"By . Rebecca Evans . Updated: . 03:07 EST, 6 March 2012 . Convert: Detectives believe fugitive terror suspect wanted for her role in a bomb plot is 7/7 widow Samantha Lewthwaite, pictured as a teenager . Kenyan police say British colleagues have confirmed that a fugitive terror suspect wanted for her role in a bomb plot is 7/7 widow Samantha Lewthwaite. Senior anti-terror police sources in Mombasa yesterday said fingerprints of the woman being sought over an Al Qaeda-linked plan to attack Western tourist resorts had been sent to London. They said Scotland Yard found them to be a match for the wife of suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay. Interviewed on condition of anonymity, a Kenyan police chief said: ‘Samantha Lewthwaite’s fingerprints have been confirmed by detectives we have been working with from the UK. 'This woman is still in the country. She will not escape if she passes through exit points at the border because of her fingerprints. ‘We are confident we are looking for the white widow.' Senior Assistant Commissioner Ambrose Munyasya, head of Mombasa's criminal investigations department, added: 'We are looking for her and if we get to know where she is we will go there. 'I have a strong team of officers in anti-terrorism and they are determined to find her.' However, the Metropolitan force is still refusing to comment on the foiled Christmas bomb plot against luxury hotels and shopping centres in Mombasa. It insists that ‘this is a matter for the Kenyan authorities’, even though a large team of British anti-terror officers is in Nairobi, working with the CIA to assist in the investigation. On the radar: A woman believed to be Lewthwaite was photographed by undercover police in August at the Kenyan-Tanzanian border, accompanied by a man believed to be Habib Ghani, whom police describe as 'dangerous' Married to a bomber: Lethwaite with Jermaine Lindsay who blew himself up in the 2005 terror attack near Russell Square which claimed 26 lives . Muslim convert Lewthwaite, 28, a soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is wanted by Kenyan police who believe she was the ‘main financier and bomb-making expert’ for the Somalian Al Qaeda affiliate Al Shabaab. She fled with her three children following a raid in December on several safe houses in Mombasa used by the terror cell. Kenyan police say they found her diary - where she detailed what it took to be a mujihadeen's wife. The woman police claim is Lewthwaite arrived in Kenya using a forged South African passport with the name of Essex nurse Natalie Faye Webb and a picture bearing a striking resemblance to Lewthwaite. Explosive: Chemicals for bomb making were found during a raid in the Bakarani region of Mombasa in Kenya . Evidence: . The woman rented several houses and apartments in Mombasa, including a . villa in Shanzu where police found AK47 shells, pictured, hidden in the . sewers . Miss Webb, who has never been to Kenya, had been the victim of identity theft.

The Mail has revealed how a woman . believed to be Lewthwaite was photographed by undercover police in . August at the Kenyan-Tanzanian border, which shows  she was on the . anti-terror radar even then. Police revealed Lewthwaite . kept a tatty A5 exercise book diary in which she wrote that wives of . Muslim suicide bombers must be devoted, unquestioning and believe that . life will be 'sweeter in the hereafter'. Officers in Kenya found notes they . believe she wrote that the 'devoted' wife of a 'mujihadeen' must realise her 'life . in the hereafter promised to be sweeter' because of her husband's . 'sacrifice'. She added that such a wife must be . 'discrete' (sic), 'obedient' and understand her husband's 'calling' meant that both he and his wife would be cut off from their families. She was accompanied by a man believed to be Habib Ghani, from Hounslow, Middlesex, whom police describe as ‘dangerous’. Months later, she managed to escape following a raid on an Al Shabaab safe house in Bakarani – a crime-ridden Mombasa ghetto synonymous with Islamic fundamentalists – in mysterious circumstances following suspicions of police corruption. An inquiry has been launched into how this happened. The woman is believed to be on the run in East Africa with her children and Ghani. Two co-conspirators, Jermaine Grant, 29, a Briton, and Kenyan Foaud Abubakar are under arrest. Grant, from Newham, east London, is due in court tomorrow. His Kenyan wife, who he married just 24 hours before his arrest, has also been charged. The woman arrived in Mombasa in November and rented several houses and apartments, including a villa in Shanzu where police found AK47 shells hidden in the sewers, the forged passport and a smashed laptop computer. Lewthwaite was seven months’ pregnant when her husband blew himself up on July 7, 2005, claiming 26 of the 52 lives lost in the London bombings. Her family in Aylesbury say they have not seen her for years.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A young woman literally worked herself to death shortly after bragging online about how long she had been in her office. Mita Duran, 24, of Jakarta, Indonesia, died after tweeting ’30 hours of work and still going strooong,’ last Saturday night. Coworkers of her’s blamed energy drinks for her death. It was one of many tweets Mr Duran sent out describing the long hours she worked as a copywriter for WPP-owned Young & Rubicam, an ad agency in the country’s capital. Zafrul Sjahrial, the stepfather of Pradnya Paramita who died after a 30 hour shift, has defended the advertising industry saying Paramita knew what it took to succeed . Ms Duran was a hard-working, dedicated copywriter, so much so that she wrote on Tumblr about her exhausting workload. 'Tonight, I carry the keys to the office for the eighth day running,’ she lamented. ‘I’m still here. I have no life. Someone please take me out for drinks, kicks and giggles.’ The determined 24-year-old also made frequent posts to Twitter about her long hours. ‘Home before midnight after three long, exhausting weeks. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,’ the overworked woman tweeted November 18. A few days earlier she showed signs she was having trouble keeping up with the demands of her bosses. Paramita, who went under the name Mita Diran on Twitter, frequently posted about her long hours online and collapsed while having dinner with friends just hours after this message . Paramita worked for advertising agency Young & Rubicam whose clients include Dell and Xerox . The copy writer slipped into a coma late on Saturday night and was pronounced dead on Sunday . Sjahrial said her tweets showed she was passionate about her job and was 'a girl ready for the next step' ‘Sweetest sleep I've had in a long time. It's a shame I'm supposed to wake up uh, ONE HOUR earlier. Slept through 3 phone calls and 3 alarms!’ She tweeted November 14. That might have been a result of the long hours she worked the prior week. ‘Alright, one full week of going home past 2am from the office. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we just broke a record,’ Ms Diran tweeted November 8. She also pondered sleeping in the office. ‘The more you spend time at the office, the more you consider moving your bed here. Preferably next to the fan. #AgencyLife,’ Ms Diran tweeted October 29. Sjahrial, an advertising creative director with 35 years' experience, said long hours were expected . Energy drink: A friend of Duran's later wrote ‘She died because too much of overtime working, and too much kratingdaeng attacks her heart.’ Krating Daeng is the name for Red Bull in Thailand, where the original version of the energy drink comes from . Sjahrial confirmed that he would not be pressing charges against the company saying that if people wanted somebody to blame, they should blame the entire industry . The copyrighter’s mother took to Path before her death to tell of her heartache - a posting noted by BuzzFeed. ‘Hi everyone, since last night and until now my daughter who is a copyrighter in Y&R lay in coma in RSPP,’ Yani Syahial wrote. ‘Chances not very good. She collapsed after continuous working overtime for 3 days last night,’ she continued. ‘Working over the limit. I have not slept since then.’ Ms Diran died within the hour. ‘An hour after this msg [sic]… her daughter died,’ Shalini wrote in a comment to the original post. ‘She died because too much of overtime working, and too much kratingdaeng attacks her heart.’‘May she rest in peace.’ Stepfather also said reports of continuous 30-hour shift were 'overblown' saying there must have been breaks for food or opportunities to walk around the office . Kratingdaeng is Thai for Red Bull, where the original version of the energy drink comes from. Ms Diran tweeted at least once about staying up all night working with help from the energy drink. ‘Spent half the night writing copy and finishing up a 23-page deck with a glass of vodka/red bull mix and now I can't sleep. SO BEAR WITH ME. Y&R posted on its Facebook page about the death. After expressing condolences and wishing their dead employee’s family well, they announced the office would close this week in order to give employees time to grieve - for one day. Shalini had one final plea. ‘Please people. Know your own body limitation, don’t push yourself too hard.’","Mita Duran, 24, often tweeted about working extremely long hours .

"By . Helen Pow . and Meghan Keneally . Matt Lauer is siding with his former Today Show co-host as he is allegedly telling NBC executives to let Ann Curry out of her contract so that they both can move on. The move shows a change of heart from Lauer as he was said to be one of the major reasons why Curry was so publicly ousted from the Today Show in April. But really his siding with Curry may be an act of self-interest because he thinks that it would be a way for him and the network at large to move past the bad publicity that they earned after using Curry as a scapegoat for the fledgling ratings. Today: Ann Curry, pictured right with Today host Matt Lauer, believes her demotion from the morning show may constitute a breach of contract . Curry is being not-so-quietly courted by CNN as her former boss Jeff Zucker has taken over the cable channel and wants to replace Anderson Cooper's 8pm show with her familiar face. The 56-year-old journalist officially needs approval from NBC to be released from her multi-year contract before going on the air for another network, and though she gave them that notice two weeks ago, the bosses have not handed down word yet. Lauer, however, thinks that they are just dragging the fight out longer by not cutting their ties. 'He canâ€™t imagine why the bosses are dragging their feet and are at a stalemate,' a source told Radar Online. Out: Jeff Zucker, right, is reportedly earmarking Curry for CNN's 8pm slot, currently inhabited by Anderson Cooper, left . 'It would allow Ann to get back on the . air on a regular basis and everyone can move on from the debacle. Matt . only wishes Ann the best and thinks itâ€™s for the best if she were to . take a job at another network..' Curry's lawyers are arguing that her dramatic demotion from Today in April was in fact a breach of her contract terms by NBC. Let me out: Ann Curry, pictured, is begging NBC bosses to let her out of her contract so she can accept a high-profile anchor job at CNN . 'Ann's lawyer feels that there is a . very strong case to be made that NBC has breached terms of the deal . because Curry was demoted from Today,' a different source previously . told RadarOnline. 'Furthermore, . Ann has basically been sequestered from appearing on the network. Yes, . she has been doing some work that has been assigned to her, but it . hasn't been steady.' Zucker, previously executive producer at . the Today show and one-time head of NBC Universal, wants to put Curry . in the prime-time 8pm slot currently occupied by Anderson Cooper, . RadarOnline reported. Today is set to finish the year . trailing its rival Good Morning America. Curry was dumped as co-anchor . of the NBC morning show after Today lost its top spot, as . bosses thought a fresh face may bring back viewers. But . the depressing ratings got worse, something which has vindicated Curry, . according to RadarOnline. The website claims things . won't improve for Today until NBC sets Curry free. 'The numbers just don't lie. (Ann) wasn't responsible for the show tanking in the ratings,' the insider said. 'Ann doesn't like the fact that the show isn't back on top, but her on-air presence wasn't the problem. 'In fact, the show lost more viewers after Ann departed the show. As long as Ann remains at NBC, it will be a constant reminder to everyone of how badly the situation was handled. 'It would be so much better for NBC, Ann, and CNN if she was let out of her contract. It would be a new beginning and a chance for all parties involved to move on, once and for all.' A source recently told The New York Post that Cooper could transition to a 'Christiane Amanpour role' as a globetrotting correspondent, if Curry bumped him from his spot.","Curry's attorney is exploring her exit options and will argue that her demotion from Today in April was a breach of contract .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A banker, his wife and their nine-year-old nephew have been gunned down in a drive-by shooting outside their home. Benoit Philippens, a 37-year-old director at BNP Paribas Fortis, was targeted by gunmen who were waiting near his house in the Belgian city of Vise. Mr Philippens and the boy were killed at the scene as the family pulled up on the driveway. Gunned down: Toys, flowers and a candle are placed near the home where a banker, his wife and their nine-year-old nephew were shot dead in a drive-by shooting outside their home in the Belgian city of Vise . His . wife Carol Haid, 37, who was also the boy's godmother, died of her . injuries the next day after being struck three times in the back. It is thought shots were fired with an automatic weapon from the gunmen's car before it sped off. However, a bullet hole found in the window of a nearby sports centre suggested the shooter may have been waiting on the drive or by the house, according to a judicial source. The gunmen, who struck on Friday, have not yet been traced nor has any motive been established for the shooting, it was reported by Zero Hedge which cited L'venir. Tragedy: The family were each shot several times with an automatic weapon as they pulled up on the driveway of the home (above) on Friday . The Mayor of Vise, Marcel Neven, said the killings could be linked to Mr Philippens' profession. A friend claims the banker was involved in an argument with a customer around six months ago in which he was threatened in public, according to Zero Hedge which cited the 7Dimanche newspaper. According to neighbours, the couple had been married just over a year and had lived at the house for five or six years. They said the shooting was particularly shocking because they were a normal family and that it was not linked to drugs.","Family gunned down by passing car as they pulled up on their driveway .

"By . Hugo Gye . An American hate preacher has called for Al Qaeda terrorists to launch attacks on Western diplomats and praised the murder of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Adam Gadahn, who was born in California but converted to Islam and became a wanted jihadist, urged wealthy Muslims to dole out rewards for killing other Western ambassadors. The 34-year-old's chilling message comes after Western embassies across the Muslim world were shut down earlier this month after warnings of an imminent terror attack. Threat: Adam Gadahn has called on Al Qaeda terrorists to launch attacks on Western diplomats . Gadahn issued his call for violence in a 39-minute video in Arabic, according to SITE, a group which monitors Islamic extremists. He pointed to the bounty placed on the head of the U.S. ambassador to Yemen, and asked rich jihadists to offer similar rewards for killing other senior diplomats. 'These prizes have a great effect in instilling fear in the hearts of our cowardly enemies,' Gadahn said. 'They also encourage hesitant individuals to carry out important and great deeds in the path of Allah.' Gadahn, also known as 'Azzam al-Amriki', himself has a $1million bounty on his head promised by U.S. authorities. Origins: Gadahn was raised in California but converted to Islam and became a jihadi extremist . Last year, the Yemen branch of Al Qaeda offered 3kg of gold to anyone who could kill the American ambassador to the country, or 5million rials (Â£15,000) for the death of a U.S. soldier. Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, was killed last September when militants stormed the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. This is not the first time that Gadahn has called for attacks on Western diplomats - in 2007, he warned that Al Qaeda would target embassies in retaliation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FBI has been trying to question the militant, who is believed to be in Pakistan, since 2004.","Adam Gadahn, originally from California, issues chilling video message .

"By . Daniel Martin . In a report Dr Antony Seldon recommends charging parents who earn more than £80,000 for state school paces . Rich parents should be charged £20,000 a year for their children to attend the best state schools, a leading headmaster has said. They would become liable for the fees if they had a combined household income of £80,000 a year or more. Dr Anthony Seldon, master of £11,000-a-term Wellington College in Berkshire, also said private schools should set aside a quarter of places for poorer pupils. Making the wealthy pay for state education would end the wasteful and unfair gap between the academic achievements and career prospects of the richest and poorest children in the UK, he argued. In a report to be published by the Social Market Foundation think-tank on Wednesday, he said the money could be used to pay for more teachers and smaller classes. Dr Seldon, who said he had discussed his plans with politicians from both main parties, added that the move was vital because social mobility in Britain had stalled, with poorer children unable to advance. ‘We have to end this unfair farce whereby middle-class parents dominate the best schools, when they could afford to pay, and even boast of their moral superiority in using the state system when all they are doing is squeezing out the poor from the best schools,’ he said. His suggested starting point for fees – £80,000 – is the average income of the top 10 per cent of the population, but ‘the more the parents earn, the more they should pay’. Dr Seldon, who is master at £11,000-a-term Wellington College in Berkshire, says private schools should reserve a quarter of all places for the poorest children . Families earning more than £200,000 a . year with children at the most over-subscribed state schools would pay . the most – up to £20,000 a year for a secondary place and £15,000 for a . primary place, equivalent to the fees of a private school. ‘Grammar schools, popular academies and comprehensives would be the most expensive schools,’  Dr Seldon said. Just 3 per cent of pupils at the country’s 166 grammar schools come from the poorest homes. Dr . Seldon added it was only fair that if parents could afford to pay for . better schooling – secured by buying houses in the right catchment areas . or paying for private tutors to help their children pass grammar school . entry exams – they should be made to do so. ‘Instead of estate agents and private tutors getting rich, let’s  put this money into the state system,’ he said. Parents are paying an average of £31,500 more for a house near the top 30 state schools, according to research by Lloyds, while one in three parents say they have moved to be closer to one. According to the Lloyds research the . most expensive catchment area around Henrietta Barnett all-girls grammar . school in Barnet, north-west London, where the average house price . includes a premium of 87%, or £402,600. Whissendine C of E primary school was recently named by Tatler magazine as one of the best in the country, and an average house in the village costs £316,000, compared with just £209,000 for a property nearby Melton Mowbray. Likewise in Marton, North Yorkshire, where Marton-Cum-Grafton school is located, houses go for an average of £404,000, up 5 per cent on last year, whereas a similar houses in York sell for just £235,000.","Doctor Anthony Seldon has produced a report on UK schools .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Tampa, Florida, police officer has been disciplined for dragging a restrained homeless woman on the floor after she was arrested for smoking crack cocaine. The incident took place last October and was caught on a surveillance camera inside the parking garage at the Hillsborough County Jail. The brief clip shows Officer Scott Van Treese remove the suspect from the backseat of a cruiser and place her on the floor. Scroll down for video . Video evidence: This surveillance video from the Hillsborough County Jail parking garage shows Officer Scott Van Treese standing next to Sonja Mimmenger, who is lying on the floor with her arms and legs tied . Hogtied: Van Treese restrain the homeless woman's legs and cuffed her arms in what is known as Total Appendage Restraint Position after she resisted arrest . The woman, 36-year-old Sonja Mimmenger, has her hands and feet restrained, and she is seen lying flat on her stomach with her legs bent at the knees, Tampa Bay Times reported. Van Treese takes off the suspect's restrains and attempts to get her to stand up, but Mimmenger collapses to the floor. The officer is then seen hauling the woman away by dragging her on the floor by her left bicep. According to a police report, Mimmenger, who has a lengthy criminal record, was arrested on charges of cocaine possession, trespassing and obstructing or opposing an officer without violence. The police department conducted an internal affairs investigation, which found that Van Treese ‘should have used better judgement’ in handling an uncooperative suspect. The officer received a written reprimand for his conduct. In the wake of the October 5, 2013, incident, the Tampa Police Department revised its policy of handling passively resisting suspects, requiring the presence of two officers. Carried away: The clip shows Van Treese grabbing the 36-year-old suspect by her left bicep and dragging her on the floor . Her version of events: Mimmenger later explained that she was unable to stand up on her own because her legs hurt from being restrained in the back of the police cruiser . According to the police probe, on October 5, Van Treese and another officer spotted Mimmenger, who is homeless, on the porch of a blighted house notorious for drug and gambling activities. The 36-year-old woman, who has had nearly 80 run-ins with local police and 15 convictions, resisted arrest, prompting Van Treese to restrain her legs, cuff her arms and put her in the police cruiser on her stomach in what is known as Total Appendage Restraint Position. The woman was reportedly not injured after being dragged on the floor by Van Treese. She was taken to a hospital as a precaution, where she allegedly informed a nurse that she did not require medical attention. The woman then jumped off a gurney to prove that she was fine before being released. She was eventually sentenced to 90 days in jail. Aftermath: Van Treese was reprimanded by the department, while Mimmenger was sentenced to 90 days in jail for cocaine possession and trespassing - . When interviewed about the incident by Fox 13, Mimmenger said that the arresting officer dragged her ‘like a little rag muffin.’ The woman explained that she could not walk on her own because her legs hurt from being restrained during the 10-15 minute ride to jail. 'I had never been hogtied before,' she said. Mimmenger added that being dragged off by a police officer like that showed a lack of respect on his part and made her feel like she 'didn’t have much to live for.’","Tampa Officer Scott Van Treese received written reprimand for dragging Sonja Mimmenger by her arm .

'They both have things they are really good at but with the current manager, he's ultra-positive. He takes the positive from every single scenario. 'That's been the big thing for me: the difference in the style of play, committing to that and not feeling like we have to adapt to the opposition.

And Baines, who is likely to be Roy Hodgson's first-choice left-back in Brazil, says their approach will not change in the run-in. 'He tells us we're not going to change, we're just going to improve constantly and keep practising until we get to the level where we want to be. Stick to it, don't compromise, get better at it. At the helm: Martinez has stuck to his attacking football principles this season . 'He also spoke about the Champions League from the start. He didn't shy away from it. He came in straight away and set the bar high. 'We might have got away with a fairly ordinary season - the changeover with the new manager, a transitional season - but he didn't want to accept that.'","Roberto Martinez told Everton to aim for Champions League as soon as he joined, says Leighton Baines .

"By . Snejana Farberov . The mobile payments start-up Clinkle has not even been launched yet, and already it has found itself at the center of a new scandal after someone had hacked the site to reveal a very unflattering photo of the company’s 22-year-old CEO brandishing a cash fan. The embarrassing ‘money shot’ depicts tech wunderkind Lucas Duplan, a recent Stanford University graduate who came up with an app that promises to revolutionize financial transactions with a digital wallet used on smartphones. In his Clinkle profile picture, the baby-faced 22-year-old tech mogul is pictured with his mouth agape holding what was estimated to be about $30,000 in cash all in $100 bills. Money shot: This awkward profile picture of Clinkle CEO Lucas Duplan, 22, surfaced online after the yet-to-be launched mobile payments app was hacked . Clinkle immediately went into damage control mode, publicly denying that the site had been actually hacked. According to company spokeswoman Ana Braskamp, Andrew Aude, a former inter for the mobile payments company Venmo, took advantage of a ‘visibility’ feature that was being used in preliminary testing of the app, and which was meant to be disabled, NBC News reported. According to the statement, Aude also accessed Clinkle’s system in September and exposed screen shots. Game changer: The app promises to revolutionize financial transactions with a secure digital wallet used on smartphones . The site TechCrunch said that this latest digital security breach has affected only 33 test users, exposing their names, phone numbers and profile pictures, which ended up PasteBin - a public text storage site. Addressing the Clinkle CEO's gauche 'money shot,' Braskamp noted that the cash in the ‘playful, self-deprecating’ picture was fake, Business Insider reported. The controversy comes at a particularly bad time for Duplan's emerging business, which made headlines last month after firing 25 per cent of its staff. Although a Clinkle engineer has reportedly dismissed the breach as 'no big deal,' it raises some serious questions considering that the start-up is promoting itself as a game-changing, secure mobile payments app. It has been rumored that Clinkle will be made available to both iPhone and Android users later this year. Clinkle is the brainchild of Duplan and a dozen of his Stanford classmates who came up with the idea back in 2011, but kept it under wraps until last year when the young entrepreneurs graduated. Funded in part by Stanford professors, the ambitious mobile payments start-up has been widely  hailed by business insiders as the next big thing in Silicon Valley. Golden boy: Duplan (left) stunned Silicon Valley when he was able to secure $30million in investments from the likes of Richard Branson (right) and Peter Thiel . Articles in many publications . breathlessly recounted how the company’s young CEO was able to secure . $30million in investments from such big-name captains of industry as . Richard Branson and Peter Thiel. Troubles arose for Clinkle last November when pair of former employees penned a scathing - albeit badly misspelled – post on Quora that has arguably made a dent in Duplan’s ‘golden boy’ image. According to the former Clinkle staffers, who noted that they left the company of their own accord, the 22-year-old CEO was earning a six-figure salary while mistreating his overworked and underpaid underlings. Image crisis: Two former employees of Clinkle wrote a scathing post describing Duplan as a 'shark' who takes home a six-figure salary while mistreating his overworked and underpaid workers . ‘He hurts his employees daily and shoves it under the rung [sic] as collateral damage,’ the ex-Clinkle workers lamented, adding that Duplan was a shark who prefers to control rather than lead his team. Despite the bad publicity, Duplan has been able to recruit some impressive talent, with his most recent high-profile hires being PayPal vice president Mike Liberatore and former Netflix CFO Barry McCarthy.","Lucas Duplan, 22, is Stanford-educated founder of Silicon Valley start-up Clinkle .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Texas woman has been arrested and charged in the death of her fiance's 2-year-old daughter who had her mouth taped shut earlier this month. Little Gracie Ford was discovered unconscious in her father's Plano home January 9. She was rushed to Children's Medical Center in Dallas, where she was declared legally dead three days later. On Tuesday, police arrested Melinda Muniz, 25, on a capital murder charge. The woman was ordered held in the Plano City Jail on $1million bond. Justice for Gracie: Melinda Muniz (left), 25, was charged Tuesday in the January 9 death of her fiance's 2-year-old daughter, Grace Ford (right) Innocent toddler: Grace, pictured here with her mother, Emily Ward, was found unconscious in her crib with her mouth covered with duct tape . Plano police officers responded to an apartment in the 1500 block of J Place at around 1.40pm on January 9 to discover 2-year-old Grace Ford unconscious in her crib with duct tape covering her face. According to a page created by the toddler's family on the fundraising site YouCaring.com, Grace had been deprived of oxygen. On January 22, Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the child's death a homicide caused by suffocation. Grace was reportedly staying in the Plano home of her father, Mitchum Ford, who lived with his fiancee, Melinda Muniz. Mr Ford reportedly had been locked in a custody battle with his ex-wife, Emily Ward, over Grace’s care, Dallas Morning News reported. Too young: Gracie was declared legally dead from suffocation three days after she was found unconscious in her father's Plano, Texas, apartment . Caught in the middle: The toddler had been the subject of a heated custody battle between her mother (pictured) and Grace's biological father, Mitch Ford . According to Muniz’s arrest affidavit cited by the station WFAA, it was Ford who called police January 9 asking to perform a welfare check at his apartment. Officers who arrived at the home on J Place found Grace Ford duct taped in her crib and Muniz lying on the floor of another room with her also mouth taped shut and her pants pulled down. The affidavit states that the 25-year-old woman told police she had been sexually assaulted by an unknown man, but medical tests showed no signs of rape. According to a post shared by Emily Ward on her Facebook page Tuesday evening, Muniz had confessed to cheating on Ford and faking amnesia, beating herself up and lying about her rape to cover up the toddler's murder. Ward also wrote that the woman was caught on a surveillance camera buying duct tape and scissors at a nearby store shortly before police were called to Ford’s home. Mother's tirade: Emily Ward posted this message accusing Muniz of killing her innocent daughter and then lying about a rape to cover up the crime . The mother’s claims were corroborated in part by the arrest affidavit, which stated that Muniz and Ford were in the process of breaking up. 'What a monster!!!' Ward wrote on Facebook. ‘I hope she gets everything she has coming to her from the law. God will make sure justice is served to the fullest!!!’ Grace's family decided to donate the child's organs ahead of her funeral held January 18.","Grace Ford, 2, was found unconscious in her crib with her mouth taped shut January 9 in Plano, Texas .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Gifted: University of Pennsylvania sophomore Elvis Hatcher, 18, died Tuesday after hanging himself . The University of Pennsylvania community is reeling from the suicide of an 18-year-old sophomore, which came just three weeks after another student at the Ivy League college ended her life. Elvis Hatcher, a native of Miami Beach, Florida, hanged himself Tuesday, according to police. The teen was rushed to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was pronounced dead. A popular figure on campus, Hatcher was the treasurer of Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity and worked in IT support at the Wharton School. Hatcher obtained an associate’s degree in mathematics from Miami Dade College, graduating in 2012 with a 4.0 GPA, before enrolling in University of Pennsylvania. During his freshman year, Hatcher made the Dean's List and was a National Merit Scholarship finalist. He was expected to complete his studies in 2016. The bespectacled, eccentric 18-year-old had not declared a major, instead preferring to take a variety of courses, including calculus, French, art history, printmaking and sex and human nature. Scroll down for video . Fascinating character: Those who knew Elvis described him as a bright and funny young man who had many interests, including math, art, music and fashion . Prestigious: Hatcher enrolled in the Ivy League university last year, pursuing a bachelor's degree, after graduating with an associate's degree in mathematics from Miami Dade College . Hatcher's French professor Sophie Degat-Willis called the charming teen one of her 'brightest and funniest students,' The Daily Pennsylvanian reported. 'He was ... a brilliant person, and it's terrible that he passed away,' Hatcher's former neighbor Minji Kwak told the paper. On Wednesday, Hatcher’s brothers at Pi Lambda Phi released a statement about the passing of the fraternity treasurer. ‘We are deeply saddened by this unfortunate incident and are currently supporting the family during their loss,’ it read. ‘Pi Lambda Phi has been truly blessed to have a brother like Elvis, and will miss him very much.’ Hatcher's sudden passing is the fourth student death at UPenn since the beginning of winter. On January 17, freshman Madison Holleran, 19, took her own life by jumping from a parking garage in Philadelphia.

Holleran’s father said Madison, a track and field star, had been struggling with her school workload. Her parents suggested that she transfer to a different school or go on a hiatus, but the freshman decided to return to UPenn after the Christmas break. Between December and mid-January, the Ivy League institution suffered two other losses. Kevin Zhao, a 21-year-old senior in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, died from cardiac arrest while on a family trip to China. A few weeks later, computer science major Pulkit 'Josh' Singh, 20, was found dead in his room off campus. The student's cause of death is still pending. On Wednesday, Hatcher's friends and classmates took to Twitter to pay tribute to the beloved young man. One user wrote of Hatcher: 'You had an awesome style, a great spirit and wonderful smile. Wish I could have gotten to know you better.' Too young: Kevin Zhao (left), a 21-year-old senior in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, died from cardiac arrest in December; computer science major Pulkit 'Josh' Singh, 20, was found dead in his room off campus from an unknown cause . The band Norwegian Arms, which featured Hatcher in a music video last July showing the teen wiggling around and dancing, posted a touching tribute in his honor on their Tumblr account Wednesday. One of the band members recalled meeting Elvis for the first time during a concert in 2012. ‘Effortlessly cool, it was instantly apparent that this was a special person,’ the eulogy read. ‘His dance moves were otherwordly, a combination of voguing and interpretive dance so incredible that we ended up approaching him that night and asking him if he’d like to be involved in our first music video.’ 'Rest Assured - he'll be missed,' the post concluded.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . House prices have shot up 7.3 per cent since this time last year, new figures have revealed. The value of the average property - which has increased by 1.1 per cent in the last month alone - now stands at £175,546, according to Halifax. The bank said that the pace of increase has picked up since December, when prices fell by 0.5 per cent. Hike: Today's figures show that house prices continue to shoot up . Prices in the three months to January . were 1.9 per cent higher than in the preceding quarter, which the bank's monthly report said is in line with recent increases. The steady increase in house prices comes as the Government's Help to Buy scheme has fuelled demand by allowing those with small deposits to join the property ladder. Under the programme, the state will back loans made to buy homes worth up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit. However, critics have said that stoking the property market in this way could lead to a price crash by creating a housing bubble. Business Secretary Vince Cable said in December that the Coalition 'need to look again' at the policy, which he said was 'conceived in very different circumstances' to the growing housing market shown in figures today. Dr Cable specifically expressed concern over the difference between the 'raging housing boom in London and the South East' which was not reflected elsewhere. He brought up a statement by credit rating agency Standard and Poor's which he said was 'expressing very serious worries', which Dr Cable seemed to share. Underlying trend: This map shows how house prices have changed across the UK over the last quarter, increasing by 1.9 per cent on average. Prices are 7.3 per cent higher than this time in 2013 . However, David Cameron hit back at the criticism of the flagship scheme last month, pointing out that house prices are still far from their 2007 peak and that there was 'no evidence of a problem'. He said: 'Where we are today, house prices are still way below the peak they reached in 2007. 'Forecasters do not think they will get back to the level before the crash even in 2019. So there is no evidence of a problem. 'Nationally, excluding London and the south-east, house prices are up just 3% over the last year. 'I think there are some people who are rather London-centric about this. This is about helping people to achieve the security and stability they want of owning a flat or a home of their own.' In response to today's figures Martin Ellis, a housing economist for Halifax, said the continued squeeze on household finances as wages fail to keep up with the pace of inflation is 'expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices'. Halifax said that despite people's finances continuing to be constrained, the scarcity of homes will continue to push up prices. According to recent findings from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the increased number of owners looking to sell at the end of 2013 is still too few to meet surging demand. Mr Ellis continued: 'With the supply of properties being slow to respond to more buoyant market conditions, stronger demand has resulted in continued upward pressure on house prices. 'Demand has increased against a background of low interest rates and higher consumer confidence underpinned by signs that the economy is recovering and unemployment falling faster than expected.' Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: 'We are still very much in recovery mode and it's unlikely that the Bank of England will risk raising interest rates too soon. 'Borrowers need to plan ahead, however, and ensure they can cope with rate rises when they do come.' Mr Harris said estate agents and mortgage brokers have got off to 'an incredibly busy start' in 2014. He said: 'Many buyers view this as the year when they will finally get on the housing ladder, or move up it - as long as they can find the right property.' London - house prices rose 4.0 per cent .

"By . Snejana Farberov . San Francisco photographer Helena Price has become an overnight viral sensation among Brazilian Twitter users - and all thanks to her name. Since Monday, Price, 26, has been inundated with thousands of tweets from fans of the new Brazilian soap opera Em Familia, which features a character named Helena. In the series premiere Monday, the troubled Helena nearly drowned, undressed in front of her uncle and fell in love with her cousin. It girl: San Francisco photographer Helena Price, 26, landed on the cover of a Brazilian magazine after she was mistakenly associated with a character from a new soap opera also named Helena . Early adopters of the new show immediately took to Twitter to share their thoughts of Em Familia, and that is how many of them stumbled upon Price’s handle, @Helena, San Francisco Chronicle reported. Price, who is blonde and has Nordic feautres, is not an actress and looks nothing like her fiery brunette namesake on the show, but that did not stop thousands of strangers from tweeting at her. The photographer, a North Carolina native, was initially blindsided by all this unsolicited attention, but quickly embraced it and decided to enjoy her 15 minutes of cyber-fame. To set things straight, the 26-year-old Bay Area resident clarified on her Twitter page exactly who she was, writing: 'Tall, pale, and half-Norwegian. Full-time photographer who occasionally dabbles in tech. Not the actress, DJ, Brazilian soap opera star, or state capital.' But the tweets kept pouring in and Price, who does not speak Portuguese, began responding to the best of her ability. No resemblance: The blonde, part-Norwegian Price looks nothing like either Bruna Marquezine (left), who plays the young Helena, or Julia Lemmertz (right), who portrays the character later in life . Fifteen minutes of fame: Brazilian news media breathlessly wrote about the American woman who has won over the hearts of local soap opera fans . When one soap opera fan wrote to her that in the first episode Helena made a blood pact with her boyfriend (who is also her cousin), and then nearly drowned while swimming, Miss Price wrote a dead-pan response: 'I do not remember this.' Before long, the full-time photographer, who only last year ditched her previous career in Silicon Valley, turned into an Internet phenomenon. 'Omg i think I've become a meme,' a stunned Price shared with her skyrocketing number of followers. In one picture, Price’s head was digitally inserted into the opening credits of Em Familia. In another, the blonde beauty was Photoshopped into an image of a scantily clad Samba dancer. In an email to MailOnline Thursday, Miss Price said she does not expect the hullabaloo over Helena to die down in the near future. 'A few thousand Brazilians have let me know that the show is continuing for the next 8 months or so, so I don't think this will be over anytime soon,' Price wrote. Carrer change: Price worked in Silicon Valley's technology industry until last year, when she quit and reinvented herself as a professional photographer . New opportunity: Price hopes she would be able to travel to Brazil for a photo-shoot . Brazilian news media quickly caught on, breathlessly reporting about the American mystery woman who has won over the hearts of local soap opera fans, many of whom took to Twitter to profess their love for the real-life Helena. ‘I'm officially in Brazilian news for becoming a meme,’ Price wrote two days ago. ‘Life is funny.’ One . user inquired whom Helena would choose as a love interest in the show, . Virgilio or Laerte, while another begged her to pose naked for Brazilian . Playboy. Thereza Chammas gushed: 'Please come to Brazil for Carnival! You are our queen.' The photographer told MailOnline that her friends and family are baffled as to why she is getting all this attention online. 'It is still pretty hard to explain, but we all think it's pretty funny,' she wrote. Born to dance: The blonde beauty had her face digitally inserted into this picture of a Brazilian Samba dancer . Protagonist: With the help of Photoshop, Price made it into the opening credits of Em Familia . Adored: Soap opera fans on Twitter professed their love to Price, and some urged her to visit Brazil, where she has never been . ‘Still getting thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets. Brazil you are funny,’ Price tweeted. The San Francisco woman now boasts more than 21,000 followers on Twitter, many of them Brazilian. She said that she hopes one day to visit the country that has shown her so much love. 'Maybe all of this will translate into some photo work there someday,' Price said.","Helena Price, 26, has been inundated with tweets about a character from new Brazilian soap opera Em Familia named Helena .

The young TV presenter shared an amusing anecdote involving tow of his adopted sisters, one of them African-American and another blind. 'My sister Quincy, who is black, would get called the N-word at school and we'd talk for hours, and my sister Frankie, who's blind, would chime in an hour into  conversation about race, ""Wait, Quincy's black?""' Farrow recounted to peals of laughter from the audience. ‘Still haven't told her what color I am.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Texas woman awaiting sentencing in the shooting death of her husband has revealed that she accepted a plea deal so she could be released on parole quickly and get on with her life. Michele Williams, 44, a twice-divorced Dallas woman dubbed in the media 'the black widow of Keller,' was arrested in 2012 for the murder of Gregory Williams, who was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in the couple's tony home. Initially, Mrs Williams claimed that an intruder broke in, hit her over the head with a wrench and then murdered her husband. Scroll down for video . Crocodile tears? With her nails freshly painted pink, Michele Williams, 44, tearfully talked about accepting a plea deal in connection to her husband's 2011 killing so that she could get out on parole sooner . 'Scared to death': Williams said she was terrified of serving her sentence in a cell with other inmates because she herself is not a criminal . But police found no sign of forced entry, so Michele Williams changed her story, alleging that her 40-year-old spouse took his own life, and that she covered up his suicide for the sake of their 4-year-old daughter. On a 911 call placed by Michele Williams October 13, 2011, the woman sounded hysterical and was sobbing so loudly that the emergency operator could hardly make out what she was saying. Happier times: Michele Williams pictured with her third husband, Gregory, on their wedding day - years before the 40-year-old man was found shot in the head . But in the course of a three-month investigation into the killing, police were able to untangle the wife’s web of lies. According to law enforcement, Mrs Williams sedated her husband and shot him from one foot away after turning up the volume on the TV in the affluent Dallas suburb of Keller. The couple’s child slept through the entire ordeal. The wife then allegedly struck herself with a wrench and made the 5,000-square-foot home seem like it was the site of a home invasion. Detectives noticed a number of details that did not add up: Michele Williams was fully dressed with her hair done when they came, even though she said she was sleeping; the gun used in the murder was found on the premises but had no fingerprints on it; and the $20,000 in cash the couple had in the house had not been stolen. In the days after the murder, those close to the newly minted widow were surprised by her conduct and demeanor, CultureMap Dallas reported.. The . very next day after the slaying, Michele went out for a big breakfast . at IHOP. She then took her children on a week-long vacation, where she . went to sports bars and out shopping for Halloween costumes. Williams . also wasted no time selling off her husband’s assets, including the . client list from his computer company and the Blueberries frozen yogurt . shop he had bought for her. Eight . months after Gregory's death, Michele started dating her older son's . friend Gene Wallis, a bodybuilder and fitness instructor 15 years her . junior. Together the . couple opened a Kettle Bell fitness studio in Bedford, which they have . been promoting online with Michele adopting the name Shelley. Crime scene: Police officers arrived at the Williamses' home in the affluent Dallas suburb of Keller after getting a 911 call from a hysterical-sounding Michele . Speaking to the Star-Telegram this week in a jailhouse interview, an emotional Michele Williams said that if she were to go on trial, her chances of being acquitted would have been about 50/50. 'It can go either way. Win big. Lose big,' she said. 'With a plea deal, I’m looking at a couple of years before I’m out for parole.' The 44-year-old mother pleaded guilty in October to tampering with evidence and deadly conduct. Prosecutors have said they decided to offer Williams a plea deal because she had destroyed material evidence needed to prove an intentional murder beyond a reasonable doubt, including wiping down her home with bleach after her husband’s death. With her perfectly manicured nails freshly painted pink, a tearful Williams described her marriage to Gregory – her third husband – as 'wonderful' and insisted that she still loves his 'so much.' She noted that Tuesday marked the eighth anniversary of their first date. At the time of her plea deal, the 44-year-old widow was pregnant with twins fathered by her young boyfriend, Gene Wallis. Last week, a judge learned that the woman was no longer pregnant following an apparent miscarriage and ordered her jailed until her sentencing hearing in April. Cougar: Eight months after her husband's violent death, Michele Williams (left) started dating her son's friend Gene Wallis (right), a bodybuilder and fitness instructor nearly 15 years her junior . Williams, who had been out on bond until last Thursday, is currently being held in a single cell due to the high profile of her case. With tears gleaming in her eyes, Williams spoke of sitting in a tiny locked room for hours and hours on end with nothing to do. But the 44-year-old admitted that she is terrified of going to prison and being housed in a cell with other inmates. ‘I’m not a criminal and the fear of being in with people who are…’ she trailed off.

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 13:59 EST, 3 February 2012 . This is filmmaker Costis Mitsotakis - the only man in a Spanish village who didn't win a share of a £600million lottery prize because he forgot to buy a ticket. When the residents of Sodeto's number came up on the Christmas mega draw - called El Gordo or the Big One - they danced down the street in the conga. But Mr Mitsotakis wasn't celebrating - because when community leaders went round the 70 houses in their remote community collecting money for tickets they missed him off. World's unluckiest man: Costis Mitsotakis is the only person in Sodeto who did not win a share of the El Gordo Christmas lottery jackpot after he didn't buy a ticket . Jackpot joy: The people of Granen celebrate winning the Christmas lottery in Spain by doing the Conga. The winning tickets were all bought in the small town and the surrounding villages including Sodeto which has around 70 houses . A share in a single ticket - or a 'participation' would have cost him £4 and would have won him an £83,000 prize. The Greek national moved to the area . after falling in love with a woman. When . the relationship fell apart he stayed in the area and has been . renovating a barn. However, Mr Mitsotakis did not lose out entirely as the day after the Christmas draw was made a neighbour agreed to use their winnings to buy a plot of land he had been trying to sell. The Spanish lottery El Gordo - the Fat One - has a total of 1,800 winning tickets. Each ticket costs around £16 but it is sub-divided into four participations which cost around £4 each. Each one of the residents bought a ticket bearing the first prize winning number 58,268 - except for Mr Mitsotakis. Celebration: This man in Granen cracks open the champagne after winning a share of the £600million Christmas prize money . Rejoice: Each share of a ticket in Granen which won was worth £83,000. The lottery El Gordo - the Fat One - takes place in Spain every year just before Christmas . While some people won £83,000 after buying a single share, other villagers won millions. In total, the people of Sodeto received around £100million of the £600million money for the 'first prize tickets'. The rest of the £600million fund went to people in the town of Granen nearby and neighbouring villages. The village, in northern Spain, is around three hours by car from Barcelona on the coast. José Manuel Penella Cambra's wife bought two participations and his son discovered two more which he had forgotten he had bought. In total, the family netted in the region of £372,000. The homeowner joked to the New York Times: 'I kept saying: look for some more, look for some more.' El Gordo: The big Christmas lottery has taken place since 1812 - and the average Spaniard spends £47 on tickets. It is so popular people take the day off work to watch the draw . 'But this money means that now we can breathe. And the best part is that it isn’t just me. Everybody won.' Sodeto, which has around 250 residents, has been inundated with travelling salesmen and bankers hoping to persuade the wealthy villagers to part with their winnings. The annual El Gordo lottery has been . running since 1812 and is so popular that some people take the day off . work to watch the morning draw. The homemakers association in Sodeto organise the sale of tickets for the draw every year. Although a single participation costs £4, the area has been so badly hit by the recession that some people were struggling to come up with the money. The average Spaniard spent £47 on tickets despite the severe economic crisis and record unemployment. The lottery gives out 1,800 first prizes for each whole ticket split into four participations of £332,000, 1,800 prizes of £100,000, 1,800 third prizes of £41,600 and thousands of smaller cash prizes. Around £50 million of the takings go to charities including the Red Cross.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and James  Nye . After New York Congressman Michael Grimm threatened to throw NY1 reporter Michael Scotto off the Capitol balcony last night he followed up his ferocious threats with a series of insults questioning the journalist's masculinity. This has led New York City media and gossip site Gawker to openly speculate whether the real reason former Marine and FBI agent Grimm threatened the 35-year-old political reporter was because he is gay. Indeed, after threatening to throw Scotto off the 'f***ing balcony', Grimm seethed that he was going to break the reporter in half 'like a boy' and then proceeded to torment him by claiming 'You're not man enough.' Scroll down for video . Insulted: NY1 reporter Michael Scotto was verbally attacked by New York Congressman Michael Grimm (seen right speaking to reporters on Wednesday) after the State of the Union on the balcony of the Capitol in an exchange which has caused some to question Grimm's motivation . Threat of violence: Grimm (right) was caught on camera telling Scotto: 'I'll break you in half. Like a boy.' According to Gawker, who spoke to the reporter's colleagues, it is well known among his friends that he is indeed gay. 'Within the station community it’s pretty well known,' one colleague told Gawker. The website poses the question: If Scotto didn't ask Grimm anything about his or anyone else's sexuality, then why did the congressman fire back a stream of insults aimed at questioning the reporter's masculinity. Gawker claims that this is a 'common weapon of homophobes seeking to torment and marginalize gay men.' Gawker makes the point that it is unclear if Grimm was aware of Scotto's sexuality at the time of their ugly spat. However, the two men have been involved in interviews repeatedly over the years. Apology: NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto takes a phone call from Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., in Washington on Wednesday a day after Scotto was threatened by Grimm after President Barack Obama's State of the Union address (left) and (right) returns to work . 'He and Congressman Grimm have worked together professionally for a while,' NY1’s Washington bureau chief Jennifer Babich told Gawker. 'But this is the first time Grimm has said anything like this.' However, Scotto's friends claimed that the argument had nothing at all to do with his sexuality. 'It looked to me like old-school a**holedom that had nothing to do with Michael being gay,' argued a friend of his, who added - 'I’d be surprised if Grimm knew.' Babich added, 'I don’t think that was a factor in the confrontation.' Last night, Michael Grimm stormed off after NY1 reporter Michael Scotto tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but returned to confront the TV news man. Bully pulpit: Rep Michael Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island, was being interviewed by NY1 about the State of the Union address when he became angry with the reporter and threatened him . He squared up to Scotto and told him 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'. But today Grimm said he had called Scotto to apologize and said he 'overreacted' when he threatened him with physical violence following the State of the Union address. Scotto posted a message on Twitter Wednesday morning announcing the call, but it comes after Grimm already defended his decision to 'take him to task' after the reporter asked about an ongoing federal investigation into Grimm's campaign finances. The incident was caught on camera, showing how Grimm cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe. Off-topic question: NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto attempted to question Grimm about the FBI investigation into his 2010 campaign fundraising, but the politician cut him off and refused to discuss the matter . ‘I'm not speaking to you off-topic, this is only about the President,’ said an irate Grimm before stalking off. ‘So Congressman Michael Grimm does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,’ Scotto said into the camera. That is when Grimm, 43, marched back and confronted a startled-looking Scotto. Although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low, a transcript provided by NY1 . shows that at one point Grimm said to Scott: 'Let me be clear to you, . you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony.’ The reporter attempted to defend himself, pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘a valid question.’ In response, Grimm told him: 'No, no, you're not man enough, you're not man enough. I'll break you in half. Like a boy.’ In . the wake of the incident, Grimm released an unapologetic statement . claiming that he was ‘extremely annoyed’ because he was doing NY1 a . favor by agreeing to do their interview first. ‘The . reporter knew that I was in a hurry and was only there to comment on . the State of the Union, but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap . shot at the end of the interview, because I did not have time to speak . off-topic,’ Grimm said. Fit of rage: The 43-year-old retired Marine and former FBI agent went after Scott, threatening to throw him off the balcony . Next step: Hours after issuing a statement defending his decision to 'take him to task', Grimm called the reporter and apologized . He continued, saying: ‘I verbally . took the reporter to task and told him off, because I expect a certain . level of professionalism and respect, especially when I go out of my way . to do that reporter a favor. ‘I doubt that I am the first Member of Congress to tell off a reporter, and I am sure I won’t be the last.’ He issued a second statement Wednesday morning: 'I was wrong. I shouldn’t have allowed my emotions to get the better of me and lose my cool.' 'I have apologized to Michael Scotto, which he graciously accepted, and will be scheduling a lunch soon. In the weeks and months ahead I’ll be working hard for my constituents on issues like flood insurance that is so desperately needed in my district post Sandy,' Grimm wrote. A retired U.S. Marine and former FBI agent, Grimm was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 during the wave of Tea Party conservatism. Unapologetic: A defiant Grimm (left) released a statement blaming Scotto (right) for being ungrateful and failing to show him respect by taking a 'cheap shot' at him . NY1 political director Bob Hardt demanded that Grimm issue an apology to Scott, calling his behavior 'extremely disturbing.' Earlier this month, the FBI charged Grimm’s donor Diana Durand with exceeding the maximum allowable contribution to the Republican’s campaign by asking her friends to donate $10,000. Grimm, 47, has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged. The New York Times reported that the politician has faced an investigation into allegations that he or his campaign illegally asked for contributions from foreign donors. This is not the Congressman's first threat of violence, as The New Yorker reported in 2011 that he got into a fight with a man at a Queens nightclub more than a decade earlier. He allegedly said the man 'don’t know who he’s f***ing with...I’ll f***in’ make him disappear where nobody will find him'. The confrontation continued into the club's garage, where a NYPD officer who was working at the club confronted then-FBI agent Grimm after Grimm was holding his gun and threatening the man. 'I’m gonna f***in' kill him...I’m a fucking F.B.I. agent, ain’t nobody gonna threaten me,’ Grimm reportedly said. Grimm later denied saying those statements: 'I don’t need to speak that way. A guy with a gun who knows how to use it doesn’t need to say anything.'","Rep Michael Grimm, 43, of Staten Island, told NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto he will throw him off Capitol balcony .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters Reporter . Beleaguered cable network CNN faces a new challenge as competitors try to loosen their grip on the airport television market. A new television display created by rival Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings will threaten CNN’s dominance, as they have had unmatched usage of the television sets hanging in front of passengers at departure gates for much of the past two decades. The two companies will be competing for the attention of travel-weary passengers, and advertising company Clear Channel Outdoor has signed deals with major TV networks like Fox, CBS and NBC to provide competitive content on their new hanging displays. Monopoly: For the past 21 years, CNN has ruled the airport television airwaves and now an advertising company is going to placing entertainment-filled displays in the same waiting lounges causing competition . The service provided by Clear Channel Outdoor, the second-largest outdoor advertising company behind JC Decaux, will use their deals with the entertainment networks to fuel their 'ClearVision' service. Toby Sturek, Clear Channel's head of airports, said the company is in discussions with about 20 airports including some large ones where CNN has its TVs, though the first airport ClearVision will enter in November is Raleigh-Durham International in North Carolina, where CNN does not have a presence. 'The airports want something that's different and they want something where they can have a variety of content that they can provide the passengers,' Mr Sturek said. Mr Sturek said Clear Channel previously had agreements to sell advertising with CNN in a handful of airports in the United States, and that advertisers did not see the value in CNN's offering. In response, a CNN spokeswoman said that its airport network has been 'a valued brand for over 21 years' and a 'reliable source of current news programming and localized custom content for busy, on-the-go travelers.' CNN's screens can be seen in 49 of the busiest U.S. airports, including Chicago O'Hare and Dallas/Fort Worth. CNN said it reaches 248 million customers every year in airports. Keeping travelers in touch: CNN won't lose their presence, but they will be threatened by further competition . This is just the latest in a string of blows for CNN, as their ratings this year have steadily lagged behind theirs of years past. While airport advertising is not as big a business as cable TV, it makes more than $10million a year for CNN, according to a source familiar with the situation. Any setback will hurt the reach of CNN, which has lagged in the ratings behind News Corp's Fox News and Comcast Corp's MSNBC. CNN is searching for a new president after its longtime chief Jim Walton said he would depart by the end of the year. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes singled out CNN last quarter for being a weak spot. Mr Sturek said Clear Channel will initially roll out in mid-sized airports. To try to win over customers, ClearVision will offer a wider array of programming and air shows ranging from comedies to CNBC's morning business updates. CNN mainly focuses on pulling news and programming from its networks CNN, HLN, CNN International and some local segments. Both companies said they are able to show live sports. Clear Channel also aims to stand out by letting travelers connect their mobile devices wirelessly to the TV sets starting in the first quarter of next year, so travelers can watch the airport programs on their own screens while they are waiting. Eventually, travelers will be able to select from different channels. 'So, one traveler can watch news while a person sitting next to them can watch America's Got Talent,' Mr Sturek said.","CNN has been the only TV provider in U.S. airports for two decades .

"By . Eve Mcgowan . Botox fan: Forever youthful singer Kylie Minogue . It may be a favourite among stars such as Kylie Minogue, but Botox jabs do not make you better looking, according to new research. A study, published in the Journal Of Clinical And Aesthetic Dermatology, is the first to look at whether injectable cosmetic procedures – chosen by thousands of Britons each year – make women appear healthier, younger and more attractive. When shown pictures of ten women who had had Botox, 150 volunteers said they now looked marginally less attractive than before. However, fillers – gels injected under the skin to add volume – were found to improve appearance. Botox works by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that tells muscles to contract. Over time, the nerves rebuild the ability to release the chemical messenger, allowing muscles to regain their function. This usually takes  several months. The research was carried out  by London-based cosmetic surgeon Dr Michael Prager. He did not administer the injections himself, so was able to remain impartial. He says: ‘We’re all aware  of people with frozen faces from too many treatments. Muscle movement  around the eye area is incredibly important for expressive empathy. ‘In most of the women in the study, the eyebrow level was lower after Botox and the under-eye area was saggier. 'They may have been free  from crow’s feet but they didn’t look as good. You won’t always see an instant boost to attractiveness from Botox.’ Injecting youth: Botox works by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that tells muscles to contract . Dr Prager adds: ‘Facial muscles are interconnected. If you freeze one part, you could relax another and cause sagging in that area. 'Botox can change the volume distribution of the face and injecting it into the eye area can make the cheeks droopier.’ As we age, we lose volume in our upper face and gain it in the lower  face, creating a jowly effect. Dr Prager has noticed that a prime concern for many patients is achieving a jaw line  to rival Hollywood stars such as Angelina Jolie. ‘I still think that Botox is great but it has to be used in much smaller doses around the eye and forehead and in much larger amounts in the lower face and neck,’ Dr Prager says. ‘Botox is much better if it is used for shaping the face rather than as a treatment for lines and wrinkles.’","Study found that Botox made people less attractive .

"By . Lizzie Parry . They could be mistaken for an intricate lego display, or a pile of colourful milk crates stacked up high. But take a closer look and these mesmerising photographs show the vast scale of soaring apartment blocks in one of the most densely populated regions in the world - Hong Kong. As home to a population of more than seven million crammed into an area measuring just 424 square miles, space on the island is at a premium. These mesmerising images by photographer Peter Stewart capture the sheer scale of the soaring apartment blocks in one of the world's most densely populated cities - Hong Kong . With seven million people crammed into a city, which covers 424 square miles, space is at a premium and the only way to go is up . The result is soaring skyscrapers towering above the city to provide enough homes for the vast population . People live in apartments crammed into sky-high tower blocks, their laundry spilling over balconies, which overlook one another . It means that, when it comes to providing accommodation for Hong Kong's huge population, the only way to go is up. These optical illusions, captured by landscape photographer Peter Stewart, show the state in a totally different and colourful light. From a distance the images appear to depict giant lego constructions or stacks of crates piled high. But the bright colours are in fact the vast fascias of tower blocks across the area. The images reveal the densely-packed apartments crammed into towering skyscrapers, with laundry spilling from barred windows and hanging over cramped balconies. Mr Stewart, said: 'Photographing the Hong Kong skyline and suburbia has always been a dream of mine. 'A . lot of people see high rise buildings as drab and an eyesore, but I . look at them in the positive light and actually think they have a lot of . appeal. 'Whenever I look . at the photo's I wonder who's in that apartment, and what they are . doing, and this just gives so much depth to the photo's and I can sit . looking at them for hours.' Mr Stewart's clever images turn what is a sprawling concrete jungle into a bright montage of colours . The giant tower blocks come in all shapes and sizes, fitting as many homes as possible into the city's 424 square miles . From afar the images could be mistaken for an elaborate lego construction or milk crates stacked up high . But on closer inspection the eye is drawn to the open windows, washing hanging from balconies and blinds partially drawn . Mr Stewart said photographing the city had been a long-held dream. 'Whenever I look at the photos I wonder who's in that apartment, and what are they doing... I can sit and look at them for hours' Recent statistics show that Hong Kong has more skyscrapers than any other region in the world and has more buildings higher than 500ft than any other place on the globe. High rise buildings are so common as they meet the demand for the ever growing population of the bustling Chinese island, but such buildings don't always have a great aesthetic appeal. As some of the photo's show, buildings are designed in such a way that they outlook onto other people's balconies, in prisms blocked from most natural daylight. But, Mr Stewart's work has captured the character, of the bustling communities who live in these cumbersome tenement blocks. He said: 'The architecture of the city is great and I love the angles, the clever design of the city how everything slots in to place. 'It's probably one of the most exciting cities I've ever photographed in.' Giant prisms of light beam through the blocks, slotted tightly together to create a concrete jungle .

"By . Paul Collins . Everton manager Roberto Martinez has dismissed a potential surprise move from Liverpool for England starlet Ross Barkley. The 20-year-old playmaker has made an explosive entrance on to the Premier League stage this season under Martinez's guidance, and scored a goal-of-the-season contender at Newcastle last month. Barkley's Everton exploits have attracted interest from Manchester United, but city rivals Liverpool are now prepared to smash their transfer record to land the youngster, according to reports in the Daily Star. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ross Barkley scoring in England training . Hands off: Ross Barkley will not be leaving Everton any time soon, says Roberto Martinez . Instant impact: Barkley has become a hot property during his maiden full season in the Premier League . Wonder goal: Barkley scored a superb solo effort at Newcastle, having ran almost the length of the pitch . But Martinez is not willing to entertain any bids for Barkley, and laughed off a potential bid from Brendan Rodgers' title chasers as well as from Old Trafford. And the Spaniard insisted he welcomes bids for his players, because it proves they are performing at a high level. 'In terms of speculation, we already turned down a £50m bid from (Manchester) United so we're not going to take £38m from Liverpool,' Martinez said at a press conference on Tuesday. 'It's quite enjoyable to speak about speculation because it shows how well our players are doing. That's the type of football compliments we want.' Martinez also dismissed the possibility of defender John Stones leaving the club this summer. As revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, Chelsea have joined Arsenal in the race for the 19-year-old defender, but both clubs clearly face a difficult task prising him away. Going nowhere: Defender John Stones (left) is another impressive Everton youngster . Martinez insisted he did not know . about the interest in Stones, who was a £3m buy from Barnsley in . January 2013 and is being tipped as an outsider for England's World Cup . squad after a series of increasingly impressive displays this season. 'No, I haven't heard about (that),' said Martinez. 'We won't send players on loan either. 'It's a good sign. It's not bad for a young man who's just beginning his career.' He added: 'Stones has been phenomenal.' No thanks: Espanol forward Sergio Garcia is not on Everton's wishlist, insists Martinez . Martinez also rejected suggestions of interest in Espanyol forward Sergio Garcia, and said that, while he expects to bring in players this summer, he will be looking to bring through more academy graduates, such as Barkley. 'We're well in advance in the search for talent and characters who can help our dressing room,' he said. 'We always do that from (transfer) window to window. But the names coming up are far away from our targets. 'Recruitment is underway behind the scenes. The biggest source of recruitment is at home.

Hi guys, so most of you are probably wondering why I’m doing this video. My life’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, to say the least, over the last . couple of years. Losing my dad to cancer in 2011 was one of the hardest . things I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. Then winning an Olympic . medal last year in 2012 in front of a home crowd, finishing my A Levels . this year.. it’s been hectic. One thing I consider to be pretty important is to have some form of . private life and you're probably thinking 'well why did you do a book . and why did you do a documentary and stuff' but I've only ever talked . about things I feel comfortable talking about. When I was younger I . didn't like talking about a bullying situation at school, I didn’t like . talking about my dad because at the time it was a sensitive subject. It’s one of those things where in an ideal world I shouldn’t be doing . this video because it shouldn’t matter but recently I was misquoted in . an interview and it made me feel really angry and frustrated. Emotions . that I’ve never felt before when reading quotes about myself. Honesty, . for me is something I really do believe in. And I’ve always been honest. I may have been vague in some of my answers, but one thing I’ve never . felt that comfortable talking about are my relationships, because it is . what I get asked even if I’m doing sporting interviews ‘do you have a . girlfriend, who are you seeing’ all that sort of stuff. I mean, I've been dating girls and I've never really had a serious . relationship to talk about. Now I kind of feel ready to talk about . relationships. Come Spring this year, my life changed, massively, when I . met someone and they make me feel so happy, so safe and everything just . feels great. Well that someone is a guy. And it did take me by surprise . a little bit. It was always in the back of my head that something like . that could happen. But it wasn’t until spring this year that something . just clicked, it felt right. And I was like: OK. Like I said, my whole . world just changed right there and then. Of course, I still fancy girls, . but right now I’m dating a guy and I couldn’t be happier. I feel safe . and it just feels right. People are going to have their own opinions and people are going to make . a deal of this. Is it a big deal? I don’t think so. People are going to . call me a liar, it’s going to be big, but I wanted to say something and . right now I’m ready and I wanted to do it. People will think: what would your dad say? Well he always said: 'if . you're happy, I'm happy' and right now I couldn’t be happier. My mum’s . been so supportive as well, I can count the number of people on my hand . that I've told, but all my friends and family that I have told have been . so supportive and great. But I told the rest of my family today and let’s just say they had mixed . opinions, lots of them didn’t believe it, lots of them wanted me to . keep it quiet. Some said why don’t you just do a statement, why don’t . you do a magazine cover, why don’t you do a TV interview? But I didn’t . want to get my words twisted, I wanted to put an end to the rumours and . just say it, to tell you guys. Because it’s what I want to do. My friends and family are always there to support me and I hope you guys . can be too. I’m still Tom, I still want to win a gold medal for Great . Britain in Rio in 2016.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . The woman who inspired the film An Education has admitted for the first time that she only realised decades after her relationship with a teacher that she had been groomed. An Education is set in the 1960s but it was not until after 2000 that Lynn Barber, a renowned journalist, came to the realisation that what she initially thought was a love story was a peadophile grooming a young girl and conning her parents. The story of David Goldman and Jenny Mellor was a hit - winning Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, a best actress BAFTA. Carey Mulligan plays Jenny in An Education. Her character is based on Lynn Barber and her romance with teacher Alan Green. Peter Sarsgaard plays the teacher, called David Goldman in the film . In the film, a scene at Jenny's parents' shows Mr Goldman charming her parents and convincing them that he should marry her daughter. But now Mrs Barber, who is behind its . plot admits that in hindsight, that the teacher who she has referred to as Simon Goldman did not just charm . her parents, they were groomed in the same way that she was. In a piece in The Sunday Times Magazine she admitted that it was only in the early noughties when she heard the expression for the first time that the realisation of what had actually happened to her struck. She wrote in the magazine: 'Yes, I believe he was a paedophile and that he groomed my parents to deliver me to him'. Until recently, Mrs Barber had said that the older man's name was Simon Goldman but after his death she revealed that his real name was Alan Green. The 2009 film was based on Lynn Barber's schoolgirl relationship with teacher Alan Green. She reveals in the piece that it was only after 2000 that she released she was groomed . Mrs Barber said that although Green was not by definition a peadophile because she was above the age of consent, she had been in a 'peadophile relationship'. She said the attraction came from their difference in age. Mrs Barber admitted that she fell for the teacher because he was a grown-up. In turn, he was attracted to her position as a school girl. Mrs Barber added: 'He relied on the fact that schoolgirls didn't question what grown-ups did.' Mrs Barber is known for her hard-hitting . interviewing technique and has interviewed names from Rafael Nadal to . Marianna Faithful. Years on, Mrs Barber admits that being duped by her former lover, never asking whether he was married or for his age, was not in keeping with her inquistive nature. She wrote in the magazine that she had never forgiven Green and that, when she found out that he had died in 2013, she thought 'Phew'.

"By . Amanda Williams . Parents are petitioning against Tesco for labelling too many products - from potatoes to fruit juice - with the unlikely warning 'may contain nuts'. Mothers of children with nut allergies have complained that it is 'almost impossible' to feed their offspring if they take the over-cautious policy at its word. More than 12,500 people have signed a petition calling for the supermarket giant to 'Stop using blanket 'may contain nuts' labels'. Parents are petitioning against Tesco for labelling too many products - from potatoes to fruit juice - with the unlikely warning 'may contain nuts' It was launched by Claire Hussein, from Portsmouth, after she said that Tesco 'dramatically changed its labelling policy'. She said: 'Suddenly, many previously safe foods are now apparently unsafe as they have ‘may contain nuts’ on them. 'These products literally changed their allergy information overnight. 'We recognise there will be risk in some foods, such as chocolate and biscuits. 'However, when you attempt a weekly shop for your family and find that everything from baked beans to pizza, butternut squash, potatoes, fruit juice and more are suddenly labelled as being potentially unsafe it is very disruptive and leaves you with extremely limited options for feeding your family.' Tesco said that the foods would previously have been marked as having been made in factories where nuts were also used. But it told the Times that the need for a larger font has changed the warning. New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory. Ms Hussein added: 'Rather than making a genuine and careful assessment of the risks, it appears that Tesco is using a blanket 'may contain nuts' policy as a legal disclaimer and to avoid having to implement the proper controls to ensure even staple items of food are safe for our children. Tesco said that the foods would previously have been marked as having been made in factories where nuts were also used, but the need for a larger font has changed the warning . 'I am calling on Tesco to act now to change its labelling procedures to ensure they are true reflections of risk. They need transparent traceability for all ingredients so a may contain label is only used with real need. The guidance is to prevent blanket statements - yet this appears to be the stance Tesco is taking.' Tesco told the paper that it takes great care to label its products with allergy advice where necessary. It added: 'We only display these warnings where there is a risk of cross-contamination.' Up to ten people a year die from reactions caused by coming into contact with even minute quantities of peanuts. Peanut allergy, which is now thought to affect at least one in 50 children, can cause serious breathing problems. The most severely affected could experience a life-threatening anaphylactic shock or even die when exposed to just a trace of the nuts in their food. Sufferers have to carry an EpiPen, an autoinjector to administer adrenaline in an emergency. But the fear of accidental exposure can reduce their quality of life and severely limit the social activities of allergic individuals, their families and even their friends.","Tesco labels 'butternut squash, potatoes, fruit juice' with warning .

"By . Ryan Gorman . New Yorkers still licking their wounds from one of the worst winters in recent memory may now have to contend with a brutally hot and humid summer. The 2014 Farmer’s Almanac is predicting a summer with above average heat, humidity and precipitation for the tri-state area. Some are already half-jokingly referring to it as the 'Solar Vortex.' The long-term forecasters at the Almanac are also calling for a major hurricane to take a similar path to Sandy and slam the region in the middle of September. Familiar scene: Children are likely to be seen this summer playing in fountains if temperatures skyrocket to the 90s as they did on this July 2011 day . ‘It looks like it’s going to be an oppressively hot and humid summer for the New York area,’ Sandi Duncan, the almanac’s managing editor, told the New York Post. ‘It’s going to be very humid and thundery,’ she added. Temperatures will predictably heat up in mid-June, but will bring with them monsoon-like rains that will soak New Yorkers to the bone, according to the book. The ‘Solar Vortex,’ as Gothamist has already called it, will inundate the metro region with heavy rains and high temperatures through Mid-August but somehow save a dry day for July 4. Things will then begin to cool off and dry out as August draws to a close. Gothamist forecaster Joe Schumacher seemed conflicted about the coming summer. A distant memory: The major snowstorm that blasted the city January 21 is fast fading in the rearview mirror . He said he enjoys reading the books, but ‘no forecast that predicts specific weather for specific days months in advance has any shred of credibility. ‘That sort of forecast, where the exact weather is predicted, shows no skill beyond about ten days and becomes theoretically impossible beyond 2-3 weeks,’ he added. Weather predictions looking that far into the future play on probabilities, and that saying ‘a hurricane will threaten the East Coast from Sept. 16-19 is the equivalent of selling snake oil,’ said Schumacher. But then he lent credence to the idea of a harsh summer. ‘There is some agreement among long-range forecasters that an El Nino, a warming of the eastern Pacific Ocean, will develop this summer. ‘El Niño is associated with fewer tropical storms bothering the northeast and warmer winters.’ Published since 1818, the Almanac claims to correct predict forecast 80 per cent of the time using astrological and mathematical formulas that take sunspot activity, lunar cycles and planetary alignment into account. It did predict this year’s winter – almost to a T.","The 2014 Farmer's Almanac claims this coming summer will be one for the record books .

Deborah Betesh, 56, is suing the firm Microdot after she claims she paid the company $250,000 for the miracle hair transplant procedure. Between April 2012 and April 2014, Betesh claims she underwent treatments with Microdot after she began worrying about her hair thinning out. Wigged out: Deborah Betesh claims a botched hair-implant procedure left her completely bald . Bald: Betesh claims that after the procedure ruined her hair, the firm convinced her to spend thousands on a 'permanent artificial wig' The company, she claims, promised to give her 'the hair of her dreams' and that the Microdot procedure is 'a safe and effective alternative to having hair transplant surgery,' according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. 'Not only would Microdot technique exactly match the color and texture of . her natural hair, it would allow her to among other things, wash her . hair, use a curling iron or even put it in a ponytail,' the company . pledged to Betesh, according to court documents obtained by the New York Post. However, the procedure - which includes surgically implanting hair into a person's scalp - didn't restore her thinning hair. Rather, it left her with bald patches all over her scalp. Betesh claims a Microdot staffer tried to weave additional hair into the strands that hadn't already fallen out, but that procedure failed, as well. Betesh claims the Microdot employee who performed the medical procedure on her had no medical license, just a cosmetology license. Sour grapes: Microdot claims Betesh never had the procedure done and she is just disgruntled about a failed business arrangement she'd made with the firm's founder . After the implants failed, Betesh says the firm convinced her to buy a 'permanent artificial wig for several thousands of dollars.' Microdot, however, says Betesh's claims are the product of sour grapes, not a botched procedure. Karen Decileo, a rep for the firm, says Betesh has a hair-pulling disorder and that she only paid $4,800 for a non-surgical treatment similar to getting hair extensions. Decileo told the Post that Betesh is 'disgruntled' over a business-deal-gone-wrong that she had with Microdot founder James Costa. She says the $250,000 Betesh paid was an investment in Costa's other alternative medical technique, Derma-Dot. However, Costa recently was diagnosed with a heart condition and the new venture went by the wayside, causing Betesh to become 'annoyed that [Derma-Dot] wasn’t going forward and she wanted out,' Decileo says. According to the Post, Microdot doesn't exactly have a great track record when it comes to satisfied customers - over the past three years, there have been 10 complaints made to the Better Business Bureau about Microdot for 'problems with product/service. A different rep for the company told the paper that Microdot has 'roughly 2,500 clients a year in each location, making a total of 5,000. So having 10 complaints in the past three years isn’t a bad percentage . at all.'","Deborah Betesh is suing the hair-implant firm Microdot for $15 million .

"By . Sam Webb . Poorly-installed pipes fitted by DIY-crazy homeowners are leaking raw sewage and other toxic materials into UK waterways, killing marine life. As more and more home improvement enthusiasts, inspired by programmes like DIY SOS and Grand Designs, tackle their own plumbing issues, fish and water-based plants are dying off, experts have warned. A spokesman from Thames Water, which serves 14 million people in London and the Thames Valley, said an estimated 300,000 properties across England and Wales have wrongly connected pipes that not only pollute watercourses but also increase flood risks. DIY: But bad amateur plumbing is seeping waste into UK waterways, killing fish and increasing the risk of flooding . Approximately 1.5 Olympic swimming pools' worth of foul waste enters watercourses daily in the Thames Water region alone. He said: 'People put in a new washing machine and plug it into what looks like the waste pipe but it goes to the surface water drain and it enters a local stream. 'Water from appliances and sewage needs to go to sewage treatment plants.' He said that the boom in DIY is a factor behind the numbers. He said: 'Less housing is being sold because of the recession so many people are staying in their houses and improving them.' The spokesman added that Thames Water is seeking a legislative change that will allow water companies to enforce work at private properties. It is currently the remit of local authorities, which Thames Water claims are not incentivised or resourced to give it the priority it warrants. DIY SOS: Home improvement programmes are fuelling the trend for homeowners to undertake their own plumbing . Granting companies these powers would make tackling harmful plumbing mistakes easier for local authorities, companies and customers, the spokesman said. In 2009, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) predicted that half a million properties will have botched pipework by 2015. Dr Robert Keirle, pollution programme manager at the Marine Conservation Society, told The Observer: 'As DIY has become more popular, aided by an explosion in property programmes on television, the problem has grown. 'It is also probably a result of the times we live in, with people unable to afford to call in tradesmen to do the plumbing.' Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, told the paper his members had seen a change at fishing spots, particularly in inner cities. 'The sewage removes oxygen, encouraging eutrophication, meaning that it grows a lot of algae and the water becomes stagnant.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . Delighted: Kate Silverton, 43, has spoken of her shock at conceiving naturally twice despite setbacks . TV newsreader Kate Silverton has told how becoming pregnant for a second time against all expectations is 'beyond a miracle'. The BBC presenter has struggled for years with fertility problems, undergoing IVF a number of times. Now, having conceived naturally for a second time, she has urged women to keep trying through the 'tough times'. 'To be blessed with baby number two seems beyond a miracle,' the 43-year-old told Hello! magazine. 'It seems it's also beyond the doctors' understanding, too. It's simply amazing and we are so excited.' She and her husband Mike Heron have had years of setbacks in their efforts to have children. Miss Silverton had lost an ovary during an operation to remove a cyst when she was 29, and resigned herself to life without children after four rounds of IVF treatment. Finally, in November 2011, the couple were delighted to welcome their daughter Clemency, conceived naturally. It gave Miss Silverton the hope to try again, she explains - two months ahead of the birth of her second child. 'I have felt such utter joy in motherhood that I just wanted the chance to do it all over again. 'Despite my limited chances, I thought it was worth trying again. I just wanted to have one more try naturally and see what happened.' It has not been straightforward and she has had two miscarriages after Clemency's birth which led to her waiting in this pregnancy before going public. 'Blessing': Miss Silverton tweeted this image of the baby, due in two months, giving a thumbs up . She went through four rounds of IVF with partner Mike Heron before Clemency was born in November 2011 . Miss Silverton hopes she will be able to provide support for others who have difficulty conceiving in the future. 'I think it helps for women and their partners to be able to talk openly about what they are going through and to know they're not alone, and that even with the tough times there can always be hope,' she said. 'Mike and I struggled to have children for the last seven years. Now it feels as if we're coming to the fruition of a long but lovely journey. I would love to know that there are others out there who are able to do the same.'","Presenter celebrates imminent birth of second child after years of setbacks .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Two British woman have been detained in China for more than two months after their dream holiday turned to nightmare. Modupe Idowu, 59, and her friend Esther Jubril Badmos, also 48, were arrested after becoming embroiled in a dispute at a shoe shop . in the city of Guangzhou. They were locked up in 'hell-like' conditions at a detention centre for 38 days and although they have now been released, the two women remain trapped in the country as their visas have expired and authorities refuse to issue them new ones. Trapped: Mary Idowu, left, and Esther Jubril-Badmos are stuck in China as their visas ran out when police detained them for 38 days and authorities are now refusing to issue them new ones . Mrs Idowu's desperate family said the two women's ordeal began Ms Badmos asked the shop to amend an order she had lodged earlier in the trip. She was then assaulted by two members of staff before both women went to a police station.Mrs Idowu, from Islington, North London witnessed a vicious attack on her friend. Daughter Sarah Murray said: 'Although Esther tried to defend herself, she was pushed to the floor, kicked and beaten - and handfuls of her hair were ripped out. 'A security guard locked them in a room and another man, who we think is the shop owner's brother, came to the room and punched Esther.' When they arrived at the police station their passports were seized and they were pressurised into signing paperwork they didn't understand, before being flung into a cell overnight without food and moved to a detention centre the next day. Ms Idowu, who is known as Mary, was put in a cell with six other women - forced to sleep on a wooden plank and go to the toilet in front of the other prisoners. Her friend was taken to the centre's hospital where she was treated for her injuries. Meanwhile Mrs Idowu's five children . have struggled to find out any information about their mother - despite . paying lawyers in China around £4,000 to find out - and two of them flew . to the country to track her down at the end of July. Both . women were released on July 29 but since then have been met with an . onslaught of demands including a £20,000 claim for damages from the shop . owner, which was eventually settled with £4,500. Ordeal: The pair were arrested after being assaulted by two members of staff at a shoe shop in Guangzhou, pictured, when they asked them to amend an order . But their visas have now expired and they cannot be issued with new ones until police provide paperwork to show the charges had been dropped. Despite endless visits to the police station, officers refuse to tell them when, and if, the documentation will be provided. Mrs Murray said she barely recognised her mum when she saw her come out of prison. 'When I saw her, I thought she looked like an old woman. She could not walk properly. She was so frail and so skinny as she had lost a couple of stone as she barely ate.' Mrs Murray, who returned from China last week, added: 'I can't really put this experience into words. We are totally confused. It's like watching a horror film.' Her sister, Julie Idowu, 26 said: 'Our pain is very real. I have been crying every day. I have taken a lot of time off work as I'm so worried about my mum. 'Her health and mental state is a big concern as well as the fact that she has missed her operation. 'It's an injustice that my mum has been held for all this time for witnessing an assault on her friend. Her other sister, Elizabeth Idowu, criticised lawyers, saying: 'People are exploiting our despair. They are making money out of our continued suffering.' A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman said they were aware of the situation and were providing assistance, but could not comment further and said it was a matter for the Chinese.","Modupe Idowu, 59 and Esther Jubril Badmos, 48, were arrested after becoming embroiled in a dispute at a shoe shop .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy tried to seduce Valerie Trierweiler, the former partner of his successor President Hollande, it has been claimed. Mr Sarkozy allegedly approached political journalist Ms Trierweiler at a Bastille Day garden party two months after being elected president in 2007, whispering: 'You are beautiful. We should see each other'. But Ms Trierweiler, who was already dating Mr Hollande, is said to have hit back with a flat rejection, later calling him 'a boor'. Rebuffed: Political journalist Valerie Trierweiler had already been dating Mr Hollande for five years when Nicolas Sarkozy propositioned her, according to a new 'tell-all' book about Sarkozy's post-presidential life . 'Feud': Mr Sarkozy's biographer claims the incident was the start of a feud between Mr Sarkozy and Ms Trierweiler, evident at every public engagement since Mr Hollande was elected in 2012 (pictured) The latest addition to France's colourful history of political love scandals comes from a 'tell-all' book on Nicolas Sarkozy's post-presidential life. It has been taken by many as an explanation for the apparent feud between Ms Trierweiler and Mr Sarkozy at every public appearance since Mr Hollande was elected in 2012. Mr Sarkozy, whose marriage was on the verge of collapse, took the refusal badly, writes biographer Patrice Machuret. Divorcing Cecilia Ciganer, he had already dated a number of political journalists - and wrongly took Ms Trierweiler to be 'an opportunist', Mr Machuret writes in His Life After The Elysee. According to the tale the leader recoiled, remarking: 'Who does she think she is?'. His 11-year marriage to Cecilia Ciganer (left) was collapsing at the time of the alleged incident in July 2007. They are pictured left in October 2007, when they divorced. In July 2008 he emerged with Carla Bruni (right) Valerie Trierweiler and Francois Hollande had been secretly dating for five years by the time of the party . In January, Mr Hollande separated from Ms Trierweiler after his affair with actress Julie Gayet became public . Months after the alleged incident, reported by The Times, Mr Sarkozy met his bride-to-be, model Carla Bruni. But from that moment on, he appeared to hold a grudge against Ms Trierweiler, Mr Machuret writes. At Nelson Mandela’s funeral in Johannesburg, Mr Sarkozy is said to have ridiculed Ms Trierweiler’s hat. He said it made her look like François Mitterrand, the last French socialist president, joking: 'There were three French presidents at the funeral: Me, François Hollande and François Mitterrand,' Machuret writes. A month later, she was dumped by Mr Hollande after it emerged he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. Representatives of Mr Sarkozy have denied that he 'made a play for' Ms Trierweiler, said Machuret.","Nicolas Sarkozy whispered proposal to Ms Trierweiler at party, book claims .

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . Vice President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday 'it's time for Russia to stop talking and start acting' to reduce tension in Ukraine. Standing alongside acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Kiev, Ukraine, Biden called on Moscow to encourage masked, pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine to vacate illegally occupied government buildings and checkpoints, accept amnesty and 'address their grievances politically.' 'We have been clear that more proactive behavior by Russia will lead to more costs and greater isolation,' the Vice President said. Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden (left) and  acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk (right) held a press conference on Tuesday after meeting privately in Kiev, Ukraine. During the meeting the Biden offered the country additional support to help it get - and stay - on the right track . Biden said Russia needs to act 'without delay,' adding, 'We will not allow this to become an open-ended process. Time is short in which to make progress.' Yatsenyuk was harsher in his characterization of Russia. 'No country should be able to behave like an armed bandit,' he said. 'Russia should stick to its international commitments and obligations. They should not behave as gangsters in the modern century.' 'Or else what?' asked Sen. John McCain on MSNBC after Biden and Yatsenyuk's press conference. 'If they continue to do this, what will we do?' McCain, who recently visited . the region, described U.S. allies in Eastern Europe as 'extremely . nervous' about the intentions of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Arizona Republican called on Obama to give the . Ukrainian government some weapons to defend themselves. The ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee also said . America must show more support for countries under siege. That doesn't . mean the United States 'must fight' every war, he said, but 'the only . thing that Putin understands is a strong, viable alliance.' Biden not disclose in his statement to the press on Tuesday what costs Russia would face if it did not adhere to the international agreement made last week that requires pro-Russian separatists to cede control of Ukraine's government buildings. He merely noted that both the U.S. and Ukraine would prefer a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The Vice President also announced the United States will provide an additional $50 million to help Ukraine's beleaguered government with political and economic reforms. The money includes $11 million to help conduct the May 25 presidential election, including voter education, administration and oversight. It also will help fund expert teams from U.S. government agencies to help Ukraine to reduce its reliance on energy supplies from Russia. Other technical advisers will help fight corruption. The White House also announced $8 million in nonlethal military assistance for the Ukrainian armed forces, including bomb-disposal equipment, communications gear and vehicles. Vice President Joe Biden (right) greets a member of the Ukrainian parliament (left). Biden met with nine Ukrainian lawmakers from across the political spectrum and the country on Tuesday . 'You face very daunting problems and some might say humiliating threats that are taking place indirectly,' Biden told Ukrainian lawmakers . In the most high-level visit of a U.S. official since the crisis erupted, Biden met privately with Yatsenyuk . and acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov on Tuesday and held a . meeting in front of the press with nine Ukrainian legislators from the . across the country. I' want to thank my colleagues for bringing me back home. For 36 years I sat in our legislature, and I used to actually have this seat in our -- I was the chairman of our committee,' Biden told the Ukrainian lawmakers. 'Thank you for making me feel relevant again, back in a legislative body,' he said before moving on to more serious matters. 'You . face very daunting problems and some might say humiliating threats that . are taking place indirectly,' Biden said during the publicly broadcast meeting. He . told leaders from various political parties of Ukraine that he brings a . message of support from President Barack Obama as they face a historic . opportunity to usher in reforms. 'The . opportunity to generate a united Ukraine, getting it right, is within . your grasp,' Biden said. 'And we want to be your partner, your friend in . the project.  And we're ready to assist.' The group included three candidates . running for president in the May 25 election — most notably billionaire . chocolate magnate and front-runner Petro Poroshenko.  Biden told the . candidates he hopes that they have more luck than he did in two . presidential runs. On Tuesday video surfaced of Ukrainian nationals supposedly beating up a young pro-Russian man before throwing him into a river. A police spokesman said: 'We have not had any . reports of anyone missing or being attacked, this might just be more . pro-Russian propaganda' Biden's . visit comes at a critical time. After a tenuous international agreement . was reached to de-escalate violence in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia . insurgents oppose the government in Kiev, a shootout occurred on Sunday . at an Eastern Ukraine checkpoint, killing three. And on Tuesday, video surfaced on Ukrainian nationals reportedly beating up a young pro-Russian man before throwing him into a river. He . said the United States is an example of people from different cultures . united as one nation, although he said Ukraine has a big difference. 'We're not sitting against a border of another powerful nation,' Biden . said. Biden told the . lawmakers a priority for the U.S. is to help them become independent . from Russian energy supplies. 'Imagine where you'd be today if you were . able to tell Russia, ""Keep your gas,""' Biden said. 'It would be a very . different world you'd be facing today.' The . U.S. Vice President said during his visit Ukrainians have an historic . chance now that former President Viktor Yanukovych has fled the country . to stop being a 'kleptocracy' and become a democracy. 'This . is a second opportunity to make good on the original promise made by . the Orange Revolution,' Biden told lawmakers in a reference to 2004 . protests that overturned a widely criticized election that had given . Yanukovych the presidency. Yanukovych later took office but left the . country amid charges of corruption after violent protests in February. Biden . added, 'To be very blunt about it, and this is a delicate thing to say . to a group of leaders in their house of parliament, but you have to . fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right . now.' He mentioned reforming the courts and finding the right balance of . power between the president and Rada. 'I . want you to know I do not underestimate the incredible pressure you all . are under,' Biden said. 'I do not underestimate the challenge that you . all face. And I do not underestimate the frustration you must feel when . someone like me comes along and says this is a great opportunity for . you.' But he added that the . upcoming election may be the most important in the country's history. 'The truth of the matter is your fellow countrymen expect a whole lot of . you right now,' he said. The . Vice President also spoke with four dozen Ukranian democracy activists . and students on Tuesday. According to a White House press pool report on . the meeting, Biden told the group he was most looking forward to . meeting with them because they are the 'lifeblood' of a free Ukraine. Biden stressed to the group that corruption is the 'root cause' of Ukraine's problems, and it is significantly hurting Ukraine's economy. 'No one wants to be engaged, unless you're Mr. Putin' in a corrupt country, Biden reportedly said. The Vice President is now on his way back to Washington, D.C. He will return late Tuesday evening.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Oregon teacher who admitted sexually abusing one of her 16-year-old students sobbed hysterically in court as she was sentenced to a month's jail time. Denise Keesee, a math and special education teacher at Sherwood High School, pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree abuse as part of a plea deal as she was given a 30-day jail sentence and five years probation. Keesee also must register as a sex offender, surrender her teaching license, complete sex offender treatment and have no contact with teens unless approved by her probation officer. The 39-year-old was first investigated in 2008 when a mother reported finding inappropriate text messages between the teacher and her son. Jailed: Denise Keesee (seen here during an earlier court appearance) has now been sentenced to 30-days in jail and five years probation after admitting two counts of sexual abuse. She will never be able to teach again . Keesee has been out on custody since the day after her arrest in June of last year. When she addressed the court, she said had already completed hundreds of hours of therapy. 'I’m doing everything I can to rectify my wrong,' she said. 'I am motivated to continue to change.' She begged the judge to keep her out of custody. 'I want you to know I am learning the truth about myself, and this has been a painful process,' she sobbed. 'I am doing this to be a better wife, sister, member of society and, most importantly, the best mom I can be to my 9-year-old son.' The loss of her career, the embarrassment and shame she’s suffered because of this case were punishment enough, she said. 'I am deeply sorry for any pain and suffering I have caused,' she said. 'I will strive for the rest of my life to never cause anyone such harm.' Her defense attorney James Jensen told the judge that, as a child, Keesee suffered physical and emotional abuse. 'I would attribute this case to past challenges my client suffered in her life, he said. She is committed to saving her marriage, being a good mother and changing her behavior', Jensen said. Her lawyer also told the court that she was devastated that she will never teach again. 'Teaching wasn’t just a career for my client, it was her identity,' Jensen said. Arrest: Denise Keesee admitted having sex with a 16-year-old student and kissing an 18-year-old at the school . According to Oregon Live, at the time of the allegations, Keesee was married to a police officer who also worked at the school. According to the deputy district attorney Paul Maloney, Kessee admitted to police that she had sex with a student in 2008. In . court documents the teacher stated that the pair had sex on several . occasions at her house, the student's home and in a park. The . student, who was 16 at the time, believed he was in a long-term . relationship and that Keesee would marry him when he had finished . school, Detective Robert Rookhuyzen told Oregon Live. Keesee . contacted police in May 2008 to raise concerns about the student's . state of mind. She had received an email from him, that appeared to show . suicidal thoughts. In the email, the victim wrote: 'I'm sick of life and how I'm lying/I'm sick of this earth and what I'm trying to do/I'm sick of everything just want to be true'. It was during that investigation that the teacher admitted to having sexual contact with another student in 2012, who she admitted to kissing in her classroom several times in 2012. Detectives said she admitted sending the student a naked photos of herself. Because he was 18, no criminal charges were filed. One of the students, who is now in his 20s, filed a $5.1million lawsuit against Keesee and the Sherwood School District, allegeing that she sexually abused him, that her husband intimidated him, and that the school failed to report the abuse.

"By . Ashley Collman . Just in time for margarita season, a lime shortage in Mexico is causing a shortage of the cirtus across the U.S. with prices inflating to as high as $1.50 for a single fruit. Heaving rains in Mexico, the world's largest lime producer and where the U.S. get's 97 per cent of its supply, combined with a crop disease are contributing to the short supply of juicy limes. But more concerning is the crime caused by the Knights Templar drug cartel in the state of Michoacan, where the most limes are produced. Pricey: A shortage in Mexico, where 97 per cent of the U.S.'s  limes are produced, has caused prices to skyrocket. At Gristedes market in New York, prices for a single lime are $1.50 while they hover just under $1 at Cal-Mart Grocer in San Francisco (above) Lime crime: The Knights Templar drug cartel in Michoacan, Mexico has been raiding lime groves and hijacking farmer's trucks. Above, vigilantes have organized to fight the cartel . Lime farmers have been reporting that cartel members are raiding their groves and hijacking delivery trucks. Many growers won't even send their trucks on the road. While importers are now turning to Columbia to supplement the supply of limes, the shortage is still causing a panic with restaurant and bar owners who are now paying more than six times what they used to for a case of the fruit. What cost about $30 for a case months ago, is now closer to $200 and the limes aren't even that usable. Because of the shortage, growers are stripping all of the fruit off the trees, rendering a majority of small, golf ball-sized fruit that are rock hard. Alternatives: The shortage is causing restaurants and bars to charge more for lime-based drinks, or substitute them partially or completely with lemons. Above limes are sorted in Mihoacan, Mexico last November . Some, like Mexican chain Rosa Mexicano, are taking the hit, hoping the shortage will pass without charging their customers extra. 'I can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $36 a case,' manager Jay Holmes told CNN earlier this month. 'The first delivery this morning was $110 a case. We've not passed that onto the guest and don't plan to.' At grocery stores, the shortage has led the price of limes to skyrocket to as high as $1.50 each at Gristedes market in New York City. Restaurants are passing on the extra charge as well, upping the price on their margaritas, while some are getting inventive by doing without limes completely. Winners and losers: One man has taken advantage of the shortage by driving a U-Haul truck to and from Florida and selling limes at New York restaurants and bars. Above a man unloads a truck-load full of Mexican limes at a packing plant in Michoacan . Ricky Camacho, the executive chef at Manhattan's Anejo, has created his own lemon margarita which he told the New York Post is 'just as amazing and refreshing'. Other bartenders are mixing lime with lemon juice to make more economical mixes for their cosmopolitans and margaritas. Of course there are winners in the shortage as well, those who are taking advantage of the crisis to make an extra buck. An unidentified man in New York has been driving a rented U-Haul truck to and from Florida to sell limes to local restaurants and bars. 'He saw an opportunity to profit from this,' Esteban Ordóñez, owner of Burning Waters Cantina in Greenwich Village, told the post. 'He’s working to prepare A/C units, and he’s getting ready for the summer, and he put one and one together.' It's also causing a boon in Mexico where they've never seen such high demand for the fruit. Growers like Juan Leane Malpica in Morelos are using the extra profits to expand and upgrade fertilizer and irrigation systems.","Heavy rains in Mexico caused a large loss of the lime crop this year, which was already plagued by disease .

They signed a prenup which not only protected her fortune, but also provided her husband with the right to spousal support if they ever divorced. Paige isn't contesting that amount that she agreed to pay, reports TMZ and plans to change her name back to Elizabeth Paige Laurie.

Nancy and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke between them own a stake in the retail behemoth worth over $6 billion. Mother and daughter caused controversy in 2004 when they made a $25 million naming rights gift towards the building of a new $75 million basketball arena at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Nancy and her husband Bill Lawrie decided to name the facility Paige Sports Arena after their daughter. Neither . parents nor daughter had ever attended the university, instead Paige . graduated that year from the University of Southern California. A former roommate told ABC’s 20/20 that she had been paid $20,000 over four years to do Paige's homework for her. Once the allegations emerged, Paige’s parents agreed to let the school rename the arena which is now known as Mizzou Arena. In 2005 Paige voluntarily surrendered her USC communication degree. Paige and Bo first met back in high school during an ACT prep course and dated briefly during their senior year of high school. Four years later they bumped into each other at an L.A. nightclub and rekindled their romance. Bo proposed to Paige in December 2006.

"By . Associated Press . A New York hospital is banning electronic cigarettes after a patient on oxygen was burned by a fire that erupted while she was puffing on one of the devices. Syracuse Fire Department investigator Joe Galloway tells The Post-Standard the exact cause of last month's fire at St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center has not yet been determined. But he says the patient had a battery-powered e-cigarette, which uses a heating element to vaporize nicotine. Banned: A Syracuse hospital is banning electronic cigarettes after a female patient on oxygen was burned by a fire that erupted while she was puffing on one of the devices . The patient had an e-cigarette in her mouth and was using oxygen when the fire started. Brandon . Leonard, a St. Joe's patient safety representative, was in the . patient's first-floor room helping her roommate when he heard a loud pop . and saw flames through a privacy curtain separating the patients' beds. He . saw flames around the patient's nose and fire shooting out of the end . of a hose connected to an oxygen outlet in the wall. The flames were put . out in less than a minute. Oxygen itself is not flammable. But medical oxygen increases oxygen levels of normal air, making it easier for fires to ignite. Stubbed out: St. Joseph's officials have told patients e-cigarette use is not allowed. The hospital also prohibits tobacco use inside its buildings or outdoors on its campus . Jennie . DeLee, a registered nurse at St. Joe's, heard yelling and went into the . room where the fire occurred. 'The patient was standing at the side of . the bed,' she told Syracuse.com 'I just saw black soot and charred skin. She was in shock.' Hospital officials said the quick response of . staff prevented what could have been a catastrophe and more serious . injury to the patient. Hospital officials have not identified the patient. They say she suffered first- and second-degree burns across her face, but is home and doing well. Since the fire, St. Joseph's officials have told patients they aren't allowed to use e-cigarettes. The hospital also prohibits tobacco use on its campus. The fire investigation at St. Joe's comes at a time when there is growing concern nationally about the safety of e-cigarettes which are not regulated by the government and have been linked to poisonings and fires. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  has received at least four reports of e-cigarettes causing fires. There is no government regulation of e-cigarettes. The FDA is expected to issue proposed rules governing e-cigarettes soon.","Patients at Syracuse hospital have been asked not to use electronic cigarettes after a patient on oxygen caught fire .

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . A teen stowaway who traveled from San Jose to Hawaii in the wheel well of a passenger jet was actually captured by surveillance cameras as he crept across the tarmac and onto the plane, it has emerged, but no one saw the footage. The 16-year-old successfully slipped past layers of security early Sunday morning at San Jose International Airport but no one noticed the security breach until the plane — and the boy — landed in Hawaii. The startling failure made it clear that a determined person can still get into a supposedly safe area and sneak onto a plane. Video surveillance can help catch trespassers. Some airports use not just human eyes watching video screens, but also technology that can be programmed to sound an alert when a camera captures something potentially suspicious. Epic journey: The above graphic shows a Boeing 767 and a map of the route taken by the teenage stowaway . Security: A teenage boy, seen sitting on a stretcher center, was spotted on security cameras at San Jose International Airport, California, was the breach wasn't picked up until he landed in Maui . But just because something is caught on camera doesn't mean it will make an impression. Despite great promise, 'sometimes the actual results are quite underwhelming when it gets to the real world, where people are fatigued, people are preoccupied,' said Richard Bloom, an airport security expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona. 'There's no way to guarantee security, even if you had one person per video screen.' There were no obvious efforts Monday to increase security or the police presence at airports in San Jose or Maui. In San Jose, airport officials said they were reviewing how the boy slipped through security that includes video surveillance, German shepherds and Segway-riding police officers. While each of those measures can work for certain situations, 'the problem is that each layer has its own error factor,' Bloom said. Nobody monitoring security cameras throughout the 1,050-acre airport saw anyone approaching the Boeing 767 until they reviewed the footage after the boy was discovered in Hawaii, San Jose airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes said. The airport, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is surrounded by fences, although many sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled. Departures: People make their way into Terminal A at Mineta San Jose International Airport near the Hawaiian Airlines gates Monday . Breach: A 15-year-old boy on Sunday scrambled over an airport fence, crossed a tarmac and climbed into a jetliner's wheel well, then flew for five freezing hours to Hawaii on a misadventure that forced authorities to take a hard look at the security systems . Barnes said the boy went onto the tarmac when it was still dark. The flight took off at about 8 a.m. PDT, about 90 minutes after sunrise. The boy was knocked out most of the 5 1/2-hour flight and didn't regain consciousness until an hour after the plane landed in Hawaii, FBI spokesman Tom Simon said. When he came to, he climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by Maui airport personnel, Simon said. Surveillance video at Kahului Airport showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing, transportation officials in Hawaii said. The video was not released because of the ongoing investigation. The boy was not charged with a crime, Simon said. While the Transportation Security Administration oversees checkpoint security inside airport terminals, airport perimeters are policed by local authorities and federal law enforcement.Airport police were working with the FBI and TSA to review security. Memory loss: FBI spokesman Tom Simon in Honolulu said the teen did not remember the flight from San Jose . San Jose police said they will forward the findings of their investigation to the district attorney, who can decide whether to file criminal charges in California. Maui County spokesman Rod Antone said the county was not involved with the incident or investigation because the state runs the airports. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said they didn't plan to investigate further after turning the boy over to state human services, where officials were working to reunite the boy with his family. Isaac Yeffet, a former head of security for the Israeli airline El Al who now runs his own firm, Yeffet Security Consultants, said the breach shows that U.S. airport security still has weaknesses, despite billions of dollars invested. 'Shame on us for doing such a terrible job,' he said. 'Perimeters are not well protected. We see it again and again.' U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California, who serves on the Homeland Security committee, said on Twitter that the incident demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. The FAA says about one-quarter of the 105 stowaways who have sneaked aboard flights worldwide since 1947 have survived. Some wheel-well stowaways survived deadly cold and a lack of oxygen because their breathing, heart rate and brain activity slow down.","A teen stowaway who traveled from San Jose to Hawaii in the landing gear of a passenger jet was actually captured by surveillance cameras .

"By . Jill Reilly . A family is suing a New Jersey school district, contending that the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance is discriminatory toward atheist children. The lawsuit against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District was filed in state court last month and announced Monday by the American Humanist Association. The group says the phrase, added in 1954, 'marginalizes atheist and humanist kids as something less than ideal patriots.' A family is suing a New Jersey school district, contending that the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance is discriminatory toward atheist children (file photo) The anonymous plaintiffs say those two words violate the state constitution. According to the suit, the humanist group complained to school officials in February, but the district would not change the pledge. David Niose, an attorney for the American Humanist Association’s Appignani Humanist Legal Center, said public schools should not permit an exercise that 'teaches students that patriotism is tied to a belief in God.' 'Such a daily exercise portrays atheist and humanist children as second-class citizens, and certainly contributes to anti-atheist prejudices,' Niose said in a statement reported Fox News. But school district lawyer David Rubin said the district is merely following a state law that requires schools to have a daily recitation of the pledge. In March last year Enidris Siurano Rodríguez, a sophomore at Damascus High School in Montgomery County, faced suspension for refusing to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance . He told NorthJersey.com that individual students do not have to participate. 'We are disappointed that this national organization has targeted Matawan-Aberdeen for merely obeying the law as it stands,' Rubin said in a written statement. The group is awaiting a ruling from a court on a similar case in Massachusetts. In March last year a high school student faced suspension for refusing to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Enidris Siurano Rodríguez, a sophomore at Damascus High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, had refused to participate in the daily pledge since she was in seventh grade because of the federal government's policies toward her native Puerto Rico. The American Civil Liberties Union became and filed a complaint against the school, saying it is Enidris' right to sit in silence during the pledge.

"By . Ashley Collman . A professor at Miami-Dade College was mercilessly beaten up at the Kendall campus last week, and he believes a spurned student may be to blame. While Professor Marc Magellan didn't recognize the assailant, nothing was stolen which leads him to think it was a hired hit. 'There is nobody I can think of who would have wanted to attack me so brutally unless there was some sort of grudge or chip on their shoulder,' Mr Magellan told the Miami Herald in an email. 'In my business, the only people who hold grudges are the ones who I've had to drop or fail. It comes with the territory I guess.' Scroll down for video . Injured: Miami-Dade College Professor Marc Magellan was brutally beaten up leaving campus last week. He suffered a broken nose and hand in the attack . Before and after: Mr Magellan says nothing was stolen from him, which leads him to believe the attack was organized by a student with a grudge . The attack happened April 15, just before 6pm in a campus parking garage, as the 31-year-old jazz and music history professor was leaving campus to go home. He says he turned around when he heard a man call out 'Professor Marc' and that's when he was hit with a sucker-punch to the face. The hit took him so by surprise that he was knocked to the ground, where the attacker continued to beat him up 'unmercifully' against the pavement. At one point, Mr Magellan says the assailant, who he didn't recognize as a student, 'was powerfully punching the side of my head against the concrete floor of the garage'. On high alert: Security has been stepped up at Miami-Dade College's Kendall campus following the attack . Mr Magellan suffered a broken nose, broken hand and other injuries to his head, face, arms, knees and feet before the attacker fled, speeding off in a blue sports car. After the attack, Mr Magellan spent five hours in Baptist Hospital's emergency room before returning home to recover for a week and see specialists. He had his first day back in class on Monday, and told MailOnline that everyone on campus was 'exceptionally nice and supportive'. He says he considers himself 'very lucky' since he easily could have died being beaten on concrete. Mr Magellan's beating seems surprising considering the overwhelmingly positive reviews he has received on RateMyProfessor.com. Many of the student reviewers call him the best professor they've ever had, with one student saying they switched their major to art history after taking his class. Back in the classroom: Mr Magellan teaches jazz and music history at the college's Kendall campus. He returned to school for his first class since the attack on Monday. Pictured above in a photo posted on his Facebook . Tough teacher? Mr Magellan has received almost all positive reviews on his Rate My Professor page, but one of the reviews call his class to hard for an elective . But a recent review was less positive, calling his class 'ridiculously hard for an elective'. 'DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY,' the review reads. '...STAY AWAY if you don't want to hurt your GPA.' Following the attack, school spokesman Juan Mendieta issued a statement calling the beating 'disturbing'. 'The battery appears to be a very isolated incident and possibly targeted...the Kendall Campus is normally a very safe campus. However, in an abundance of caution, the campus leadership has further heightened security,' Mr Mendieta said.

Treacherous: Hikes up Mount Everest are generally confined to May given the favorable weather (pictured: the Khumbu Icefall in May 2003) 'We want to have the right tribute.' They also announced that they would be establishing a relief fund for the relatives of the victims and encouraging viewers to donate. They did not specify if the relatives of only the five Sherpas who were working with their crew or all 16 who died on Friday will be able to access the funds. The Nepalese government released a list of the 16 Sherpas on Friday, and at the time only 12 bodies had been found and four were still missing. That number has since increased as a total of 13 bodies have been found and the remaining three are presumed dead. Discovery Channel was set to air the live jump on March 11 with Today Show personality Willie Geist set to host the special as it was broadcast across 224 countries simultaneously. Organizers cancelled the jump on Sunday, ahead of calls that the Sherpa community would strike if the government would not force changes within their industry so that disability and life insurance rates were raised. 'The success rate of such an ambitious . project that needed to have everything go right was greatly . compromised,' Ms O'Neill told the Associated Press. 'It was a collection of issues that really gave us no choice.' O'Neill wouldn't say how much . Discovery had paid for the mission, which the network hoped would be a . big ratings-grabber along the lines of Nik Wallenda's tightrope walk . across the Grand Canyon. Making a documentary on the disaster would allow the network to recoup some of its investment. Emotional: Daughter of Ang Kaji Sherpa, one of the victims of the Mount Everest avalanche on 18 April, collapses during the cremation ceremony at Syambhu . On Tuesday, it was confirmed that many of the Sherpas have decided not to climb Everest this season- which is generally confined to the month of May due to more favorable weather conditions. 'It is just impossible for many of us to continue climbing while there are three of our friends buried in the snow,' longtime guide Dorje Sherpa said. 'I can't imagine stepping over them.' Government-mandated death insurance for the local guides hired to help bring adventurers and their gear up the harrowing mountain was recently raised from $4,600 to $10,400, and earlier this week the Sherpas argued that the fee should be boosted to $20,800. The $4,600 death and accident insurance fee that had been the standard rate for years was never enough, and families regularly went into debt in order to give their loved ones a full Buddhist ceremony meant to speed up the soul's journey towards reincarnation. That number was doubled earlier this year, but it has not addressed the continuing problems of inequality surrounding the Everest climbs: foreign groups and adventurers pay upwards of $50,000 or $60,000 to make the storied trek, but the Sherpas see very little of that money. Deadly force: The avalanche that killed at least thirteen Sherpas is pictured as it barrels down Mount Everest . Since the deadly avalanche on Friday, pictured, expedition teams have declared a week of mourning . Documentation: A Nepal government report names the victims of the tragedy and reveals they were on an 'NBC Everest Expedition' The Nepalese ministry of tourism gets a much larger cut, and now the Sherpas have demanded that a portion of the visa fees be set aside for a relief fund. The government has issued 334 permits this season, up from 328 last year and it is unclear what exactly will happen to them as a result of the walk out. After the avalanche, the government quickly said it would pay the families of each Sherpa who died 40,000 rupees, or about $415. The Sherpas said they deserved far more - including more insurance money, more financial aid for the victims' families and new regulations that would ensure climbers' rights. Rescue . mission: Nepalese mountain rescue workers pictured lifting an injured . climber shortly after the avalanche on Mount Everest at around 6.30am on . Friday . Survivor: Dawa Tashi Sherpa, pictured, is one of several guides who were rescued from the mountain . On Tuesday, the government's offer was modified to include a relief fund to help Sherpas injured in mountaineering accidents and the families of those killed, and to pay for rescue during accidents on the mountain. The government said it would stock the fund annually with 5 per cent of its earnings from Everest climbing fees - well below the 30 percent the Sherpas are demanding. Nepal earns some $3.5million annually in Everest climbing fees. The insurance payout for those killed on the mountain will also be doubled to $15,620 (2 million rupees), the Ministry of Tourism said - far short of the Sherpas' demand for $20,800.","Five of the 16 Sherpas who were killed were on the mountain working as part of the crew prepping for a Discovery Channel live jump special .

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . NBC has added Johnny Weir and Tara . Lipinski to its Kentucky Derby line up as fashion correspondents after . their star turn as figure skating commentators at the Sochi Olympic . Games. The two former . figure skaters, who earned the Olympic bronze medal in 2008 and the . Olympic gold in 1998 respectively, made a name for themselves by wearing . over-the-top outfits throughout the Russian winter games in February. Their . keen fashion eyes will be in full force next Saturday at the storied . horse race where attendees try to out do one another on their hat . selections. Foray into fashion: Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski (seen together at the Oscars in March) made a splash for their sartorial choices while working as figure skating commentators at the Sochi Games . Trying different styles: Lipinski and Weir made their fashion choices part of their broadcasts in Sochi (left) and since returning to the U.S. to their renewed celebrity (right) Their involvement also shows how the network's coverage now reflects one of the most female-friendly televised sporting events of the year. The image of cigar-chomping race fans no longer applies to horse racing's signature event. Slightly more than half of NBC's Derby viewers last year were women attracted to the party, the Nielsen ratings company said. No other major TV sports event, with the exception of the Olympics, is so weighted toward female viewers, NBC said. 'It's not just a two-minute race,' said Rob Hyland, coordinating producer for the NBC Sports Group. Bling: The duo will be focusing their attention on the fashions being worn by celebrities at the Derby as opposed to the costumes on the ice like they did in Sochi . 'Of course, the two-minute race is extremely important, but our job is to capture the venue and the day — it's a huge celebration — as creatively and poignantly as possible.' Hyland produced NBC's ice skating coverage in Sochi and saw firsthand how the rookie analyst team of Weir and Lipinski captured attention, primarily for their sense of style. Their stars rising, the team was added to Access Hollywood's coverage of the Academy Awards, and now NBC's coverage of the Derby, scheduled May 3 from Churchill Downs in Kentucky. 'We've always loved loud fashion and sort of bonded over it,' Lipinski said. 'The whole Olympics experience was a bit of a surprise. We came in and were focused on doing a good job as rookies. But we're young and we like to have fun. The fashion was specifically for us every day and it was like, “Oh, people are watching. This is fun.”’ Particularly for Weir; fans anticipated his wardrobe choices. Continuing their collaboration post-Olympics was a natural, Weir said, since they both follow fashion trends and designers closely as consumers. Appealing to audiences: More than half of the television audience of the Kentucky Derby were women so NBC's decision to enlist Weir and Lipinski shows them catering to the viewer's interest in fashion . 'We've grown up as entertainers, and going out the door, what you're wearing is often the loudest statement you can make,' Weir said. They're also no strangers to the horse racing world. Lipinski rode horses when she was younger and Weir was more active, competing in equestrian events before he focused on figure skating. Weir said he attended the 2010 Kentucky Derby as a fan, earning money by betting on the winning horse. He also wore a giant, fur-covered sombrero, he said, raising anticipation for his outfit next week. 'I'm not such a sports guy, aside from what people may think,' he said. 'I love figure skating, I love my job, but aside from that, I prefer to run in meadows and chase butterflies.' Weir’s time back from Russia has been turbulent as he and his husband have been rotating back and forth between divorce and reconciliation after the skater’s lawyer husband released a photo showing that Weir bit and hit him during a violent outburst. Most recently, Weir and his estranged husband Victor Voronov announced they were remaining apart just hours after deciding to give things another ago. It's over...again: Victor Voronov and Johnny Weir (pictured at NY Fashion Week in 2012) called off their reconciliation last week just hours after the estranged couple said they were getting back together . As part of his conditions for reconciliation, Weir reportedly issued a five-page document including a list of no-no's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation and bi-yearly STD tests from both parties. The latest reports have the couple remaining apart. The subject matter of the storied race will undoubtedly remain more staid and civil, however. NBC's coverage is preceded by four hours on the NBC Sports cable network. The first hour of NBC's three-hour Derby coverage will be entertainment-focused, including red carpet arrivals coverage. NBC is also distributing to its local affiliates stories offering tips on how to throw Kentucky Derby parties, and how to mix the event's signature drinks. The Derby coverage will also mark the NBC debut of Josh Elliott, who came to the network from ABC's 'Good Morning America.' He will be doing a series of taped pieces that are part of the coverage, along with celebrity interviews, Hyland said. NBC's Derby telecast in 2013 was seen by 16.2 million viewers — 51 per cent of them women — and was the second most-watched Derby in 25 years.","Figure skaters Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski will comment on the big hats and outlandish fashion at the horse race next Saturday .

"By . Wills Robinson . Probe: Ian Ousey, the former Chief Financial Officer of FreemantleMedia is said to have claimed around £850,000 from the company over 17 years . A former executive of the company behind The X Factor and American Idol could face fraud allegations over £850,000 he claimed while in the senior role. Ian Ousey, the ex-chief financial officer of FremantleMedia, is said to have claimed extra money from the company over 17 years by submitting false invoices and payment authorisations. The expenses allegedly include £237,000 to a holiday home developer in Portugal and £477,000 to cover credit card, cars, mobile phone and courier payments. The company, who also produce Take Me Out and Grand Designs, are thought to have handed a complaint to the Metropolitan Police. Mr Ousey, who left the company in March, paid back the . sum as part of a £1.4million legal settlement last year, but he could still face prosecution. His assets were frozen after Fremantle obtained a court order following his departure, but it ended when the agreement was reached in December. He is said to have gone to Holborn police station in Central London in January, after Fremantle reported the allegations, but has not been arrested or charged. Rodney Hylton-Potts, Mr Ousey's lawyer, told The Times his client was 'desperately sorry', even though he claims not all of the money was accepted wrongfully. 'He admits wrongfully receiving £237,000 as part of a larger sum yet to be determined. He was very happy to be able to make full repayment, with interest, legal and investigative charges.' Mr Hylton-Potts, was struck off the solicitors' register and jailed for fraud in the 1990s. Worldwide business: Freemantle Media produce programmes such as the X Factor .

A daughter has been charged with cruelty to her elderly mother after the 87-year-old developed a bed sore down to the bone. Officers arrested Tara Dawn Smith, of Cobb County, Georgia, after a concerned relative contacted police to report suspected neglect. An arrest warrant said 'packed dirt' was visible on the elderly woman's body and the house smelled of human waste. The warrant, obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said: 'There was a trail of feces from the bed to the bathroom. 'The feces was packed into the fibers of the carpet and the entire home smelled of feces.' It stated the woman had not seen a doctor for a number of years and had lost 40 pounds since December. The warrant also said the elderly woman had fingernails and toenails which measured several inches and had 'dirt caked underneath,' according to The Marietta Daily Journal. It also said she had two bed sores on her left hip, 'one of which was infected down to the bone.' Police allege Smith did not bathe or groom her mother for months, forcing her to 'lay in bed while her diaper was soiled'. She was charged with cruelty to a person 65 years of age or older and was held in Cobb County jail last week before posting a $7,500 bond.

"By . Ashley Collman . A 48-year-old Montana man arrested for running a child-pornography ring told the FBI that the online community was his family and all he had in the world. Paul Wencewicz started the 'Kingdom of Future Dreams' in 2009 from his home in smalltown Polson, Montana after another site he belonged to got shut down. Over the course of two and a half years, members in the online community shared over 300,000 lewd images of children - mostly underage girls. Ringleader: Polson, Montana resident Paul Wencewicz started a child pornography website in 2009 and now faces more than 20 years in prison. Above, his last known address in Polson according to public records . About 40 men were members of the site, and were organized into a hierarchy with Wencewicz at the top and new members branded 'castle dwellers' on the bottom, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. Conspirator: Jonathan Godson of the Isle of Jersey took down the Kingdom of Future Dreams after receiving a tip from Wencewicz. But the Channel Islands resident kept a backup of the site at his home and it was confiscated about two weeks later . Castle dwellers were vetted before they were allowed to work their way up the hierarchy to gain access to the most disturbing images on the site. One of the most active members in the community was 57-year-old postal worker Steve Humiston, who Wencewicz told authorities participated for the attention. The Tacoma, Washington resident and Air Force veteran joined the site in November 2009 and posted more than 4,500 times before the site was shut down. He posted so much that Wencewicz confronted him, telling him to scale back for fear of attracting too much attention. Apparently Humiston just wanted to be appreciated for all of his hard work tracking down 'rare collections'. 'I’ve come to the realization in the past that I do this for myself and for the few that may appreciate it,' Wencewicz said in a note to Humiston. 'You are very hard to keep up with sometimes, and that ain’t a bad thing!' Wencewicz continued. 'I will say that you don’t get NEAR enough credit to all the hard work you do.' But all of that came crashing down on March 14, 2012 when the FBI raided Wencewicz's beer bottle strewn home in Polson. After his arrest, Wencewiz told authorities that he 'felt like his entire family was taken away when the bulletin board was shut down' and that the Kingdom was all he had. Initially Wencewicz handed over the site to the authorities, but soon after posted on a music board warning another site operator - Richard Godson - that he had been caught. 'Castle dwellers': Thanks to Godson's back-up of the site, federal authorities were able to bring 15 of the some 40 members to justice. Above, Ian Nosek (left) and Jeffrey Wooley (right), two of the men caught in the ring . Wencewicz's 'family': Above, Joseph Purificato - yet another one of the men involved in the website .

"By . Lydia Warren . Sex offender: Jeffrey Epstein served 13 months in prison in 2007 for relations with teen girls . Victims of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have won the right to see the negotiations that led to an apparently lenient plea deal that saw him avoid federal prosecution. An appeals court ruled that the two victims, known only as Jane Doe 1 and 2, can soon view the documents - as their attorneys ask whether Epstein's wealth and connections affected his sentence. Epstein, 61, had counted numerous celebrities, . politicians and socialites as friends, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Donald Trump and Naomi Campbell. The financier was first arrested in 2005, after the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told Florida police that he'd paid the girl $200 for an 'erotic massage'. An FBI investigation led to Epstein being accused of keeping a harem of women - many of them teenagers - at his luxury homes in New York and Palm Beach, and on a private Caribbean island. By 2008, the FBI believed it had identified at least 20 victims who might level sexual allegations against the financier in court. But Epstein struck a plea deal with prosecutors, which saw him plead guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. The rest of the case was dropped. He received an 18-month jail sentence, of which 13 were spent behind bars, and was put on Floridaâ€™s sex offenders register. He escaped prosecution on more serious pedophilia charges, which might have seen him jailed for life. Scene: He allegedly paid underage girls for 'erotic massages' at his private Caribbean island, Little St James . But it also also resulted in civil . suits being filed against Epstein, who reportedly settled claims from about two dozen young women, some as young as 14, who he allegedly paid for massages. The latest ruling in the case was issued on Friday and orders federal authorities to disclose the correspondence that took place between Epstein's attorneys and federal prosecutors when they were negotiating the 2007 agreement, the Sun Sentinel reported. 'We're trying to figure out if Epstein used his political connections and great wealth to secure this kind of arrangement, that was unheard of, frankly, if you look at these charges,' said attorney Paul Cassell. Court filings say that when federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with Epstein in September 2007, the victims weren't told. 'Not only did the United States neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement with Epstein, it also failed to notify them of its existence for at least nine months,' Circuit Judge William H. Pryor wrote in the decision. Friends: Among his good friends were Bill Clinton (pictured), his wife Hillary, Donald Trump and Naomi Campbell . Now the two victims are hoping that the documents will shed light on the deal, and their attorney hopes that the deal will be invalidated and that Epstein will face a new prosecution. They have yet to see the documents, however. The attorneys were initially told they would receive them on Monday, but they were not yet ready to be viewed. One of Epstein's attorney's, Martin Weinberg, insisted that the plea agreement was 'reached in good faith' and that there was nothing improper about the dealings. He said he will ask the appeal court to review their decision.","Jeffrey Epstein was accused of paying underage girls - some as young as 14 - for 'erotic massages' at his Florida home and Caribbean island .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A Boy Scout troop has been closed down after refusing to sack their openly gay Scout Master Geoff McGrath . The Boy Scouts of America have shut down a Seattle troop after they refused to sack their openly gay scout master. Eagle Scout Geoff McGrath, 49, was invited to help set up Troop 98 at an inclusive Methodist church in Seattle last year, but was sacked at the start of the month by BSA officials after they found out he was gay. However, the church's pastor and members of the troop refused to remove Mr McGrath and now the BSA have revoked the group's charters, a move that has left Mr McGrath 'stunned.' He said: 'I'm stunned and disappointed to hear the news. Pastor Corsaro specifically sought out someone with my Scouting background to help get these units off the ground, and her church is now being told to violate their religious convictions. It's unconscionable and irreverent.' Despite the BSA's move, McGrath said that the church will continue to hold meetings for the 15 cubs and scouts who attend, even if they can't use the scouting name. He added: 'It's one of the best things I do. One of the things that really makes my week is spending time with these kids.' 'Nobody likes to be rejected from the company of people that you have valued. 'I've had to move on and accept that BSA, both national and regional, is not ready to be properly fully inclusive for all youth and adult leadership.' The 49-year-old software developer says the decision has left him 'stunned' and vowed he will continue holding meetings without using the Boy Scout name . Mr McGarth was invited to set up Troop 98 in Seattle last year by the pastor of an inclusive Methodist church and says he was open about his sexuality with both members and officials . Zach Wahls, executive director of Scouts for Equality: 'The Boy Scouts’ decisions only serve to hurt a group of boys who need the values and leadership of someone like Scoutmaster McGrath. 'Unfortunately, the BSA’s decision calls into question its commitment to leadership and values by perpetuating an outmoded policy rooted in fear and discrimination. 'History will show that today’s announcement is a self-inflicted wound.' In January the BSA voted to allow gay youths into the scouts for the first time, but their rules still do not allow gay adults to run the troops. The organisation said they had been left with 'no choice' but to sack Mr McGrath after he discussed his sexuality while being profiled by NBC, and said it was 'saddened' by the latest developments. Rev. Monica Corsaro of Rainier Beach United Methodist church said it was important the the church remained open and inclusive to all, adding that she has obtained legal counsel. Before his sacking, McGrath believed he was the only openly-gay troop leader in the country. At the time McGarth said: 'It’s extremely disappointing to not be fully supported and defended in my membership. 'They . are complaining that the problem is a distraction to Scouting and they . don’t seem to understand that the distraction is self-inflicted.' McGrath . started leading Troop 98 last fall after he was asked by Reverand . Monica Corsaro of Rainier Beach United Methodist Church. No gay leaders: The Boy Scouts of America voted to allow gay youth into their ranks starting this year but that rule does not pertain to adult leaders. Above, McGrath addresses his troop at a parade . McGrath agreed to start the troop when asked by the reverend at his inclusive Methodist church. He attends the Rainier Beach United Methodist Church with his husband of more than 20 years (pictured together above) Rev . Corsaro wanted to start an inclusive troop for local youth, and reached . out to McGrath who attends the church with his husband of 20 years. McGrath was hesitant to start the group at first because he had his own troubled history with the BSA. When . he was 22-years-old, McGrath was offered the position of Assistant . Scoutmaster but that job was rescinded once his troop leaders figured . out he was gay. The troop was also sponsored by his Mormon church, and he was additionally excommunicated from the religion. He agreed to start the program, in part inspired by the work of his straight twin-brother Dave who has publicly championed for gays to be admitted into to the scouts. 'If you don’t participate, you're not part of the conversation,' McGrath, a software engineer, said.  'Yelling from the outside is not conversing. So we're on the inside doing good work. Talking about the gay and lesbian issue is not the biggest part of what we do—it's the smallest part.' But McGrath makes clear that his decision to lead the troop was not part of a publicity stunt, but because he genuinely wanted to help out the local kids. And his troop at Rainier Beach, including their parents, thank him for his work. 'Anyone who is willing to step forward and provide an opportunity for our youth should be supported, and Geoff has done an excellent job,' said Denise Mimura, whose son, 14-year-old son Jonathan is in the troop. 'If anyone has an issue with this, then where are they?' Won't stop: McGrath says he will continue to lead the troop until relieved by his church's reverend . Proud to be a Scoutmaster: McGrath waves a pride flag during an outing with his troop . The troop currently consists of all . straight boys, but gay high-schooler Koyle Kendrick, 17, says he plans . to join the troops after the end of the school year. Kendrick left another troop last year because it didn't feel gay-friendly. 'I'll . be more comfortable going back into Scouting and being in an inclusive . troop,' he said, adding that McGrath will 'understand where I'm coming . from.' McGrath certainly understands Kendrick's perspective, having experienced a similar isolation growing up and feeling like he was the only gay person around. 'One of the things that’s different now with our troop from when I was a youth in the Scouts, was there were no identifiable gay or lesbian adults,' McGrath said. For his part, McGrath hopes that 'cooler minds will prevail' and he will be allowed to continue as Scoutmaster. 'That's what I believe. If it doesn't happen today, that will be disappointing. But it doesn't mean it won't ever happen,' he said.","Geoff McGrath was invited to start Troop 98 in Seattle last year .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Minnesota air stewardess has finally welcomed home her three adopted daughters seven years after she first met the girls in a Guatemalan orphanage. Suann Hibbs met her daughters in 2008, but when the Guatemalan government cut back on foreign adoptions the family were left in legal limbo. It took seven years, 30 trips abroad and a lot of help from Senator Amy Klobuchar before officials finally allowed Ms Hibbs to take the three sisters home last week. Scroll down for video . Mother's love: Suann Hibbs hugs one of her three adopted daughters . It is a dream come true for Ms Hibbs who had been keen to become a mother for years. 'I still feel like this is so surreal. I . mean, I just have to pinch myself. When they come in, in the morning . and crawl in bed with me. I just have goose bumps thinking about it,' she told CBS News. When she first met the children, twins Savanna and Sophia were one-year-olds and their sister Sydney was a newborn. 'I just fell in love with them as soon as I saw them. I just thought morally, I just can't let them go,' Ms Hibbs, who is not married and found the girls through a church adoption group, said. The adoption agency Ms Hibbs had used estimated that within six to nine months the paperwork would be completed and the girls would be with her in Edina, Minneapolis. But the process was massively delayed as developing countries including Guatemala started to restrict foreign adoptions while they tackled problems with fraud and child trafficking. Family: Twins Savanna and Sophia were a year old and their little sister Sydney was a newborn when Suann first met them . Growing up: By the time the sisters finally arrived at their new home the twins were 8 and Sydney was 7 . In November 2007, her adoption case was put on hold during a country-wide investigation, and it looked as though she may lose her children. While the case was being slowly processed the three sisters were moved between several orphanages and foster homes. The constant moving made it hard for Ms Hibbs to keep track of them, and also meant that the girls have not had any formal education. 'They needed a permanent home,' Ms Klobuchar, who met Guatemalan officials on Ms Hibbs' behalf, said. Settling in: After living in several orphanages the sisters finally have a permanent place to call home . 'It took a little time, but . they got to the right place and allowed these children to be adopted.' She added: 'A lot of times when you personally meet . with the ambassador like I did and you tell the story of these three . little girls and this mother who has been trying for seven years, they . listen.' Although the girls, now aged eight and seven, speak only a little English, they are settling into their new home well. They will start school in a couple of weeks and attend summer classes to help them catch up with their new classmates.","Suann Hibbs was left in legal limbo after Guatemala put hold on foreign adoptions .

"By . Associated Press . Authorities say a 47-year-old New York man who had been for four years and fled to Africa after being charged in 2010 with raping a child in western New York, has been captured in Britain. The Onondaga County sheriff's office says Tobias Bowen has been spending his time leading one of Liberia's public hospitals and was taken into custody after getting off a plane Saturday at a London airport. Officials say Bowen was charged with rape and criminal sex act in March 2010, when he lived in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool. Caught! Tobias Bowen, 47, had been on the run since 2010 and is now back in custody after authorities caught up to him in a London airport on Saturday . After his $10,000 bail was posted, Bowen fled to his native Liberia, where he was administrator of a government hospital. After Bowen disappeared, sheriff's detectives assigned to the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force whereupon investigators were able to track his travels to Liberia and the United Kingdom.

"By . John Hall . Funds: Napster co-founder Sean Parker is said to be looking for 'credible' political candidates to bankroll . Technology billionaire Sean Parker has turned his attention to politics and plans to donate vast sums of money to both the Republicans and Democrats, it has been claimed. The Napster co-founder and former Facebook president, 34, is understood to have hired a team of respected political advisers to help him select 'credible' candidates to bankroll on both sides of U.S. political divide. Parker - who was played by Justin Timberlake in the film The Social Network - is a long-term Democrat donor, but is said to want to develop a less party-based approach as his political influence increases. According to a report in Politico, Parker has met with several senior political figures in recent months - including Kentucky Senator and 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul, and the Democrat New York Mayor Bill De Blasio. Later this week he and other tech entrepreneurs will be co-hosting a fundraiser for California's Democrat Attorney General Kamala Harris. Although Parker declined to comment on claims he is moving further into the political arena, Politico said they understood he has also assembled a strong team of advisers to help shape his move into the world of politics. This reportedly includes appointing Chris Garland - the former chief of staff to California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom as his political director, and taking Addisu Demissie on as an adviser. Demissie previously managed the 2013 election campaign for New Jersey's Democrat Senator Cory Brooker, and now runs the West Coast office of The Messina Group - the political consultation business founded by Jim Messina - Barack Obama's 2012 presidential election campaign manager. Parker's idea to donate to both sides is believed to stem from a desire to increase voter engagement by modernising U.S. politics in general. He is said to want to ease bitter divisions that lead to voting blocks and established politicians habitually opposing their rivals, regardless of the issue at hand. Ambition: Sean Parker is said to have met with several political figures recently - including Kentucky Senator and 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul (left) and New York's Democrat Mayor Bill De Blasio (right) Big name: Sean Parker was famously played by Justin Timberlake (left) in the Oscar-winning film The Social Network. Jesse Eisenberg (right) played Mark Zuckerberg in the movie . Parker's move into politics follows that of Mark Zuckerberg - the multi-billionaire Facebook founder who last year hosted fundraisers for New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie, and the state's aforementioned Democrat Senator Cory Brooker. In April last year Zuckerberg co-founded FWD.us - a lobbying group calling for immigration reform, an overhaul of the U.S. education system, and increased investment in the technology sector. Company: Sean Parker's move towards politics follows that of Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) Parker's personal wealth is estimated to be around $2billion thanks to his early involvement in several highly successful tech businesses. In 1999, at the age of 20, he co-founded Napster - the pioneering file-sharing service that has been credited with revolutionising the music industry and paving the way for the likes of iTunes and Spotify. Although a court order shut the original Napster down in July 2001, the millions of users it acquired in its two year lifespan has led to claims it could be considered the fastest growing business of all time. After Napster Parker founded Plaxo - an early social network that would eventually influence the likes of LinkedIn and Facebook. Two years after founding Plaxo, Parker was ousted by the company’s financiers, Sequoia Capital and Ram Shriram, in an exit that reportedly led to the investors hiring private investigators to follow him. In 2004 he stumbled upon a website called The Facebook via a student friend, which led to him meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, overseeing the website's development as Facebook, and eventually becoming the company's first president. Parker has also been involved as either an investor or adviser in technology companies including Spotify, Votizen, AirTime and Willcall.","Napster co-founder, 34, reportedly plans to help fund political candidates .

"By . Lydia Warren . When their two-year-old son was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor, Devon and Valerie Morse didn't think it could get much worse. But just weeks later, Devon, who is a Marine, also began feeling sick and doctors revealed the unthinkable: that he, too, had a brain tumor. Now the family, who live at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, are trying to come to terms with the news as they attend medical appointments across the state. Fighting together: Devon Morse is pictured with his two-year-old son; both have a brain tumor . 'If it were to come worse to worse for me, I would rather have myself go than my son,' Devon told WCTI12. 'I would rather him see that life that he deserves.' The family's battle began in March when David began vomiting, suffering from nosebleeds and struggling with his balance. They took him to hospital, where he underwent a brain scan. Doctors revealed that the toddler had a tumor the size of a tangerine in his brain - and that it was malignant. 'I stopped and I cried and I cried,' Valerie told WCTI. 'And my husband had to walk out of the room, just to take a breather real quick. Fight: David was diagnosed with brain cancer in March and is now undergoing chemotherapy . Still smiling: The family say they have been touched by donations and kindness from the local community . 'My son looked up at me, and said, ""What's wrong, mommy?"" And I just lost it.' David underwent surgery and doctors were able to remove most of the tumor. He is now undergoing chemotherapy. But then in April, Devon began suffering numbness in his body and doctors revealed that he also had a tumor in his head. His was much smaller than his son's, and doctors deduced that it was more dangerous to try to remove it, so they left it and are treating him with medication instead. Devon continues to undergo treatment, as well as regular hospital visits. Hopeful: They are pictured with mom Valerie, who said she has found the diagnoses heartbreaking . The community has rallied around the young family, and the local fire and police stations have been collecting donations and toys for the Morses, who are feeling the financial strains. On the family's Facebook page, they expressed their thanks to Cherry Point police for their kindness. 'Today you let David play in the squad car, and to see our baby boy laugh and smile like that made us cry inside... to know that there are people out there that care for and about him, and that do everything they can to keep him happy and smiling,' they wrote. If you wish to donate to the family or follow their story, visit their gofundme page or their page on Facebook.","David Morse was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor in March .

"By . Tara Brady . Hundreds of sheep have been released around Carson City in Nevada to eat vegetation in a bid to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires this summer. The sheep have become a familiar sight in the capital since 2006 - two years after the Waterfall Fire spread across land around Carson City destroying 17 homes and damaging 14 others. The 2004 fire also damaged or destroyed three commercial buildings, 51 vehicles and 32 out buildings.

"By . Tara Brady . A bust to commemorate the wife of a former Romanian president in her hometown of Targu-Jiu is at the centre of a row after the Ministry of Culture demanded it be reworked because the breasts are too large. Gorj County Council paid 5,000 euros (£4,110) for the work but then asked local artist Paul Popescu to rework it to make her breasts smaller after the Ministry had complained. The sculpture showed Arethia Tatarescu who was born in the city of Targu-Jiu in 1889 and after a short while studying art in Belgium, moved back to Romania where she met and married the man who was to become prime minister, Gheorghe Tatarescu. A bust to commemorate the wife of a former Romanian president in her hometown of Targu-Jiu is at the centre of a row after the Ministry of Culture demanded it be reworked because the breasts are too large . She was famous for introducing the idea of mass weddings into Europe and in the 1930s organised huge wedding ceremonies when up to 1,500 couples got married at the same time. However, after the statue was unveiled in a local park it failed to find favour with Radu Boroianu, a deputy minister in the Romanian Ministry of Culture and himself a keen collector of modern art, who called for it to be taken down. Pompiliu Ciolacu, head of the council's Culture Department, said: 'Artistically it's exaggerated, and that means that aesthetically it doesn't resemble the real image of the person.' They have ordered that the sculpture be taken down and reworked to reduce the size of the breasts. That idea was rejected by artist Popescu who is refusing to make the breasts smaller. Storm: Gorj artist Paul Popescu has been asked to rework the bust to make her breasts smaller . Support: Arethia Tatarescu was born in the city of Targu-Jiu in 1889 and went on to marry Gheorghe Tatarescu . He said: 'It's a totally arbitrary reason and at the end of the day in artwork breast size is a matter of taste. 'We don't all have to like the same type of women, the same way that not every woman likes the same type of man. 'Minister Boroianu personally finds it too sexy because the breasts are too large. I don't think that the breasts are too small, and I don't think that they are too large. I think they are just right.' Popescu is currently working on building the highest statue in Europe of the Egyptian goddess Isis. He is working on it for Nicolae Sofianu, the richest man in Targu-Jiu, and said so far the issue of breast size not been a problem on his new project.","Gorj County Council paid 5,000 euros (£4,110) for the work .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . The Vogue writer whose Kate Upton profile was knocked off its intended cover story spot in favor of the now infamous Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover, has spoken out. According to the New York Post, Jonathan Van Meter took to his Facebook page to smugly post a review of the controversial Vogue issue, in which his story is declared 'the jewel,' of the April edition. 'After getting bumped from the cover of April Vogue for Kimye and finding out only once it hit newsstands, I think I have earned the right to post this little bit of frothy praise,' Mr Van Meter wrote, making a dig at the fact that he was the last to know of the last minute change of cover spot. Scroll down for video . Dig: Jonathan Van Meter, who penned the Kate Upton profile for Vogue's April edition and lost the coveted cover spot to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (pictured), took to his Facebook page to vent his frustrations . The review, written for Magazine Review's blog, states: 'While the article that goes with the [Kardashian West] cover story is entertaining, the jewel of this [issue] is undoubtedly ‘Follow Me’ by Jonathan Van Meter, photographed by Mario Testino.' Mr Van Meter, who has previously profiled giants including Oprah Winfrey, Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga for Vogue, concluded frankly with: 'So there.' He later removed the post and deleted his Facebook account this morning. And the Kardashian West cover didn't only come as a surprise to Mr Van Meter; it stunned legions of avid Vogue readers too, many of whom took to the publication's website to vent their disapproval. 'I have . always purchased Vogue, ever since I was a teenager and I felt like I . could always rely on Vogue to inspire me and educate on a number of . levels,' wrote one woman. Ditched: Mr Van Meter's story on supermodel Kate Upton (pictured in Los Angeles last week) ran alongside a photo spread shot by Mario Testino which was originally reserved for the cover . 'I don’t buy tabloids for a reason because I don’t look up to or find inspiration in people with no talent and even less morals. Wow, RIP Vogue. The last bastion of style has fallen today. I’ll miss you.' But Anna Wintour, the magazine's editor-in-chief, defended her choice and also put an end to rumors that West had been 'begging' her to put Kardashian on the cover of Vogue. She wrote in her Editor's Letter: 'You may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue’s cover. He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.' Mr Van Meter's profile on 21-year-old supermodel Kate Upton, which lost the cover story battle, came with an array of tastefully shot photos of the blonde with the famous curves in a series of slim fitting gowns. Smiling all the way to the bank: Anna Wintour's . (left) controversial cover is flying off the newsstands, despite Mr Van . Meter's (right) thinly veiled opinion that his Kate Upton story should . have taken the cover spot . In it, Ms Upton, who launched into fame thanks to her buxom 2013 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition cover - explains that while she 'likes being sexy', she is cautious in how she portrays herself to the world. 'I definitely have limits,' she says.'There's a line between becoming, you know, a little cheap and cheesy versus being sexy. And I try to be very careful of that line.' As for Ms Wintour's shock decision to idolize the Kardashian West couple on her cover, it seems her choice is actually proving to be a wise one, as the issue is flying off newsstands. According to the New York Post, the controversial April issue is set to sell around 400,000 copies. Comparatively, Beyonce's cover sold more than 355,000 copies and Michelle Obama's cover sold nearly 300,000.","Jonathan Van Meter took to Facebook claiming he didn't even know his cover had been ditched until it hit newsstands .

Last cavemen and women of Dongshan are preparing to move to the big city two centuries after their ancestors made the caves their home . Time to move on: Tan Wenyan, 82, and his wife have decided to move after spending their whole life living in a cave in China . The couple have two sons and four daughters. All of the children except the younger son have settled down in towns. The children tried to persuade their parents to live in town but the couple declined until recently when they decided they do not see their children enough. The local authority said it may consider a plan to turn the cave dwellings into a museum when the old couple die, or move out.","The cave village is called Kahongdong, in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region .
Previous residents have moved to subsidised housing nearer to where they work .
Nine families once lived in the ten flats carved from the rock in the cave that is 50 metres deep and 60 metres high .

However, they miss their children and are now planning to join them in the big city ."
"By . Ashley Collman . The 12-year-old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear. Charlotte Ponce of Spring Lake, Michigan was just three-months-old in 2002 when her young parents left her at home with the pet and she lost her right ear, nose and part of her lip in an attack. Two years ago, Doctor Kongrit Chaiyasate repaired little Charlotte's nose and now he's focusing on giving her a new ear. Going home: Charlotte Ponce, 12, of Spring Lake, Michigan was released from the hospital Monday after undergoing a seven-hour surgery to implant cartilage into her arm . Revolutionary surgery: The lung cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery . Growing: The cartilage will continue to grow in her arm for the next few months before doctors will attach it to her ear. Pictured above on Monday . One last surgery: Little Charlotte will return to the hospital in June for her surgery, which will hopefully be her last. Pictured above on Monday . 'The raccoon pretty much ate the right side of her face, all the way back to the ear,' Charlotteâ€™s adoptive mom Sharon Ponce told ABCNews.com. 'Now, all she wants is to wear two earrings.' That dream of pierced ears came closer to reality on April 15, when she underwent a seven-hour surgery to embed lung cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into her arm where it will continue to grow until June. That's when Charlotte will go under the knife for hopefully the last time as Dr Chaiyaste attaches the cartilage to her ear. Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose, ear and lips. Pictured above just before she underwent the surgery on April 15 . But this last procedure will be the most complex yet, as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before.[ . Dr Chaiyasate admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right, so he has been practicing on a potato. Dr Chaiyasate, of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, told WBIV: . 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - . what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl . He said he could not guarantee success, but would try his best. Charlotte's adopted mother Sharon Ponce said people from as far as Britain and Australia had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been. She was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet. The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin. They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15 months old, and they and their friends raised more than $10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital. Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care. Although ears have been made out of ribs before, the method of 'growing' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare. Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done . Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose . Intact: Charlotte as a baby with her brother Marshall before she was attacked in late 2002 . Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall . It has to be done because Charlotte's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head. Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected.","Charlotte Ponce from Spring Lake, Michigan, left disfigured by 2002 attack .
On April 15, she underwent radical surgery to implant lung cartilage in her arm where it will grow until it can be attached to her ear .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Sutton Foster, the two-time Tony-winning darling of New York's Broadway, has revealed what it's like to completely shed her make-up for her latest starring role. The 39-year-old Michigan-native, who plays the title character in Broadway's new production of Violet, spoke to ELLE.com about her passion for exposing issues related to 'vanity' and 'insecurity'. 'I am wearing nothing onstage. It’s a little scary, but it’s also kind of cool and exposing,' she admits. Natural beauty: Sutton Foster, 39, opens up about hitting the stage make-up free for her new role in Broadway's production of Violet, claiming it's 'scary' but also 'kind of cool' The musical production, which has been met with early critical acclaim, is set in 1964's rural American South and follows Violet; a character with a facial deformity who is on a journey to love herself 'scars and all', says Ms Foster. She explains that she took on the 'challenging' role because she instantly connected with it, a far cry from the usual 'glamorous or over-the-top' parts she is used to playing. The natural beauty, who has been described as 'the Jennifer Garner of Broadway,' also spoke about her new TV show, Younger, in which she plays an 'older' single mom who is struggling to find employment, and so pretends to be 26 and subsequently lands a job. Voila! The Broadway veteran, who will also star in Sex and the City creator Darren Star's new TV series, Younger, says she has a passion for exposing issues related to 'vanity' and 'insecurity' Ms Foster, recently engaged to screenwriter Ted Griffin and without children in real life, says she is over the moon to be working with legendary Sex and the City wardrobe consultant Patricia Field, whom she admits she is 'obsessed with'. She describes how the 'Ah-mazing' Ms Field came up with a wardrobe for her character that was so 'crazy-awesome and ridiculous', it lead her to question whether 26-year-olds really wore these clothes. Speaking of growing old gracefully, Ms Foster says: 'The thing is, I mean, I’ve been working for so long, everyone knows how old I am. And I’m not interested in hiding it, you know?' Before and after: Ms Foster, pictured at the Roundabout Theatre's Spring Gala in March (left) and bare-faced in her starring role for the company's production of Violet (right) But she later jokes: 'I just have to keep getting facials… and slowly I can sneak in lots of Botox! Do you think they’ll notice on camera if I just can’t move my face anymore?' The Broadway veteran gushed about co-star Hilary Duff, labeling the ex-Disney starlet as 'the most mature' 26-year-old she had ever met, and recalling the time during filming when her dog died, and Ms Duff presented her with an iPhone case covered in photos of the passed-pooch. As for her off-camera, off-stage beauty regime, Ms Foster says it's decidedly scant. Glamorous lead: Ms Foster, who plays an 'older' single mom in Younger, jokes about sneaking in 'lots of Botox' to regain her youthful appearance . 'I’m lucky if I run a hairbrush through my hair. I don’t really wear makeup at all unless it’s for work,' she reveals. 'I do moisturizer and I’m a sunscreen freak, and that’s about it.' She does mention Skyn Iceland as her preferred skincare brand for sensitive skin, as well as Bobbi Brown's tinted moisturizer for its ability to 'hide things' without looking like she has make-up on. MTV-owned network TV Land has confirmed that Younger will air 12 episodes, but are yet to announce a release date. Violet will run on New York's Broadway until August 10th.","Also spoke of her glamorous part in Sex and the City creator Darren Star's new series, Younger, with Hilary Duff .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Rough state: Ice Road Truckers star Tim Zickuhr was arrested in December and pictured here after being taken to the Las Vegas police department . A star of a reality trucking show has been charged with kidnapping a Las Vegas prostitute and threatening to kill her. Tim Zickuhr now faces three felony charges after threatening and attacking a prostitute who went by the name 'Snow White'. His mugshot, which was taken in December immediately following the arrest but only released on Tuesday, shows that the 40-year-old has bruises or dirt all over the sides of his face. TMZ reports that he attacked the unidentified prostitute after accusing the woman of taking too much money out of his debit account after he gave her his ATM card to pay for an evening with her. Zickuhr joined the History Channel . show in its second season, which filmed in 2011, and was sent to drive . cargo across some of the scariest roads in Bolivia. The . show went off the air after that season and he has since returned to . the United States- and was in Las Vegas on the night of December 18 when . he had a tryst with the prostitute. TMZ . reports that the pair met that night and she claims that he gave her . his ATM card so that she could withdraw an undisclosed amount for her . payment. Charged: Tim Zickuhr was arrested for kidnapping, extortion and coercion following a December 19 incident when he attacked a prostitute in Las Vegas . He later accused her of taking too much from the account but she agreed to come back and meet him the following day to settle the dispute. As soon as she walked into his apartment on December 19, he punched her and said that he would kill her if she didn't get him the money. During the attack, he allegedly used backpack straps to tie her up and then poured cold water over her head from a bucket. She continued to deny that she took . any extra money from him, but he gave her a phone and forced her to call . someone who would be able to get him the $1,000 he accused her of . stealing. She cleverly . thought to dial a police officer friend of hers and Zickuhr is said to . have ripped the phone out of her hand and threatened him into meeting. Aggressive: Zickuhr allegedly tied the prostitute up, punched her and doused her with cold water before threatening her life . Zickuhr pushed the woman out a second-floor window as they headed to the meeting, and as soon as they arrive, the officer friend arrested Zickuhr.

"By . Chris Pleasance . This is the terrifying moment a pair of backpackers were robbed at gunpoint by two masked bandits - and caught it all on headcam. Heidi Burton and companion Dan Landsborough were riding a motorbike along a dirt road in Guatemala when they were ambushed. Two men in balaclavas jumped from bushes waving a gun and a machete and forced them to stop. Scroll down for video . A British backpacker and her Canadian companion have been robbed at gunpoint by masked men while riding a motorbike in Guatemala . The pair were ambushed as they drove along a dirt road in the country's southern state of Solola . While one bandit aimed a pistol at the couple, forcing them to stop the bike, another man jumped from bushes beside the road wielding a machete before searching them . They tore the rings from Heidi’s fingers and used the machete to hack off a bag of money, an iPod and iPhone the pair had strapped to the motorbike. Heidi, an illustrator from Cambridge, and her companion Dan, both 34, were badly shaken but unhurt in the April 10 raid on the road between Santiago Atitlan and San Pedro La Laguna in Solola. The apparently brazen daylight robbery was filmed on the headcam being worn by Dan, though the footage has not yet been verified. She said: 'When the first ""bandito"" ran out ahead of us pointing a gun, there was an initial feeling of dread. 'Then . the second man jumped out with a machete demanding money and we knew . the best thing to do was give them what they want and get out of there. 'I’d hidden my valuables well and left my backpack at the hotel out of caution. The men took the pair's wallets from their pockets, before pulling the rings from Heidi's fingers . Heidi has been travelling across South America since November last year. She met Dan Lansborough in Mexico and the pair are now biking across Guatemala . Despite their ordeal, Heidi and Dan are still in the country and are encouraging others to visit . 'I felt violated, being searched and having rings pulled off my fingers by a masked, armed robber, but the feeling of not knowing how far it will go was the worst thing.' She added: 'Dan’s motorcycle tank bag was cut off with a machete. 'It . contained a fake wallet with expired cards and a real $100 note and a . few electronic items such as an e-reader, iPhone and iPod. 'Luckily we had hidden our bank cards, money, and other valuables elsewhere. 'Apparently . this road is notorious for robberies though we hadn’t seen any reports . online for a few years and people we met had used it with no issues.' Heidi started backpacking in Central America in November and has also been chased by a pack of wild dogs. The robbers searched a bag tied to the bike containing cash, an iPhone, iPod and money, before cutting it free . Heidi and Dan say the road is known for trouble, but there hadn't been any crime reports in the last couple of years and other travellers told them it was safe . She met Dan in Mexico and teamed up with him on his motorcycle trip from Canada to Argentina. She added: 'I would still recommend people visit beautiful Guatemala and not be put off by crimes like this. 'Otherwise this has felt like a very safe country with warm and kind inhabitants.' Dan added: 'To all of the Guatemalans apologizing for your country, thank you very much. 'We . know that it is only a small percentage of Guatemalans that are bad . people, just like anywhere. We loved our time spent in Guatemala and the . Guatemalan people. We would definitely come back! 'To the . people who think this video is fake: Believe me, it's very real. I'm in . the middle of a motorcycle trip from Canada to the bottom of South . America, I don't have the time or desire to produce fake videos and put . them on the internet. 'I know there is a ton of fake stuff on the internet, so I really can't blame you for having doubts. The bandits also made off with the satnav Dan was using to plot their South American trip . Heidi said luckily the pair had hidden their real cards elsewhere, and the wallet was full of fakes . Guatemala is a country know for its high gun crime, and the gun death rate is double the global average . 'Like I said in the write up, I removed the audio because my girlfriend requested me to so the whole world wouldn't hear her, understandably, freaking out. 'The guy was trying to steal my GPS when I took off. They weren't done robbing us. 'I felt like we could get away so I pulled the bike ahead about a foot to test them, it seemed ok, so I took off. 'He didn't even notice my camera but it's a black Contour on a black helmet and blends in pretty well. Just lucky I guess...'","Heidi Burton has been travelling in South America since November .

"By . James Tozer . Wife: Ryan Giggs is pictured with Stacey - mother of his two children, whom he married in 2007 . Three years ago, his family man image was in tatters when he lost a £150,000 legal battle to hush up an affair with a glamour model. Ryan Giggs’s reputation took a further beating when his sister-in-law said she aborted his child two weeks before her marriage to his brother. The sordid claims made the father of two – and former BBC Sports Personality of the Year – a laughing-stock. Yet yesterday he capped an unlikely comeback by taking charge of one of the sporting world’s biggest names, Manchester United. His elevation to player-coach was announced following the sacking of David Moyes after ten disastrous months in the hot seat at Old Trafford. Neither Giggs, 40, nor his team-mates made any comment as they arrived at the club’s training ground yesterday. Fifty-year-old Moyes, who is set for a pay-out of up to £10million, is thought to have left by a back door to avoid the cameras. Investors gave the temporary appointment of one of the club’s most decorated players a vote of confidence, with United shares up 6 per cent on Wall Street. But users of Twitter – which Giggs had tried to sue to keep his affair with Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas a secret – were quick to make fun of the club’s announcement. They posted jokes suggesting Giggs might now target his players’ wives. As a youthful star, he dated celebrities including television presenter Dani Behr and former Hollyoaks actress Davinia Taylor. Involvement: The footballer had tried to sue Twitter users to keep his affair with Imogen Thomas (left) a secret. Natasha Giggs (right), the wife of his younger brother, revealed she had an eight-year relationship with him . Taking charge: The elevation of Giggs (left) to player-coach was announced following the sacking of David Moyes (right) after ten disastrous months in the hot seat at Old Trafford . Former interests: As a youthful star, Giggs dated celebrities including television presenter Dani Behr (left) and former Hollyoaks actress Davinia Taylor (right) The veteran had apparently settled . down after marrying Stacey in 2007, later presenting her and their two . young children to a global television audience at Old Trafford. However . his private life became one of the worst-kept secrets in British legal . history in 2011 after Miss Thomas gave a newspaper interview about their . affair. The High . Court controversially imposed a draconian gagging order barring . publication of Giggs’s name. This ruling was quickly flouted by . thousands on Twitter. He . instructed lawyers to try to silence the social networking service . before the prospect of a full-scale battle between the courts and . Parliament ended with MP John Hemmings naming him in the Commons. Giggs’s reputation suffered a further . blow two months later when the wife of his younger brother revealed they . had had an eight-year relationship. Family: Mother-of-two Natasha claims Giggs arrived on a mountain bike to give her £500 in cash to pay for the abortion of their baby before her wedding to Rhodri (pictured) On TV: Rhodri's marriage ended in divorce with Natasha (pictured) going on to appear in Celebrity Big Brother . Mother-of-two . Natasha claims Giggs arrived on a mountain bike to give her £500 in . cash to pay for the abortion of their baby before her wedding to Rhodri. The sacking of David Moyes was motivated by financial concerns as much as by football. Manchester . United pulled in revenues of £363million in 2013 but paid out a fifth . of that sum, some £73million, in interest payments on the debt of the . American owners, the Glazer family. The . club made a £146million net profit last year but has a massive . £180million wage bill that it cannot cut without losing its stars. It . therefore needs a regular flow of money from TV rights, shirt sales and . sponsorship deals and failure on the pitch puts all three at risk. Despite the public humiliation, Giggs and his wife remained together at their £6million mansion in Worsley, Greater Manchester. His . brother’s marriage ended in divorce with Natasha going on to appear in . Celebrity Big Brother. She is expecting her third child with a new . partner. Giggs’s father, Danny Wilson, later said he had wanted to give the star ‘a bloody hiding’ after learning about the claims. The 56-year-old, who split from his sons’ mother Lynne when Giggs was a teenager, branded him ‘gutless’.

"By . Leon Watson . David Cameron will today urge the English to embrace Scotland in the run-up to the crunch independence referendum this autumn.

At the same time, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will make a rare speech in England – also to mark St George's day. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) will use his annual St George's Day message to promote the union . At an event in Carlisle this evening, he will claim that England will remain 'Scotland's closest friends', even if his country votes to break up the UK in September. Both politicians are desperate to win the battle for hearts in a debate that has so far been dominated by economic claims and counter-claims. Mr Cameron will describe the UK as 'the world's greatest family of nations'. In a video message he will say: 'Let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations. Because no matter how great we are alone, we will always be greater together.' Mr Cameron's unusual decision to use his St George's Day message to discuss Scotland reflects growing nervousness in Downing Street, as a recent poll showed support for separation is now only three points behind support for the union. Mr Salmond will claim today that an independent Scotland could help to regenerate the North of England by providing a counterweight to London. First Minister Alex Salmond will claim that England will remain 'Scotland's closest friends', even if his country votes to break up the UK in September . The SNP leader will insist that people could still live in England and work in Scotland if there is a Yes vote – ignoring warnings of passport controls. 'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent,' Mr Salmond will say. 'You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours ... people would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other.' Gordon Brown yesterday made his first intervention on behalf of the pro-union Better Together campaign. In a speech in Glasgow, the former Prime Minister warned that Scotland faces a £700million pensions 'timebomb' if it votes for independence.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Energy prices in Britain will rise unless urgent action is taken to prevent Russia holding countries to ransom by cutting off gas supplies, a minister has warned. Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin could quickly force up costs for families in the UK. Energy security will be high on the agenda of a meeting of the G7 meeting in Rome early next month. Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) has claimed it is 'impossible' European countries will stop buying Russian gas, but British Energy Secretary Ed Davey urged action to improve energy security . A quarter of Europe’s gas comes from Russia, half of which passes through Ukraine which has been the focus of mounting tensions after the Crimea region was annexed by Moscow. Last week President Putin insisted it was ‘impossible’ for Europe to stop buying gas from Russia. In Britain there is growing concern about the impact of moves by Russia to use gas supplies to increase its stranglehold on the region. Ministers from Britain will join counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US to draw up a plan to speed up alternative energy supplies. The G7 talks on May 5 and 6 will examine how to increase gas storage, find alternative supplies and reopen nuclear power stations which have been closed down. Mr Davey said: ‘It can’t be right for Russia to hold individual countries to ransom. This is an issue we cannot allow to go off the table. ‘There have been at least two, if not three, occasions in recent times when Russia has sought to use its energy superpower status in quite an aggressive manner,’ he told The Times. ‘If this [the current Ukraine crisis] goes away, who is to say it won’t happen again? Putin wrote his Phd about the possibility of Russia using energy to reassert its political status.’ Tensions have mounted over Russian gas supplies to Ukraine, and the wider impact on the rest of Europe . He insisted that the EU should show ‘solidarity’  with countries at risk from Russian aggression and show ‘we mean business’. ‘If, because of Russian action, EU gas prices go up, that affects consumers and businesses here very quickly. Gas and energy goes around the world, so we are interrelated. ‘We have got to look at everything, from more diversified supplies of gas, whether it’s from the US, from shale, or helping other countries who are demanding a lot of gas now but who needn’t. Maybe Japan will turn on some of its reactors.’ Russian Vladimir Putin . However, President Putin has been dismissive of the idea that countries will reduce their demand for Russian gas. In an interview last week, he said: ‘Of course, everyone is taking care about supply diversification. There, in Europe, they talk about increasing independence from the Russian supplier... It's just like we begin to talk and take action towards independence from our consumers.' 'We sell gas in European countries which have around 30-35 percent of their gas balance covered by supplies from Russia. Can they stop buying Russian gas? In my opinion it is impossible.' EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger also opposes cutting back gas ties with Russia. In an interview with Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Oettinger conceded there is a risk of Russia cutting supplies to Ukraine, an important transit country, over unpaid bills. But he added: ‘We agree that the gas sector should not be a priority in possible economic sanctions — whether on the European or Russian side.’ He added that he is ‘against reducing or even breaking off gas relations with Russia in the coming years. However, we must pursue our diversification strategy’.","G7 countries to hold talks on how to improve energy security .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Actress Olivia Wilde has opened up about the joys of pregnancy in an interview for the May edition of Lucky magazine. The 30-year-old Tron star, whose May 4th due date is a mere two weeks away, admits that although she initially wanted to hide her bump 'forever', she ended up showing it off at every opportunity, referring to it as 'a badge of pride'. 'I’m a woman!  Look at me making a human! I am a goddess!' she exclaims. Radiant: Olivia Wilde, 30, who is expecting her first child early next month, opens up about her 'badge of pride' bump in the May edition of Lucky magazine . The radiant mother-to-be also reveals that her pregnancy has made her feel more connected to other women, in a way she never has before, and also to her unborn son. 'He’s moving around in there and no one else can tell - it’s a little secret friendship,' she says. Miss Wilde, who is engaged to actor and comedian Jason Sudeikis, 38, explains that one of the more profound changes she has undergone since becoming pregnant is her heightened sense of empathy. 'You look at everyone and you think, You were a baby!' she says. Nautical delight: The stunning actress admits she initially expected to keep her bump away from prying eyes, but now feels empowered by her changing body, and more 'connected' to other women . The dedicated philanthropist speaks at length about her nonprofit, Conscious Commerce; a company which encourages consumers to shop from brands, such as Toms shoes, that are 'doing something positive' in the world. The company was born after Miss Wilde's 2010 visit to Haiti's earthquake aftermath, which threw her into what she describes as a 'maniacal fund-raising mode'. She also delves into her 'messy' personal style, citing Bob Marley and Keith Richards as unlikely early fashion icons, and mentions Eva Longoria as being the antitheses of her own laid-back approach to dressing. 'Eva Longoria always looks so put-together and goddamned adorable,' she remarks. 'But I can’t imagine walking everywhere in those heels. She goes to the Laundromat with them on! I just don’t have it in me.' All grown up: She doesn't look it here, but Miss Wilde refers to her style as 'messy', admitting she was a 'thrifty' tomboy in her teenage years . Miss Wilde claims she was a tomboy in her teenage years, stealing clothes from her father's closet, and says 'thrifty girl' was her nickname at the time. 'I couldn’t imagine paying more than $20 for a pair of jeans,' she admits. These days, the actress counts upmarket brands including Rick Owens, Rag & Bone and James Pearse - her new 'savoir' in terms of maternity wear - as her go-to labels. Ready to pop: Miss Wilde's baby bump was displayed on Saturday, as she and her fiance Jason Sudeikis, 38, stepped out in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood . Miss Wilde also appears to have developed into something of a Francophile, mentioning Adele Exarchopoulos - the French star of recent indie hit Blue is the Warmest Color - as a new style influence. 'When in doubt, look to the French,' she says. 'For literally everything in life. It’s just minimalism at its best.' She fondly recalls seeing girls in Paris wearing vintage tees tucked into pencil skirts a few years ago, stating: 'I remember thinking, I’m going to go home and buy a bunch of pencil skirts so I can do that. Staying busy: The expectant mother, pictured last Thursday at a Revlon fundraiser, reveals she would much rather play a 'basket-case mess' role than a femme fatale . 'The same thing happened with suspenders. I saw someone in suspenders and I thought, Yes! Suspenders are everything!' The stunning expectant mother concludes by revealing that when it comes to her ideal role, the 'basket-case mess' trumps the 'ideal girl' every time. 'Now when I look at roles, if it says, ""In walks in the femme fatale, the epitome of perfection and desire,"" I say, ""No, that’s not going to work""' she explains. 'I’m not interested unless she turns out to be psychotic and murders everyone in the room. I’d rather be Ursula than the Little Mermaid.'","Also discusses her 'messy' personal style, citing Bob Marley and Keith Richards as early fashion icons .

Though it will come as little consolation to David Moyes, his enforced departure from Manchester United was almost inevitable from the moment he walked into Old Trafford. Probably no successor, no matter how talented, could have banished the spectre of the fire-breathing, gum-chewing, trophy-winning Sir Alex Ferguson. Indeed, I rather suspect David Moyes's biggest mistake was to take the job in the first place. Great leader: Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson got his send off last April . Feeble: Ferguson's successor as Manchester United manager David Moyes . But you don't have to know or care anything about football to appreciate the tragic resonance of his fate. What business experts call ‘succession planning' is vital not just to the fates of clubs and corporations, but to the future of entire countries. This is tricky enough when a leader has been running the show for, say, the best part of a decade. But Sir Alex Ferguson managed Manchester United for more than 26 years, having taken over shortly before Margaret Thatcher won her third General Election. Though the Scot is a keen Labour donor, the parallels with the Iron Lady are irresistible. Like Mrs Thatcher, the former Manchester United manager was a driven, obsessive character and a serial winner who has proved impossible to replace. When Sir Alex joined Manchester United, Mrs Thatcher had been in power for seven years. Already her colleagues were speculating about her successor, but as one aspiring prince after another lost favour, the crown eventually fell to the unheralded figure of John Major. The Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher and her successor John Major portrayed in 90s TV comedy Spitting Image . Like David Moyes, Mr Major never really succeeded in winning over hard-core supporters and was widely seen as a grey, insubstantial figure after the charismatic fireworks of the Thatcher years. And like the sacked Manchester United manager, Mr Major never banished the shadow of his predecessor, who famously told the Press that she intended to be a ‘very good backseat driver' — although Sir Alex has always maintained he would not meddle since stepping down. Eclipsed . Later, Mr Major described Mrs Thatcher's behaviour as ‘intolerable'. But the truth is that had he been a more popular, compelling and impressive leader, then no one would have cared what Mrs Thatcher thought. The paradox, though, is that great men and women rarely pick figures of the same stature to succeed them, perhaps because their sheer competitiveness means they cannot countenance the thought of being eclipsed by a rival. Even the Romans never found an answer. Their first emperor, Augustus, ruled for 41 years and died peacefully in his bed. But the final years of his life were blighted by his unsuccessful efforts to find a plausible heir. Eventually Augustus picked his rough-hewn stepson Tiberius, who had none of his charm and proved a very dodgy successor indeed, spending much of his time interfering with small boys in his private villa on the island of Capri. Sir Terry Leahy enjoyed a stunning career as the chief executive of Tesco, presiding over an unprecedented expansion between 1997 and 2011 . He was succeeded in turn by the deranged Caligula, the stammering Claudius and the narcissistic Nero. For decades, therefore, Augustus's shadow hung over Roman politics — both an inspiration and a curse, like some ancient version of Mrs Thatcher. Our own history is full of similar stories. So it was that while the grim Edward I reformed the law, conquered the Welsh and hammered the Scots, his feckless son Edward  II lost the battle of Bannockburn, was ousted by his wife and ended up on the wrong end of a red-hot poker. And while dashing Henry V smashed the French at Agincourt, his dreamy son Henry VI lost England's possessions in France, was stripped of the crown during the Wars of the Roses and was murdered in the Tower. Even Oliver Cromwell, probably the outstanding leader in our history, made a mess of the succession. When he died in 1658, his son Richard, a mild-mannered country farmer, proved hopelessly inadequate at filling his father's shoes, and back came the Stuarts to regain the throne. Wretched . Colourful as these stories may seem, they offer some intriguing lessons for modern politicians and businessmen. All too often, great leaders have failed to plan for the future. It is often said that great leaders step down voluntarily only when they know, deep down, that the wheels are about to come off, thereby leaving their successor a wretched legacy. But I think the reality is subtly different. I suspect that in politics, as in sport, great leaders use their sheer charisma to disguise the cracks that would otherwise be apparent. As soon as they step down, deep institutional flaws are exposed for all to see. Britain's boardrooms offer some compelling examples. Sir Terry Leahy, for instance, enjoyed a stunning career as the chief executive of Tesco, presiding over an unprecedented expansion between 1997 and 2011. Yet for the past two years, Tesco's profits have fallen. Certainly there are deeper factors at play, from rising food prices to competition from Aldi and Lidl, but Sir Terry's retirement surely played its part. It is a similar story at the drinks giant Diageo, which has lost momentum after announcing the departure of chief executive Paul Walsh. Rolls-Royce's titanic chief executive Sir John Rose retired in 2011 after a 15-year reign.  Only two months ago, Rolls-Royce issued a profit warning that wiped more than £3 billion off its share price. Would things have been radically different had Sir John still been on the scene? Perhaps not. But the City might well have had more confidence in the engine manufacturer's prospects. And in business, as in sport, confidence is often half  the battle. At Sainsbury's, for instance, the jitters have already set in, even though the long-serving chief executive Justin King is not stepping down until July. When his retirement was announced earlier this year, the firm's stock price dropped by almost 5 per cent. Who would fancy playing John Major to his Thatcher? The truth is that like medieval barons and Manchester United footballers, most of us still pay homage to the cult of the strong leader. Once the familiar, steady hand is gone, we start to lose  confidence — and the blame inevitably falls on the hapless successor. Even the great American technology giants are not immune. Apple is not merely the largest publicly traded corporation on the planet, it has one of the most sophisticated and well-regarded brands in history. Obscure . Yet many observers believe that the Californian giant has lost its way since the death of its founder, Steve Jobs, in 2011. His successor, the comparatively obscure Tim Cook, has one of the most enviable jobs in the business world. Yet Mr Cook had scarcely been in the job before the muttering started. Would you really want to be in his shoes, knowing that you would always be judged against your predecessor — and that nothing you did would ever be enough? In one area of our national life, however, succession planning is unlikely to be too difficult. For my money, the leaders of Britain's three main parties are the least impressive trio in living memory. Will we miss David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg when they are gone? Will their shadows hang heavy over their unfortunate successors, as Sir Alex Ferguson's silhouette looms over Old Trafford? I don't think so.","The parallels between Ferguson and the Iron Lady are irresistible .

"By . Daniel Martin . Fears: Attorney General Dominic Grieve said that the rise of religious fundamentalism has made Christian reluctant to express belief . Moderate Christians are afraid to declare their religion publicly because of the rise of fundamentalism, a minister said last night. Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, said the rise of religious fundamentalists had made Christians reluctant to express their beliefs. He said they were being ‘turned off’ by the ‘disturbing’ and ‘very damaging’ rise of those with a ‘deep intolerance’ to other people’s views. Mr Grieve said atheists who said Britain was no longer a Christian nation were ‘deluding themselves’ and must accept that faith had shaped this country’s laws and ethics. He said that 1,500 years of Christian values were ‘not going to disappear overnight’ and that many people remained believers even if they chose not to go to church. But he said that people were being discouraged from openly declaring their beliefs because of the ‘deep intolerance’ of religious extremists of all faiths, including Islam and Christianity. ‘I do think that there has been a rise of an assertiveness of religious groups across the spectrum,’ he said last night. ‘That is why those with softer religious views find it disturbing and say they don’t want anything to do with it.’ Mr Grieve’s comments follow criticism of David Cameron for declaring Britain to be a ‘Christian country’. A group of 55  liberal celebrities, scientists and academics accused the Prime Minister of sowing ‘alienation and division’ and fuelling ‘sectarian divides’. Criticism: Mr Grieve's comments follow attacks on David Cameron by a group of liberals after he described Britain as a Christian country . Mr Grieve told the Telegraph that ‘atheism hasn’t made much progress’ in Britain and that ‘our state, its ethics and our society are underpinned by Christian values’. He added: ‘Many of the underlying ethics of society are Christian-based and the result of 1,500 years of Christian input into our national life. It is not going to disappear overnight. ‘They [the atheists] are deluding themselves. I do think that the rise of religious fundamentalism is a major deterrent to people. It is a big turn-off away from religion generally, and it’s very damaging. It encourages people to say “I’m not interested” [and] an unwillingness to express commitment. ‘The evidence in this country is overwhelming that most people by a very substantial margin have religious belief in the supernatural or a deity.’ Mr Grieve’s comments are at variance with census statistics which show that in 2011, the percentage reporting ‘no religion’ had almost doubled to more than 25 per cent.","Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, said some are afraid to admit faith .

"By . Emma Innes . A series of controversial adverts about pancreatic cancer have been cleared of being offensive, despite 121 people complaining about them. The adverts saw pancreatic cancer sufferers say ‘I wish I had breast cancer’ or ‘I wish I had testicular cancer’. The string of adverts, which were shown on TV, online, on posters and in newspapers, showed three people suffering from the cancer, including Kerry Harvey, whose image was accompanied by the words 'I wish I had breast cancer'. The Advertising Standards Agency has cleared a Pancreatic Cancer Action campaign of offensiveness. The adverts saw patients (such as Kerry Harvey, pictured) saying they wished they had other cancers . The idea of the campaign was to highlight the disease's terrible survival rates. Ms Harvey, who was diagnosed with the disease in April 2013, died on February 22 this year at the age of just 24. The image of her used in the campaign by Pancreatic Cancer Action showed her with no hair and a series of tumours on her head. The adverts stated: ‘Today, 23 people will be told they have pancreatic cancer. ‘Like Kerry, this is what they face: Only three per cent will survive because of late diagnosis; Most will die within four to six months; It’s the UK's fifth biggest cancer killer. ‘Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of all 22 common cancers. Early diagnosis saves lives.’ Ms Harvey, who married fiance Matthew Biggin just days before her death, received death threats online after appearing in the advert, but said she had 'no regrets' about appearing in the campaign as she wanted to raise awareness about the cancer. The aim of the campaign was to raise awareness of the extremely low pancreatic cancer survival rates. Kerry Harvey (pictured with her husband, Matt Biggin) died of the disease in February . The advertisement caused so much controversy that 121 people complained about it to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). However, the organisation has refused to ban the advert. The complainants, some of whom were cancer patients, said the adverts, which also showed a man saying he wished he had testicular cancer and a woman saying she wished she had cervical cancer, implied that other types of cancer were 'not serious or difficult to deal with'. The complainants said they felt that this was 'offensive and distressing'. The ASA, however, did not ban the ads, saying: ‘The ASA noted that the headline claims in the ads that seemed to compare different types of cancer were likely to be shocking and could potentially be upsetting, particularly for people who had experience of those types of cancer. ‘However, we understood that the quotations reflected the genuine views of people who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and noted that the text directly below the headline claims clarified what was meant by those claims. Ms Harvey said she did not regret appearing in the advertisement as having breast cancer would have meant she had hope which did not exist for her as a pancreatic cancer patient . ‘This text made clear that due to low early diagnosis and a lack of awareness of the symptoms of the disease, pancreatic cancer had the lowest survival rate of all common cancers and therefore the chances of survival with any other type of cancer were likely to be greater. ‘We considered that this put the quotes referring to other types of cancer into context and that, when considered as a whole, the ads were unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence or unjustifiable distress, and therefore the ads did not breach the Code.’ Pancreatic Cancer Action (PCA) said the campaign aimed to provide an insight to the general public into how it feels to be diagnosed with a disease that leaves you 'with no hope'. It said it had 'never suggested that the suffering of a pancreatic cancer patient was worse than that of breast, testicular or cervical cancer patients' and that ads were not offensive. PCA said the ads 'contained the facts' and explained 'why someone might want another cancer' and 'that pancreatic cancer had the lowest survival rate of all 22 common cancers'. It said the decision to run the adverts was 'not taken lightly' and that of 2,000 people polled before the adverts appeared, only six per cent said they were 'angry' about them.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A prisoner broke out of jail after getting so fed up of hearing loud rap music being played ‘day and night’ on his wing, a court heard. Robert Stevens, 58, became so annoyed with the constant hip hop music played by his fellow inmates that he fled HMP Leyhill prison in Gloucestershire. The convicted robber also became distressed by being ‘constantly pestered’ to buy drugs off younger cellmates inside, the court heard. Robert Stevens, 58, pictured, became so annoyed with rap and hip hop music being played 'day and night' by his fellow inmates that he fled HMP Leyhill prison in Gloucestershire by jumping over an outside wall . Stevens simply climbed over a security wall to escape the minimum security category D jail before walking several miles to the nearest town. The fugitive, who had been serving a six-and-a-half year sentence for robbery, spent 20 days at large in various towns in the South West. Police issued a public appeal to find him and he was finally caught while visiting a Coral bookmakers in Bridport, Dorset, on March 29. Jamie Porter, defending, said: ‘He was in a very noisy wing where rap music was being played day and night. ‘He was also being constantly pestered to purchase drugs by younger cellmates. Stevens was sent to the minimum security HMP Leyhill prison in Gloucestershire, pictured, in 2012 for carrying out a string of commercial robberies, including at a Coral bookmakers in Bath . ‘Stevens has apologised for his behaviour. It was an impulsive act on his part. ‘It is quite clear he does not wish to commit any more crime.’ He said his client was about to hand himself in when he was recognised and arrested. In sentencing Stevens, Judge Roger Jarvis said his escape was ‘impulsive and opportunistic’. He said: ‘The reason for your escape has been explained to me as your unhappiness at people who were with you in prison. ‘I’m afraid that’s one of the prices people pay if they commit crimes and go to prison. ‘Those who escape from prison have to be sentenced in a way that is a deterrent to other prisoners.’ Stevens complained of loud rap music being played 'day and night' at HMP Leyhill prison and blamed it as the reason for absconding. The music could have included songs by rap artist Eminem, left, or Dizzee Rascal, right . Stevens jumped over an outside wall to flee HMP Leyhill after getting fed up of listening to other inmates playing rap music - which could have included songs by superstar Jay Z, pictured . Stevens admitted the charge of escaping from HMP Leyhill and was given an extra . 10 months to serve on top of his current sentence. Dorchester Crown Court heard that Stevens has 21 convictions for 45 offences spanning four decades.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Almost half of Britons complain about soaring bills - but cannot be bothered to look for a better deal, research reveals. At least 45 per cent of bill-payers feel their potential savings wouldn't be worth the change, while one in four said they can face the 'hassle'. The poll by regulator Ofgem follows research that the majority of Britons are baffled by highly-complicated energy tariffs. At least 45 per cent of Britons feels the potential savings wouldn't be worth the hassle of shopping around . The complex combination of standing charges, kilowatt hours and unit prices leaves most of us baffled. This is despite reforms after the ‘big six’ energy firms were ordered by Ofgem to cut the number of tariffs and deals to help families find the best value. Launching a campaign to encourage people to shop around for deals, Ofgem today insisted changes have made the industry 'simpler, clearer and fairer'. The Be An Energy Shopper campaign includes a consumer guide on the goenergyshopping.co.uk website to help people find the best energy tariff. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'We shop and compare prices for many things in life, yet we often don't think to do the same when it comes to our energy bills, even when we could be saving around £200. 'Previously, people found it difficult to compare tariffs and the process too time consuming but the recent reforms have changed things for the better. The poll follows research that two in three are baffled by energy tariffs despite reforms to simplify the market . 'With the introduction of Be An Energy Shopper it has never been easier to go energy shopping and get a better deal on your gas and electricity.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'Making the switch is easier than ever before, and the Be An Energy Shopper campaign gives consumers practical advice on how to shop around and get the best deal for their energy use. 'Having made the switch myself, I would encourage anyone who hasn't already done so to check whether their current supplier is giving them the best deal - and if it isn't, switch. 'We're working to make the energy market work better for consumers. 'We've trebled the number of suppliers since 2010, made people's bills easier to understand, reduced the complexity of tariffs and promoted competition through initiatives such as collective switching. We want consumers to get the benefits of more competition.'","At least 45% of bill-payers feel potential savings wouldn't be worth change .

"By . Amanda Williams . Summer bank holidays could be moved to winter to give people a day off in the run up to Christmas, in plans touted by a government think tank. Government wellbeing officers are considering moving some of the national days off in order to spread them out across the year. At present, there are two bank holidays in May, often shortly after the Easter break, and one at the end of August - leaving the country without another day off between the summer and the four months until Christmas. Summer bank holidays could be moved to winter to give people a day off in the run up to Christmas, in plans touted by a government think tank . In a blog on 'Wellbeing and why it matters' Lisa Ollerhead, from the Government's wellbeing unit, said that a break could be good for the country, and added: 'After a few more years of data we might even consider moving a bank holiday into early winter when the nights are drawing in and we're feeling low.' The paper also looked at who was happiest in their careers - with publicans, care escorts and construction workers scoring the lowest levels of satsifaction. It said: 'While highly-paid Chief Executives and senior officials do well, take-home pay doesn’t seem to be the only important factor. Occupations like publicans and members of the clergy, which have similar income levels, seem to have very different levels of wellbeing.' The bank holiday could be moved to just before Christmas 'after a few more years of data' has been collected . Churchmen and women topped the league table, joined by farmers, fitness instructors and school secretaries in enjoying a modest salary but high personal satisfaction, according to the breakdown prepared by a think-tank. At the other end of the scale, the most miserable workers in the country are pub landlords – and their bar staff are not far from them at the bottom of the league table of job satisfaction, the  report reveals. Those who go to work with a heavy heart also include debt collectors, industrial cleaners, call centre salespeople and security guards. The table was drawn up by a group led by former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell, who persuaded David Cameron to spend £2million a year collecting statistics on our happiness. Lord O’Donnell believes politicians should make decisions based on people’s level of well-being as well as on economic benefit. The breakdown takes into account both pay and the sense of achievement and personal reward. To be happy, a worker must have a clear idea of what is expected of them, some freedom and control, feel valued by their boss and achieve the best balance between work and family time. ‘Not all jobs are a bed of roses,’ said the report published by the Legatum Institute think-tank. ‘Job satisfaction is on a long-term downward trend in most advanced countries, and people rank time spent with their manager as among their least happy moments in the day.’","Government wellbeing officers considering moving some national days off .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An advert for Center Parcs resorts was today banned for ‘irresponsibly’ encouraging parents to take their children on holiday during term time. The television ad promoting four-night midweek breaks showed families with school-aged children taking part in various activities, with small print stating that the offer ‘excludes school holidays’. Two viewers complained that the ad was irresponsible because it encouraged parents to take their children out of school during term time. Banned: The television ad promoting four-night midweek breaks showed families with school-aged children taking part in various activities, with small print stating that the offer 'excludes school holidays' Center Parcs said it was the responsibility of parents to exercise judgment regarding their children, and there was nothing in the ad that encouraged them to take their children out of school during term times. The advertising clearance service Clearcast said the issue of taking children out of school during term time was the responsibility of parents, who would be aware that rules had recently been tightened to discourage the practice. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) noted that many of the scenes in the ad featured families with school-aged children enjoying various activities. It said: ‘We considered the emphasis of the ad was on a family break and that the overall impression was that families could take advantage of the advertised offer, which was not available at weekends or during school holidays. Ruling: Two viewers complained that the ad was irresponsible because it encouraged parents to take their children out of school during term time . ‘We also noted the final on-screen text stated ‘Your family. Your time’, which we considered was likely to be an encouragement for parents to take up the offer. 'It irresponsibly encouraged parents to take their children out of school' Advertising Standards Authority . ‘Because the ad had focused on a family break to promote an offer which was available only during term time, we concluded it irresponsibly encouraged parents to take their children out of school.’ The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, adding: ‘We told Center Parcs to avoid promoting family breaks which were available only during school term times.’ A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs has always adhered to the ASA processes and guidelines and the approach with this particular TV commercial was no different. Response: Center Parcs said it was the responsibility of parents to exercise judgment regarding their children, and there was nothing in the ad that encouraged them to take their children out of school during term times . ‘As with all previous TV commercials, it was cleared for transmission by the relevant regulatory broadcast authority. It is also our understanding that only two complaints were received regarding this ad. 'We believe this ruling to be extremely harsh' Center Parcs . ‘Our ad shows a number of families, with children of varying ages, enjoying some of the activities that are available at Center Parcs. 'We do not believe the ad encourages parents to take their children out of school and it is very clear that the price displayed excludes school holidays. 'This approach was taken based on a ruling by the ASA themselves. In our opinion, this ASA ruling represents a new interpretation of the guidelines. Decision: The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form . 'However, whilst we believe this ruling to be extremely harsh, we do of course take on board the ASA's comments and will continue to work within their guidelines.’ 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect' Department for Education . A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. ‘We recognise the challenges facing parents and that's why we are giving schools the flexibility to set their own term times so they can change term dates to ones that work for their pupils and families. Many schools are already taking advantage of this.’","TV advert promoting midweek breaks said it 'excludes school holidays'

"By . Becky Barrow . Holding on to it: Figures from the Bank of England show the amount lent by banks to entrepreneurs has dropped every month since April 2010 . Small businesses have been starved of cash by banks for four years – with net lending plunging by £4.3billion in the past year alone – the Bank of England said yesterday. Its figures show the amount lent by banking giants to entrepreneurs has dropped every month since April 2010. Between February 2013 and February this year, the total handed to small firms fell by 2.5 per cent – a drop in net lending of £4.3billion. Net lending is the total amount given out by banks, minus the amount that is repaid. The Bank’s latest ‘Trends in Lending’ report said entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of the economy, are increasingly turning their backs on the banks. It said: ‘SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] use of alternative sources of finance to borrowing from banks is increasing. In 2013, contacts of the Bank’s network of agents [based around the UK] reported a growing use of non-bank finance by SMEs, albeit from low levels.’ Alternative sources include peer-to-peer lending, when people lend money directly to entrepreneurs and receive interest on the money, and venture capital funds, which are investors who put money into small businesses in return for a stake in the firm. Yesterday the Federation of Small Businesses said it is ‘critical’ the problems faced by small firms getting the money that they need to grow is resolved as a matter of urgency. John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Demand for finance by small firms is outstripping supply. Coupled with no change in the pricing of lending facilities despite a strengthening economy, it underlines the ongoing challenges small businesses face in accessing finance to meet their growth ambitions. ‘As the economy continues to gain momentum, ensuring small firms have access to finance is critical.’ It is nearly four years since this newspaper launched its ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms, which need money to grow. At the time, the former Bank of England governor, Lord King, described being deeply saddened by the ‘heartbreaking’ stories that he regularly heard from entrepreneurs struggling to survive, or expand their business. 'Growing use of non-bank finance': The Bank of England's report found that small and medium-sized firms were increasingly turning to alternative sources such as peer-to-peer lending and venture capital funds . Marcus Grimshaw, chairman of the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers, said: ‘There is more work to be done to help credit-worthy businesses access finance. ‘Government initiatives are having an impact, but there are still too many SMEs in the UK whose growth is being obstructed because they can’t access the right funds.’ The Bank’s figures show gross lending to small firms was £12.5billion between October and December 2013, compared to £9.4billion between October and December 2012. But critics say the problem will not be resolved until the all-important net lending figure becomes positive again. Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the British Bankers’ Association, said: ‘As the economy picks up businesses are building up record cash reserves and paying off more of their debt, leading to an overall decline in net lending. ‘However, as the Bank of England notes, new lending is picking up strongly. He insisted: ‘There has rarely been a better time to approach your bank.’","Net lending has fallen £4.3billion since February 2013, figures show .

"By . Nathan Klein . Thousands of women migrant domestic workers in Qatar are being severely exploited and sexually abused in 'utterly miserable conditions', according to a new report by an international human rights group. The 77-page Amnesty International report titled 'My sleep is my break: Exploitation of domestic workers in Qatar' has uncovered the appalling conditions women - primarily from the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka - face on a daily basis. In the report, women are said to be lured to Qatar on the basis of false promises over salaries and working conditions - only to be made to work extreme hours and seven-day weeks. Appalling conditions: A migrant worker sitting on a bunk bed in his accommodation in Qatar, the host country of the soccer World Cup in 2022 . A computer image of the 'Al Khor' stadium, for the FIFA World Cup 2022, to be built in Doha, Qatar . Some women also described how they were also subjected to sexual and physical violence. The report, which draws upon interviews with 52 female domestic workers, revealed that in some cases women in Qatar are being made to work up to 100 hours per week, with no days off. Under Qatari law there are no limits on working hours for domestic workers and no requirement to allow them a day off, and domestic workers are unable to lodge complaints with Qatar’s Labour Ministry - a situation which Amnesty is calling on the Qatari authorities to remedy urgently. Qatar’s estimated 84,000 women migrant domestic workers are subject to the country’s highly restrictive sponsorship system - known as the kafala system - which prevents migrant workers from leaving their job or the country without their employer’s permission. As with male construction industry workers, the women routinely have their passports withheld by their employers, and in some cases employers also confiscate their mobile phones. While some women find good jobs and are treated well, those facing abuse are left with little choice but to “run away”, putting them at risk of being arrested, detained and deported on charges of 'absconding'. Exploited: Migrant workers at a construction site in Doha, Qatar. The human rights organisation Amnesty International has found an 'alarming level of exploitation up to forced labor' in Qatar, the host country of the soccer World Cup in 2022 . A computer image of the 'Al Khor' stadium, for the FIFA World Cup 2022, to be built in Doha, Qatar - which will be built by migrant workers, many of whom are complaining of appalling working conditions . Amnesty International's global issues director Audrey Gaughran said construction work in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup has shone a spotlight on the plight of migrant workers in Qatar. 'The complete absence of protections for domestic workers’ labour rights, and the fact that they are isolated in employers’ homes, leaves them exposed to abuse to an even greater extent,' she said. 'Migrant domestic workers are victims of a discriminatory system that denies them basic protections and leaves them open to exploitation and abuse, including forced labour and human trafficking.' She said many women spoke about being terribly deceived, and then trapped and at the mercy of their abusive employers. Poor conditions at the PCSI workers accommodation camp in the Industrial Area of Doha, Qatar, where the 2022 World Cup will be held . A migrant worker from Nepal, in Qatar, who suffered After a horrendous workplace accident in June 2011 that left him permanently disabled, he lived in Qatar without pay while struggling to get compensation for his injury through the Qatar court system . An Indonesian woman being held at the deportation centre after fleeing from sustained physical abuse, showed Amnesty researchers a deep scar on her chest where her female employer had branded her with a hot iron. She told researchers she’d been forced to work seven days a week, was not paid for months and was banned from leaving the house. “Women who find themselves in abusive households face utterly miserable conditions. They have few options - if they choose to simply to get out of the house, they will be branded ""runaways"" and are likely to end up being detained and deported,' Ms Gaughran said. 'Promises by the government to protect domestic workers’ labour rights have so far not amounted to anything.' Amnesty researchers were told by women workers they were slapped, pulled by the hair, poked in the eyes, and kicked down the stairs by their employers. Three women also reported that they had been raped. A computer image of the 'Al Rayyan' stadium, designed by German architect company Albert Speer & Partner, for the FIFA World Cup 2022, to be built in Doha, Qatar . In one horrific case, a domestic worker broke both her legs and fractured her spine when she fell from a window as she tried to escape a rape attack by her employer. Her attacker then proceeded to sexually assault her as she lay on the ground, injured and unable to move, and only afterwards did he call an ambulance. When researchers interviewed her six months after the attack, she was still using a wheelchair. Despite her appalling injuries, Qatar’s public prosecutor dismissed the case due to “lack of evidence” and she returned to the Philippines last year. Her employer has never been held accountable. Women who have been physically or sexually abused face major obstacles to getting justice, with those who report sexual abuse also risking being charged with sexual relations outside of marriage - a 'crime' in Qatar normally punished with a year in jail and deportation.

PD, from the Philippines, told Amnesty that she was promised US$400 per month by a recruitment agency before she took up her job, but when she arrived in Qatar she only received $247. 'When I complained, the madam [employer] … told me “you don’t deserve it"",' PD, whose name has been disguised to protect her identity, explained. 'I had to start work at 4am. I had to start at exactly that time. I would get about three to four hours’ sleep. I would be constantly washing or ironing clothes and if the clothes were not clean enough I would have to wash and iron them again. 'My hands split and bled because of the work ... I would run so hard that I would fall, and I lost feeling in my feet. I wasn’t even allowed to go to toilet while I was working.' After two months of excessive hours and constant verbal abuse from her employer, PD said she contacted the employment agent whose only interest appeared to be in ensuring that she worked for at least three months with her employer. '“I called the recruitment agent and they would not help me. I think that this family has a history of problems - I heard that no-one has ever finished a contract with them,' she said. 'The agency told me to do a month’s more work and then just stopped answering the phone.'","Women in Qatar are being exposed to 'utterly miserable conditions', a new report has found .

"By . Lizzie Parry . and Daily Mail Reporter . Retired special needs teacher William Gouldburn died after waiting two hours for an ambulance, despite his family making seven 999 calls . A pensioner died after an agonising two-hour wait on his bathroom floor for an ambulance. William Gouldburn, 73, collapsed at home but was not regarded a ‘red’ emergency despite seven desperate  999 calls. By the time a rapid-response team arrived the retired teacher had gone into cardiac arrest and it was too late to save him, an inquest heard. Incredibly, the first crew to turn up at his Hartlepool home were from the charity first aid service St John Ambulance – who were replaced once the seriousness of the situation emerged. Ambulance bosses say they lacked the resources to meet demand that night and were hit by delays caused by a lack of  hospital beds. A coroner has ruled that Mr Gouldburn might have been saved if medics had reached him sooner, branding the tragedy a ‘sad consequence’ of a lack  of ambulances. Saying his death was aggravated by a ‘lack of timely and appropriate medical intervention’, Hartlepool coroner Malcolm Donnelly added: ‘Had there been more ambulances available the outcome might have  been different. ‘It would appear to be a consequence of stretched resources, perhaps doing the best they can, but people are not receiving the service they might feel entitled to occasionally. ‘My concern is the time it takes for deployment and when [an ambulance] does attend it is manned by a charity.’ On the day of the tragedy last April, Mr Gouldburn, who was recovering from shoulder surgery, told his wife Pamela, 70, he was feeling unwell. A doctor who visited failed to find a serious problem, but offered to send him to hospital – which he refused. He collapsed at around 10.20am, when his carer called 999, telling call handlers about the doctor’s earlier visit. Although they were told Mr Gouldburn couldn’t move, his condition was not deemed a ‘red’ case and he was allocated a 60-minute response time. Mr Gouldburn, pictured with his wife Pamela, 70, 'could have survived' had medical help reached him earlier, a coroner has ruled . Mr Gouldburn collapsed and died on the bathroom floor at the flat he shared with his wife Pamela, in Hartlepool (pictured) last April . It was midday by the time an ambulance arrived – and it was a St John vehicle. Once the seriousness of the situation became apparent, an ambulance with an eight-minute response time was summoned and eventually arrived along with a rapid response car. By then it was too late, and Mr Gouldburn was pronounced dead after a ten-minute battle to save his life. Mr Donnelly ruled the former special needs teacher died of natural causes. Pathologist Dr Jan Lowe said Mr Gouldburn had an underlying heart condition – which was worsened by the stress of being on the bathroom floor for so long. Lynn Corrigan, a dispatch manager for the North East Ambulance Service, blamed problems on a high number of urgent calls that day. She said there had also been delays in admitting patients to North Durham Hospital because of a lack of beds – which she described as ‘a national problem’. 'He gave his life to helping others and the (ambulance) trust failed him in his moment of need' - William Gouldburn's family . The inquest heard Mr Gouldburn’s carer and relatives made calls to the 999 and 111 emergency numbers – both of which are handled by the same call centre in Newcastle. But the coroner was told there was nothing in the computer software to flag up that the family had called before. Calls to both numbers are processed in a similar way, but the two systems are not linked – so handlers taking 999 calls will not know if 111 staff have dealt with the same patient. Assistant call centre manager Geraldine Hope said a request had been made to hook up the two systems but Coroner Mr Donnelly described it as ‘a big gap’. Bosses at the North East Ambulance Service admitted they did not have the 'resources to meet demand', adding it was a 'national problem'. The coroner ruled had Mr Gouldburn received medical attention sooner, it is likely he could have survived . Mr Gouldburn’s family hit out at the ambulance service trust’s failure to grasp the seriousness of the situation until it was too late. Speaking after the inquest, they said: ‘This should never happen again to anyone. We simply want recognition from the trust that a mistake was made, and that the trust failed a fantastic man. ‘He gave his life to helping others and the trust failed him in his moment of need. We hope they will make sure as best they can this will never happen again to another family in Hartlepool.’ Tom Howard, head of the North East Ambulance Service’s contact centre, apologised to the pensioner’s family for not getting to him sooner. He said: ‘Mr Gouldburn didn’t receive the level of care that he should have done.’ Ambulance services across the UK categorise each call according to how serious the patient's condition is. The aim is to ensure the most serious, life-threatening calls are dealt with first. The categories are nationally agreed, by the Department of Health and each ambulance service across the UK are measured according to required targets.- Red 1The most serious category, Red 1 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life-threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest.An ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes.Where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to Red 1 calls - commonly a rapid response car, who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene, followed by an ambulance, who can transport the patient to hospital.- Red 2The second most serious category is for all other life-threatening emergencies. Examples include patients who have suffered a stroke, with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe.Similarly to Red 1 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged. For both Red calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times. The guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes. Where onward transport to hospital is required, 95 per cent of life-threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made.- Green 1These are serious but not life-threatening calls, for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms.A Green 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes.- Green 2Also deemed serious but not life-threatening, Green 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs, or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile.These calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes.- Green 3These are non-emergency calls which require an on-scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes. A patient who has suffered a suspected overdose, but is showing no serious symptoms, or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a Green 3 call.- Green 4These are the least serious calls, which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour.Minor scalding, a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain, but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a Green 4 999 call. Response times for Green calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements.","William Gouldburn collapsed at his Hartlepool home last April .

"By . Jason Groves . David Cameron was facing embarrassment last night after it emerged police were called when his local bishop tried to deliver an open letter about food poverty. The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend John Pritchard, was barred from entering the Prime Minister's constituency office in Witney, Oxfordshire, earlier this month. Police were called to deal with the bishop and a group of 40 campaigners who were trying to deliver a letter urging Mr Cameron to do more to tackle poverty. Police were called to deal with the Bishop of Oxford and a group of 40 campaigners who were trying to deliver a letter urging Prime Minister David Cameron to do more to tackle poverty . The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend John Pritchard, pictured, was joined by 40 campaigners when he tried to deliver a letter urging the Prime Minister to do more to tackle poverty last month . Tory sources last night insisted that Mr Cameron's staff were not responsible for calling the police. A spokesman for Mr Cameron: 'The Bishop of Oxford's petition about world hunger will be passed on to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street.' But the incident is embarrassing for the Prime Minister, coming just days after he spoke about the importance of his Christian faith to his politics. The Reverend Keith Hebden, a prominent food poverty campaigner who was also present, said the police had left quickly, but said the group had been forced to abandon its bid to deliver the letter. He said: 'It is deeply ironic, to say the least, that on the same day David Cameron was writing in the Church Times talking about what a good Anglican he is, he wasn't able to receive his own bishop in his constituency office. I think this speaks volumes. 'They were expecting us - we had phoned ahead. Most of my surprise was reserved for them not even opening the door. The letter was positive and addressed to all three party leaders, so it wasn't political.' Tory sources last night denied they had been given advance notice of the visit and suggested the letter should have been delivered to Downing Street.

"By . Darren Boyle . A plague of intelligent super-rats has invaded Luton town centre and have learned to avoid traps while foraging for food. The latest super-rats, photographed by pest control expert Tony Margiocchi, avoided getting snared on the deadly trap despite nibbling on the food. Mr Margiocchi was staking out a lane way in Luton when he spotted the first of the monster rats. One of the monster super-rats investigates an abandoned box of chicken bones from a local takeaway . The cunning rat has learned not to put his front paws on the trap's pressure plate, allowing him to feast on tinned fish without having his neck snapped by the spring-loaded device . Rat will do nicely: The rodent manages to defeat the trap by safely removing the food without suffering any injury . He said: 'I was looking to take some photographs for my new pest control business and set up on Library Road in Luton. 'It is just behind the main shopping centre and is in the middle of town. I put out a trap baited with some of John West's finest Sardines in Tomato Sauce and sat back. 'I was about 18 metres away using a 400mm lens when this massive rat appeared. He was so big I couldn't get him all in frame - even from that distance.' According to Mr Margiocchi, he was preparing for a fairly long stakeout to get the perfect shot, but because Luton's rat problem is so severe, he was spoiled for choice. 'Rats have an excellent sense of smell and that's why I baited my trap with fish. Within minutes they arrived. I was taking photos and the flash on the camera was going off, but they had no fear. Rats used to be afraid of new things but not any longer. 'When they approached the trap, I'm certain that they knew exactly what it was. They were very careful not to put their front paws on the trap as this would release the spring. Not only do we know have super-rats, but we have intelligent super rats.' There are an estimated 10 million rats in the UK and the population has exploded over the past several months because of the mild winter. According to Mr Margiocchi, overflowing bins are an excellent source of food for rats allowing them to thrive . The exceptionally mild winter and a plentiful supply of food is responsible for the explosion in super-rat numbers . Mr Margiocchi said exterminators need to be brought into areas that are invested by colonies of super-rats . According to Mr Margiocchi, conditions are perfect for breeding rats. 'I don't think I can blame Luton council for the rat problem. The budget for street cleansing might be under pressure, but the council didn't dump fast food wrappers all over the place. 'We have everything we need to sustain a massive rat population. All they need is food and water. There is plenty of food dumped on the street on a nightly basis and the bins are overflowing. 'Everyone who dumps food on the street is responsible for this super-rat problem. We need to all work together to face this problem. Not dumping food is a good start but we also need to target rat populations with poison. That is the only way to keep them under control.'

Meanwhile, several parts of the country have been plagued by infestations of super-rats.

'John had so much to live for so he must have just flipped. It is all very distressing and baffling.' However, neighbour Jean Howells, 72, said Mr Caughey had appeared 'a bit stressed' recently. 'He's lived here for quite a few years now. I know him reasonably well . and he's always been really pleasant, and often says hello,' she said. 'He's a member of the sailing club - as am I. I think he really enjoys it. I saw him the other day in the garden and he seemed okay but I think he has seemed a bit stressed lately. 'He's in the middle of moving house and . all I can think is that it has just got to him - its stressful moving . house anyway and especially if you're on your own.' Mr .

He said he rushed to his bedroom window to see plumes of black smoke billowing from the building. Incident: Mr Caughey, from Emsworth, is now being treated in hospital for minor injuries and has been arrested . 'I . had just switched on the radio at 6.30am when there was a massive . bang,' he said. 'It sounded like someone had dropped a tonne of bricks . into a skip from a great height. It was so loud that at first I thought . the boilers at the club must have exploded. 'I said to my wife: ""What the hell was . that?"" and we looked out of the window to see this huge plume of black . smoke billowing from the club. 'Then we spotted the car embedded in the wall and realised what had happened. I threw on some clothes and ran down to the club. 'The blaze was well alight and the flames were 20ft high.

'I . don't know what it was but can only describe the noise as like . fireworks. By this point, the driver had been taken out of the car . and was being escorted up the road by two police officers. 'He looked in a very bad way and was taken away in some distress.' Mr . Clode said the crash appeared to have done some great damage to the . sailing club, which was fitted with a new bar, training rooms, . balcony and larger changing rooms during the refurbishment. He added that club members were 'devastated' by the incident, saying: 'The driver was a longstanding member of the club and has many, many friends within the membership. 'There . was absolutely no dispute with other members. What brought this about . we have no idea and we need to find out through his family what brought . this on. 'Everybody at the club is devastated this has happened.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Cardinal Vincent Nichols warned alarmist rhetoric about immigration caused distrust of foreigners . Britain’s top Roman Catholic cleric has accused politicians of using ‘alarmist’ language over immigration to fuel public anger at foreigners moving here. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, said most migrants ‘add’ to the nation’s wellbeing and warned against attempts to foster distrust of ‘all these people coming to this country’. The row came as the UK Independence Party unveiled a controversial £1.5million poster campaign of against EU immigration. The issue of immigration is likely to dominate in the run-up to the European Parliament elections on May 22. The government has sought to tighten rules on migrants accessing benefits, housing and public services. But Ukip argues that Britain can only control its borders if it leaves the EU altogether. The party has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’ Another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.’ But Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been forced to deny the posters are ‘racist’ amid growing concern about the impact of anti-immigration rhetoric. Cardinal Nichols did not name Ukip directly but appealed to all sides to celebrate the contribution of immigrants rather than ‘anger and dismay’. ‘What I would appeal today is that the debate about immigration is done with a sense of realism and a sense of respect - and that it is not cushioned in expressions which are alarmist and evocative of anger or of dismay or distress at all these people coming to this country,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘We have to grow to appreciate the richness that immigration brings, not simply to the Catholic church but to the life of hospitals and many public sector areas where we are now embracing and dependent on people who come to this country willing to give and wanting to support their families back home. ‘The reality is that the vast majority of migrants to this country add to our well-being.’ Controversial: . Ukip's new posters are being funded by £1.5m of funding from . millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Skyes to launch its biggest ever . publicity drive ahead of the European Parliament elections in May . Poles apart: Deputy PM Nick Clegg, right, appealed for help from Labour and pro-EU Tories to counter the . Nigel Farage's (left) arguments in the run-up to May 22 and dismissed Mr . Farage’s claims to be an insurgent . Ukip is using £1.5 million of funding from millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Sykes to launch its biggest-ever publicity. Critics compared the immigration posters with those used in the past by the far-right British National Party and Labour MP Mike Gapes said they were ‘racist’ and appealed to ‘decent’ voters to turn out to oppose Ukip. But Mr Farage said Ukip was ‘standing up and speaking for ordinary people’. He described his party as ‘non-sectarian and non-racist’. Adverts: Under the slogan 'take back control of . our country', the party complain that 75 per cent of British laws are made . in Brussels and that UK taxpayers fund the 'celebrity lifestyle' of EU . bureaucrats . ‘There is no angry language. There is very cool and calm language,’ he told ITV’s Daybreak. ‘We are not against anybody from any part of the world. ‘But to have an open door to 485 million people from the rest of Europe, many from poor countries, many from countries where youth unemployment rates are as high as 60 per cent, means there is an influx of foreign labour into Britain, the likes of which we have never seen, and it is working families in Britain who have paid a huge price for that over the last 10 years. ‘If I was Romanian, I would come to London too. I don’t blame people from poor countries for coming here, but I think it is the job of the British Government to put the interests of our own people first.’ An . ICM poll published yesterday suggested that Labour will win the . European elections with 30 per cent of the vote, Ukip second on 27 per . cent and the Tories a distant third on 22 per cent. Senior . Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said the posters were ‘extreme . even by the standards of the Front Nationale’, the French far right . party Mr Farage has tried to distance Ukip from. The . peer said: ‘This is divisive politics. The mask is off now, this has . never been about Europe with them, but playing on fears of foreigners, . when there are many British people working in the rest of the EU. ‘It really is in the gutter with the extremist parties of Britain’s past, when I thought we had got rid of those 50 years ago.’","Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric speaks out on immigration .

"By . Amanda Williams . Stephen Farrington, 54, denied abusing the 15-year-old girl and said he had passed out after taking cocaine and Viagra . A paedophile jailed for fathering a baby with a 15-year-old girl has had his appeal rejected after claiming she raped him. Stephen Farrington, 54, said he had passed out after taking cocaine and Viagra and denied abusing the underage teenager at a party. He said the girl had taken advantage of him after he collapsed, and insisted he had been an 'unconscious participant'. Farrington was jailed for four and a half years last July when a jury at Cambridge Crown Court refused to believe his story. He appealed against his conviction but last week the Appeal Court kicked out his case and said his claims that he did not get a fair trial had 'no merit'. The girl went on to have a baby girl which has been taken into care. Lord Justice Pitchford said: ‘He accepted he was the father but claimed he had done nothing wrong because the girl had raped him.’ Farrington had earlier told police he had no memory of the event and only found out the next morning, when the girl explained what had happened. The story was rejected by the jury, and he was jailed for four and a half years. His laywers had argued that the jury was given an 'unfair' summing up at the end of the trial.

"By . Chris Pleasance . As far as close-shaves go, this one must be a shoe-in for some sort of award. A 77-year-old Czech pensioner has been filmed being hit by a speeding train, which sends his trainer flying off his foot. Amazingly, the man himself escapes with only minor injuries, but will be feeling like a complete heel after being slapped with a fine by Czech police. Scroll down for video . A pensioner in the Czech republic has been filmed on camera being hit by a train. The impact is enough to send his shoe flying off (pictured) but he escapes with only minor injuries . The footage starts as the lights begin flashing on the level crossing and the barriers start to come down . While several cars stop and wait, the man has no such thought, and instead walks around them . The close-shave happened in the small town of Rájec-Jestřebí as the express train to the nearby city of Brno passed through. As the CCTV footage starts, the man - whose face has been hidden - can be seen walking towards the level crossing as the lights start flashing. When the barriers come down, he calmly walks around them, and then waits as if checking both ways before deciding to risk walking across. Only too late he realises how fast the train is approaching, but instead of turning back he tries to run the final few feet, and his left foot is hit. After hesitating for a few moments, the man begins walking across, oblivious to the train hurtling at him . At the last moment he runs for it, and nearly makes it, but the train hits his left foot, tearing his shoe off . As his shoe goes flying (bottom left) the man is thrown to the floor, luckily landing away from the tracks . The force of the impact rips the shoes clean off his foot, sending it flying across the road, and leaving him flat out on his back. Luckily he falls away from the tracks and on to his back, where he lays stunned until the train has finished passing. The elderly man then gets to his feet and starts to hobble away. The whole incident is watched by waiting car drivers, but instead of stopping to help, they simply drive away as soon as the barriers have raised. Laying on his back, the elderly man edges himself to safety as the express train to Brno continues going past . After the train has passed, the man simply gets up and hobbles away although he was fined by police . According to Zrcaldo, police spokeswoman Iva Blanenská Šebková said: 'The man was very lucky, he suffered a leg injury, but there is no danger to life. 'The whole thing shows quite a negative image of our country. The drivers show no respect, nor are they willing to help.'","Czech pensioner, 77, filmed walking around barriers on level crossing .

But after posting Murphy's details on to the Notts and Yorkshire Boxer Rescue Facebook page, his plea for help went viral. Donations began to flood in, as people touched by his story, offered to help. Celebrities including Hollywood A-lister Jessica Biel, who is married to Justin Timberlake, BBC presenter Claire Balding and Rugby star and husband of Zara Philips, Mike Tindall re-tweeted Mr Blythe's call for help on Twitter. He said he was shocked when £1,000 was raised, allowing him to hire a helicopter and pilot for a day, to search the area from the sky. Mr Blythe said: 'We flew over the area and on the third passing we saw him lying down in some grass. 'He looked up at us, he sat up, but he stayed there. 'Then we landed in a field below. I got him in my arms and held him. It was an amazing feeling, but nothing sank in until much later on.' Murphy, who was finally found on Saturday, has lost five kilos but otherwise remains unscathed by his ordeal.

"By . Darren Boyle . Two young woman who admitted stealing almost £800 worth of goods from John Lewis blamed the store's lax security for their crime. Jodie Hastings, 25, and Natasha-Marie Fleming, 23, snatched scooters and hair straighteners worth nearly £800 from the store's flagship store in Oxford Street, central London. The young mothers were snared when they returned to steal from the same shop again just a few days later. But the two thieves were recognised by security guards and arrested, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Jodie Hastings, of Regents Park, left, and Natasha-Marie Fleming, of Tottenham, right, told police that they targeted John Lewis because 'security at the store was so lax, and therefore tempting' Hastings, wearing a black gilet over a grey jumper, and Fleming, dressed smartly in all black, spoke only to confirm their names and plead guilty to theft from a shop. Prosecutor Birgitte Hagem said: 'In the police interview Ms Fleming said they decided they were going to steal because the security at the store was so lax, and was therefore tempting'. District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe fined the pair £490 each for the March 27 theft and handed them each a 12-month conditional discharge. She said: 'It would be nice that people should leave everything unguarded, doors open, cars unlocked and things were not stolen. 'The fact that people are not as security conscious as others is not a reason or excuse for stealing, and should not be a temptation'. Fleming, of Regent's Park, northwest London, and Hastings, of Tottenham, north London, both admitted theft from a shop.

"By . Darren Boyle . A 15-month-old girl nearly choked to death when a safety chain on fairground ride wrapped around her neck. Kyla McMillan, from Hulme, Greater Manchester was enjoying a day out with her family when she almost lost her life. The toddler was sitting on the swing seat as it spun around when she lost her grip and slipped. A safety chain caught her around the neck and prevented her from falling from the ride. Stephanie McMillan watched in horror as her Kyla slipped while sitting on a fairground ride and had a safety chain caught around her neck . Little Kyla suffered bruising around her neck, pictured, when she almost fell from the fairground ride . Kyla slipped from the carousel ride, pictured, ten minutes before this photograph was taken . Her mother Stephanie said Kyla turned red and was coughing and spluttering. Ms McMillan said she was outraged that staff assured her that Kyla, who is just slightly more than two feet tall, was big enough to safely use the ride. Children using the ride sit on metal seats and are secured in place by a piece of chain around their waist. Once the chain is fastened, the ride spins around for several minutes. Little Kyla slipped while sitting on the seat and was held around the neck by the safety chain until she was rescued. Fortunately Kyla, pictured, was not seriously injured during her ordeal . Ms McMillan said she was angered by the fairground's offer to refund the £6.99 cost of the ride . Ms McMillan was at the Manchester Easter Fair in Rushmore when the incident happened. She was with her boyfriend Gareth, and children Kyla, Kade, nine and Che, three. You never think these things are going to happen and when they do it’s a mother’s worst nightmare. Ms McMillan said she thought her daughter was too small to go on the ride but was assured by staff it was safe . According to Ms McMillan: 'She was sat on the swing for a couple of minutes when disaster struck. The chain wrapped fully around her neck and she started to choke. 'Her face was turning red, she was coughing and spluttering, and she started to panic. 'Kyla’s dad and another dad ran over to her and managed to free her. I couldn’t see her and that’s the worse thing for a mother, never knowing if your child is OK. 'I knew she was too small for the ride but I was convinced otherwise. I should have trusted my instincts because mums know best. 'It was a nasty incident and I just hope the people responsible learn from this because I wouldn’t want it to happen to anyone else.' After the shocking incident, Ms McMillan and the children were too upset to continue with their day out. She added: 'The way they handled it was disgusting. To give us £6.99 back when she was almost killed is a joke.' Fun fair manager Krystle Hart said: 'All our rides are approved by the Health and Safety Executive and anually tested. 'The chain is for safety reasons and it did what it was meant to do and stop a child falling.'","Kyla McMillan slipped while sitting on the popular fairground ride .

Jamie Lewis, 23, of Caerphilly, south Wales, has never been able to use his left arm after errors made during his birth. Staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, south Wales, used 'excessive force' during his mother's labour, and damaged nerves in her son's neck, leaving his left arm and hand permanently paralysed, according to lawyers who won the payout. Blunder: Medics at the Royal Gwent Hospital (pictured) in south Wales applied 'excessive force' when Jamie Lewis was born, disabling him for life . His mother, Cheryl Lewis-Thomas, attempted to make a claim against the then Powys local health board when her son was four years old, but couldn't find a firm which would take up her case. She thought her chances of a successful claim were small so gave up - but was persuaded years later to renew her efforts during a meeting with a psychic. She added: 'I visited a psychic in Wales . who told me that my son would win a claim and she could see us very . happy. I thought we had nothing to lose so Jamie decided to give the . claim another go.' Claim: Mr Lewis's mother, Cheryl Lewis-Thomas, was persuaded by a psychic to pursue the case . 'Jamie had a tough childhood growing up with no use in his arm. He was unable to play with other children, use his bicycle and the appearance of his arm also made him a target for bullying. I knew the way he was treated during the birth wasn’t right and it wasn’t any fault of his own.' Spurred on by the spiritual advice, she approached Fletchers Solicitors, who took up her claim and were able to secure the six-figure sum. The Aneurin Bevan local health board, the successor of the organisation responsible for Mr Lewis's treatment at birth, agreed to settle the matter out of court for £450,000. However, it did not admit full liability. Acting solicitor in the case Emma Jordan said if the hospital had admitted the problem when it first occurred then the Mr Lewis’ recovery would likely have been far better. She said: 'Unfortunately, it took over 20 years for Jamie and his mum to achieve justice for what happened. 'The compensation secured for Jamie takes into account the extent of the injuries he suffered and his future needs, and will allow him to enjoy an optimistic future with his wife and two children.'","Medics used 'excessive force' when Jamie Lewis, 23, was born .

The teen stowaway who survived a five-hour flight from California to Hawaii after hiding in the wheel well of a Boeing 767 was on airport grounds for six hours before the plane took off, it has emerged. The 15-year-old boy, who has not been named, climbed over the fence at the airport in San Jose just after 1am on Sunday and the Hawaiian Airlines Flight took off at 7.55am, a federal official told CNN. It is not known when he climbed into the plane's wheel well, but the aircraft was at the airport at 1am. He was found that afternoon on the tarmac in Maui, having miraculously survived the flight. The teen may have been trying to get to Africa to see his mother, Hawaii News Now reported. He was living with his father, stepmother and her children in Santa Clara. Scroll down for videos . Miraculous: The 15-year-old boy who traveled from San Jose to Maui was pictured on a stretcher on Sunday. He has told authorities he doesn't want to go home . After he was found on the tarmac in . Maui on Sunday, he told the FBI he had run away after arguing with his . family - but on Monday, his sister denied this outside their home.

'They are very quiet, very private,' Amy McGinn told KTVU. 'When . I heard there was an argument, that was surprising, because I never . hear anything, like loud noises from the house.' McGinn . added that the boy's father drives a taxi, while the stepmother is mostly seen taking her five children to and from school. The family did not answer the door to reporters, but a woman who claimed she is the older sister of the boy told NBC that he did not have an argument with his family. She added that her brother was physically 'OK' after the trip, but declined to say more. The 15-year-old boy scaled a perimeter fence at San Jose Mineta International Airport on Sunday and climbed into the wheel well of a plane with no knowledge of where the plane was heading. shock that it was the 'quiet' boyHome: The teenage boy who survived a flight in the wheel well of a plane lives at this home in Santa Clara, California.

Disbelief: Neighbor Amy McGinn, pictured, said she has never heard the family make a sound . The FBI has determined that the boy . did not have any plans to threaten civil aviation, but authorities are . questioning how the teenager breached multiple layers of security. 'This was not something he planned . out,' FBI Special Agent Tom Simon said. 'My impression is that he ran . for the first flight he saw... His intention was to run away from home.' Simon said the teen climbed into the left rear wheel well of the first plane he saw in San Jose. 'He got very lucky that he got to go to Maui but he was not targeting Maui as a destination,' he said. He . passed out in the air and didn't regain consciousness until an hour . after the plane landed in Hawaii, Simon said. When he came to, he . climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by airport . personnel who escorted him inside where he was interviewed by the FBI, . Simon said. It was not . immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized space, . where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero and the . air is too thin for humans to stay conscious. An FAA study of stowaways . found that some survive by going into a hibernation-like state. Epic journey: The above graphic shows a Boeing 767 and a map of the route taken by the teenage stowaway . On . Monday, authorities tried to determine how the boy slipped through . multiple layers of security, including wide-ranging video surveillance, . German shepherds and Segway-riding police officers. San Jose International Airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes says airport employees monitor security video feeds from throughout the 1,050-acre airport around the clock. However, she said no one noticed images of an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp and approaching Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 in the dark until security agents reviewed the footage after the plane had landed in Hawaii and the boy had been found. The airport, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is surrounded by fences, although some sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled. The boy found his way onto the tarmac during the night, 'under the cover of darkness,' Barnes said. Hours later, surveillance video at Kahului Airport showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing, according to a statement from Hawaii's Department of Transportation. The video was not released because of the ongoing investigation. Miracle at Kahului Airport: The 15-year-old boy managed to survive for almost 6 hours in freezing temperatures at 38,000 feet during his stolen flight . Security questions: A 15-year-old boy scrambled over a fence at the airport, crossed a tarmac and climbed into a jetliner's wheel well, then flew for five freezing hours, arriving in Hawaii before anyone noticed . A picture of the teen being taken away for medical care, looking awake and alert, was provided to the MailOnline by The Maui News. A congressman who serves on the Homeland Security committee wondered how the teen could have sneaked onto the airfield unnoticed. 'I have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters. Stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed,' tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco Bay Area's eastern cities and suburbs. The FAA says 105 stowaways have sneaked aboard 94 flights worldwide since 1947, and about one out of four survived. But agency studies say the actual numbers are probably higher, as some survivors may have escaped unnoticed, and bodies could fall into the ocean undetected. The FAA found that all wheel-well stowaways will lose consciousness at high altitude from lack of oxygen, and that their freezing bodies go into a state somewhat similar to hibernation. At 38,000 feet - the cruising altitude of the Hawaiian Airlines flight - the outside air temperature is about minus 85 degrees. That would usually be deadly, but some people survive because their breathing, heart rate and brain activity slow down. Plane: This is a 767-300 aircraft - the same model that the teen boy managed to stow himself away in . Staggering: The boy somehow survived unharmed while stowed in the wheel well beneath the plane . The boy was not charged with any crime and has been handed over to child protective services. Simon said the boy was medically screened and found to be unharmed. But news of the survival was met with suspicion, as most wheel-well stowaways don't survive the freezing temperatures and lack of oxygen. Among the skeptics was ABC News aviation consultant John Nance, who said: 'This is a first in medical science and a first in physiology. I just don't believe it.' Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, said to survive such conditions, the body has to fall into a hibernation-like state, with the heart only beating a couple of times a minute. 'It's near impossible, almost miraculous, and maybe there's more to the story,' Besser said. Hawaiian . Airlines Flight 24 to Oakland, California, was delayed nearly three hours . Sunday due to the incident. The flight was scheduled to leave Kahului at . noon and finally departed at 2:51 p.m. Take-off: The teenager sneaked onto the plane at San Jose airport in California (pictured) A male passenger who declined to be . identified said that he was seated on the plane to Oakland with his . family before he was notified of the delay.

Aberdeen on Friday has died in hospital, police said. Preston Flores ran into the street ‘on fire’ near his home after his clothes became doused in petrol and ignited on Saturday. The youngster, who is thought to have suffered 80 per cent burns, may have been deliberately set on fire – or been the victim of a prank gone wrong. Preston's mother Luisza said in a statement on behalf of the family: 'Preston's family want to inform the public that their precious little boy has passed away and is at rest. 'He meant the world to his family and will always be deeply missed and loved. Preston was a special little boy and his loss has ripped our family apart.'

The youngster was taken to hospital in Aberdeen before being transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh where he died today. Preston was a pupil at Sunnybank School in Aberdeen. Its acting headteacher, Michelle McKay, said: 'Preston was a lively and competitive little boy who loved football, PE and all sorts of outdoor activities, as well as board games, baking and building with Lego. 'He was a fun-loving boy with a great sense of humour and lots of friends. He loved his family too, and was always sharing with us the latest news about his new baby brother. 'This is a tragic time for his family, for the school and for everyone connected to it. We are all so saddened by what has happened. His mother said: 'Preston was a special little boy and his loss has ripped our family apart' 'This is a strong and close-knit community, however, and so we are all supporting each other and I am sure that, together, we will find ways of coming to terms with our loss.'

'They weren’t really big but they were enough to do a lot of damage to him.’ Earlier, the schoolboy had been outside enjoying the fine weather, playing with two friends, a boy and a girl, in the street near his home. The tragedy happened shortly before 2pm yesterday afternoon. Local resident Paulina Pilska said she had been watching the children from her window as they jumped on top of a council pick-up van.

"By . Steph Cockroft . An airline pilot asked his passengers if they could 'smell roast chicken' after a flock of seagulls flew into the aircraft's engine. The Thomson holiday jet had just left Cardiff airport when it hit dozens of gulls over the South Wales coast. One hour later the pilot announced to passengers over the tannoy that the plane had been involved in a bird strike. 'Roast chicken': A Thomson flight travelling from Cardiff airport to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt was grounded after a flock of seagulls flew into the airliner's engine. The pilot asked passengers if they could 'smell roast chicken' after the incident took place . The announcement was made while the airliner was flying over Switzerland. The plane immediately turned back to Gatwick Airport in London as a 'precaution', a spokesman for Thomson said. Holidaymaker Dan Tyte was one of more than 100 passengers on the plane headed for Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Mr Tyte, who was travelling with his girlfriend Rebecca, said: 'The captain came on and said: ""I donâ€™t know if you can smell what seems to be like roast chicken. '""We have looked into it and it turns out as we were leaving Cardiff, some seagulls flew into the engine"".' Mr Tyte, who was travelling with his girlfriend Rebecca, said: 'From that it seems like it was quite a dramatic situation. 'But it was handled with such calm assurance by the captain and his crew everyone handled it well. 'The flight itself was really smooth so I suppose safety must come first.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Accused: Leeds United squad player Simon Lenighan, 19, is accused of joining a friend in the rape of a young woman and filming the attack on a phone . A Leeds United footballer joined a friend in the rape of a young woman in a hotel room and filmed the attack on a mobile phone, a jury has heard. Simon Lenighan, 19, is alleged to have carried out the attack with Nathan Campbell in a room at the Etap Hotel in Leeds in August 2012. Prosecutors told the jury that the alleged victim woke up naked and alone the following morning with no idea where she was or how she got there. Her phone and money were missing and she alerted police who found video footage on Campbellâ€™s mobile, the court was told yesterday. Andrew Haslam, prosecuting, told Doncaster Crown Court: 'We say that Nathan Campbell and Simon Lenighan raped her. 'We have a window in to that hotel room. That window shows how the defendants treated and continued to treat her.' Mr . Haslam said the two defendants both used their mobile phones to video . the woman and were heard laughing as they avoided being seen on the . camera. The jury saw footage which showed the woman, who can not be named for legal reasons, lying naked on a bed and intimate shots of her body. At . one point both men are heard using slang words including 'pum pum' and . 'batty' and describing the woman as 'looking a bit stretched'. At one point Campbell, 24, is heard telling the woman, 'Ah yeah it hurts too much - calm down'. Mr . Haslam said Lenighan and Campbell met for the first time on the night . of the alleged incident as they drank in the Tiger Tiger bar in Leeds. The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men. Mr Haslam said friends were concerned for her safety because she had so much to drink, with one describing her as 'very drunk'. Allegations: The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel with the two men, the jury heard . After they were arrested both men admitted having sex with the woman but claimed she was a willing partner, the court heard. Lenighan . claimed they started to have sex but he realised she was too drunk and . she said no.He told her that he fell asleep and did not know what . Campbell was doing. Mr . Haslam said: 'The prosecution say that she was so drunk she could not . give meaningful and proper consent. The capacity to give consent is . affected by drink. Arrival: Lenighan outside Doncaster Crown Court before the trial. He denies denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice . â€œDrunken consent is still consent but if someone becomes so intoxicated their ability to choose can evaporate, it can be lost.' When Campbell was arrested by police they found the video on his mobile phone. He told police that the woman was the instigator and said that he had sex with her. Lenighan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice.

"By . Wills Robinson . For years TV gardeners like Alan . Titchmarsh have advocated putting broken terracotta pieces, or 'crocks', in a pot to protect a plant. But the long-established gardening trick, which is supposed to help water drainage, has been rubbished by experts who claim it can actually harm them. The method, passed down through generations of gardeners, is said to stop the soil becoming too waterlogged. Tradition: The method, which involves covering holes at the bottom of plant pots, has been rubbished by experts who claim it could actually saturate the plant . Now a team of experts at Which? magazine have undermined the claim having carried out a series of controlled tests. They used 40 10-litre pots and planted five 'Million Bells Trailing Yellow' in each one. The perennial plant was chosen because it is known to get root rot in very damp soil. Half of the pots were plastic and half were made of clay, and 50 per cent of these had crocks added to them. Some were also put on saucers . The idea of placing pieces of broken terracotta pots or polystyrene over the hole at the bottom of containers is believed improve drainage and stop waterlogging. Soil . scientists, hydrologists and environmental engineers have however . suggested that when water reaches two different textures, a coarse layer . and a fine layer, the flow can change in peculiar directions. The difference between crocks and the soil is similar to the way sand works on a golf putting green. Putting sand below the surface helps compact the water while also assisting in drainage. However, the water sometimes does not travel between the two layers because of capillary forces. This leaves what scientists call a 'perched' water table above where it should be. This means when there is heavy rain, the plant will remain dry for a short time, but will eventually become saturated. Each container was regularly watered and when the plants had bloomed there was found to be no difference between the pots with crocks in and ones without. Ceri Thomas, editor of Which? Gardening, was part of the team behind the test. She said: 'Despite six-in-ten of gardeners telling us they always use crocks in pots, we found that this made no difference to how well the plants did in our tests. 'In fact, in wet summers crocks can prevent water draining out of the pot and do more harm than good, so think twice before you follow this commonplace habit.' Alan Titchmarsh was not available to address the new research but has previously advised gardeners to use crocks on the BBC gardening website. He states: 'Cover the base of the pot with a layer of crocks (ask at the garden centre they usually have a few broken pots) and cover with a 5cm (2in) layer of gravel. 'This improves drainage and prevents soil washing out of the container.' Colin Brickell, group plant buyer at Haskins garden centre in Ferndown, Dorset, insists that crocks do help container planting. He said: 'At the bottom of most pots you have a large hole or three or four smaller holes. 'If you lay broken terracotta, rubble, or polystyrene on top of the hole, when you put the soil in it won't clog up the hole. 'When the plant is watered, the water can then drain through the crocks and out of the hole. 'We have always put crocks in our pots at Haskins and will continue to do so. 'In January and February they made a big difference because we had so much rain and they helped to stop the plants getting waterlogged.' Myth? The practice, being demonstrated by Sarah Bishop at Acres Garden Centre in Dorset, may prevent the water from effectively draining from the pot . Rubbished: Tests to prove if the method works showed that if there was heavy rain, the plants would become waterlogged . Common: The practice was advocated by gardeners including Alan Titchmarsh .","TV gardeners like Alan Titchmarsh advocated method to stop waterlogging .

Bantick, who was jailed for 12 months at Swansea Crown Court, now faces being discharged from the Royal Navy for the 'uncontrollable attack'. He pleaded guilty to assaulting Tammy Davie and Xhenia Thoncheva, admitting punching each woman in the head three times. He also pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm to another customer, Jeremy Rees, who confronted Bantick about his behaviour. The court heard Bantick punched and kneed Mr Rees 20 times. The victim was left with permanent nerve damage after the attack. Thumbs up: Nathan Bantick puts his thumbs up outside court where he was jailed for 12 months for the 'uncontrollable' attack on Christmas Day. Bantick became angry and said he'd been 'ripped off' when he was told his 30-minute massage was over . The court was told that Bantick and his . brother Christopher were dressed in Santa hats when they visited the . Park Lane massage parlour in Swansea at 3am after a night . out together. Prosecutor James Hartson said: 'Bantick paid for a 30-minute massage and when he was told his 30 minutes were over he became very agitated. 'He started shouting that he hadn’t received his full 30 minutes and said he’s been mugged off. Attack: Bantick, bottom of the picture, was captured on CCTV assaulting a person at the massage parlour on Swansea high street. He had gone to the parlour with his brother wearing a Christmas Santa hat . Aggressive: The Royal Marine commando attacked workers Tammy Davie and Xhenia Thoncheva and also dealt 20 blows to Jeremy Rees, another customer who tried to intervene . 'He shouted aggressively and threatened to hit two masseuses if they didn’t give his money back. 'He punched the plaster board wall near the head of one of the women, grabbed her and pushed her against a wall. 'He took out his military ID saying: “Who do you think the police are going to want to believe, you or me?' Swansea Crown Court heard how Mr Rees then confronted Bantick telling him: 'You can’t do that to women'. Mr Hartson added: 'Bantick then launched a sustained attack punching and kneeing Mr Rees to the body. He dealt him 20 blows in total.' The court heard Bantick also attacked the two women, punching each one of them around three times to the head. Captured: Bantick was seen walking into the parlour on CCTV. After becoming angry, the Royal Marine commando took out his military ID and asked the women 'who the police would believe' He was given his £40 back before kicking Mr Rees 'forcibly to the head'. Bantick fled the parlour but was caught after police issued pictures of him from the CCTV system. When interviewed by police he told them he’s been ripped off and had become angry when they refused a refund. Bantick also admitted causing £875 damage to the massage parlour, which sits above an environmental company in the centre of Swansea. Parlour: The massage parlour, on the top floor of this building on Swansea high street, where the attack took place . Defence barrister Huw Rees-Davies said a prison sentence could mean Bantick is discharged from the Royal Navy. His senior officer was in court. Judge Keith Thomas told him: 'This was a frightening display of aggression. 'You showed your military ID in order to threaten and bully - then you launched a sustained and uncontrollable attack. 'Out of spite and revenge you kicked Mr Rees in the head as he lay defenceless on the floor.'","Nathan Bantick, 22, assaulted the workers on Christmas Day morning .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . Speaker John Bercow was last night accused of putting  MPs’ safety in jeopardy after deciding to ‘sack’ Scotland Yard and bring in private security to take on a high-profile role at the Commons. Mr Bercow was told he was risking ‘disaster’ by agreeing to the privatisation of the airport-style searching and screening of visitors to the Palace of Westminster. The move, agreed with the House of Lords, comes amid complaints that the cost of the Metropolitan Police’s contract for the security of the entire Palace – £31 million a year – is too high. Controversy: It comes just days after Mr Bercow - pictured with his wife Sally and a Metropolitan Police officer -  backed the 'sack[ing' of Scotland Yard and use of private security to take on a high-profile role at the Commons . However, the plan – first revealed by The Mail on Sunday last August – has sparked fury from some MPs. Labour’s Barry Sheerman, who represents Huddersfield, said: ‘This is a recipe for disaster. This kind of privatisation will lead to a lack of security in what is a very vulnerable building. ‘Have people forgotten the level of security during the full IRA challenge and how vigilant we still need to be?’ The MP, who is writing to Mr Bercow to protest, also warned that employing private contractors would lead to much greater turnover of staff. John Bercow has rarely been popular among MPs and has now further irritated them by his plans to replace the Metropolitan Police Force at the Houses of Parliament with a private security firm . The plan has also angered Commons workers, with one saying: ‘It’s a total disgrace. That job of checking on the thousands of visitors who come in here every day is absolutely vital for our safety as well as for the politicians. It can’t be palmed off.’ Despite concerns, the House of Commons’ governing Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, and the equivalent committee in the Lords, have now agreed to the privatisation when the current contract with the Met ends next March, shortly before the Election. A note sent to Commons staff last week said that a ‘specialist commercial provider’ would be sought to operate at the three main public entrances – Portcullis House, Cromwell Green and Black Rod’s Garden in the House of Lords. New security: A note sent to Commons staff last week said that a ¿specialist commercial provider¿ would be sought to operate at the three main public entrances ¿ Portcullis House, Cromwell Green and Black Rod¿s Garden in the House of Lords . Armed protection, policing and other security functions will remain with the Met. Concern over the price of the Met contract has been combined with complaints expressed two years ago that although they had 500 personnel at Westminster, only 20 or 30 were visible at any time. A spokesman for the House Committee, which oversees the running of the Lords, insisted security would not be compromised. And the Met would only say it had been informed of the parliamentary authorities’ ‘preferred option’ for future security arrangements.","Metropolitan Police Force paid £31m a year to guard Palace of Westminster .

"By . James Rush . An animal rights organisation has released undercover video footage of a Canadian veal farm which appears to show calves being forced into small pens, beaten and left to suffer. Mercy For Animals Canada captured the shocking footage over an eight week period at a veal factory farm in Quebec. The footage appears to show the young animals being forced into tiny crates, in which they are unable to turn around, as well as being punched and kicked. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Undercover footage which appears to show calves being forced into small pens and beaten at a Canadian veal factory farm has been released by an animals rights organisation . The footage appears to show the animals being abused at the site in Quebec . The footage, taken over an eight week period, appears to show the animals being kicked and punched . The group also claims sick and injured animals were left to suffer in the crates without proper veterinary care. In one shocking scene, a calf appears to be shot by a rifle. The injured animal however does not die immediately and has to be shot for a second time. The undercover investigation, which took place between December 2013 and February 2014, has now prompted an investigation by Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, CTV News has reported. Krista Osborne, of Mercy For Animals Canada, said: 'Their short lives are filled with fear, violence and prolonged suffering.' Dr. John Webster, Professor of Animal Husbandry at the University of Bristol, and Europe's leading expert on dairy cattle welfare, said: 'In all my experience, this is the worst, cruellest system that I have ever seen, in every sense, housing, health and stockmanship. '[T]he system as seen on the video is now . illegal in Europe, both in regard to individual housing, and denial of . access to solid feed containing sufficient digestible fibre.' The undercover investigation, which took place between December 2013 and February 2014, has now prompted an investigation by Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, it has been reported . The footage shows the calves crammed into tiny pens, in which they are even unable to turn around . The footage has also been shown to Fabien . Fontaine, a member of the Quebec Veal Association and the owner of . Delimax Veal, it has been reported. Delimax delivers the calves to the barn before picking them up to take to the slaughter house and also delivers the milk by-products the calves are fed. Fontaine told CTV W5 that Delimax does not own the operation and described the video as 'sickening and unacceptable.' He also said he had not been aware of any mistreatment of calves at the site and said the future for milk-fed calves in Quebec would soon be more humane. He took a news team to another operation where calves were raised in group pens, had more room to move and were occasionally fed grain and corn as a treat. Andre Blais, Delimax's head of development and commercialization, said the farm was not owned by his company. Mercy For Animals Canada claims sick and injured animals were left to suffer in the crates without proper veterinary care . Veal crates were made illegal in the UK in 1990 and banned by the European Union in 2007 . He told QMI Agency: 'They're not our animals. The people who raise them don't work for us.They are a client, and we sell their services.' Twyla Francois, Mercy For Animals's director of investigations in Canada, told The Huffington Post: 'The Canadian veal industry treats baby calves like mere meat-producing machines. Their short lives are filled with misery, violence, and deprivation.' Mercy For Animals is now calling on the Retail Council of Canada to prohibit veal crates in its members grocers' supply chains. Veal crates were made illegal in the UK in 1990 and banned by the European Union in 2007. A number of U.S. states have also banned crates. The American Veal Association wants them eliminated completely by 2017.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Mercy For Animals Canada captured footage at veal factory farm .

"By . Darren Boyle . A drunken thug who dangled his girlfriend over a major road bridge continued to harass her from behind bars. Adam Scott was jailed for the terrifying incident when he threatened to drop her on to a main road over the pedestrian bridge. But within days he sent letters to his girlfriend from behind bars breaching a restraining order which banned him from any contact with her for life. Adam Scott, pictured, dangled his girlfriend over a pedestrian bridge and threatened to stab her new partner in a letter from behind bars . A court heard the letters were meant to be loving but a judge said one of them threatened the young woman’s new partner by ‘stabbing him in the face’. Scott, 21, was given a suspended jail term after he admitted three breaches of a life long restraining order against his ex lover. But the judge warned him that he will lock him if he makes any contact with his ex-girlfriend again. Exeter Crown Court heard Scott, from Exmouth, Devon, has 27 convictions for 44 offences. Judge Francis Gilbert QC said: 'You have a record for violence and aggressive behaviour, often when in drink.' He said Scott had a restraining order banning him from contact with his father and when he harassed his ex-girlfriend the last time, he also intimidated her and his own mother about giving evidence against him. Adam Scott, 21, dangled his ex-girlfriend from this pedestrian bridge over the main A379 dual carriageway just outside Exeter, Devon . The judge said the latest offences were relevant to what he had done to his ex-girlfriend before. Judge Gilbert said during the bridge incident Scott punched her and pulled her hair before picking her up over the railings and with her head pointing towards the main road below where he threatened to drop her which would have caused her serious injury or worse. A family driving below saw what he was doing and alerted the police and were ‘very shocked by his extreme aggression’. Scott dangled his ex-girfriend from a pedestrian bridge over the A379 just outside Exeter, Devon. The court heard Scott sent her a letter from jail intimidating her saying he held a grudge adding ‘it was far from over and not to underestimate me’. The prosecution said Scott sent three letters to his ex girlfriend in breach of the restraining order in May and July. Judge Francis Gilbert gave Scott a suspended sentence at Exeter Crown Court, pictured, but warned that he would jail the 21-year-old if he tried to make contact with his ex-girlfriend again . Defence lawyer Rupert Taylor said the letters ‘professed his affections for her’ but the judge disagreed saying they caused her ‘considerable harassment’ and threatening to ‘stab’ her new boyfriend ‘in the face’. Mr Taylor said one letter expressed he was ‘truly sorry’ and saying his ex-girlfriend was ‘still the one I miss, love and think about’ but the judge said Scott acted ‘regardless of her wishes’. While Scott wrote telling her she was ‘still the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with’ the judge replied: 'She wants to be left alone. He was jailed for a total of eight months, suspended for two years, and told to pay £100 victim surcharge. The judge warned him that if there are any more breaches of the restraining order he will face more time behind bars, saying: 'You must be very careful.'","Scott had 27 prior convictions relating to 44 earlier offences .

"By . Sara Malm . A hungry bear in the mood for food ended up in a Pooh situation after getting its head stuck in a jar, just like A.A. Milne’s famous honey-loving teddy. Police had to be called to the scene in Ontario, Canada, after the bear was spotted walking down a street with the large white container on its head. The Winnie-the-Pooh-a-like had been looking for a snack, discovering the plastic jar which had been used to store birdseed. Oh Pooh: The unfortunate bear had been looking for left-over birdseed, but ended up with the large white jar stuck on its head . Greater Sudbury Police responded to a call around 5.30am on Sunday after the unfortunate bear had been sighted by a member of the public. The poor bear could not get the jar off its head and ended up wandering down the street, bumping into things as it went - including a police cruiser. Officers from Greater Sudbury Police called the Ministry of Natural Resources who tranquillised the bear. They were able to cut the container to remove it, and the real life Winnie-the-Pooh is set to be relocated. Oh, bother: Police had to be called to the scene in Greater Sudbury in Ontario, Canada, after the bear was walking down the street with the jar on its head, bumping into things as it went .

Their adventures often see the honey-loving teddy bear get his head stuck in jars in his quest to eat all the ‘hunny’.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron is hosting arch-Eurocrat Herman Van Rompuy for dinner at Chequers tonight, just weeks before crucial European elections. The Tory leader will dine with the President of the European Council, who is also due to stay the night at the Prime Minister’s official rural retreat. Nigel Farage said the timing of Mr Cameron’s intimate meal with the Brussels bureaucrat ‘could not be better’ as Ukip prepared to unveil a £1.5million poster campaign attacking immigration from the EU. David Cameron has invited President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, for dinner at Chequers . Mr Van Rompuy is expected to stay the night at Chequers, although Downing Street would not comment on whether he would be served a continental breakfast . Mr Cameron has sought to win back disaffected Tories who have been won over by Ukip with the promise of an in-out referendum. The Prime Minister says he will claw back powers from Brussels, before staging a vote by the end of 2017. He has held a series of meetings with other European leaders who also want to see reform, particularly over access to benefits by EU migrants and red-tape strangling business. Ukip is poised to top the polls in European Parliament elections on May 22. But Mr Cameron’s decision to give Mr Van Rompuy the honour of dinner at Chequers will be contrasted with Ukip's regional push to appeal to voters concerned about immigration. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'This is one of a number of meetings that President Van Rompuy is having with heads of government around Europe. 'It is an opporunity to talk around the future direction of the next European Commission and EU reform priorities. 'Also I am sure they will discuss the latest on the situation in Ukraine. It is a working dinner.' The spokesman confirmed Mr Van Rompuy would also be staying the night: 'If someone is coming for dinner in the evening, it is polite to ask them to stay the night.' However, he refused to be drawn on whether he would be served a continental breakfast tomorrow morning. Ukip leader Nigel Farage contrasted the dinner at Chequers with his own trip to Sheffield today to launch his controversial posters . Mr Farage told MailOnline voters on May 22 could deliver a 'severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake' But Mr Farage told MailOnline: 'How entirely and utterly appropriate. David Cameron equals Herman Van Rompuy. Nigel Farage equals Sheffield.’ ‘It says absolutely everything about David Cameron. The timing could not be better. ‘This is a European election that matters. You can make a difference. If you are with us and the 77 per cent people who think immigration needs to be controlled, vote Ukip. ‘You could deliver a severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake on May 22.’ However, Ukip has become embroiled in a fresh racism row after it unveiled the billboards which will appear across the country in the run-up to polling day. The party has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’ Controversial: . Ukip's new posters are being funded by £1.5m of funding from . millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Skyes to launch its biggest ever . publicity drive ahead of the European Parliament elections in May . Adverts: Under the slogan 'take back control of . our country', the party complain that 75 per cent of British laws are made . in Brussels and that UK taxpayers fund the 'celebrity lifestyle' of EU . bureaucrats . Another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.’ All the posters call on voters to ‘Take Back Control of Our Country’ by backing Ukip in the European elections. Tory MP Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, wrote on Twitter: ‘At a time when our country really needs to come together, the Ukip advertising campaign is deeply divisive, offensive and ignorant.’ Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth said: ‘UKIP would have us believe they stand for working people but the truth is very different - they're even more right wing than the Tories. ‘A vote for UKIP is a vote for higher taxes for working families, charges to see your GP, huge tax giveaways for the rich and even deeper cuts to public services. Only Labour can make Britain better off.’ Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said the posters were ‘extreme even by the standards of the Front Nationale’, the French far right party Mr Farage has tried to distance Ukip from.","Red carpet rolled out for European Council President Herman Van Rompuy .

But there is nothing delicate about this rampant houseplant now - after it has enjoyed a fantastic growth spurt every year for half a decade. Gloria Baptist-Smith was given this red Clivia - an African species of plant - as a present seven years ago. Huge: Gloria Baptist-Smith was shocked when her pot-plant shot up and began produced oversized blooms . Before: The plant started out being tiny enough to keep in a tea-cup, and would have been even smaller than this specimen (file photo) And for the first two, its blooms remained decidedly manageable as the houseplant unobtrusively stayed in its diminutive terracotta home. But five years ago the plant began enjoying phenomenal growth - and has to be contained by a huge plastic bucket after it shot up to be almost five feet tall. Huge: The blooms, which last for around three weeks, are astonishingly large . Ms Baptist-Smith, from Burgess Hill in West Sussex, was astonished by the progress her pot plant has made - especially as she confesses to being far from green-fingered. She said: 'I'm not terribly good with plants, and I didn't expect anything really to come of it. 'For a while it just seemed to be fine, then suddenly, over the last five years or so, it has grown almost a foot every year. 'The bright red blooms it produces are bigger than my head. It reminds me of a triffid - the blooms are just massive.' Clivia are a species native to South Africa and Swaziland. They are a popular houseplant which are - in general - easy to maintain. According to the Chicago Botanic Garden, if cared for correctly the plants will burst into colour right in the very depths of winter. However, the plants are slow to grow, and often take several years to lay their roots before they are capable of springing up as Ms Baptist-Smith's specimen appears to have done. It is not unusual for a Clivia to reach heights of two or three feet once fully mature.","Gloria Baptist-Smith received plant seven years ago - and it hardly grew .

"By . Wills Robinson . Craig Dutton, 21, received two more years in jail after calling officers from his prison cell, asking whether he would be charged with drugs possession . A prisoner has been handed two more years in jail after he phoned police from his cell to ask whether they had forgotten about the cocaine he was carrying when he was arrested. 'Honest' Craig Dutton, 21, called officers from a young offenders’ institution to find out if he was going to be charged with possessing class A drugs after not hearing from them. He was four months into an 18-month sentence after taking police on a high-speed chase in a stolen BMW. When he was arrested in December, after crashing into a taxi, police found 16.2 grams crack cocaine in his possession. Dutton was jailed on Christmas Eve for aggravated vehicle taking without consent, driving while disqualified and without insurance. Now he has landed himself two more years behind bars after being brought back to Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to possession of a Class A drug. Police officers said they were awaiting test results on the drugs before deciding whether to bring extra charges when Dutton rang them from HMYOI Brinsford. Prosecutor Heather Chamberlain told the court Dutton was in debt to a dealer and feared he would be beaten up if he did not hold the drugs for him. She said: 'He was prosecuted for a driving offence and it was while he was in custody for that offence that he contacted police and said, ""What’s happening about these drugs?"" and asked to be interviewed. 'He was interviewed while in custody. He said he had a phone call to pick the drugs up and was to keep them until the dealer wanted them. 'He knew it was cocaine. He said he is not a user himself but was in debt to the dealer for £100 so he owed him and did that job for him.' The court heard Dutton has 18 previous convictions for 32 offences. He has now been transferred to an adult jail for the first time. Dutton’s latest crime comes five . years after he took part in a pilot police boxing scheme aimed at . getting young troublemakers off the streets. Stuart . Muldoon, mitigating, said: 'Although he has previous convictions, there . are none for drugs. He’s still young. Going to HMP Dovegate will be his . first experience of an adult prison.' Sentencing . him two years to run consecutively with his earlier sentence, Judge . Paul Glenn said: 'You are still only 21 and have been in quite a lot of . trouble from the age of 12 but nothing previously relating to drugs. Transfer: Dutton will be moved from the young offenders' institution to Category B prison HMP Dovegate . 'On December 24 I sentenced you on other matters. Those offences were committed on the same day as this one. 'Police found drugs when you were arrested. They are valued in the region of £1,200 and you told police in interview you were holding the drugs for someone else who you knew to be a dealer. 'Crack cocaine is highly addictive and those connected in the supply expect significant sentences and you knew you were associating with someone who was actively drug dealing.' A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'This was a possession with intent to supply class A drug offence. 'We require forensic evidence from the lab to identify the drugs and establish exactly what they are. 'We then need police drugs experts to give a street value and that means it can take time to bring the charges.'","Craig Dutton, 21, called officers from a young offenders' institution .

"By . Claire Coleman . After years of experimentation, I can now apply a smoky eye with the best of them and know exactly what foundation suits my face. But the problem comes when I run out of contact lenses and have to wear my glasses, usually reserved for nights in with the TV. Suddenly my carefully applied eye make-up looks a bit wrong. Fortunately, a new book, Everything Eyes, by make-up guru Bobbi Brown, gives spec-specific tips for girls who wear glasses. We put them to the test . . . Specs appeal: Claire tries out Bobbi Brown's tips . Since most people who wear glasses have frames that allow at least the top of their eyebrows to be seen, keeping them neat and well defined is key. It’s very hard using tweezers to get a sharp line, so if you do want to remove hairs, opt for threading for a perfectly straight brow. Bobbi recommends defining brows with a product the same colour as your hair, so your glasses don’t overpower your face. We used a blend of powder and wax — the Smashbox Brow Tech Trio  (£17, smashbox.co.uk) — applied with a fine brush to fill in gaps, tame rogue hairs and give a clean,  full line. Bobbi says the glass in your frames can highlight under-eye discolouration and darkness — bad news for anyone who suffers from dark circles or bags. Look for peach-toned concealers that will neutralise grey or blue and make the area look brighter without bleaching it out. Benefit’s Boi-ing concealer (£17.50, benefitcosmetics.co.uk) comes in five shades and hides shadows without looking creased or caked. Bobbi says your eyeshadow shouldn’t compete with your glasses, so it’s best to keep things neutral . If you’re long-sighted, your lenses can magnify your eyes — while if you’re short-sighted, you may find your specs make your eyes look smaller. Either way, you tend not to see as much of the eye socket, so the outline of the eye should be the focus of applying make-up rather than the lid. Bobbi says your eyeshadow shouldn’t compete with your glasses, so it’s best to keep things neutral. A cream shadow will give a bit of a sheen as a counterpoint to the very matte base — we used Maybelline Color Tattoo 24hr Cream Gel Shadow in Pink Gold (£4.99, boots.com). Bobbi’s golden rule is that eyeliner is key because it adds definition. And whether your eyes look big or small through your lenses, a clean sweep of eyeliner won’t leave you looking squinty or bug-eyed. Use a liquid liner pen to draw a solid line across the top — Charlotte Tilbury’s Quick Fine Line Shodo Pen (£22, charlottetilbury.com) makes it very easy. Spectacle wearers spend an average of £149 a year on glasses . Then, to give the tops of the eyes even more definition, use a kohl liner on the top water line, just inside the eyelid. Urban Decay’s Glide-on (£15, debenhams.com) is soft to apply but waterproof and long-lasting. On the lower water line, just inside the lid, use a liner that will open the eye up — white is too harsh, so look for a metallic cream, a pale gold or a pale metallic pink like By Terry’s Kohl in Opaline Flash (£23, spacenk.com). For a cheaper option, seek out Avon’s SuperShock Gel Eyeliner Pencil (£2, avonshop.co.uk). Most glasses sit far enough from the eyes so that, even when curled, lashes shouldn’t hit the lenses, so curl them  as you normally would, at the base to open up the eye. But when it comes to mascara, rather than going for  a lengthening one, look for one that will thicken and give volume instead. Chanel’s Le Volume de Chanel (£24, houseoffraser.co.uk) makes lashes look thick and full without clumping. Keep the bottom lashes free of mascara as — like the glasses frame — this can cast shadows under the eye, making it look very dark. And, if your lashes do hit your lenses, Bobbi suggests opting for a waterproof mascara that won’t smudge. Without glasses: After years of experimentation, Clarie is confident in her make-up routine when she is wearing her contact lenses . Use a matte foundation to stop the slide of glasses down your face — try Laura Mercier Oil Free Supreme Foundation (£34, spacenk.com). To avoid your blusher clashing with the lower part of your glasses, avoid putting colour on the apples of your cheeks and instead contour your face and give it structure. Use a powder blusher to keep your face matte, suck in your cheeks and, working from the outside edge, sweep a bronzer or brownish pink blusher into the hollow — try Mac’s Powder Blush in Cubic (£18, maccosmetics.co.uk). The old adage says you should pick lips or eyes to emphasise. But although the eye area is defined with glasses, they can also act as a barrier to your peepers, so you can get away with using a dramatic shade on your lips — we went for Mac’s Relentlessly Red Lipstick (£15, maccosmetics.co.uk) with Nars Jungle Red Lipliner (£16.50, narscosmetics.co.uk). Everything Eyes by Bobbi Brown is published by Chronicle Books, £10.99.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Sentinel has provided a tantalising glimpse into the incredible radar imagery it will provide from its 435 mile (700km) perch above the Earth. The satellite, launched earlier this month, is on an ambitious mission to provide data for Europe’s Copernicus environmental monitoring programme. Rather aptly, its first image is a stunning mosaic of Brussels in Belgium - the seat of the European Commission who are leading the mission. Taken on 12 April 2014, just nine days after launch, this first image from Sentinel-1A captures Brussels and surrounds in Belgium. The image also shows a more detailed view of the city in the 'zoom in'. Antwerp harbour is visible in the top left. The green colours correspond to vegetation, red-blue to urban areas, white to high-density urban areas and black to waterways and low-reflective areas such as airport runways . It clearly captures the dense urban environment of Brussels shown in white in the middle of the picture. Antwerp can be seen in the top left in red –blue colours and the greens depict vegetation in the surrounding areas. Waterways and low-reflective areas such as airport runways appear black. Among other applications, images such as this will be used for urban planning, for monitoring agriculture and for managing water resources. This first set of images also includes an area in Namibia that is currently flooded by the Zambezi river. An area over the northern part of the Antarctica Peninsula. The image was taken using radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. The colours indicate how the land, ice and water reflect the radar signal differently . This image covers parts of Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. With Pine Island Glacier in a state of irreversible retreat, Sentinel-1 is set to be an vital tool for monitoring such glaciers as well as for providing timely information on many other aspects of the polar regions, such as sea ice and icebergs . Launch: 3 April 2014 at Kourou, French Guiana . Life: Minimum of seven years . Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs) Instrument: C-band synthetic aperture radar . Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high . Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes . Sentinel-1A’s ability to ‘see’ through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring floods and for offering images for emergency response. This is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. Radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded, but materials like metal, rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods.  It also makes no different to radar if the Earth is in darkness. In fact, the Caprivi plain was shrouded in thick cloud when the satellite acquired the image on 13 April. One of the images acquired on the same day focuses on Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica. This glacier is in a state of ‘irreversible retreat’ so it is important to keep a very close eye on glaciers such as these as they lose ice to the ocean. Another image reveals a section over the northern part of the Antarctica Peninsula. The colours indicate how the land, ice and water reflect the radar signal differently. As well as monitoring glaciers, Sentinel-1A is poised to generate timely maps of sea-ice conditions, particularly for the increasingly busy Arctic waters. This image reveals the extent of flooding in the Caprivi plain from the Zambezi River in Namibia. Victoria Falls is also featured in the image, further east along the Zambezi River. The image was downloaded two hours after data was received and the resulting products were available in less than an hour . Since it was launched from Europe¿s Spaceport in French Guiana, Sentinel-1A has undertaken a complicated routine to deploy its 39ft (12m) long radar and two 32 ft (10m) long solar wings (pictured), as well as passing a series of initial instrument checks . Images from its advanced radar can be used to distinguish clearly between the thinner more navigable first-year ice and the hazardous, much thicker multiyear ice to help assure safe year-round navigation in polar waters. Since it was launched from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, Sentinel-1A has undertaken a complicated routine to deploy its 39ft (12m) long radar and two 32 ft (10m) long solar wings, as well as passing a series of initial instrument checks. Engineers still need to refine Sentinel's 435 mile (700km) high orbit by firing the spacecraft’s thruster. The director of Esa’s Earth Observation Programmes, Volker Liebig, said: ‘We are exceptionally happy with this first set of images. ‘We are in very early days of the satellite’s life in orbit and ground segment operations, but these images certainly demonstrate the calibre of data this advanced radar mission will bring from its different imaging modes, and how it will provide essential data for Copernicus services to benefit us all.’ Sentinel-1A (pictured here at launch) is the first satellite built for the Copernicus environmental monitoring programme. It willl be used to monitor many aspects of the Earth's environment, from detecting and tracking oil spills to mapping sea ice and monitoring movement in land surfaces .","The satellite, launched earlier this month, is on an ambitious mission to provide environmental data on the Earth .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . We often think of emoticons arriving with the invention of text speak - when people first started to send messages using mobile phones and in emails. But the first emoticon – specifically the smiley face – could have been used much earlier. Literary critic Levi Stahl came across a poem written in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of the smiley face emoticon, or ':)'. Emoticon or typo? Literary critic Levi Stahl came across a poem written by English civil ar poet Robert Herrick in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of ':)'. The possible emoticon appears in the second line of his poem, 'To Fortune' (pictured) The questionable emoticon appears in the second line of English civil war poet Robert Herrick's verse, entitled ‘To Fortune’. The first couple of lines read:  ‘Tumble me down, and I will sitUpon my ruins, (smiling yet:)’ He wanted to know whether the mark was a typo in his poetry book 'Hesperides' so he checked it against a two-volume version of Herrick’s poetry published by Oxford University Press last year. He found that the ‘emoticon’ is included. The literary critic explained Herrick's poetry is rich in wit, so it's possible that the smiley face was used deliberately. An illustration of the poet's bust is pictured . Mr Stahl wrote on his blog: ‘Herrick's poetry is rich in wit, so it's not entirely out of the bounds of possibility that this is something more than a punctuational oddity.’ If the mark is deliberately made to show a smile, it would predate another ‘emoticon’ by some two hundred years. That emotional piece of punctuation was found in a New York Times transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln’s speeches in 2009, according to the newspaper’s City Room blog. It reads: FELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion, [applause] but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves, (applause and laughter ;) and I offer, in justification of myself and of you, that, upon examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution against. [Renewed applause.] . However, writing in the New Atlantis, which describes itself as a 'journal of technology and society',  Alan Jacobs says: 'I hate to be a party pooper — no, really: I hate it — but I just don't think Levi Stahl has found an emoticon in a seventeenth-century poem — nor, for that matter, that Jennifer 8. Lee found one from 1862.’ If the mark in the poem was deliberately made to show a smile (pictured), it would predate another 'emoticon' by some two hundred years, which was found in a New York Times transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln's speeches in 2009 . Emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works, Australian researchers have claimed. They say the use of the punctuation faces trigger parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at real faces. They believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face. 'Emoticons are a new form of language that we're producing,' Dr Owen Churches of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide told ABC News. 'And to decode that language we've produced a new pattern of brain activity.' The researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to 'read' them for emotion. The team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons. They showed 20 participants images of real faces, smiley face emoticons and a meaningless string of characters. They used electrophysiology to determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the participants viewed the different images, and found we react to emoticons ion the same way. 'There is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with. Before 1982 there would be no reason that ':-)' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we've learnt that this represents a face,"" said Dr Churches. 'This is an entirely culturally-created neural response. It's really quite amazing.' He said: ‘If we were really serious . about finding out whether Robert Herrick had used an emoticon, we’d look . for his manuscripts - since we could never be sure that his printers . had carried out his wishes accurately, especially in those days of . highly variable printing practices.’ He . looked up a 19th century version of the work and found that there was . no ‘emoticon’. But as the original manuscripts are not available, the . mark may remain a mystery. However, despite literary spots, Scott Fahlman, of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, wrote in a blog post: 'Yes, I am the inventor of the sideways 'smiley face' (sometimes called an emoticon) that is commonly used in e-mail, chat, and newsgroup posts.  Or at least I’m one of the inventors.' According to the professor, they came to be used in the early 1980s among the computer science department's online bulletin boards where a mixture of serious and jokey messages were posted. 'In at least one case, a humorous remark was interpreted by someone as a serious safety warning,' he writes. 'Some people suggested marking posts to show that they were not serious. Various 'joke markers'  were suggested and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution,' he said. 'In the same post, I also suggested the use of :-( to indicate that a message was meant to be taken seriously, though that symbol quickly evolved into a marker for displeasure, frustration, or anger.' Professor Fahlman said that the convention caught on quickly around the university and soon spread to other institutions and research labs via primitive computer networks.","Smiley face was discovered in a poem written by Robert Herrick in 1648 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Some people have a force-field of terrible breath or feet that smell so repellent that insoles are never enough to dampen the disgusting odour. And while people have their own unique scent, it is a surprisingly select cocktail of chemicals that create the distinctive and disgusting aromas associated with bad body odour. An British graduate chemist and secondary school teacher has created an infographic to pinpoint the compounds and the particular smells they bring to underarm odours and even flatulence. Brace yourself: A British graduate chemist and secondary school teacher has created an infographic (pictured) to pinpoint the chemical compounds and the particular smells they bring to underarm odours and even flatulence . Bad breath is the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, hydrogen sulphide and dimethyl sulphide. They produce a blend of odours including sulphur, garlic, rotting eggs and cabbage. Flatulence is a blend of the same three chemical compounds responsible for bad breath. Feet really do smell cheesy as the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, propanoic acid and isovaleric acid. The result is a horrible odour reminscient of sulphur, garlic, sourness and cheese. Underarm odour is largely the product of another three compounds: (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid. Most people's sweaty armpits smell of a combination of goat, onion and cumin. The anonymous blogger started publishing his infographics four months ago after creating some posters to brighten up his classroom and hopes to explain the chemistry of everyday substances and problems on his Compound Interest blog, where he also sells his creations. It is well known that in most cases, halitosis, or bad breath, is the product of bacteria in the mouth, which produce waste products and chemical compounds. But many people don’t know that the main offenders are volatile sulphur compounds, including hydrogen sulphide, which smells of rotten eggs, methanethiol, which resembles gone-off cabbage and dimethyl sulphide, which is a little bit like garlic. At low levels, these compounds aren’t detected by the human nose, but it doesn’t take a great deal for them to become noticeable and put off a partner. Certain foods and drinks can also make the problem worse – or at least more distinctive. As well as the three primary offenders, the compound called 3-mercapto-3-methylbutylformate is produced when someone drinks coffee and gives their breath a nasty tang. Garlic breath is attributed to allyl methyl sulphide - a product of the breakdown of garlic - and eating meat and fish can make your breath smell like a rotting corpse. What a whiff: Feet really do smell cheesy as the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, propanoic acid and isovaleric acid. The result is a horrible odour reminscient of sulphur, garlic, sourness and cheese . This is because the bacteria that produce volatile sulphur compounds thrive on proteins and produce extra compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine, which smell of rotting human bodies and fish. In a rather disgusting study, it was ‘proved’ that sulphur-containing organic compounds are produced in the digestive system and are to blame for flatulence. Hydrogen sulphide, methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide – all of which contribute to bad breath – are again the main offenders. Experts used a combination of gas chromatography and ‘smell experts’ to identify the compounds. Bad date: Terrible breath is the result of three main chemical compounds: methanethiol, hydrogen sulphide and dimethyl sulphide. They produce a blend of odours including sulphur, garlic, rotting eggs and cabbage . Step away from the cuppa: Certain foods and drinks can make the bad breath worse ¿ or at least more distinctive. As well as the three primary offenders (illustrated), the compound called 3-mercapto-3-methylbutylformate is produced when someone drinks coffee and gives their breath a nasty tang . A total of 16 participants were fed 0.44lbs (200g) of pinto beans and samples of their gas were collected and handed over to three judges with the dubious expertise of being able to identify the different sulphur-containing gases. As well as rating the odours from mild to offensive, they discovered that women typically emit a higher concentration of hydrogen sulphide, which smells of rotten eggs, and consequently their gassy emissions are more pungent than men’s. However, they also noted that men generate ‘a greater volume of gas per passage’ so it seems both sexes have undesirable abilities. There are approximately one million bacteria per square centimetre on your underarms, which can smell if left unwashed. Time to upgrade the deodorant? Underarm odour is largely the product of another three compounds: (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, (S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid. Most people's sweaty armpits smell of a combination of goat (pictured left), onion (right) and cumin, if stale and unwashed . Eew! There are approximately one million bacteria per centimetre squared on your underarms, which can smell of goat and onion (illustrated) if left unwashed . There are two organic compounds responsible for undesirable odours that don’t contain sulphur. One is 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid - which is recognisable as that nasty sweaty smell and has been described by experts as ‘goat-like’ - and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid that makes a cumin-like smell. Another compound called 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol along with other sulphurous compounds provides an onion-like note. Like with underarms, the presence of sweat provides a helpful environment for bacteria to thrive and produce noxious compounds. Two of the main contributors to ‘cheesy’ feet are propanoic acid and isovaleric acid. Propanoic acid is described as ‘pungent, sour and rancid’, while the cheesy smell comes from isovaleric acid, which is also said to smell ‘rancid and fermented’. Isovaleric acid is produced as the result of bacteria also found in certain pungent cheeses. Battle of the sexes? Experts discovered that women typically emit a higher concentration of hydrogen sulphide, which smells of rotten eggs, and consequently  produce more pungent flatulence than men .","Graphic was created by a British graduate chemist and secondary school teacher to pinpoint chemical compounds and the smells they create .

"By . Kirk Maltais . The Democratic candidate for Governor in Maryland slammed his opponent on Monday, claiming that Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown was someone that 'had never managed anyone, never run anything,' and was not up to the task of handling 'a real job,' despite being a veteran of the Iraq war. The comment, made by Doug Gansler, Maryland's Attorney General, was made on Monday morning in front of a crowd gathered for a Gubernatorial Candidate forum, and has since sparked outrage from veteran's activist group VoteVets, who have accused Gansler of making a 'horrible insult' to war veterans. The group is demanding an immediate apology from Gansler. 'I’m running against somebody who has never managed anybody, never run . anything, his ads are about how he’s a lawyer in Iraq, and that’s all . fine and good but this is a real job,' Gansler told the crowd in Rockville, Maryland. Scroll down for video . Democratic gubernatorial candidate Douglas Gansler during his speech in front of a Gubernatorial Candidate forum in Rockville, Maryland on Monday. Gansler criticized his opponent as someone who has 'never run anything' VoteVets released a statement later in the day, demanding that Gansler apologize for his words. 'Doug Gansler needs to stop smearing those of us who served in Iraq as not having had a ""real job.""' said Jon Soltz, chairman of VoteVets.org and fellow Iraqi war vet. 'It’s a horrible insult to all those men and women who put their . lives on the line, and especially those who died, in service to this . country.' In a press release, Soltz asserted that: 'This kind of slime ball politics is what turns people off to our . democratic process, so Mr. Gansler is doing no favors for Maryland or . our democratic electoral system by playing in the gutter like this.' Gansler later sought to clarify his statements, saying that he has 'the utmost respect for veterans,' and asserting that his comments were in reference to his opponent's failed roll-out of Obamacare and his leadership skills, not his military service. 'The point I was trying to make,' said Gansler in his statement 'is that Anthony Brown's only attempt to . lead as lieutenant governor was the unmitigated debacle of the health . exchange website that denied Marylanders access to health care and cost . taxpayers nearly $200 million.'

"By . Leon Watson . A newly-discovered lizard-like creature that lived more than 300 million years ago is believed to be the earliest known ancestor of plant-eating mammals. Eocasea martini, which measured less than eight inches long, marked a pivotal transition from carnivores to herbivores on the land. Scientists showed that a partial skeleton of a juvenile specimen found in Kansas, belonged to the caseid branch of a family of early mammal-like reptiles called synapsids. The University of Toronto released this artist's impression of the tiny mammal ancestor eocasea in the footprint of its much larger herbivorous descendent Cotylorhynchus . Although a carnivore feeding on insects, its larger descendants were herbivores. 'Eocasea is one of the oldest relatives of modern mammals and closes a gap of about 20 million years to the next youngest members of the caseid family,' said Dr Jorg Froebisch, from Humboldt university in Berlin, Germany. 'This shows that caseid synapsids were much more ancient than previously documented in the fossil record.' Canadian colleague Professor Robert Reisz, from the University of Toronto, said: 'The evolution of herbivory was revolutionary to life on land because it meant terrestrial vertebrates could directly access the vast resources provided by terrestrial plants. Scientists at the University of Toronto showed that a partial skeleton of a juvenile specimen found in Kansas . 'These herbivores in turn became a major food resource for large land predators. 'Eocasea is the first animal to start the process that has resulted in a terrestrial ecosystem with many plant eaters supporting fewer and fewer top predators.' The research is published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE. It suggests plant-eating first evolved in the distant relatives of mammals some 30 million years before the ancestors of dinosaurs, birds, and modern reptiles adopted the same behaviour.","Eocasea martini marked transition from carnivores to .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Female Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land isn't going put up with accusations that she'd work against women if elected. The Michigan Republican shot down claims that Republicans are engaged in a 'War on Women' in a snarky new ad released Tuesday morning. In the ad, Land, former Michigan Secretary of State, makes fun of her male opponent, three-term Rep. Gary Peters, for attacking her on women's issues, boasting, 'as a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters.' Battle of the Sexes: Michigan Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land, a Republican, mocks her male opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters, in a new ad for claiming she would work against women if elected . 'Really? Think about that for a moment,' Land asks before taking a sip of coffee, shaking her head disapprovingly and looking at her watch . Land and Peters, a Democrat, are vying to replace retiring Democratic lawmaker Carl Levin in the U.S. Senate. Polling shows the two candidates in a dead heat. Neither Peters nor his allies have outright used the 'War on Women' jab at Land. Both have knocked Land for opposing the health reform law, though, which Democrats say offers women better access to care than Republican alternatives. Peters spokeswoman Haley Morris told the Detroit Free Press last month that Land would “cut access to preventative health services like mammograms, cancer screenings and prenatal care and … let insurance companies go back to dropping people’s coverage when they get sick.” Democratic Rep. and Michigan Senate candidate Gary Peters has not accused Land outright of participating in a 'War on Women,' but his campaign has argued that she would restrict women's access to health measures . A Service Employees International Union (SEIU) ad released Monday charges that Land and 'billionaire special interests' are out to 'gang up' on Michigan families. 'Insurance companies could go back to charging women more,' the ad alleges. 'It would be harder for women to get equal pay. And Land would even cut access to preventative care like mammograms.' Land's new 30 second ad doesn't provide any reasons as to why she would be better suited to represent Michigan women in the Senate other than the fact that she is a woman. 'Congressman Gary Peters and his buddies want you to believe I'm waging a war on women. Really? Think about that for a moment,' Land asks as game show style music begins playing in the background. She then takes a sip of coffee, shakes her head disapprovingly and looks at her watch before saying, 'I''m Terry Lynn Land, and I approve this message because as a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters.' 'The purpose of this ad is to set the stage for the rest of the campaign and show the absurdity of the Democrats’ strategy to leverage the war on women against Terri,' Land's campaign strategist John Yob told reporters in an email. 'Terri Lynn Land has an impeccable record advocating for working women — developing management programs that resulted in more women managers statewide and implementing flexible time for working moms. She also has the vision to get both women and men back to work.' Not so, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman Regan Page fired back in a statement posted on the organization's website. 'Terri Lynn Land is on the wrong side of pay equity and health care issues important to Michigan women and her 30-second gimmick to distract from her record and poke fun at women’s issues shows just how out of touch she really is.' 'Michigan women deserve a leader in Washington that will fight for pay equity, and women’s health care and it’s clear Terri Lynn Land will do neither.' Democrats relentlessly went after Republicans in 2012 for 'being on the wrong side of women's issues.' Even President Barack Obama claimed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was offering women a 'sketchy deal.' 'Democrats were successful in their war-on-women messaging last election because we didn’t fight back, Republican National Committee press secretary Kirsten Kukowski told Politico earlier this month. 'We need to turn the table, tell voters the Democrats are being deceptive and bring our viewpoints to the table, which is exactly what we’re doing.'

Cup of cheer: Gerrard holds the FA Cup aloft after his heroic performance in the 2006 final . The . competition for that accolade is huge when you consider the candidates. Thierry Henry, for instance, was the most complete striker this country . has seen, an exhilarating blend of speed, skill and strength, who led . Arsenal’s line with class and distinction. Alan . Shearer was a goal-machine who carried Blackburn to the title in 1995, . served England proudly, then immortalised himself on his native Tyneside with his exploits for Newcastle. He would have won more medals . going elsewhere but his reputation was never diminished.

He is now 40 but remains Manchester . United’s best player. Others . deserve, of course, mentioning. Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira; .

Longevity: Ryan Giggs has played in every season during the Premier League era for Manchester United . Yet should . Gerrard, who has reinvented himself this season as a deep-lying . midfielder and is flourishing in the role, win the league, he would . stand apart. For all that . Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have been sensational, do not mistake . that Gerrard is the driving force in this title charge and he is . performing with the same grit and hunger that was so evident on the road . to Istanbul. You only needed to see him charging into tackles and bombing forward against City to realise how much this means to him. It . was captured, perfectly, in that huddle, when he called his team-mates . together and implored them to remain focused as they close in on . history. Pure emotion: Gerrard wiped away the tears before delivering a stirring post-match team talk to his players . Leader: Gerrard delivered an impassioned speech saying the players needed to keep their feet on the ground . He has hit a . number of Liverpool landmarks recently, leapfrogging Kenny Dalglish in the list of . all time scorers and moving alongside Ray Clemence and Emlyn Hughes on . 665 appearances, but the one that he craves most of all, the one he has . chased since he emerged as a spindly-legged 18-year-old, is ending the . drought that goes back to 1990. 'You . know what I said to those players in that huddle,’ Gerrard said. ‘I . think the important thing now is not to get carried away by that result. We need to stay calm, focused and we’ve got all week to prepare for . Norwich, they are fighting for their lives. 'We . showed that against Fulham, West Ham and Sunderland, on our journey . that those teams are just as tough. The scenes were and obviously the . fans are very happy.

"By . Binky Felstead . Last week I told you about my trip to Bologna for Cosmoprof Worldwide - a giant international trade show for the professional beauty and cosmetics industry, with hundreds of exhibitors from all corners of the beauty world. I was there with my nail polish range Binky London, but of course I took the opportunity to explore the huge arena and discover new and exciting beauty treatments and products. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The makeup artist at MUD achieved Binky's high glamour look using clever sculpting techniques . While I was exploring the show, I ran into the stand of an American company called Make Up Designory (or MUD). They're based in Hollywood and run make-up schools throughout America and worldwide. As well as this, they have a professional quality make-up line popular with make-up artists and beauty junkies like myself. When I was offered the chance to get a MUD makeover, I obviously couldn't refuse! The make-up artist chose to recreate a Hollywood-style look on me that was natural yet super-glam. Here's how she did itâ€¦ . MY MAKEOVER WITH MUD . Step 1 - Base . Binky said she adored the vibrant coral shade of her lips . The lovely MUD make-up artist started off by applying MUD's Face Primer across my face to provide a smooth base for the rest of my make-up. Then, she applied their Cream Foundation to my skin using a small foundation brush. The product evened out my skin tone beautifully while providing a gorgeous sheer finish. A great tip she told me was to test the colour of the foundation out on the neck, as opposed to the face, to ensure a perfect match. Step 2 - Concealer . Next, she took a blue shade of their Corrector (cream concealer) and applied it gently to my eyelids as well as under my eyes. The blue tones work to neutralise any redness in those regions, evening out the skintone effectively. Step 3 - Highlight and Contour . Of course, no Hollywood style makeover would be complete without some serious sculpting! Using a small face brush, she applied MUD's Lemon Cream Highlighter on my chin, under my eyebrows and across my cheekbones to give me a subtle glow. She then took a darker shade of their Cream Foundation to contour the hollows of my cheeks, as well as gently sweeping it across the top of my forehead near the hairline and across my jawline for added definition. Step 4 - Loose Powder . To set my base, the make-up artist used various shades of MUD's Loose Powder to give the skin a three-dimensional, radiant look. Using a fan brush, she first applied a very light shade in the area under my eyes, using only a very small amount so as not to counteract the glowy look of the base. She then dusted a light layer of powder in my skintone all over the face, and finished by emphasising the contour on my cheekbones with a darker shade of the powder. Using different shades of finishing powder on the face wasn't a trick I'd tried before, but it worked wonders in giving my skin a flawless finish. Binky says that testing a foundation shade on your neck rather than your face can help find a better colour match for your skin tone . Step 5 - Eyes . She then pencilled in my eyebrows with a dark brown shade of MUD's Eye Color, gently blending in the colour using a small brush. For my lids, she selected a gorgeous coppery shade of their Eye Color shadow called Spanish Gold, and applied it all over the lid, blending well. She packed the colour onto the outer corners of my eyes - on both the upper and lower lash lines - to create a smouldering, smokey effect. After this, she defined my eyes using MUD's Cake Eyeliner in a soft brown shade, applied with a damp brush. Applying brown eyeliner close to the lash line helps make lashes look fuller, so she took her time to ensure she had filled every crevice between my lashes with the liner. Finally she applied a touch of MUD's Volumising Mascara to give my eyelashes a flirty flutter. Step 6 - Lips . For my lips, the make-up artist used a vibrant coral shade of MUD's Satin Lipstick called Lucky, applying it carefully with a small lip brush. I absolutely adored the result, and certainly learnt some great make-up tips! All the MUD products the make-up artist are available online at mudshop.com, but I've found some great alternatives you can buy here in the UK that will allow you to create a similar look . Binky suggests using these products that can be found in the UK to achieve her MUD makeover look . Daniel Sandler Retexturising Face Primer . bareMinerals Correcting Concealer . Clarins Skin Illusion Natural Radiance Foundation . bareMinerals Ready Bronzer . Rimmel London Glam'Eyes Quad Eyeshadow in Sun Safari . Guerlain Liquid Eyeliner in Brun Cendre .

"Published: . 08:03 EST, 22 April 2014 . | . Updated: . 09:19 EST, 22 April 2014 . With booming bass and heavy hip hop beats thundering through their walls 24-hours a day, the neighbours of Elvis Turasinze, an aspiring rapper, were less than impressed. Now, after 18 months of noise, 15 visits from the council, one noise abatement order and one court appearance, Turasinze has finally switched off his speakers - but says he still doesn't understand what he did wrong. 'I just went to court with the truth, the . truth being that I wasn't causing no one a nuisance with the music,' says Turasinze of the court appearance that finally put a stop to his music career. 'I . didn't really get what they were talking about.' Rapper: Elvis Turasinze had a successful music career in his native Kenya, including a number one hit . Unpopular: Rapper Elvis Turasinze was the subject of 82 complaints to the council from neighbours . But while Turasinze claims to have done nothing wrong, neighbours at the Dagenham council block he calls home would beg to differ. 'We live in a commercial block of flats and . they're not brilliantly made,' said one neighbour, who has asked not to be named because of what she describes as 'intimidating' behaviour on Turasinze's part. 'They have thin walls! 'It was severe bass . - the bass was quite bad and it was horrendous music. The way he portrays himself and the way he acts makes me think he is threatening,' she continues. 'Many times I've thought I'll go up there and say something but then I think, what if he turns on me? How am I going to deal with that?' Turasinze's musical career began in his native Kenya, where his talent for rapping brought him a number one hit record. But after moving to London almost four years ago, success proved harder to come by and Terrasense was forced to relocate his equipment to his Dagenham flat. 'I'm into R&B, rap, dancehall,' he reveals. 'I've . been through a few up and downs here and there, obviously got in . trouble with the police and stuff, and I used to walk . around in gangs of youths. I had a community studio and I'd go there and . make music. 'I saw that studio as a way to make me better. Then I got . myself a job, worked there for a few months, made a bit of money and . started buying my equipment. 'Obviously, I needed speakers and I needed . the mixer tape to normalise my beats and stuff, and I needed a . microphone to record my stuff and mix it up.' But for those living next door, Turasinze's dedication to his music proved unbearable with vibrating walls caused by the bass and continual noise among the most irksome side-effects. 'Sometimes it wouldn't start until 1am so you'd think, hooray peace and quiet for one night, and then suddenly, it would start, and you'd think, what?!,' complains his disgruntled neighbour. Unimpressed: A neighbour who didn't want to be named said the constant loud music made her walls vibrate . Baffled: Elvis was the subject of 82 complaints from neighbours but says he's done nothing wrong . 'He was outside on his balcony one time and everything was quiet,' she continues. 'Then I heard him say, ""F*** it! I'll go acapella"" and he started rapping to himself and his friends.' Furious, she and other neighbours complained to the council and Turasinze received the first of 15 visits over the next 18 months. In total, Terrasense's music had been complained about a whopping 82 times. 'I really didn't see the need to go to the council and start pointing fingers like they did to me,' gripes an unrepentant Turasinze. 'These walls are really thick walls so I . don't see how the sound would travel from this room to the next. I don't . see how it would vibrate the room.' 'Bass was a big problem, obviously, . because it made my walls vibrate,' adds his neighbour. 'But I could hear his music in every . single room of my home. Passion: Elvis says that despite the setbacks, he will never stop making music because it's the love of his life . 'Even in the bath, I could still feel the bass - . even with my head under water. Even that didn't block out the sound.' After more than a year and a half of complaints and a noise abatement order that was repeatedly breached, Turasinze found himself in court where he was handed a three month conditional discharge and a Â£1,000 fine. As a result, Turasinze was forced to shut down his studio and move it to his brother's home in a suburban street a mile away. 'Now . he's stopped the music, I've got a much better life,' says his relieved neighbour. 'Now I can go out, . go to work, come home, relax and go to bed when I want.' Turasinze, however, has no plans to give up his musical career, even if he can't do it from home. 'I'm just going to keep coming and doing my music as I always did,' he explains. 'It's like I said, music is my addiction. It's not going to stop ever.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . In May 1998, the town of Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland was the scene of a horrific discovery. Under the floorboards of a half-built house, police uncovered the dismembered body of pregnant Sylvia Fleming, 17. The culprit was her boyfriend, Stephen Scott, 26. Now, more than a decade on, her family have revealed that they're still haunted by Sylvia's violent death and are tortured by the thought that they could have done more to extract her from Scott's clutches. Scroll down for video . Haunted: Jodie Fleming says she is haunted by her sister's terrible fate more than a decade after her murder . Speaking during an appearance on Britain's Darkest Taboos, her older sister, Josie, said: 'There's always is going to be a missing piece. We . miss her at special occasions, like Christmas. 'It’s a hole that you feel . empty. And the thought of what happened that night in that flat will . haunt me for the rest of my life.' Sylvia was murdered by someone who she loved and trusted - her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child, Stephen Scott. Despite a 10-year age gap, the pair had met through friends and had a sexual relationship. Part-time fireman Scott was a known in the area as a 'jack the lad' who helped with community projects like a boxing club for teenagers. Youngsters, Sylvia among them, were said to have 'worshipped' him. But Josie was not won over by his seemingly charismatic demeanour and disliked the way he seemed to control and belittle her sister. She was also concerned by his penchant for hosting young teenagers at his flat, where he threw parties and bought them cigarettes and alcohol. Tragic: Pregnant teen Sylvia Fleming, 17, was suffocated and dismembered by her boyfriend, Stephen Scott . 'He loved himself, he loved attention on him,' Josie said of why Scott hung out with younger people who idolised him rather than those his own age. 'I did not like him at all, I knew that there was something about him. I knew he had control over her.' Unbeknown to Josie, Scott's control over Sylvia also extended to the bedroom. Before she died, Sylvia had confided in a friend about his penchant for violent sex. On one occasion, he tried to put a pillow over her face. Sylvia had felt uncomfortable and frightened by the experiences but the vulnerable young girl who had grown up in foster homes went along with Scott's desires in a bid to be loved. Three months after they met, Sylvia become pregnant and Scott's true colours started to show. He didn't want to be a father and denied the baby was his. Josie recalls how the situation unfolded: 'Sylvia had phoned me and she had told me that she had her suspicions that she was pregnant. Scott wasn’t happy. He . didn't want to be a father, so he tried to make out Sylvia was with . somebody else. Tragedy: Sylvia's father Patrick (right) and sister Josie (left) at her funeral at Christ the King Church in Omagh . Tragedy: Sylvia's funeral on 3rd April 1998 was attended by mourners from all over Omagh . 'It makes me feel very angry that he was trying to make . it out like that. She . moved out not long after she told him about the baby. She would have . wanted things to work, but I had told her that I would always be there for her if things didn't work out with her and Scott.' Despite moving out, Sylvia, who had just gained a job at a care home, continued to see Scott in the hope of rekindling their relationship. But the decision to go to his house on the night of Friday, 3rd April, 1998, proved to be a fatal one. Before Sylvia arrived, Scott had told two 14-year-old friends, who were at the flat in Lisanelly Heights that night, of his plans to murder the mother of his unborn child. They thought it was a joke but when Sylvia arrived he took her off to his bedroom and gave her alcohol and sleeping pills, blindfolded and tied her up to the bed, taped up her eyes and mouth and then injected her with insulin. Commenting on the case, Dr Keri Nixon, a criminal profiler who works with Cheshire Police, explains: 'If you give insulin to somebody who’s not diabetic, what it does is it lowers their blood sugar levels, and induces eventually a form of coma. 'So he gave her alcohol, gave her valium, and gave her insulin, so she became almost like a zombie.  And he could then use her as a sexual object to carry out his sadistic sexual pleasure.' At some point, Sylvia lost her life but police remain unsure of the exact circumstances. However, they were certain that this was not a sex game gone wrong and that Scott had intended to commit murder. The next morning, after threatening his 14-year-old accomplices with the spectre of prison, he and the teens wrapped the body in a blanket, put it in the attic and went swimming. 'After they had done what they’d done, they went swimming in the local leisure centre, and it makes me feel physically sick to think that they were able to go on about their own business knowing what they had done that night,' adds Josie. But events were about to catch up with Scott. Worried by Sylvia's continued absence, Josie went to Scott's flat to try and find her sister. Horrendous: Sylvia's unrepentant killer, Stephen Scott, was given 17 years in prison for her murder . She recalls: 'We had our suspicions that he had hurt her. We walked in to the flat and Stephen was sitting . on the bed and his eyes was all red, pure red. 'I happened to glance up . at the attic door, and he had seen me, and he moved us into the living . room and he kept saying that he didn’t know where she was, he hadn’t . heard from her. 'He seemed very agitated, he kept repeating himself. I . did have a suspicion that he had hurt her and had her up in the attic. Never did I think it went as far as it did.' As Josie was at the police station reporting Sylvia missing, Scott set about disposing of her body. After cutting her into eight pieces, the killer enlisted the help of a friend to help him dispose of her various body parts across the town, including at a site where new homes were being built. But seven weeks later, Scott's attempt to cover his tracks unravelled, when his accomplice confessed his part in the crime to police and told them the whereabouts of Sylvia's head. The gruesome discovery sent shockwaves through the town and left Josie devastated. 'When the police told me they had found part of a body they thought was her, I remember thinking ""part of a body?"" What the hell has happened to my sister?' Dental records confirmed it was Sylvia. 'We were devastated,' added Josie. 'We couldn’t believe what we were being told. I’ve lost my baby sister.' Scott and his accomplice were arrested and charged with murder and three counts of perverting the course of justice. Jane Loughrey, a UTV news broadcaster, who reported on the case, tells of the harrowing moment when the circumstances of Sylvia's death were revealed in court. 'I've covered many trials in my time at UTV, and that's a trial that I will never forget,' she explains. 'There have been a lot of callous, . horrendous murders in Northern Ireland, even by Northern Ireland's cruel standards, . this was a shocking murder.' She added: 'The judge talked in the trial of the . degradation and humiliation of Sylvia. Apart from the obviously . sadistic way that she was murdered and dismembered, and callously . placed under floorboards, it was the fact that he had no respect whatsoever [for Sylvia]. 'Sylvia was not treated like a human being; she was like a piece of . meat, just chopped up and discarded.' Scott showed no remorse as he was found guilty and ordered to serve a minimum 19 year sentence. His male accomplices were given two-and-a-half-years each. Josie said she is trying to move on with their lives now the 'monster' is in jail. 'You have to remember the happy times, us always being away enjoying ourselves, laughing,' she said. 'We will always be strong, and if anything what's happened has made us even stronger. I do feel that my sisters will always be there, all though my life. He will never break our bond ever.  Ever.'

"By . Sophie Borland . Updated: . 08:50 EST, 27 September 2011 . Patients with terminal cancer should not be given life-extending drugs, doctors said yesterday. The treatments give false hope and are too costly for the public purse, they warned. The group of 37 cancer experts, including British specialist Karol Sikora, claimed a 'culture of excess' had led doctors to 'overtreat, overdiagnose and overpromise'. Killer: Some 310,000 Britons a year are diagnosed with cancer - by 2030 it could be 400,000 . Campaigners dismissed the report, saying it was wrong to write off cancer victims. 'I would hardly call this type of treatment futile,' said Rose Woodward, of the James Whale Fund for Kidney Cancer. Breast cancer cells: A group of cancer experts said doctors over-diagnose and over-promise . 'We have kidney cancer patients on a . life-prolonging drug called Sutent who have been told they have only two . to three weeks to live but who go on to live for a further five years.' Around 310,000 Britons a year are . diagnosed with cancer. But by 2030 this is expected to have risen to . 400,000 as an ageing population succumbs to the disease. The NHS spends well over £5billion annually on cancer treatments, up from £3billion in 2002. In the journal Lancet Oncology, the expert group warned many of the costly drugs produced by manufacturers brought little value. They said patients were offered treatment even where there was little evidence it was of use. Instead, money should be invested in . better scans and tests to determine whether a tumour is beatable, . leaving 'difficult decisions' as to who gets treatment. 'We clearly would want to spare the . patient the toxicity and false hope associated with such treatment, as . well as the expense,' the experts told the European multidisciplinary . cancer congress in Stockholm.

'Just because they cannot be ""cured"" does not mean that we cannot give them valuable treatment, care and support.' Ian Beaumont of Bowel Cancer UK said money was not the sole issue. 'While cancer care can be expensive, it is unjust to put a cost on the lives of patients, especially when modern treatments can often give them precious time with their loved ones and increase their length and quality of life,' he added. Only last week a pill for prostate cancer, Abiraterone, was made available in the UK for the first time at a cost of £35,000 a patient. Although on average it only extends lives by a few weeks, some patients survive for five years. Similarly, Avastin, which is used to treat advanced bowel cancer and some other tumours, was initially thought to extend survival by an average of only six weeks. But some patients are still alive five years later and tumours have not returned. Barbara Moss was given months to live when she was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer that had spread to her liver in November 2006. She paid for Avastin privately and the drug shrank the tumours so much that they were small enough to be removed by surgery. She lived an extra five years. Last week Professor Sikora warned that, in future, the best cancer treatments would be the preserve of the rich because they would be too expensive for the Health Service.","NHS spends £5bn annually on cancer treatments up from £3bn in 2002 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Controversy: David Cameron characterised Britain as a 'Christian country' in a recent article . David Cameron's controversial claim that Britain is a 'Christian country' risks sowing 'alienation and division' in society, a group of leading public figures has warned. More than 50 writers, scientists, broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the 'negative consequences' of the Prime Minister's assertion in a country where most people do not describe themselves as Christian. Signatories of the letter, published in The Daily Telegraph, include the authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett; broadcasters Dan Snow and Nick Ross, the philosopher AC Grayling; and the human rights activist Peter Tatchell. It follows the article last week for the Church Times by Mr Cameron - who in the past has been reluctant to discuss religious matters - in which he wrote of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with Christian ideals and values. While the letter acknowledges that the Prime Minister is entitled to his religious beliefs, his comments do not reflect the country as it is today. 'We wish to object to his repeated mischaracterising of our country as a ""Christian country"" and the negative consequences for our politics and society that this view engenders,' the letter states. 'Repeated surveys, polls, and studies show most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities and at a social level, Britain has been shaped for the better by many pre-Christian, non-Christian, and post-Christian forces. 'We are a plural society with citizens with a range of perspectives and a largely non-religious society. To constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society.' The letter said that Mr Cameron was wrong to 'exceptionalise' the contributions made to society by Christians when they are equalled by those of people with different beliefs. Author Philip Pullman is one of 50 signatories of the letter - which has been published in The Daily Telegraph . 'It needlessly fuels enervating sectarian debates that are by and large absent from the lives of most British people, who - as polls show - do not want religions or religious identities to be actively prioritised by their elected government.' Professor Jim Al-Khalili, the theoretical physicist and science broadcaster and President of the British Humanist Association, who organised the letter said Mr Cameron's comments were part of a 'disturbing trend'. 'Politicians have been speaking of our country as ""a Christian country"" with increasing frequency in the last few years,"" he said. 'Not only is this inaccurate, I think it's a wrong thing to do in a time when we need to be building a strong shared identity in an increasingly plural and non-religious society.'","50 liberals signed open letter over concerns about Cameron's assertion .

"By . Ellie Buchdahl . Pearly queen: The Pearl of Asia - the largest pearl in the world, once part of the crown jewels of the Moghul empire - is on display at the V&A . A parasitic invertebrate that has just been pooed out by a shark is hardly the place you'd go to find that classy necklace. But experts have scuppered the popular belief that pearls form through friction with a grain of sand - saying that they actually build around tapeworm larvae. The revelation, which might have surprised fans of the beads such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, comes as part of a new exhibition at the V&A in London. A video demonstrating how the precious stones form when tapeworm larvae excreted by sharks and stingrays become trapped in water-filtering shellfish such as oysters will be on show at the museum's Pearls exhibition, which begins on Saturday. The show's co-creator, Hubert Bari, said: . 'The people marketing (pearls) prefer to say, ""It is so fantastic, your . necklace was made from a grain of sand"". 'It is better to speak about a grain of sand than to speak about a piece of s*** from a stingray.' The somewhat unsavoury origins of the . pearl have been known since 1852, when Filippi of Turin proved that a . parasitic flatworm called the Distomum duplicatum was the cause of the . stones forming inside freshwater mussels. ...and here's the little guy who made it: The larvae of a tapeworm, which gets into shellfish and causes them to excrete a substance that forms into a pearl . Precious: An Akoya pearl necklace, previously owned by Marilyn Monroe, which is one of the items in the V&A exhibition . The tapeworm had its crucial role in pearl formation acknowledged in a 1903 paper by Professors Herdman and Hornell on pearl fisheries in Ceylon. Pearls can form around any parasite - . including fish and snails - that has drilled into the the flesh of sea . creatures such as mussels, but tapeworms and flatworms that have been . excreted by larger animals are the most common invaders. The . immune system of the shellfish then fights the worm by surrounding them . with layer upon layer of nacre - a calcium-based material that makes up . their shells - causing the parasite to suffocate and become trapped in . this solid casing. Wealth: The Roseberry Pearl and Diamond Tiara that was given to Hannah De Rothschild as a wedding present in 1878 . Ancient and modern: The Pearl Pendant Earrings (top) and Ring (centre) once owned by Hollywood film star Elizabeth Taylor, left, and right, the Hope pearl, which was previously owned by King Louis XIV of France . Oysters, which produce a milky nacre, are the most common source for commercial pearls, but other animals can produce pearls that are black, blue, red or green, depending on the natural colour of their nacre. Pearls are most abundant where ecosystems thrive from larger predators through to the parasites and their hosts. The V&A exhibition explores the history of pearls, chronicling how the jewels went from being a luxury . adored by royalty (Queen Victoria loved pearls so much she had . Garrard’s create black pearl jewellery when she was in mourning) to . objets d’art, by jewellers such as Vietnamese Sam Tho Duong, and a . mass-produced product worn by fashionistas and aristos alike. Aristocracy: The Lady Raine Spencer tiara, owned by the stepmother to the late Diana, Princess of Wales . Fit for a princess: The Hanover tiara, worn by both wives of Prince Johann Georg of Saxony . I . Natural: The exhibition opens on Saturday and includes historical displays and features about the science of pearls . It goes back to the invention of the cultured pearl and how Kokichi Mikimoto produced it on an industrial scale in Japan. Marilyn Monroe wore a 16in string of Mikimoto pearls to court the day she divorced her second husband Joe DiMaggio in 1954. After the war, the Hollywood hits of the 1940s and the 1950s generated a feelgood factor and a style that was desired – if not affordable for ordinary Americans. Doris Day, Lauren Bacall and Ava Gardner were among the actresses who wore pearl chokers made up of cultured pearls – they gradually started to take over from natural pearls. For centuries, pearls had been a sign of extreme wealth. Finding . one usually required a diver to open 2,000 oysters, – but Mikimoto, who . headed the company which made Monroe’s necklace, pioneered the . commercial ‘culturing’ of pearls, where irritants were deliberately . introduced to oysters to farm jewellery. Mikimoto said he wanted to ‘adorn the necks of all women around the world with pearls’. The new exhibition at the V&A in London features jewellery from Elizabeth Taylor's (left). The Duchess of Cambridge (right) with a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden . History went full circle when Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, wore a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden, to the celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The exhibition also features Liz . Taylor’s stunning Bulgari pendant earrings, a pearl-drop earring worn by . Charles I at his execution in 1649, a brooch given as a sentimental . gift to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert and a sparkling collection of . tiaras, including one with pearls ‘the size of walnuts’ made for the . wedding of Hannah de Rothschild who in the 1870s was the wealthiest . woman in England. Much of the show focuses on rare, natural pearls from the Arabian Gulf. Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy (pictured with son John Jr) and Princess Diana . Elizabeth Taylor's Bulgari pendant earrings: 'To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday,' said co-curator Beatriz Chadour-Sampson . ‘Qatar and the other Gulf states have  money and they want to buy their heritage back,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘They now own Elizabeth Taylor’s pendant earrings and many other pieces including an eye-popping 1930s Cartier five-strand graduated pearl necklace. 'If you think that you need thousands of oysters to find a pearl it’s no surprise they have been seen as objects of desire through the ages.’ The Romans wore pearls as items of sheer luxury, while in medieval times they became a Christian symbol for purity and chastity, and then in the Renaissance symbols of  authority and wealth. They were even felt to have medicinal . properties – philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon is said to have . taken crushed pearls mixed with lemon juice as an elixir. ‘Pearls are still given at weddings today and  have an association with joy,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘But . at the same time they are directly associated with death. The classical . belief that pearls were created from the teardrops of the gods links . them with sadness and tears.’ Marvel: Visitors will be able to look at exhibits such as the Roseberry Pearl and Diamond Tiara . Rich and famous: Marilyn Monroe with Joe DiMaggio wearing her Mikimoto necklace, one of the few pieces of fine jewellery she actually owned, and Lady Rosebery's tiara (right), 1878 . Their cachet has continued into the age of Hollywood and celebrity, helped by the rise of cultivated and imitation pearls. Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy and Princess Diana. ‘What fascinated me is the variety of pearls, the international trade and the worldwide obsession,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘Rubies and emeralds have been fashionable at certain times, and even diamonds go in and out of favour, but the appeal of pearls appears to  have been continuous through all jewellery history.’ Pearls is at the V&A (in partnership with the Qatar Museums Authority), Sept 21-Jan 19 . ‘A five-string graduated natural Gulf pearl necklace made by Cartier in the 1930s. He sourced his pearls directly in the Gulf that were then mounted in Paris. This really embodies the endurance of the divers and the rarity of the pearls.’ ‘Worn by Charles I when he was beheaded in 1649. It’s very difficult to authenticate these things, but in this case the family has a note saying what this pearl is and it’s written in the hand of Queen Mary II, his granddaughter.’ ‘George III, who was normally known for his restraint, dressed to dazzle with jewels at festive events and is recorded as having a special interest in buttons and button-making.’ ‘A wedding present when Hannah de Rothschild, the richest woman in England, married a wealthy young politician, Archibald, 5th earl of Rosebery. She died 12 years later and Rosebery then presented it to his daughter-in-law. The New York Times described the pearls in the tiara as being as big as walnuts.’ ‘Necklace given to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio on their honeymoon. It was bought in Japan directly from Mikimoto, so the quality is very good.’ ‘A heart-shaped openwork gold brooch given to Victoria by Prince Albert in 1843 on their third wedding anniversary. It’s surmounted by a crown with four Scottish freshwater pearls from the River Tay.’ ‘Liz Taylor was crazy about jewellery, and even wrote a book, My Love Affair with Jewellery. To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday.’ ‘The Abernethy pearl is the largest Scottish river pearl ever found – it was found in the 1960s. River pearls tend to be smaller than saltwater pearls.’","V&A exhibition reveals pearls form around larvae excreted by sharks and rays .

"By . Leon Watson . Villagers built a great wall of cash in China after their cooperative stacked up huge profits. The giant wads worth 13 million yuan (£1.3million) in total were laid out in a 2m tall 'money wall' at Jianshe village in the Lianshan municipality, in south-west China's Sichuan province. Several residents even slept on the notes overnight to guard them from thieves before the end of year bonuses were distributed the following day. Wall of money: Villagers waiting before the cash for their year-end bonus is distributed . One of guards said: 'It is not comfortable at all to sleep on cash,' adding that he was too worried to fall asleep. Villager Jin Ou, who received around 300,000 yuan, said: 'It took me so long to count the money that I almost lost strength and feeling in my hands.' Yang Huai, who received 200,000 yuan, said it had been a custom in the village since 2010 to distribute the bonus in cash before the Chinese New Year. Some 340 out of a total number of 483 households are the shareholders of a rural cooperative established that year, which profits from pig farms, cherry orchards, and its investment in four small scale hydropower plants in Sichuan, said a village official surnamed Zhu.

Village chief Jin Hongyuan suggested marrying the villagers, adding that one had to become a resident before he or she could buy a share.","Giant wads laid out in a 2m tall 'money wall' in Sichuan province .

"By . Sam Webb . Tragic loss: Joshua Houlgate, the ten-year-old who collapsed and died while he was playing in the snow with his friends in February . A 10-year-old boy who collapsed in front of his pals while they played in the snow could have had a lifelong heart condition, an inquest heard. Joshua Houlgate had been building an igloo and throwing snowballs with friends on February 5 when he complained of feeling unwell, grabbed a tree and fell backwards to the ground. Despite frantic attempts by his mother and a neighbour to revive him, he was pronounced dead later that day. An inquest into the youngster’s death was told today that there was nothing in his post-mortem examination to explain why his heart suddenly stopped but an investigation into his medical records showed he could have suffered from an underlying heart condition since birth. It is not known whether he did indeed have the rare heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or if it caused his death and a coroner said it would be impossible to say whether noticing the syndrome earlier would have altered the outcome. The hearing was told that Joshua’s friends ran to his home in Castleford, West Yorkshire, following his collapse at around midday to tell his mum Sara - who ran to her only child’s aid. Simon Thompson, the father of one of Joshua’s pals, dialled 999 and battled for 30 minutes to revive the unconscious boy with chest compressions, while Sara attempted mouth-to-mouth until the ambulance arrived. Market stall worker Sara initially thought Joshua - who had a history of epilepsy - was suffering a seizure but then realised 'it was more serious than a fit'. The ambulance arrived and Joshua was taken to Pinderfields Hospital but was sadly confirmed dead at 1.13pm that day. Distraught Sara said in her statement: 'Within minutes of getting to the hospital we were told he hadn’t survived. I still feel numb.' Coroner David Hinchliff said: 'Up to the moment when he suddenly collapsed Joshua had a thoroughly good time playing with his mates in the snow.' Wakefield Coroner’s Court heard that Joshua had been born with holes in his heart, which had healed, had suffered from epilepsy, asthma and was autistic. Joshua was building an igloo and having a snowball fight with his friends when the tragedy struck (file picture) The initial post-mortem examination couldn’t find a reason for Joshua’s death. Pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani said: 'From the post-mortem there wasn’t anything to explain why Joshua collapsed and died.' He then added that playing in the snow and the cold air may have put a strain on his heart. It was when Dr Stephen Jones, a consultant paediatrician at Pinderfields, began looking at Joshua’s medical records, specifically an ECG taken when he was two-days-old, that it was noted that he may have suffered from an underlying cardiac condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. The inquest was told that it was a sudden change in the ECG which would only have been picked up by somebody with expertise and then brought to the attention of cardiologists. Cardiac arrhythmic abnormalities claim the lives of eight young people each week, usually without warning. They come under a variety of names, including Long QT Syndrome, Catecholaminergic Polyventricular Tachycardia and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. Essentially all describe the disruption of the electrical signals which keep the heart pumping. If the pattern is disrupted enough, the heart stops beating, within seconds the brain is oxygen-starved which can quickly lead to death. If noted Joshua may have been subject to regular ECGs and possibly different medication from that point. Symptoms of the syndrome are dizziness, shortness of breath and palpitations. But Dr Jones said he couldn’t say if he had the syndrome at the time of his death or whether it caused his death, adding: 'I have probably never come across it as a cause of sudden death.' The inquest heard that it is possible to outgrow the syndrome and Mr Hinchliff said it was impossible to say if Joshua suffered from it and whether knowing about the syndrome 'would have altered the outcome'. He passed a verdict of death by natural causes but told Joshua’s parents that he would include the syndrome in his verdict.","Joshua Houlgate was playing in the snow with his friends when he complained of feeling unwell and collapsed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former drag queen has revealed how Katie Price gave her the courage to change her sex after years of confusion over her gender. Chelsea Attonley, 27, who was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, as a boy called Matthew, shared her story on today's This Morning. Now living in London, she told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she had struggled with her identity as she grew up. Scroll down for video . TV appearance: Transsexual Chelsea Attonley shared her story on today's This Morning . Idol: The 27-year-old said Katie Price gave her the push she needed to have a sex change after the pair met in a nightclub when Chelsea was still a man called Matthew who liked to dress as a drag queen . 'It all started when I was very young. I liked dressing up, at nursery I would head straight to the dressing up box and put on hats and wigs - that just felt right to me,' she explained. 'I didn't fit in at all as a teen. I felt more like one of the girls and all my friends were girls. I wasn't comfortable with my body. 'I didn't really know what was going on but I put myself in a box as gay and I didn't know about being transgender.' By the time she was old enough to hit the clubs, Chelsea, still then Matthew, enjoyed dressing up and often went out as a drag queen called Miss Malibu. Growing pains: Chelsea told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she had always struggled with her identity as a child and teenager . She admitted she 'felt great' and had fun whilst in her Miss Malibu persona but still struggled at home as 'gender dysphoria thoughts would be running through my head all the time.' Then one night at a club, she had a chance meeting with one of her idols that would change the course of her life forever. 'I was at a club dressed as Miss Malibu and Peter Andre was doing an appearance,' she recalled. 'He was still with Katie Price then and we managed to get back stage to meet them and the first thing she said to me was ""are they real?"" about my breasts.' Katie told me: ""You've got to go for it"" 'I couldn't believe she thought I'd already had surgery,' she added. The pair got to chatting and Katie told Chelsea, 'you've got to go for it', when she mentioned her thoughts on having a sex change. Katie's words of encouragement gave her the push she needed to finally become the person she always felt she was inside. After talking it over with her doctor, she then had the difficult task of explaining her choice to her family. She said: 'I saw my GP and he said, ""if you go home and tell your mum how you feel then I'll refer you"". 'So I did. My dad died when I was 13 so had never really known about how I had been feeling, but I'll never forget telling my mum. Worth it: After having gender reassignment surgery, she is finally happy with who she is . 'She was watching Emmerdale and I walked in and said: ""Mother, I'm going to become a woman!"" 'And she just turned around and said ""about time duck!"" Chelsea said she has no regrets about the lengthy gender change operation, which involves in depth counseling beforehand, as she is now much more confident and comfortable with who she is. Her only wish is that she'd 'done it a lot earlier.' 'I do sometimes think of Matthew - you go through a little grieving period' 'I am really happy now,' she beamed. 'I have met all the goals I wanted to in my life and I now just want to move on and become a successful woman. When I look in the mirror it is like looking at a completely different person.' She added: 'I do sometimes think of Matthew - you go through a little grieving period.' Now Chelsea, who says she is a trans entertainer, model and writer on her Facebook page, has dreams of hitting the stage. 'I've always wanted to be on the stage and I'd like to just represent women and transgender people,' she said. Following her appearance on the ITV show, she received overwhelmingly positive support from This Morning veiwers who emailed and Tweeted to say she was an inspiration.","Chelsea Attonley, 27, was born Matthew .

Buffalo Bills cheerleaders the Buffalo Jills perform before NFL game action against the New England Patriots at Ralph Wilson Stadium on September 8, 2013 in Orchard Park, New York. Five former members (not pictured) are now suing the team . The women say they were wrongly classified as independent contractors by Stejon Productions, which manages the Jills and failed to pay them for hundreds of hours of work during 2012 and 2013 season. 'We had always dreamed since we were little girls of becoming Buffalo Jills cheerleaders and unfortunately it was anything but a good experience,' said former Jills cheerleader Alyssa U, WIVB reported . '[They made us do] everything from standing in front of us with a clipboard and having us do a jiggle test to see what parts of our body were jiggling and if that was something she saw, then you weren’t performing at all. She and four others claim other degrading behavior included being forced to wear a bikini and then go into a dunk tank, being auctioned off like prizes, and 'the Jills were forced to sit on participants’ laps because there was not enough seats in the golf carts. The plaintiffs claim that they did not receive compensation for working at Bills games. Instead, they received a $90 game ticket and a parking pass. They claim that no compensation was paid for practice time. They contend that they were required to buy 50-75 swimsuits calendars and then resell them on their own time, and that they were subject to 'an onerous set of rules dictating how the women could walk, talk, dress, speak and behave, both in uniform and in their personal lives'. The complaint alleges that game performances, practices, rehearsals and appearances equaled '840 hours of unpaid work per woman, per year'.

They also paid for their own hairstyles, nails tights, lipstick, makeup, gas and more that were required by the Bills and appearances for the team. Their lawsuit seeks back pay and 'other damages as allowed by law'. 'We were the laughing stock of NFL cheerleaders,' Alyssa U said. 'We deserve to be compensated just like everyone else.'

"By . Bianca London . From their first public appearance together, when she walked out of the hospital cradling her newborn son, we've barely seen the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George separated. But today, for the first time, baby George was pictured not in the arms of doting mother Kate but in those of his new nanny, 43-year-old Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo - and he looked less than impressed. The 8-month-old prince pulled an adorably grumpy face as Maria Teresa carried him to the car upon the family's arrival in Sydney today. Scroll down for video . Where's my mummy?! Prince George looks a little grumpy as he is carried to a waiting car by his new nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo at Sydney Airport . The family chatted with waiting fans, including Joscelyn Sweeney, 22, who gave a bouquet to Kate and a book, Snugglepot and Cuddlepie My First Book, to George. Sweeney, from Vincentia, NSW, who suffers from Down's Syndrome, was given the honour of meeting the royal trio after her mother wrote to the palace, describing her 'admiration and affection' for family. After his meet and greet, a weary and slightly grumpy looking George, who was dressed in a smart and summery white . ensemble, was taken to the car by his nanny - perhaps he was feeling tired after the flight from . Auckland. His parents . then headed off to the Opera House, where they met excited well-wishers, . before the family reunited and met the Governor-General Sir Peter .

On his first day of the Royal Tour, Prince George was given a kangaroo backpack as a welcome present. And it appears the gift is a hit: today his nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo was seen carrying the rucksack just after the royal trio touched down in Sydney. The Australian Koala Foundation is one of the stockists of the bag that retails at $14.95 and sold out of its remaining stock the day it was given to the young prince. CEO Deborah Tabart said there had been an huge rush on the cute kangaroo bag. 'We sold the last ones that morning - we've had to take them off the website but we'll be ordering more.' With the bag stocked at numerous outlets, Ms Tabart said there was no way of knowing who gave it to the prince. She offered Prince William an invitation to become the patron of the 28-year old Australia Koala Foundation. The CEO also offered to extend the invitation to young George. 'He could be the patron in waiting.' This isn't the first time that the Cambridge's new nanny has been in sole charge of the baby boy.

Borrallo, from Palencia, 140 miles north of Madrid, was first spotted descending the steps of the plane . onto the runway at Auckland last week, along with three long-standing assistants . to the royal couple: David Manning, Miguel Head and Rebecca Deacon. But the Spaniard's training at the . prestigious Norland College, where fees cost nearly £13,000 per year, . will have prepared her well for the job. The . internationally-renowned nanny school drew up a shortlist of suitable . candidates after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge approached them . looking for a nanny for Prince George, from which the royal couple chose . the low-key Spaniard. They . decided to hire a nanny after first relying on help from the Duchess' mother, . Carole Middleton, and the Duke's former nanny, Jessie Webb, 71. Miss . Borrallo, who is thought to be the first foreign nanny chosen to look . after a future British monarch, comes from a smart family of high . achievers in Palencia, 140 miles north of Madrid.

Catholic ceremony in Madrid in 1967, the wedding was reported in the . society pages of Spain's royalist right-wing daily newspaper, ABC.

"By . David Mccormack . While America’s wealthiest citizens continue to outpace their global peers, the country’s middle class has lost its long held distinction of being the most affluent in the world according to new research. Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries - or stronger - only a small percentage of American households are fully benefiting from it, according to the LIS analysis. Based on surveys conducted over the past 35 years, income across the lower- and middle-income tiers of American society has plateaued over that time, while citizens in other advanced countries have received considerably larger rises. Catching up: The gap in middle class wealth between Europeans and those in the United States is rapidly narrowing . Canada’s middle class was substantially lagging behind the U.S. back in 2000, but it caught up in 2010 and has since surpassed the U.S. In Western Europe, the average incomes still trail those the United States, but the gap in several countires such as Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden is much smaller than it was a decade ago. The income data were compiled by researcher from the LIS who analyzed date from the Luxembourg Income Study database in connection with The New York Times. If the middle class are having a bad time, then the poor in the United States have it even worse. Canada¿s middle class was substantially lagging behind the U.S. back in 2000, but it caught up in 2010 and has since surpassed the U.S . A family at the 20th percentile of the income distribution in this country now makes significantly less money than a similar family in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland or the Netherlands. The reverse was true 35 years ago. In 2010, Median per capita income was $18,700 in the United States, up 20 percent since 1980 but virtually unchanged since 2000, after adjusting for inflation. By comparison, median per capita income increased 20 percent in Britain between 2000 and 2010 and 14 percent in the Netherlands. Median income also rose 20 percent in Canada between 2000 and 2010, to $18,700. Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries - or stronger - only a small percentage of American households are fully benefiting from it . Yet according to one of the most commonly cited economic statistics - per capita gross domestic product - the U.S. continues to maintain its lead as the world’s richest large country. Most Americans aren't keeping pace with their counterparts around the world because a large share of recent income gains is flowing to a small slice of high-earning households. ‘The idea that the median American has so much more income than the middle class in all other parts of the world is not true these days,’ Harvard economist Lawrence Katz told the Times. ‘In 1960, we were massively richer than anyone else. In 1980, we were richer. In the 1990s, we were still richer.’ That is no longer the case, he added.","The country's middle class has lost its distinction of being the most affluent in the world .
LIS research over the past 35 years shows that lower- and middle-income groups in the U.S. have plateaued over that time .
Canada's middle class has overtaken the U.S. in recent years and a number of Western European countries have caught up too .

Eric Hill, an intrepid 32-year-old on a personal quest to see every UN recognized country on Earth, slammed into a Utah mountainside after a parachute malfunctioned in high turbulence. His injuries were grievous and authorities say he suffered serious head trauma despite having worn all the proper safety gear including a helmet. Critical: Bachelorette contestant Eric Hill, center, is in a coma in critical condition after a horrible paragliding accident in Utah on Sunday . Intrepid: Aside from his reality show forays, Hill was on a quest to visit every UN-recognized country in record time. Here, he stands before Reims Cathedral, in Reims, France . 'He experienced a partial parachute collapse, which swung him into the mountainside with some velocity,' Unified Fire Authority Battalion Chief Brian Anderton told KUTV. 'It doesn't seem like he fell an extremely long distance, but the velocity that he went into the hillside was enough to cause some trauma.' Hill was was rushed to an area hospital, where he remained in a coma Tuesday. The reality TV contestant had already been eliminated from the competition where he vied for the affections of bachelorette Andi Dorfman, at the time of the accident. According to his friend, Hill was an experienced paraglider and KUTV reports that he was often in Utah where the activity is widely popular. 'He's well experienced. He knows what he's doing,' the friend, Derek Mazur, told KUTV. 'Just kind of that time of year. Spring, the air is really rough and a lot of turbulence.' But Anderton warned that safety gear and experience aren't always a match for mother nature. 'Pay attention to the weather conditions and be familiar with what they're getting into,' he warned. Hill had yet to achieve notoriety for his television appearance, but had made a name for himself online for his exploits as a world traveler. Turbulence: The adventurous California native, seen here near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, was an experienced paraglider but decided to go out in conditions that were turbulent . Hill had been eliminated from the show, which is still filming, at the time of the accident . For the project he dubbed The Global Odyssey: Finding Awesome in Every Country, Hill was determined to visit all 194 UN-recognized world countries in record time and by the time of the horrible accident he was well on his way. Social media accounts picture the handsome traveler in breathtaking shots from Finland to Djibouti. In the most recent message on his project's Facebook page, someone posted the following on Tuesday evening: . 'Friends: Eric has been in a horrible paragliding accident and is currently in critical condition in a coma. Things are not looking good right now...please, all across the world, even if you're not a praying person, please pray for him. He needs your prayers more than ever.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . Nepalese mountain guides have decided to abandon this year’s climbing season on Mount Everest to honour their colleagues killed in a deadly avalanche. After a memorial service for the victims today, one guide said it was ‘impossible’ for them to continue climbing following the disaster which left 13 Sherpas dead and three missing. The news throws the plans of hundreds of foreign climbers into disarray as it is deemed almost impossible to reach the summit without the help of the Nepali guides and porters. Scroll down for video . Sherpa mountain guides have decided to abandon climbing season on Mount Everest for the remainder of this year after the avalanche on Friday killed at least 13 guides and left three others missing, presumed dead . Relatives of the Mount Everest avalanche victims attend a cremation ceremony in Kathmandu . Dorje Sherpa, a guide who attended the memorial service at base camp, said the Sherpas had discussed their options and confirmed most of them were planning to pack and leave as early as tomorrow. He said: ‘It is just impossible for many of us to continue climbing. While there are three of our friends buried in the snow, I can't imagine stepping over them. We want to honor the members we lost and out of respect for them we just can't continue.’ Last Friday, several Sherpa guides were hauling climbing gear between camps when a chunk of ice tore loose and triggered an avalanche. Thirteen bodies were recovered and three Sherpas are still missing, presumed dead. After the avalanche, the government quickly said it would pay the family of each Sherpa who died 40,000 rupees, or about £391. The Sherpas said they deserve far more — including more insurance money, more financial aid for the families of the victims and new regulations that would ensure climbers' rights. Earlier today, Nepal's government appeared to have agreed to some of demands made by the Sherpas ahead of the boycott, such as setting up a relief fund for those who are killed or injured in a climbing accident - but the funding falls short of what the Sherpas wanted. Buddhist monks attend prayers for Nepalese mountaineers who were victims of the avalanche on April 18 . The daughter of Ang Kaji Sherpa, one of the victims of the Mount Everest avalanche, collapses during a cremation ceremony at Syambhu in Kathmandu, Nepal . Sherpa Pasang, of the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association in Katmandu, said the group would try to negotiate with the Sherpas and the government because a total boycott would harm Nepal's mountaineering in the long term. The Everest climbing season provides livelihoods for thousands of Nepali guides and porters. Climbers have long relied on Sherpas for everything from carrying gear to cooking food to high-altitude guiding. Without them, reaching the summit would be almost impossible. Most attempts to reach the summit are made in mid-May, when weather is most favourable. If the Sherpas boycott the season, many of the climbers would have to forfeit most or all of the money they have spent to go up Everest, which in some cases adds up to around £50,000. At least one expedition company has cancelled the 2014 attempt for its six-member team. ‘Our team members have empathy for the Sherpa community and we wish for everyone to be able to mourn their lost family and friends in peace,’ the Adventure Consultants Everest Expedition 2014 Team said on its website. Relatives carry the body of one of the Nepalese climbers killed in the avalanche - the disaster which prompted the climbing boycott by Nepal's ethnic Sherpa community . At least thirteen men were killed in single deadliest accident in the history of the world's highest mountain. They were laid to rest on Monday in a traditional Buddhist ceremony . Relatives of the Nepalese climbers killed in wait for the funeral procession to begin in Katmandu on Monday . At least 13 people were killed and a further three remain missing after the avalanche swept the Khumbu Icefall - one of the most dangerous parts of the climb to Everest – on Friday. The Sherpa mountain guides were trying to fix ropes and crack snow and ice to carve out a route for foreign climbers when they were caught in the avalanche at an altitude of about 5,800m, just below Camp One, at about 6.30am. Nepalese officials have now called off the search for the three missing men - saying there is no chance of finding them alive and that their rescuers are being put at risk. At least three other guides caught in the deadly avalanche survived, but are in intensive care and being treated for broken limbs, ribs, blood clots and other injuries in Kathmandu hospitals. In the wake of the avalanche, the Sherpas have expressed anger that there has not been a bigger response from Nepal's government, which profits from the permit fees charged for the climbing expeditions. The avalanche caused the most deadly recorded climbing accident in Everest history. It has resulted in several Sherpas quitting and boycotting expeditions for the remainder of the climbing season. The Ministry of Tourism said in its statement the government had agreed to the following: . — A relief fund to help Sherpas injured in mountaineering accidents and the families of those killed, and to pay for rescue during accidents on the mountain. — The government said it will stock the fund every year with 5 per cent of its earnings from Everest climbing fees — well below the 30 per cent the Sherpas are demanding. Nepal earns some £2million annually in Everest climbing fees. — Nepal will increase the insurance pay-out for those killed on the mountain to 1.5 million rupees (£14,600), up from the current 1 million rupees. The offer falls short of the Sherpas' demand for 2 million rupees (£19,500). — The government will build a memorial to the men killed in Friday's avalanche. — The government also will pay additional money to help rehabilitate the injured.

At the base camp memorial service, Buddhist lama, or priests, read religious scripts, and Sherpas and foreign climbers burned incense butter lamps and prayed for the dead. The victims' bodies were cremated on Monday.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . NFL linebacker Russell Allen is to retire from professional football at the age of 27 after suffering a concussion and stroke during a game in December. Allen, who lives in San Diego with his wife and two-year-old son, had been playing for Jacksonville Jaguars when he got knocked during a game against the Buffalo Bills. The footballer wasn't knocked unconscious, but he had blurred vision for the rest of the game and a pounding headache the following morning. Game over: A head injury has forced Russell Allen to retire from the Jacksonville Jaguars . Allen has what he described as a dead spot, no bigger than a dime, on his cerebellum which controls motor movement and coordination. The Jaguars released Allen last week after his personal physician consulted with the team's medical staff before a scheduled physical. The Jaguars declined to comment on Tuesday, citing medical privacy laws. Allen did not immediately return a message left on his cellphone. 'I told my story so athletes understand you can't ignore head injuries,' Allen posted on his Twitter page today. 'If you're not sure you have one, then you do. Report it immediately,' he warned. In the months after Allen's initial stroke diagnosis, he saw three neurosurgeons. The last one advised him to quit playing football. Allen told MMQB he has struggled to pick up and grip objects - doctors believe this will subside in time - and will be on blood-thinning medication for the rest of his life. The footballer hopes others will learn from his experience. 'Guys talk about it all the time, ""I'm all right; I just got my bell rung"",' he said. Injured: Allen, seen playing for the Jaguars in 2012, had a stroke after getting hurt during a game last year . 'I've had, maybe 10 times in my career, when for a second I felt woozy after a hit. And what I've learned from this is that it's not something to be overlooked. 'If it feels like something's wrong, something's wrong. I want someone to know my experience, so they can know when they experience something similar.' Allen sustained the concussion and stroke in Week 15 against the Buffalo Bills, after running into the team's center, Eric Wood, several yards downfield. 'It was strange because it was so routine,' Allen said. 'We hit, I got off the block, no big deal. I felt something flash - like they say when you get your bell rung. 'I didn't lose consciousness. I walked back to the huddle and finished the drive.' Later in the game, though, Allen began having double vision on the sideline. He did not notify team trainers, instead asking teammate Paul Posluszny if his eye was OK. Allen had a headache after the game and again when he woke up the next day, which prompted him to tell the team. The Jaguars ordered a MRI and sent Allen home. That Tuesday, the Jags told Allen to meet a team physician at the emergency room. Allen was told he had suffered a stroke and had tests for three days at the hospital. Wood responded to Allen's retirement through Twitter, saying: 'Pretty sobering reading on ESPN bottom line that a collision I had with a LB for the Jags gave him a stroke and career over.'","Russell Allen was injured while playing against Buffalo Bills last year .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . A prep school graduate who became the leader of a prolific drug ring in his hometown had moved away to escape drugs but returned last year after breaking up with an older woman, it has emerged. Neil Scott, 25, moved to California in 2010, where he began dating a 40-year-old dermatologist who gave him Xanax and other pills, changing his attitude and ultimately sending him back to Philadelphia, a former boss suggested. On Monday, he was arraigned on drugs charges after it emerged that he allegedly supplied marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy . to students in Philadelphia's . affluent Main Line suburbs. His partner, 18-year-old Timothy Brooks, was also arraigned. It has emerged that he met Scott after returning home following a lacrosse injury during his first semester at college. Arrests: Neil Scott, 25, (left) and Timothy . Brooks, 18, met last year after Scott broke up with his girlfriend and moved back home to Philadelphia, while Brooks returned after a sports-related injury at college . Both had once played lacrosse for The Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school where they allegedly went on to supply drugs. Scott graduated in 2008 and went to Connecticut College, but he dropped out after three semesters after he was caught smoking pot and making fake IDs, the Philadelphia Daily News reported. Afterwards, one of his high school coaches found him a job working for a team in California, and when that folded in February 2013, another coach in the state gave him a job on his program. 'He told me there was nothing good at . home,' the coach, Zack Burke, told the Daily News. 'Nothing but drugs and trouble, and he wanted to get . away from it out here.' Quite the haul: The duo allegedly set up a drug ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine to schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs. Pictured, a haul of guns, cash and drugs that authorities seized . But Burke said that Scott's attitude . began to change and he fired him for cursing at a child. He added that . he thought Scott began dating the older woman around that time. 'I feel like she made him crazy,' he said. 'I heard he packed up his car and went back to Philly in September.' Likewise, . Brooks headed back to Philadelphia for surgery after suffering a sports . injury after one semester - and he met with Brooks, a fellow Haverford . grad who he knew through lacrosse circles. The pair allegedly bought books about street-smart drug dealers to learn the business. Prosecutors say they then hired . students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford . colleges, and at several suburban high schools. The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said. Wanted: Timothy Brooks is led into Montgomery County Magisterial District Court. Prosecutors identified Brooks as one of the leaders of a drug ring they say supplied marijuana and cocaine to colleges and schools . Partner in crime: Neil K. Scott covers his face as he is led into court. He was one of the leaders of a drug ring. Scott and the other suspect, Timothy Brooks, were both graduates of The Haverford School . 'Their . intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over . drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools . and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman . said. 'This was not a game. These people were in business, they were in business to make money and . they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one . threatened their business.' Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations. Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy. 'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said. Damning evidence: Montgomery County district attorney Risa Vetri Ferman holds a rifle that was part of the drugs, guns, money and other illegal items seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring . Haul: Drugs, money and guns were seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine a number of high schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs . Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools. If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin. Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February. In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle. Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said. Questions: As well as the two ringleaders, Garrett Johnson, 18, (left) and Daniel Mcgrath, 18, (right) were arrested in the investigation. They are both students at Scott and Brooks' former prep school . 'Sub-dealers': Christian Euler, 23, (left), a graduate of the high school, and Domenic Curcio, 29 (right) Investigators found approximately . eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of . cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault . rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along . with ammunition for all of those guns. During . the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks . advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, . investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana . at local high schools. Brooks . and Scott are former graduates of The Haverford School. They also . played lacrosse at a Montgomery County private school and coached youth . sports leagues. Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation. Scott, . who is being held on $1 million bail, covered his face and shouted . expletives at reporters attempting to get comment following his . arraignment on Monday afternoon. His attorney declined comment saying he . had just gotten the case. Arrest: Willow Orr, 22 . 'Involved': Reid Cohen, 18 . Busted: John Rosemann, 20 . Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia . Caught in the act: Lafayette College another of the private coeducational liberal arts and engineering schools whose name has now been tarnished by the alleged drug ring . Brooks' parents posted the $25,000 bail to release him from jail. Brooks' attorney, Greg Pagano, says Brooks 'regrettably lost his way' and is remorseful. In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29. Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office.","Neil Scott and Timothy Brooks, 18, 'led a drug ring that sold marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy to students at local high schools and colleges'

"By . Bianca London . An overweight father has danced away the pounds and overcome a barrage of jokes - by joining his seven-year-old daughter’s all-girl cheerleading team. Darren Peacock, 32, was 17st 5lb when he was jokingly dragged onto the floor mat while watching daughter Amy Jorja wave pompoms at her local cheerleading group. The father-of-two was left out of breath and with aches and pains all over after being asked to help out with the lifting and tumbling. He was horrified at how out of shape he was, so agreed to become the only male member of the Hunters Cheerleading troupe in Horwich near Bolton, Greater Manchester, thinking it could be a great way to shift some pounds and get fit. Scroll down for video . A cheery good way to lose weight: Formerly overweight father Darren Peacock has shed nearly three stone after he volunteered to help out with his daughter Amy Jorja's cheerleading squad . Before and after: Thanks to his newfound hobby, Darren, pictured, left, 17st 5lb, has shed almost three stone and is now 14st 12lb, right . Thanks to his newfound hobby, Darren has shed almost three stone and is now 14st 12lb - and the 6ft 2in administration clerk has had the last laugh on male workmates who crack jokes about him 'waving pompoms' and 'wearing a rah-rah skirt'. He said: 'The lads at work give me stick all the time, but I don’t care. I enjoy it. It’s fun plus there's the health aspect too. I've lost three stone and I put a lot of that down to the cheerleading and eating healthier. 'In fact I am in the stunt group at Hunters so there’s no pompom waving. It’s definitely more manly. There are five of us doing various throwing, twisting and catching. 'Amy and I practise together at home a lot. It’s mainly me helping her with her stretching, balancing and tumbling. We’ll even practice when we’re on holiday.' Star cheerleader: Darren has now competed alongside Amy in the Hunters team and says it has been an incredible boost to his fitness . Proud family: Darren, who has a wife Laura, 30, and a 10-year-old son Mark, said: 'Cheerleading is a great hobby and getting fit has been an added bonus' Spot the dad! The father-of-two from Bolton enjoyed his new hobby so much he decided to join the senior team in January 2012 and began training three times a week . Darren started his hobby after taking his daughter Amy Jorja to cheerleading practice when she joined in 2011. Darren would watch with pride as his little girl was tossed up into the air and taught to cheer. 'I’d . definitely advise other men to get involved. It’s better than the gym. It’s not all about doing feminine moves like shaking your hips - it’s . throwing and catching mainly' Eventually Amy’s coach dragged Darren onto the mat to help out with catching the little ones. The father-of-two from Bolton enjoyed his new hobby so much he decided to join the senior team in January 2012 and began training three times a week. The father-and-daughter pair even have matching training outfits and Darren ignores banter from his friends at work and continues to wear his with pride. Darren has also embraced a new healthy diet to make sure he is at the top of his game at competitions.

Matchy matchy: The duo even have matching cheerleading outfits and Darren ignores banter from his friends at work and continues to wear his with pride . Asset: The coach says that Darren is a huge asset to the team thanks to his strength and determination - and his skills help his daughter improve . 'When I first started two years ago I was 17 and a half stone and I was really unfit. Amy’s coach Alicia dragged me onto the mat to help out with catching and throwing and I felt really out of breath afterwards. I was aching all over that was it - I got the bug. 'Cheerleading has inspired me to stop eating rubbish food and be more healthy so I can perform better at competitions.' Darren and Amy Jorja have competed at three competitions so far and are showing no signs of stopping. Not a pom pom in sight! Darren says that cheerleading has inspired him to stop eating rubbish food and be more healthy so he can perform better at competitions, which he says is more throwing and catching that prancing around . Darren said: 'At our last competition my stunt group came fourth and Amy’s junior team came second. It was such a good feeling to do so well and we want to continue to work hard to get to first place. 'I’d definitely advise other men to get involved. It’s better than the gym. It’s not all about doing feminine moves like shaking your hips - it’s throwing and catching mainly.' Hunters coach Alicia-Paris Fairclough said: 'Darren is a complete asset to our senior squad and plays a huge role within the team. He brings enthusiasm, a fantastic work ethic and, of course, immense strength. 'His daughter is in our youngest squad and his extensive knowledge in the stunts we do helps his daughter’s understanding and progression.'","Darren Peacock, 32, weighed 17st 5lb .

"By . David Kent . Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to have little or no say in who will be the next manager of Manchester United. The 72-year-old former United boss, who won 38 trophies in 26 seasons at Old Trafford, was effectively handed full authority to choose his successor after announcing his own retiremment last season. His choice, David Moyes, was fired today after an early mornning meeting with United chief executive at United's Carrington training HQ. Not this time, Sir ALex: Ferguson, who will not appoint Davuid Moyes' successor, checks his watch as he takes in a the match against Bayern Munich in this season's Champions League . No hiding place: Ryan Giggs (left) has been appointed interim manager at United following the sacking of David Moyes (right) The United hierarchy’s explanation for allowing Ferguson to effectively select his successor was that it made sense to trust the judgement of someone with so much success and who was still on the payroll as a £2million-a-year ambassador. United's board clearly remain keen to maintain links with the Ferguson era, however, as they have appointed Ryan Giggs as interim manager, with Nicky Butt his assistant. Sportsmail understands that Phil Neville remains part of the back-room set up despite Moyes' departure. The club are also intent on luring Paul Scholes back in to the Old Trafford fold after the departure of Moyes, as revealed by Sportsmail earlier today. Scholes has hardly been seen at the club since doing some work with Under 19s manager Nicky Butt earlier this season after becoming disillusioned with what he felt were half-hearted attempts by Moyes to find him a role. Now that Moyes has been sacked as United . manager, the club will do everything they can to fit their former . midfield player in to their coaching set-up as they look to retain a . connection with the club’s glorious past behind the scenes. With United set to appoint a foreign manager to replace Moyes the club are concerned that ties with the past could be cut. Ryan Giggs is now the club interim manager and will be retained whatever happens this summer but Phil Neville could follow Moyes out of the club after serving as a coach under the Scot while brother Gary and David Beckham are pursuing other careers. United had no plans in place to reintroduce Scholes to the coaching staff while Moyes was in charge and a source close to the club revealed to Sportsmail last month that the situation was unlikely to change. Scholes teamed up with Butt to help his former team-mate coach the United youngsters for the UEFA youth league in the autumn but this arrangement was on a purely voluntary, non-contracted basis. It was orchestrated by Butt, rather than Moyes, and it remained a temporary role. Last summer, Scholes turned down the chance to play a leading role on Moyes' staff, citing a wish to spend some time with his family before making his return to football.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Caught: State Rep. Dane Eagle, 30, R-Cape Coral, in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested for DUI after he pulled out of a Taco Bell about two miles from the state Capitol . A member of the Florida Legislature was arrested in Tallahassee on a drunken driving charge after an officer spotted him driving erratically outside a Taco Bell. Republican Rep. Dane Eagle, 30, was taken into custody  shortly before 2am Monday after he pulled out of the Taco Bell on West Tennessee Street about two miles from the state Capitol, Tallahassee police officer David Keller said in his arrest report. Keller says he watched as Eagle, of Cape Coral, tried to make a left turn from the parking lot and almost struck a concrete median in his path. According to the officer’s report, Mr Eagle then stopped at a red light but went across the stripe in the street. He then made a U-turn and almost hit the curb. Mr Eagle then drove 45mph in a 35mph zone, struck a curb and ran a red light before he was stopped, police said. Keller says he smelled alcohol on Eagle's breath and his eyes were bloodshot, but the state representative denied drinking. He says that when he asked Eagle to walk back to his patrol car, he stumbled and fell against his SUV. Officer Keller stated in his arrest report that when he asked Eagle about the alcohol smell, the lawmaker again denied drinking and said it came from friends who were in the car earlier. Late-night hangout: Eagle was arrested after he pulled out of the Taco Bell on West Tennessee Street about two miles from the state Capitol . Keller says Eagle refused to take a field sobriety test and said he was ‘good to get home.’ The . 30-year-old legislator was taken into police custody and later refused . to take a breath test. He was released after being charged with driving . under the influence. According to the arrest report, Eagle denied drinking that night and told the arresting officer that he was 'good to get home' In . a statement released Tuesday, Eagle said that ‘while there are some . decisions that I would have made differently,’ he does not think . Keller's report ‘is a complete and accurate picture of the events.’ He said that he could not explain further on the advice of his attorney, but would at a later time. Eagle, a real estate broker, was elected to the House in 2012 after serving as an aide to former Governor Charlie Crist. Eagle, once described as a rising star of Florida's GOP, sponsored a bill last month requiring all elected and appointed public officers to undergo mandatory drug testing, Christian Today reported. ‘We need to be as elected officials held to a higher standard,’ Eagle told WCTV in March. Eagle's proposed legislation came on the heels of Rep. Trey Radel's arrest on cocaine possession charges. Radel, a Republican representing Fort Myers, resigned in January after pleading guilty to a single drug count, Naples News reported. Friends in high places: The state lawmaker has been described as one of the rising stars of Florida's GOP, pictured here with two former Republican presidential candidates, Mitt Romney (left) and John McCain (right) On Monday afternoon, Eagle appeared on the House floor to cast a vote in favor of a memorial calling for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. House Speaker Will Weatherford issued a statement in response to Eagle’s arrest, calling it an ‘unfortunate situation.’ Tallahassee.com reported that Eagle’s father, a major contributor to Republican campaigns in Florida, pleaded guilty last year to a slew of fraud charges.","Rep Dane Eagle, 30, was caught driving erratically and speeding in Tallahassee, Florida, early Monday morning .

"By . Katy Winter . A staple in the royal calendar for generations, the Chelsea Flower show has been attended  by countless members of Britain's leading family over the years. The event, dedicated to celebrating all things floral, has taken place almost every year since 1913 following the success of an . international horticultural exhibition organised by the Royal . Horticultural Society (RHS) in 1912. Held in the beautiful grounds of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, it is an annual event (with the . exception of some years during the First and Second World Wars) and . takes place in late May. As patron of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), the Queen has attended almost every year since she came to the throne in 1953. She attends the opening of the show, which begins . with Press Day on the Monday, and is then given two private views along with RHS . members. She is often accompanied by other members of the Royal . Family. The aim of the exhibitions is to . celebrate all things floral and encourage amateur gardeners of all standards to try to achieve similar . displays at home and as a keen gardener the Queen is often seen at her most relaxed as she tours the extravagant displays amongst some of the world's most talented green fingers. Here FEMAIL opens the Queen's Chelsea Flower Show photo album ... 2013: Prince Harry gives his grandmother the Queen a tour of the garden he helped design on behalf of his charity Sentebale . 2013: Queen Elizabeth II visits the Chelsea Flower Show in London with her husband Prince Philip and grandson Prince Harry .

Queen Elizabeth, seen here visiting the gardens at the 2010 RHS Chelsea Flower Show, is often at her most relaxed and happy at the event .

The Queen at the 1984 show, in the  year she became a grandmother for the fourth time upon the birth of Prince Harry, who this year took part in the show himself . This year marked the centennial of the show and Queen Elizabeth’s presence was particularly poignant as her own grandson was involved. Prince Harry worked with his charity Sentebale, which hopes its African-inspired garden will highlight its work aids orphans in the impoverished kingdom of Lesotho. The Queen seemed delighted as her grandson showed her the garden, and her enthusiasm didn’t wane as the she took in the rest of the show, alongside many other members of the royal family. Miss Blom, who has been working on the design since last August with Harry, said afterwards: 'The Queen liked it. The Prince of Wales would like the plants in the middle to go to the stumpery at Highgrove. The Queen thinks it needs it – it needs some greenery. So we are going to send them down.' She added: 'She has been coming here (to Chelsea) for nearly 60 years. She said she thought it might be her sixtieth year.' The Queen used to attend the show often with Princess Margaret (left, in 1981) but clearly enjoys the day which ever members of her family are present .

David Bowes-Lyons (right) A young Queen visits the Chelsea Flower Show with The Marquise De Casa Valdes in 1952, just a year after she became Queen following the tragic death of her father King George, and before her coronation in 1953 . Usually demure and conservative in her style choices, the Queen often chooses to wear unusual headgear to the shows as a pragmatic guard against the windy conditions. Attending the show for the 48th time last year during her Diamond Jubilee, the 86-year-old opted for a rather different choice of head wear, striking for it's simplicity: a decorated hairnet. The tulle hair piece was first designed by the Queen's dresser Angela Kelly. It is made of a fine black netting which kept Her Majesty's hair in place while she wandered the grounds. Quite unlike the Queen’s usual headgear, it is not clear why she so often chooses to don the netting for the show, but for Chelsea Flower Show aficionados, Elizabeth’s fun fashion has become as much a staple of the show as her infectious smile. While the current Queen's love for the Royal Horticultural Society's annual event is obvious she is by no means the only member of the family who enjoys the show. It has become almost a tradition that the female members in particular attend regularly, perhaps stemming from the Queen Mother's Passion for gardening and the show itself. This year saw Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall attend, along with  the Queen's grand daughters Princesses Beatrice and Zara Phillips, following the long tradition of Royal support of the show. 2013: Getting the party started: The Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips cuts the cake as the Chelsea Flower show celebrates its 100th birthday . 2013: The affection between the Prince of Wales and his father the Duke of Edinburgh is obvious as they share an air kiss in the Forget-Me-Not Garden . 1969: Looking very young in her floral hat, it was strawberry time for  the Queen Mother in the grounds of the Royal Hospital . 1950: The Queen Mother wearing a dramatic two-tiered hat and fur stole when touring the show with the King . 2000: Princess Margaret didn't let ill health stop her attending the show . 1987: Sarah Duchess of York joined her Majesty at the event before her marriage to Prince Andrew ended . It is certainly not something usually seen on the royal head, but for many years now Queen Elizabeth has chosen to wear a decorative hairnet when she attends her beloved flower show. Opinion varies on why she continually chooses the slightly bizarre covering, but many believe it is to prevent her hair from blowing into her face, as much of the show is held outside in the gardens of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. However since it is presumably no more blustery than the countless other outdoor engagements, it seems the choice may be more a nod to the fun horticultural spirit of the day. Whether adorned with tiny bows or flowers, or topped with a fascinator hat, the Queen's hairnet has delighted and amused for years. 2012 . 1981 . 1987 . 1977 . 1993 . 2011 .","The Queen has attended every Chelsea Flower Show, bar five, since she came to the throne in 1952 .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . One man from Florida caught an 11-foot-shark weighing 805 pounds that may just break the world record for land-based shark fishing for makos. Last Tuesday night in Joey Polk of Milton, Florida wrestled with the monster mako shark and at times used almost 900 yards of fishing line from his reel. 'She was pulling line out of my reel at easily 60 miles and hour. We call that 'smokin' the drag' round here,' said Polk. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joey Polk caught this 805 pound mako shark on Tuesday and may break the world record for land-based shark fishing . SFGate reports that to celebrate his catch, Polk decided to barbecue the shark and serve it to his friends when he was unable to revive the fish. 'We tried to revive the fish and send him back out, but he was too worn out to swim,' the 29-year-old Joey Polk said. 'That's why we decided to keep him. We don't do it for the money, for the publicity, just to catch the fish,' he told The New York Daily News. 'It was really good,' Joey Polk told the Daily News on Monday. 'It's not real fishy. It does not have a real gamy, fishy taste.' The accomplishment is recognized by the International Land-Based Shark Fishing Association as the largest mako catch ever, he said. The mako shark is the fastest of all sharks and can swim at 60 miles per hour and this was no ordinary mako. 'When I saw it, I knew it was a big fish. I've been fishing since I was a little kid, but I thought it was maybe 700 pounds or so, then when we weighed it, it came in at 805!  It was amazing,' said Polk. The 11-pound mako was so big it didn't even fit in the back of his truck . Apparently catching huge fish runs in the family as the the former record belongs to Joey's cousin Earnie Polk who caught a 674 pound mako in 2009. Polk caught the mako off the Florida Panhandle with the help of two cousins, Earnie being one of them. The fish was so big that it wouldn't even fit into the back of Polk's truck. This is not the largest catch for Polk who caught a 949 pound tiger shark in 2010. SFGate reports that Polk is a third generation shark fisherman who takes his daughters aged 7 and 9 out fishing. He has a baby son who is only 3 weeks old and he plans on teaching him to be a fisherman as well. 'The funny thing is, as I left the house to go out that night, I kissed my son and said 'Daddy's gonna catch up a big, big fish tonight,' but I didn't think it would be this big,' Polk said. Usually when Polk and his family catch a shark, they release it back into the wild. Because this shark was so large, the family cooked it up and fed over 200 members of the community. Polk says he will not reveal the exact location of where he caught the shark for fear that tourists and foshing crews will overwhelm the area. When asked why he loves to fish Polk said, 'I do it because I saw my grandfather do it, my father, then my older brothers, then me. I love the sheer power of these fish, to be locked in hand-to-hand combat with a fish that can bite me.'","Joey Polk's cousin Earnie broke the last record for land based shark fishing when he caught a mako that weighed 670 pounds in 209 .

"By . Ralph Ellis . Follow @@ralphellis56 . Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football. This week, 18-year-old Southampton full back Luke Shaw proves he still has things to improve on defensively in his game, why Manchester United goal poacher Javier Hernandez is failing to find the back of the net and Liverpool's 5ft 6in midfielder is more than a match against bigger opposition... ................................................................................................................................................ Nominee: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez is on the shortlist for PFA Player of the Year after a stellar season . 1. Luis Suarez is massive odds-on favourite to be the PFA’s Player-of-the-Year as a reward not only for his Liverpool goals but his reformed disciplinary record, with Steven Gerrard second favourite in recognition of the way he has led the team’s title challenge. Spare a thought, then, for John Terry who isn’t even on the shortlist, even though Chelsea are still just in the title race and are also in the Champions League semi-finals. Aged 33, the Stamford Bridge skipper has played in 44 of his club’s 51 matches, one more than Gerrard including the Liverpool captain’s England games. Terry has also had just four yellow cards against his name, which is one less than Suarez – and Chelsea have the best defensive record in the Premier League despite Saturday’s shock defeat by Sunderland. Natural leader: Chelsea captain John Terry didn't make the list despite playing in 44 of his club's 51 games . 2. Match of the Day rightly gave praise to Southampton’s Luke Shaw for his attacking zest at Aston Villa, but they glossed over the promising young England star’s defensive stats. Marc Albrighton gave the 18-year-old a tough second half, which included Shaw picking up only his third yellow card of the season for hauling down the Aston Villa winger. Albrighton found space to put in 11 crosses in all – only Stewart Downing attempted more in Saturday’s games – and it was a relief for Saints that Villa had nobody to get on the end of them. Raw talent: Southampton's Luke Shaw (left) had a difficult afternoon against Villa's Marc Albrighton (right) 3. It’s a measure of Manchester United’s problems that Javier Hernandez, sent on to chase the game at Goodison Park with half an hour left, managed just one shot – which was blocked – in that time. The 25-year-old Mexican is a natural goal poacher who needs people to make openings for him, which might explain his worst ever season at Old Trafford with just seven goals. He’s had 1,288 minutes on the pitch in all competitions making it a goal every 184 minutes under David Moyes – compared to one every 110 minutes as he helped Sir Alex Ferguson’s title winning team with a total of 14 in 1,541 minutes last season. Goal drought: Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez (left) is having his worst season in England . 4. If any player typifies the way Tony Pulis has got the best from a group of players who were unproven at top level it is defender Joel Ward. The 24-year-old, naturally a centre half when he made a £400,000 move to Crystal Palace from Portsmouth two years ago, has played every minute of every game in three different positions since Pulis took over. Starting at right back, he then became a holding midfield man, and has now switched to left back during the club’s record run of five straight Premier League wins. He kept former England winger Matt Jarvis quiet in the 1-0 success at West Ham, as well as making more clearances than any other Palace defender. Mr Versatile: Joel Ward (centre) has played in every minute for Palace since boss Tony Pulis took charge . 5. Stoke’s Jon Walters is paying a high price for the red card he collected for a lunging tackle on Norwich midfielder Alex Tettey last month. The Republic of Ireland international set up a club record for 103 consecutive Premier League appearances earlier this season – but since returning from his three-match ban he’s been relegated to the subs bench. Mark Hughes has given him just 18 minutes in three games – although he’s doing his bit to win back a starting place. In the five minutes he did get on at Cardiff he hit the bar and created two chances for team mates. Out in the cold: Stoke's Jon Walters hasn't started for the club since returning from his three-match ban . 6. Mesut Ozil showed flashes of promise at Hull but is still struggling to live up to his record price tag despite Arsenal getting back on track to reach the Champions League. The German whose £42.5 million signing was supposed to bring world class creativity was involved in the build-up to Aaron Ramsey’s early goal. But, by the time he was taken off after just over an hour, he hadn’t directly created a chance for a team mate or had any sort of attempt on goal himself. Value for money? Arsenal's £42.5 million record signing Mesut Ozil has had an up and down debut season . 7. Joe Allen at just 5ft 6ins tall is quite capable of looking after himself in the Premier League’s land of the giants. The Welsh international played a key role for Liverpool in the win at Norwich that put the Reds within touching distance of the title. Given the task of replacing suspended Jordan Henderson in midfield, the £15million signing from manager Brendan Rodgers’ old club Swansea won ten tackles in his 81 minutes on the field, as well as getting forward to have a couple of attempts on goal. Little gem: Liverpool's Joe Allen (left) had an impressive game during their 3-2 win at Norwich on Sunday . 8. Ian Holloway’s capture of giant striker Stefan Maierhofer, a flop in his first attempt to play in English football at Wolves, has transformed Millwall’s season. The 6ft 6ins Austrian, without a club when he signed on at the New Den in March after being released by Cologne, scored twice at Middlesbrough for the win which lifted the Lions out of the relegation zone. Millwall have won three and drawn one of the four games in which the 31-year-old has started. Giant impact: Stefan Maierhofer (far left) hasn't lost a game in a Millwall shirt when he has started . 9. Watford’s strategy of playing musical footballers with the players from Granada and Udinese, the other clubs belonging to their owners the Pozzo family, might not have brought them success this season but at least provides some bright spots for Vicarage Road fans by giving them players they couldn’t otherwise afford. Spanish winger Albert Riera once cost Liverpool £8million, but is now waiting to link up with Udinese after signing a pre-contract following his release from Galatasaray. Meanwhile the 31-year-old has been parked at Watford and gave a reminder of his talent with the first goal in a 3-1 win that dented Ipswich’s play-off hopes. All smiles: Ex-Liverpool midfielder Albert Reira (centre) scored on his Watford debut vs Ipswich on Saturday . 10. Former Burton boss Paul Peschisolido once put a £1million price tag on striker Billy Kee, who he signed on a free transfer from Torquay in August 2011. The 23-year-old is proving every bit as valuable for current boss Gary Rowett after his 14th goal of this season sparked a 3-0 win over Hartlepool which all but guaranteed a place in the League Two play-offs. Stockily built Kee, rejected by Leicester at the start of his career, has now got 37 goals from 69 starts during his Burton career.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A couple have revealed how their nine year old girl nearly lost her leg to bone cancer after doctors initially thought she had simply pulled a muscle. Hannah Baker was left in agony as a 22cm tumour grew on her left leg, but was told it was probably a sports injury after visiting her GP. Her concerned parents, Paul, 36, and Shim, 36, assumed she was suffering from common growing pains. However, two weeks later when the pain got worse, they rushed her back to her doctor who recommended an x-ray of the youngster's leg, which revealed the huge tumour on her femur. Hannah Baker, pictured following cancer treatment. Doctors managed to save her leg and she is now on the road to recovery . Mother Shim believes had the tumour not been caught early in April this year, it could have proved fatal. She said: 'Hannah had been doing lots of sports and complained that her leg was aching. 'She didn't compete in the school cross country and I noticed as she walked back from watching it she was moving strangely. 'I picked her up to put her in my lap and she screamed. 'The doctor and us thought she had just pulled a muscle and we went away with painkillers. 'It was just luck we found it and acted so quickly but we never thought for a moment it could be cancer. 'We went back two weeks later and the GP suggested we go for an X-ray to be on the safe side.Three hours later Hannah and I were told they had found a tumour. In two weeks we had gone from having a healthy little girl to her having cancer. 'We were left numb and speechless. We thought we're going to wake up in a minute from all this but we just had to stay strong and be there for each other.' Hannah was treated at Birmingham Children's Hospital . Hannah's older sister Emily, 11, and the family from Clee St Margaret, Shropshire, were distraught as they awaited to find out how badly the osteosarcoma tumour had grown. After a nervous four weeks of chemotherapy Hannah's treatment was successful but she faced losing the leg altogether. The following are symptoms of Primary Bone Cancer... The primary school pupil loved hockey, netball and running but was told for the leg to recover she would have to give up high impact sports. Surgeons at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital, Birmingham, operated to insert a titanium endoprosthesis on the femur, a metal rod which will grow as she gets older. Now after six months intensive surgery, further chemotherapy and lengthy hospital stays Hannah says she is looking forward to getting better and starting to swim. Around 450 cases of bone cancer are diagnosed among children and young people aged 10 to 24 each year. Around 100 of these will be fatal. Father Paul was overjoyed Hannah has reacted so well to her treatment. He said: 'I thought when she first mentioned it that she just had growing pains. But it was likely she was born with the cancer and it lay dormant and with her growth spurts as she got older as a child triggered the bone cancer. 'The tumour was 100 per cent removed and . 100 per cent dead but the chemotherapy will continue until Christmas . when hopefully she will be given the all clear. Hannah has donated her cancerous femur to science . 'Her school has been amazing. The teachers kept her desk clear and read out her name in the register, waiting for the day she returns. 'She has managed one visit, but we can never make plans as her immune system is so low. She could be fine in the morning but off to hospital in the afternoon. 'She managed to spend her ninth birthday on July 10 at home, and smuggled sweets into hospital to sell to other youngsters on the ward.' Hannah is on a five-week repetitive programme of chemotherapy, blood transfusions and then two weeks in Birmingham Children's Hospital for more high dose chemotherapy. Her bravery and confidence has shone through with hospital staff who ask her to talk to teenage children newly-admitted with cancer. Hannah said: 'I've missed school since and I'm looking forward to getting back. 'I tell people the massive scar on my leg is the result of a shark attack and that I beat the shark away!' This week is Bone Cancer Awareness Week and Hannah revealed she donated her cancerous femur to science, in the hope other children benefit from research on it. Her recovery is also months ahead of schedule. Paul said: 'Doctors wanted her to be up and walking after the rod operation inside ten days but she was up and walking in half that time. 'She even visited school four weeks after the surgery. She's a very determined young lady.'","Hannah had a 22cm tumour growing in her left leg, causing her a huge amount of pain .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . At least 1,000 hospital patients in England die each month from avoidable kidney problems, according to a new study commissioned by the NHS. Researchers found that acute kidney injury (AKI) causes between 15,000 and 40,000 excess deaths every year. The condition refers to a loss of kidney function and can develop very quickly. Danger: Thousands of patients are dying from acute kidney injury each month - something which could be avoided, experts have warned . It can occur in people who are already . ill with conditions such as heart failure or diabetes, and those . admitted to hospital with infections. AKI can also develop after major surgery, such as some kinds of heart surgery, because the kidneys can be deprived of normal blood flow during the procedure. Severe dehydration is one of the main causes of the condition. AKI costs the health service over £1 billion every year and is responsible for nearly eight times as many deaths as superbug MRSA at its peak, according to a study commissioned by NHS Improving Quality. The research, carried out by kidney disease experts and Insight Health Economics, found that AKI is five times more prevalent in English hospitals than previously thought. Severe dehydration is one of the main causes of acute kidney injury . Report co-author Professor Donal O'Donoghue, consultant renal physician at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We know that at least a thousand people a month are dying in hospital from AKI due to poor care. 'These deaths are avoidable. This is completely unacceptable and we can't allow it to continue. Good basic care would save these lives and save millions of pounds for the NHS. 'Doctors and nurses need to make elementary checks to prevent AKI. In general, people who are having surgery shouldn't be asked to go without water for longer than two hours. 'Sometimes that is unavoidable but then medical staff need to check their patients are not becoming dehydrated. They also need to be aware that some common medications increase the risk of AKI.' Marion Kerr, health economist at Insight Health Economics, said: 'AKI costs the NHS more than £1 billion every year. That's more than we spend on breast, lung and bowel cancer combined. 'Every day more than 30 people are dying needlessly. Compare that to MRSA which was killing about four people a day at its peak. 'Simple improvements in basic care could save the NHS £200 million pounds a year and, more importantly, save thousands of lives.'","Acute kidney injury (AKI) causes up to 40,000 excess deaths every year .

Former Staff Sergeant Michael Barbera is charged with killing Ahmad Khalid al-Timmimi, 15, and his brother Abbas, 14 - both of whom were deaf - as they tended to cattle in a palm grove just outside As Sadah, about 50 miles northeast of Baghdad. Barbera, 31, who faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted, is set for a preliminary hearing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state later this afternoon. Accused: Authorities say Sergeant Michael Barbera fatally shot two unarmed, deaf Iraqi boys in 2007 . The U.S. army has released few details of the March 2007 killing, but Pittsburgh newspaper The Tribune-Review last year claimed soldiers serving alongside Barbera had reported the deaths. The newspaper said the soldiers remain troubled that he hadn't been prosecuted. Barbera also reportedly faces additional charges of lying to his commanders, directing fellow soldiers to lie to military investigators, and making a threatening call to a civilian. He had previously led Charlie Troop, 5th . Squadron of the 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment out of Fort Bragg, . North Carolina.

But I'm glad that the army is . doing the right thing,' Ken Katter - a 46-year-old sniper assigned to Barbera's team - said at the time.

Some 60 per cent of women in the UK say they are now more . likely to carry out home improvements than their partners and half consider themselves handier than men, too. The news comes as more women than ever are homeowners - single women now account for more than one in five UK households. Do It Yourself: 60 percent of women carry out home improvements themselves, while 78 per cent say their partners are consulted on the planning, design and decor . This perhaps explains why 66 per cent of those questioned said that the materials like paint, plaster and plywood are paid for from . their personal bank accounts. The survey, by WD Bathrooms, . questioned 1,244 Brits and also found that DIY still seems to be the cause of marital . disagreements.

"By . Associated Press . A search was called off because of darkness early Saturday night for one of two people who jumped from an interstate bridge in southwestern Arkansas into an icy river to avoid a jackknifed 18-wheeler that was skidding toward them. The search for the missing person along the Little Red River was to resume Sunday morning, according to Keith Stephens, a spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, which was leading the search. 'The water is 25 feet or less, so it's pretty shallow,' Stephens said. 'But the current is pretty high from the snow and ice from the storms.' The missing person's name was not released. Search: Hempstead County Sheriff deputies and Arkansas wildlife officers search the red river for a person who jumped from the  Interstate 30 bridge to escape a skidding 18-wheeler in Arkansas. Police have not released the name of the missing person . Three people were outside their vehicles after an earlier accident on the icy Interstate 30 bridge near Fulton, Ark., when a commercial truck jackknifed and slid toward them. Two people leapt over the guardrail and into the water during 29-degree weather. One person was recovered almost immediately, according to Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler. Game and Fish Commission employees and water rescue units from Hempstead and Miller counties were called to the scene. The bridge eventually was cleared and traffic flowed again, though roads were treacherous. Rescue: People watch from the river bank as Hempstead County Sheriff deputies and Arkansas wildlife officers search the Red river. A man was rescued and woman is missing after they jumped off an icy highway bridge in Arkansas into frigid water on Saturday to avoid being struck by a jackknifed truck. Snow swept into Arkansas from Texas and Oklahoma on Friday, generally leaving 2-4 inches in a swath from the Ouachita Mountains to near Memphis, Tenn. Schools dismissed early, but in the Little Rock metro area the snow came late in the evening rush hour and tied up traffic for hours. 'They need to pay attention to these hills,' said Mark Townsend of Little Rock, who bought chains Saturday morning. In the bank parking lot where he abandoned his Cadillac overnight, he worked to connect the chains to his rear tires and said he had gotten within a mile of home Friday night before traffic snarls ended his commute. 'The city should have been salting this last night,' Townsend said. 'Out here there's nothing but hills. The city could have responded better.' Cindy Keane left an SUV in the same parking lot and walked an hour to the Embassy Suites hotel less than a half-mile away. She also recovered her car Saturday morning. 'This caught us off guard. They told us we were going to get a dusting,' she said, waiting for the last bit of snow to melt off her windshield. On the lookout: Searchers dragged the Red River in southwest Arkansas to find the woman, described as being in her 40s from nearby Ashdown, Arkansas. The man was found with broken bones and taken to a hospital, said Miller County Sheriff Ron Stovall . 'I got to right there,' she said, pointing to an interstate exit ramp 200 yards away. 'It took me 10 minutes to get here. I promised the Lord, 'If you let me get through this without hitting anybody, I'll just park the thing.' Little Rock officials said the city closed five roads at one point because they were either blocked by abandoned cars or were unsafe, but all but one had been reopened by Saturday afternoon. 'At this time, I encourage citizens to exercise extreme caution if they must get out on the roads.' City Manager Bruce T. Moore said in a statement Saturday. He said 40 workers were out Friday night to address the storm and that 70 were on duty Saturday morning. Workers were scraping and salting the roads and putting down sand. Moore said crews would work 24 hours a day until operations are back to normal and that they were also working to prepare for more potential wintry weather forecast to enter the region Monday and Tuesday. He also said that police would tow cars left in roadways if they were restricting traffic or parked in an unsafe place.","A man was immediately rescued, while a woman was found missing after both jumped off icy highway bridge .

"By . Sam Webb . Jack Straw's son has defended posting a photograph on Twitter celebrating an Easter tradition with Morris dancers with blacked-up faces - claiming his critics are ignorant about history. Will Straw, 32, who has been selected by Labour to fight one of the party's top target seats at next year's general election, uploaded the tweet after meeting The Britannia Coconutters on Saturday. The 32-year-old, who is hoping to win back the Rossendale and Darwen constituency in East Lancashire, has responded to the outcry - some have branded the tradition 'racist' - defending the historic performances as a vital piece of local cultural history. Controversy: Will Straw, the son of former Home Secretary Jack Straw, sparked anger after posting a picture of himself with the Britannia Coconut Dancers, after watching their traditional Easter Saturday performances in the Pennine town of Bacup . Tradition: The 32-year-old, who was selected by the Labour party to run for one of their top target seats in East Lancashire at next year's general election, has been branded a 'racist' by people responding to his tweet (pictured). Others moved to defend the group, revealing its historic connections with the area . The Britannia Coconut Dancers take to the streets of the town of Bacup every Easter Saturday, performing their folk dances across the town . The group, who dress up in turbans and red and white skirts and clogs, congregate on Easter Saturday every year in the Pennine town of Bacup. The tradition, which dates back to the turn of the century, sees the dancers perform through the streets, from one edge of the town to the other over a 12-hour period. The group's website reveals: 'The dances they perform are actually folk dances and the custom of blackened faces may reflect a pagan or medieval background which was done to disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits afterwards, it may also reflect mining connections.' But being pictured with the group landed Mr Straw in hot water, after the Twitter community reacted with shock at his being photographed with the dancers. The message posted alongside the picture, reads: 'Good to talk to Neville Earnshaw of world famous Britannia Coconutters in the New Inn. Great Bacup tradition.' The tweet provoked dozens of responses, with some labeling the tradition 'racist'. Now Mr Straw, writing in the Telegraph, said accusers should 'mug up on their history before making false accusations.' He added: 'As many small towns throughout Britain struggle to maintain their identity against a tide of national retail chains, betting shops and fast food outlets, Bacup’s annual dance provides a window into a previous era.

Meanwhile others moved to show their support for the Morris dancers, recognising the tradition. @yorkierosie urged people to 'do some research before taking to stirring', offering a link to the Britannia Coconut Dancers website. Mr Straw told MailOnline the tradition must be treasured and preserved. He said: 'As many small towns throughout Britain struggle to maintain their identity against a tide of high street chains, betting shops and fast food outlets, Bacup’s annual dance  provides a window into a previous era and a clear sense of local tradition. 'Whatever the origins, we should all hope it will continue for many centuries to come.' Mr Straw's target seat was held by Labour before the 2010 general election when the Tories' Jake Berry won it with a majority of 4,493. The son of the former Home Secretary, an ex-Fulbright scholar and Oxford graduate, beat five other local candidates to win the post. As a 17-year-old Straw junior was caught trying to sell cannabis to undercover reporters, while his father was in the Cabinet. He was forced to write to Mr Blair apologising for 'letting down and embarrassing the Labour Party'. Mr Straw is the first in a long line of 'red princes and princesses' whose parents are MPs, to win selection for the 2015 election. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair's son Euan is said to be targetting the ultra-safe seat of Bootle, Merseyside ahead of the election campaign. The Labour Party declined to comment. The Britannia Coconut Dancers, known as the 'Nutters', are part of the history of the small Penine town of Bacup. Every Easter Saturday the troupe of men - dressed in red and white kilts and clogs, with their faces blackened - take to the streets of the town to dance their way from one side to the other. They perform folk dances, which are said to have originated with Moorish pirates. The custom of blackened faces, reflects, according to their website, a 'pagan or medieval background' to 'disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits'. The tradition is said to originate from Moorish pirates who first settled in Cornwall and moved north as the mines opened in Lancashire . It is also thought to link to the town's mining heritage. Moorish pirates who settled in Cornwall and found themselves employed in the mines are said to have brought the dances to British shores. As mines and quaries opened in Lancashire in the 18th and 19th Centuries, a number of Cornish men travelled north. With them they brought the dances and the traditions now upheld by the Nutters. The dances spread throughout the Rossendale area, and at the turn of the century four dance troupes existed. It is from the Tunstead Mill Troupe that the Britannia group descended. The dances are accompanied by the English concertina, and for Easter Saturday the group are joined by a silver band. The music, like the dance steps, has been handed down from generation to generation. The 'Nutters' have performed across the world, including taking to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for the English Folk Dance and Song Society.","Will Straw tweeted a picture with members of the Britannia Coconutters .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . U.S. President Barack Obama vowed today that America will continue it's eternal support for their top Mideast ally and assured Israel of his personal commitment to its security. In his remarks at Israeli President Shimon Peres' house, he delivered a blunt warning to the country's foes, saying that the United States has the Jewish state's back. Arriving in Israel on his first trip to the country as president, Obama told the Israeli people at an extravagant welcoming ceremony that 'peace must come to the Holy Land' and that goal would not be achieved at Israel's expense. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Glowing words; President Obama praised the long career of Israeli President Shimon Peres at their joint press conference held at his home in Tel Aviv shortly after Obama landed in Israel . Support: President Obama made it clear that the United States will continue it's unwavering support for the country . Old friends: President Obama said how President Peres refers to 'charm' as one of the biggest roles of any President, and Obama 'succumbed' to Peres' tools . The brief remarks made by both Obama and Peres came after a visit to the garden at the Israeli President's home where they planted a tree that Mr Obama brought over from the United States for the occasion. U.S. backing for Israel will be a constant as the Middle East roils with revolution and Iran continues work on its nuclear program, he said. 'The United States is proud to stand with you as your strongest ally and your greatest friend,' Obama affirmed, as soon as he landed on the tarmac at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport. 'Across this region the winds of change bring both promise and peril,' he said, calling his visit 'an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our nations, to restate America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors.' Symbolism: President Obama said that he was happy to return to the garden at President Peres' house which he saw the first time that he went to Israel in 2008 when he was a Senator . Taking action: President Obama brought this tree over from America and the two leaders worked together to plant it in President Peres' garden . Symbolic: Obama told the story of Honi and the carob tree, a famous parable from the Jewish text the Talmud, and said that it represents the two country's past and future friendship . Seeking to alter a perception among many Israelis that his government has been less supportive of Israel than previous U.S. administrations, Obama declared the U.S.-Israeli alliance 'eternal.' 'It is forever,' he said to applause as Israeli and U.S. flags fluttered in a steady breeze under clear, sunny skies. Even before leaving the airport for Jerusalem, Obama offered a vivid display of the U.S. commitment to Israeli security by visiting a missile battery that is part of Israel's Iron Dome defense from militant rocket attacks. The United States has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the system with Israel. Enjoying the welcome: Mr Obama was greeted by a children's choir . Obama and Netanyahu toured the battery, brought to the airport for the occasion. They met and chatted with soldiers who operate the system that Israel credits with intercepting hundreds of rockets during a round of fighting against Gaza militants last November. 'Let me say as clearly as I can: The United States of America stands with the State of Israel because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with Israel,' Obama said. 'We stand together because peace must come to the Holy Land,' he added. 'For even as we are clear-eyed about the difficulty, we will never lose sight of the vision of an Israel at peace with its neighbors.' 'The United States stands with Israel because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with Israel. Public events: The itinerary is filled with joint press conferences where Mr Obama and Israeli leaders will make it clear that they are united against countries like Iran and Syria . Commemoration: President Obama signed the guestbook at Mr Peres' home during the tour . Signing off: President Obama's note in the guestbook said that it was an honor for him to visit Israel again . 'We stand together because we share a common story patriots. 'Our alliance is eternal, it is forever.' In their personal interactions, President Obama said that it was 'good to see you, brother' to President Shimon Peres. To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he joked that it is 'good to see you.. and it's good to get away from Congress'. Netanyahu, . who sparred frequently with Obama over the course of the U.S. president's first term, was lavish in his praise for the president. Reaching the people: During his remarks, President Obama stressed the importance of securing a safe future for Israeli children . 'Thank you for standing by Israel at this time of historic change in the Middle East,' he said. 'Thank you for unequivocally affirming Israel's sovereign right to defend itself by itself against any threat.' Although preventing Iran from . developing a nuclear weapon is a top priority of both Israel and the . United States, Netanyahu and Obama have differed in the past on . precisely how to achieve both ends. Israel repeatedly has threatened to take military action should Iran appear to be on the verge of obtaining a bomb. The . U.S. has pushed for more time to allow diplomacy and economic penalties . to run their course, though Obama insists military action is an option. Obama, who joked that he was 'getting . away from Congress' by visiting Israel, planned to visit several . cultural and religious sites aimed at showing his understanding of the . deep and ancient connections between the Jewish people and the land that . is now Israel. He will also meet Palestinian . Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and travel to Jordan . before returning home on Saturday. But on an itinerary filled more with . symbolism than substance, Obama's main focus is on an Israel that is . increasingly wary of developments in Syria and Iran. Adding yet another . dimension to the trip, Obama landed amid new questions about the Syrian . regime's possible use of chemical weapons. Obama has declared the use, deployment . or transfer of the weapons would be a 'red line' for possible military . intervention by the U.S. in the Syrian conflict. Ahead of Obama's visit, . authorities in Israel said they believed that chemical weapons may have . been recently used in Syria, although U.S. officials have said they had . no evidence to support the Syrian regime's claims that rebels were . responsible for a chemical attack. Welcoming: Much of the trip will be focused on how President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu interact as their relationship is known to be frosty . Headed down the path together: Israel is looking for the United States to take a firm stance against Iran and their fledgling nuclear program as it is seen as the biggest threat to the Jewish state . Matching moves: Both the President and the Prime Minister were recently re-elected so there is a need for them to work out their personal difficulties and find a way to collaborate . Proud pals: Prime Minister Netanyahu posted this picture to his personal Twitter account . Even though U.S. officials have set . expectations low and previewed no major policy pronouncements, a clear . measure of the success of Obama's Israel trip will be how much he is . able to reverse negative perceptions. The centerpiece of the visit will be a . speech to Israeli university students on Thursday, during which Obama . will again renew U.S. security pledges to Israel as it seeks to counter . threats from Iran, protect its people from any spillover in the Syrian . civil war and maintain its shaky peace accord with an Egypt that is now . controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood. Obama will make an almost perfunctory . visit to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority's headquarters in the . West Bank town of Ramallah, where he will meet the embattled Abbas and . assure him that an independent Palestinian state remains a U.S. foreign . policy and national security priority. The downed 'Beast': President Obama's armored limo broke down in Tel Aviv this morning as it was headed to the airport after the driver mistakenly put gas in the tank instead of diesel . Big mistake: The 18-foot car has an tank that holds 6.5 liters of diesel, and does not work when given gas . Can't take it: The car had to be picked up on a tow truck and it is unclear whether the problem was quickly fixed . American made: The car that President Obama drove off in after speaking at President Peres' house was definitely an incarnation of 'The Beast' given it's Washington DC license plates and 5-inch-thick doors . As Israelis warmly greeted Obama, . Palestinians held several small protests in the West Bank and Gaza. Demonstrators in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip burned posters of Obama and . U.S. flags, accusing the U.S. of being biased toward Israel. In the West Bank, about 200 activists . erected about a dozen tents in an area just outside of Jerusalem to draw . attention to Israel's policy of building settlements. The tents were . pitched in E1, a strategically located area where Israel has said it . plans on building thousands of homes. The U.S. has harshly criticized . the plan. Israeli forces have swiftly dismantled . similar encampments built by Palestinians in the past. Abdullah Abu . Rahmeh, one of the activists, said Israeli forces surrounded the tent . camp but had not moved in. Despite not coming with any new plan . to get the stalled peace process back on track, Obama plans to make . clear that his administration intends to keep trying to get talks . re-launched. 'To tell the truth, they can't stand one another,' a commentator for Israel's Channel 10 television said of Obama and Netanyahu just as Air Force One landed in Israel . Reassurances: President Shimon Peres said in an interview shortly before Obama's arrival that he feels more confident now that the U.S. will support Israel against Iran if the ever developed a nuclear weapon . Being heard: Mr Obama will spend much of his trip in Israel talking with President Peres (left) and Prime Minister Netanyahu (right) Bring it in: Obama gives big hugs to both Peres (left) and Netanyahu (right) Obama will close out his Mideast trip . with a 24-hour stop in Jordan, an important U.S. ally, where his focus . will be on the violence in Syria. More than 450,000 Syrians have fled to . Jordan, crowding refugee camps and overwhelming aid organizations. In his talks with Jordan's King .

"By . SIMON JONES . Barcelona and Arsenal have joined Manchester City in monitoring San Lorenzo forward Angel Correa. The 18-year-old has been compared to City striker Sergio Aguero in his style, although is yet to prove as prolific. Atletico Madrid have reportedly already had an offer rejected. Barcelona are also closing on a deal for Croatia starlet Alen Halilovic. The former Tottenham target has been the subject of increased bids from the Spanish champions as they look to groom a replacement for Xavi. Dinamo Zagreb want a deal worth £12m with add-ons. Wanted: San Lorenzo youngster Angel Correa is being tracked by many of Europe's top clubs . Compliment: Correa has been compared to Manchester City star Sergio Aguero . Catch him if you can: Correa (right) shows off the skill that has attracted Arsenal, among others . Hopeful players duped by fake agent scams . Fake agents have been luring footballers into paying out thousands of pounds in exchange for trials at Premier League clubs. Young players, particularly from Spain, . Africa and Australia have been duped in recent months by people posing . as other agents, scouts and club employees offering trials, contracts . and extra training at clubs such as Manchester City, Chelsea and . Liverpool. In exchange for £500, the players are . promised contact with the clubs and a help with necessary visas while . an extra £2,500 will help cover travel costs, medical fees and . insurance. One incident resulted in a 16-year-old boy arriving at Manchester Airport unaccompanied to await a club representative who never turned up as they knew nothing of any proposed deal. Although such dealings are not new to the game, they do seem to be on the increase as fraudsters sense a financial gain. The cases are now being investigated by International Centre for Sports Security (ICSS), based in Doha, Qatar, who have raised the issue with the Premier League. They have circulated an alert to all licensed football agents which outlines how players have been contacted via Facebook and social media and particularly file sharing sites where players upload videos of themselves playing football. So far, ICSS say clubs that have been unwittingly used include Hull City, Stoke, Sunderland, Bursaspor and LA Galaxy as well as the three Champions League contenders in Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool. Fake documents with forged signatures have been uncovered and bank accounts traced to England, USA and Ukraine. An ICSS statement said: 'If players have any doubts they should contact the relevant clubs, check their official websites for contact details and phone them direct. Clubs will not contact you via Facebook, Linked In, Twitter. They are not likely to use Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo email accounts. If they contact you it will only be by using their official email.' Beckham trains at United's HQ Beckham was back at Manchester United last week. Not David but Brooklyn. The 14-year-old spent a few days during the October half-term training at United's Carrington HQ and took advantage of last week's school holidays to make a return. Brooklyn, who has been playing with Fulham's academy this season and has had training spells with Chelsea and QPR, spent two days at Carrington again last week as he joined up with United's Under 15s. United are on a push to bring in more young talent as well as at first-team level but, at this stage, Brooklyn is only training with the boys of his age group. Happy family: Doting dad David Beckham (centre) with his son Brooklyn (centre left) Old Trafford legend: Beckham has gone down in United lore after his trophy-laden time with the club . A keen United fan, he was spotted with his father David at Stamford Bridge last month as the family watched the Red Devils lose 3-1 at Chelsea. David wasn't around to accompany Brooklyn at Carrington last week but has been keen to play down the expectation on his eldest son when discussing his prospects. Talking to ITV's Jonathan Ross show in December, he said: 'The unfortunate thing for the boys is, any time they go and have a kick about with the youth team at Chelsea or at Fulham, or even their Sunday league teams, people say ""They've signed for them."" Or ''They're going to be playing for them."" 'And that's quite a lot of pressure on them as young kids. And they're just training at the moment. They're enjoying themselves, they're not signed with anyone, they're just enjoying playing football.' Everton are keen on Colback . Everton remain among clubs interested in Sunderland's Jack Colback, who has rejected the latest contract offer from the club. The 24-year-old and team-mate Phil Bardsley have both been made fresh offers but want to take stock of their options at the end of the season. Sunderland are keen to keep the duo and will make a revised offer next month when they hope to have a clearer indication of their Premier League status, although that could yet go down to the final day of the season. Sunderland expect to lose Sebastian Larsson and Craig Gardner with Larsson, 28, an option for several Premier League sides including Stoke. Gardner is an option for Leicester also. Stoke, meanwhile, have missed out on Hoffenheim's USA defender Fabian Johnson. The 26-year-old is joining Borussia Monchengladbach on a free in the summer. Challenge: Jack Colback (left) tackles Jack Wilshere during Sunderland's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday . Wigan target McAleny and TunnicliffeWigan manager Uwe Rosler is keen to sign Everton striker Conor McAleny and is competing with Ipswich Town to sign Ryan Tunnicliffe on loan from Fulham. McAleny, 21, impressed Rosler when on loan at Brentford at the start of this season. The Liverpool-born forward broke his leg in only his fourth game yet has battled back to fitness and Rosler is keen to give him a chance in the Championship. Tunnicliffe only moved to Fulham from Manchester United in January but could be surplus to requirements under Felix Magath. Rosler and Mick McCarthy are keen to take him on loan. Wigan are prepared to let defender Ivan Ramis go out on loan also after the collapse of proposed moves to Cardiff and Crystal Palace. Surplus to requirements? Ryan Tunnicliffe (left) could be on his way out of Fulham . Leeds and Bolton eye MoxeyCrystal Palace defender Dean Moxey is wanted by Bolton and Leeds United. Manager Tony Pulis is willing to let the 28-year-old left back go out on loan even though he has figured in 20 games this season. Moxey has competition from Jonathan Parr, who Bolton also like, with manager Dougie Freedman knowing them well from his time at Palace. However, Leeds' new owners are also looking to push on for promotion and are keen to help Brian McDermott by adding Premier League quality to his squad. Inter close on Vidic as United weigh up striker options . Inter Milan hope to finalise the smaller details of Nemanja Vidic's contract by the end of this week and remain keen on Patrice Evra, too. United assistant Phil Neville watched Porto's Eliaquim Mangala last week but staff still have reservations the centre back is worth his £37m valuation. They have also considered Jan Vertonghen at Tottenham. United remain hopeful of signing Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan, as reported by MailOnline . last month, and are weighing up strikers with PSG's Edinson Cavani, . Atletico's Diego Costa, Mario Mandzukic at Bayern and Luciano Vietto at . Racing Club among the options. On the ball: Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic (left) trains with Robin van Persie on Monday . He's on fire: Atletico Madrid's free-scoring striker Diego Costa in the Spanish capital on Monday . Liverpool kid Ilori wanted for good at GranadaGranada are considering a bold attempt to sign Liverpool's Tiago Ilori on a permanent basis after the Portuguese defender's impressive loan spell. Ilori, 20, joined Liverpool last summer for £7m from Sporting Lisbon and is yet to play a game for the Anfield club but since moving to Granada on loan he has impressed sporting director Juan Carlos Cordero. 'For the experience he has he is calm, he has pace, moves the ball well. He has come in and fitted into the team very quickly,' said Cordero. 'When the end of the summer comes we'll see if he is wanted by the Liverpool first team or if they want to sell or loan him.' Liverpool are continuing discussions with Glen Johnson over his future but are unlikely to pursue any interest in right back Bacary Sagna, who is awaiting an improved contract offer from Arsenal. The 31-year-old has offers from Turkey and France but Liverpool are likely to look at younger options should Johnson fail to agree new terms. Time to wave goodbye? Arsenal could lose Bacary Sagna this summer with contract talks unresolved . Villa scouts establish French connection . Aston Villa were among clubs represented at Auxerre's Coupe Gambardella tie with Strasbourg on the weekend. The tournament is for French Under 19 sides and Auxerre won 1-0 with a goal from 18-year-old striker François-Xavier Tamuzo, while midfielder Samed Kilic, 17, also impressed.","Manchester City, Arsenal and Barcelona are all watching Angel Correa .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple has admitted its computers were attacked by the same hackers who targeted Facebook. The iPhone maker says no data has been stolen in an unprecedented admission of a widespread cyber-security breach. Facebook revealed on Friday that unidentified hackers traced to China had staged a sophisticated attack by infiltrating its employees' laptops, but no user information was compromised. Apple CEO Tim Cook at the firm's latest launch: Today it admitted hackers had targeted computers at the firm, but failed to steal information . Apple, which is working with law enforcement to track down the hackers, said that only a small number of its employees' Macintosh computers were breached, but 'there was no evidence that any data left Apple.' In a statement, the Cupertino, California-based firm said: 'Apple has identified malware which infected a limited number of Mac systems through a vulnerability in the Java plug-in for browsers. 'The malware was employed in an attack against Apple and other companies, and was spread through a website for software developers. 'We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them from our network. 'There is no evidence that any data left Apple. 'We are working closely with law enforcement to find the source of the malware."" The iPhone and iPad maker also said it would release a software tool later on Tuesday to protect customers against the malicious software used in the attacks. Facebook also recently suffered a similar attack, and it is believed the same group could be behind both . Cyber-security attacks have been on . the rise. In last week's State of the Union address, U.S. President . Barack Obama issued an executive order seeking better protection of the . country's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. A report Monday by The New York Times claimed that an 'overwhelming percentage' of the cyberattacks on U.S. corporations, government agencies, and organizations all came from an office building in Shanghai with ties to the People's Liberation Army, information that remains unconfirmed and flatly denied by Chinese authorities. It comes just days after the same group attacked Facebook. ‘Our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack,’ the social network said on February 15. The . company says the infiltration occurred when ‘a handful of employees’ visited a website that, in turn, infected their laptops with security . compromising malware. This, the statement says, despite the laptops being ‘fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software.’ According . to the statement, the compromised site installed software that bypassed . internal security through a so-called ‘zero-day,’ or previously unseen, . vulnerability and exploit the company’s built-in protections. As reported by the New York Times on Friday, the security hole was a ‘well-publicized vulnerability in Oracle’s Java software.’ Apple's Cupertino headquarters, where the breach occurred. The firm is now set to release a patch to its software to protect customers from similar attacks . Facebook says they immediately quarantined the affected laptops and alerted authorities. ‘We have no evidence,’ the company stated on a blog post announcing the incident, ‘that Facebook user data was compromised in this attack.’ Weeks before the announcement, on February 1, Facebook was provided a patch for the software from Oracle, the makers of Java. That same day, Twitter announced its security had been breached and 250,000 of its users’ data potentially accessed. Twitter then suggested that other companies had fallen victim to similar attacks. In late January, both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal also announced their systems had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers in apparent attempts to monitor the outlets’ coverage of the country.","Apple claims no data was stolen during the sophisticated attacks, which downloaded malware onto employee machines .

"By . Deni Kirkova . Destiny's Child might have rocked some of the most iconic fashion looks of the 1990s, but Beyoncé has come a long way since letting her mother dress her for the stage. The global superstar has kicked off her Mrs Carter Show tour in outfits designed by some of the world's top fashion houses. Julien Macdonald, Dsquared2, and Ralph and Russo have all contributed to her showstopping stage wardrobe and today Italian label Pucci released inception sketches of their creations for the 31-year-old megastar. Peter Dundas, Emilio Pucci Creative Director, worked with Beyoncé to create costumes for her tour . Beyoncé wore several Pucci creations on the first night of her Mrs Carter World tour in Belgade, Serbia . Superstar Beyoncé teamed the outfit with a blue nails, lip gloss, smoky eyes and tousled hair . Peter Dundas, Emilio Pucci Creative Director, worked with Beyoncé to create costumes that resonate with the singer's 'modern take on glamour'. Dundas drew inspiration from the Fall/Winter 2013-14 Show Collection, reinterpreting the rock goddess theme through fabrics and proportions. This allows for the 'complexity of choreography and complements the theatrical storytelling' of the Mrs. Carter Show, which began yesterday in Belgrade, Serbia. Pucci's purple design was instantly recognisable as Beyoncé stepped on stage wearing a pair of high-waisted pastel shorts featuring their signature 1960s psychedelic print. Thigh-high leather boots, a double-breasted leather coat and wide-brimmed hat completed the sexy look . Beyoncé wearing the black leather Pucci creation in Serbia last night, where she performed for 18,000 fans . Queen Bey rocked the 1990s gangster look with a sexy twist, accessorised with matching hat . The shorts were paired with a cropped, beaded jacket in a cool lavender shade that she left just a little bit unzipped. The outfit was topped with a wide belt in a beige and black striped animal print. Another of Pucci's outfits is a 1990s gangster outfit given a sexy twist. The all-leather ensemble includes a large, wide-brimmed hat - which Beyoncé disposed of for part of her performance - a short black double-breasted coat and thigh-high boots, all in leather. While the Crazy In Love signer didn't appear to be wearing anything in the form of bottoms underneath the coat, she sported her favourite flesh-coloured fishnet tights. A sparkling bodysuit adorned with gems and two silver zips is designed to be worn with thigh-high boots . Beyoncé wowed the crowd in a super sexy bodysuit and thigh-high boots last night . A third Pucci outfit for the tour features a scooped neck sparkling black bodysuit with a silver zip on each side, teamed with thigh-high leather boots.

"By . Bianca London . She has become the inspiration for women everywhere wanting to lose weight after shrinking from a size 20 to a svelte size eight in just one year. And now Big Brother winner and Bristol resident Josie Gibson is flaunting the body she has worked so hard to achieve. Following the launch of her first fitness DVD (and several steamy lingerie shoots), the bubbly blonde has turned her hand to designing, releasing her debut collection of clothes for online fashion retailer Goddiva....and modelling it all herself. But the super slimmer has revealed that, although she is relishing her slim new body, she is absolutely terrified about putting the weight back on. Scroll down for video . Showing off her hard work: Josie Gibson, who shot to fame on Big Brother, is showcasing her svelte new figure in her debut clothing line for Goddiva . Before and after: Josie shed an amazing amount of weight after seeing photographs of herself in a bikini and says she is terrified of going back there . She said: 'It's a lot of pressure, imagine if I put weight on. I'm terrified of going back there. I've got to do it because I'm not just doing it for me anymore, I'm doing it for everyone. 'I was so worried about putting the weight back on I didn't buy any new clothes but I've put all my old clothes on eBay now,' she admitted. In May 2012 Josie was horrified when . she saw unflattering photographs of herself in a bikini on the beach, . which led her to lose the excess pounds. Not . only did the TV personality lose a staggering amount of weight, she did . it in record time, dropping three stone in three months - and a total . of six stone in just one year. A healthy new diet helped her slim down from 16st 7lb and a size 18 to 10st 2lb and a svelte size eight. 'I did put my heart and soul into it. It's always going to be my life now because I'm one of those people who . always has to watch what they eat and make sure I train it off; I'm not built petite, I'm built bigger,' she said. Speaking about her healthy new diet, . she explained: 'I eat all the time but little snacks. Sometimes I eat . eight times a day but the right stuff. 'I love eating healthy, I love popping . down to the farm shop and buying all the good stuff. But I've eaten . cakes today so I feel bad now.' Bubbly: Josie was chosen to turn her hand to designing because of her fun-loving personality, which they wanted to echo through her clothes . Prints and minis: The Josie Gibson for Goddiva collection combines Josie's love of fun prints, bodycon dresses and flattering maxis . Josie explained that exercise forms a . vital part of her new health plan and she trains four or five times a . week, with high intensity training serving as the most effective method . of weight loss for her. One type of exercise she would love . to try out is Yoga. She said: 'I can be quite highly strung sometimes . so I think yoga would be good, . maybe Bikram Yoga, which apparently makes you better in bed. 'I think . my exercise has made me better in bed!' Ever since debuting her new body, Josie has been hot property and been snapped up to pose for a number of magazines and lingerie shoots. 'It's such a fickle world that we live in, the offers have been rolling in since I lost weight,' she said. Health kick: After seeing photos of herself on the beach Josie adopted a super healthy new lifestyle and now loves eating all the right kinds of food . While she is relishing all the opportunities that come her way, the Bristolian is adamant that she won't get . caught up in the fickle world of fame and fortune. 'It's like I'm not living in a . reality, I keep thinking I'm going to wake up. I've been like that since . I came out of Big Brother. 'I can't believe that all this is . happening to me, I am just a normal girl who goes home and cleans up poo on a farm, I . prefer the normal life. 'I don't really have any celebrity friends, I like normal people. I love Cheska Hull from Made in Chelsea, I love all those Chelsea lot. 'I thought Pete Burns was going to be vile but he's actually the loveliest bloke and John McCririck is a really nice guy.' Girly glam: Prices range from £42-£55 and her dresses are ideal for a girl's night out . She is also a big fan of Davina McCall, who she became close with during her stint on Big Brother. She has since knocked Davina off the top of the exercise video charts with her debut fitness DVD, 30 Second Slim, but she is assured that the presenter would be proud of her. 'It's a lot of pressure, imagine if I . put weight on. I'm terrified of going back there. I've got to do it . because I'm not just doing it for me anymore, I'm doing it for everyone' 'I felt guilty at first. I do think she would be proud of me, I hope so anyway,' she said. And to celebrate her hot new body, Josie has joined forces with online fashion retailer Goddiva to create the Josie Gibson for Goddiva collection, a range of glamorous evening-wear. The 28-year-old was approached by . Goddiva due to her entertaining, flirty personality, which they were . keen to integrate into a new collection. The team formed in mid-2012, before Josie's remarkable weight loss, when the label was keen to create a collection for . women of all shapes and sizes. Josie . follows in the footsteps of Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson, whose . two collections for the online retailer were a sell-out success, and the . ex-BB housemate hopes her own range will be a similar hit. Big loser: Josie went from 16st 7lb and a size 18 to 10st 2lb and a svelte size 8, and what better way to show it off? The Josie Gibson for Goddiva . collection combines Josie's love of fun prints, bodycon dresses and . flattering maxis, making it an accessible collection for women of all . ages and sizes. From a fitted monochrome dress with . bling embellishments, to a vibrant green number with a revealing cut out . panel, Josie's collection of dresses are perfect for any glamorous . night out. Prices range . from £42 to £55, and her dresses also include a trendy animal print . dress reminiscent of Moschino's spring/summer 13 catwalk look. The collaboration will see Josie . interacting with fans and Goddiva customers with online competitions and . giveaways, as well as providing weekly style advice, creating online . links between her own website and Goddiva's. And while she is currently occupied with promoting her new collection and sticking to her healthy lifestyle, the star has big plans for the future. 'First I want to help other people lose . weight and then do a second collection with Goddiva. Now that I've lost weight I want to design some midriff baring dresses,' she said.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Charged again: Byron Smith had his charge increased from second degree murder to first-degree after killing two teenagers . A Minnesota man on trial for killing two teenagers after they broke into his house had planned the killings, and was lying in wait in his basement with a book, some snacks and two guns, prosecutors said on Monday. But a defense attorney countered that his client was terrified after several increasingly violent break-ins and hid after hearing a window break and footsteps upstairs. Byron Smith, 65, of Little Falls, is charged with first-degree premeditated murder in the slayings of 17-year-old Nick Brady and 18-year-old Haile Kifer on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. The killings rocked the small central Minnesota city of about 8,000 and stirred debate about how far a person can go in defending their home. Smith has claimed self-defense, saying he feared the teens were armed and he was on edge after earlier repeated break-ins at his home. Under Minnesota law, a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but authorities have said Smith crossed a line when he continued to shoot the teens after they were no longer a threat. ‘This is not a case of whodunit,’ defense attorney Steve Meshbesher told jurors on Monday. ‘Mr. Smith is the person who shot and killed those two people, but he is not criminally responsible for the deaths. He is not guilty of murder.’ Dead: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, (left) and Nicholas Brady, 17, (right) were found stashed in the basement of a man who claimed the teenagers had broken into his home on Thanksgiving Day 2012 . Byron Smith takes his first break during the first day of his trial at the Morrison County Courthouse in Little Fall, Minn., on Monday . Assistant Washington County Attorney . Brent Wartner told jurors that Smith thought a neighbor girl had been . breaking into his home, so on that Thanksgiving Day, Smith sat in his . basement, waiting. Evidence . in the case will include Smith's statements and audio from a recorder . that Smith had set up in a bookcase the day of the break-in, Wartner . said. ‘He's down in the . basement, in a chair, tucked between two bookcases at the bottom of the . stairs. He said he was down there reading a book... with his Mini-14, a . .22-caliber revolver, some energy bars and a bottle of water,’ Wartner . said. Wartner said Smith . heard the door of his house rattle at about 12:30 p.m., then someone . walking across the deck, then a window breaking. ‘And he waited,’ Wartner said. Scene: Smith has always claimed self-defense, saying he feared the teens were armed and he was on edge after earlier repeated break-ins at his home . Friends and teachers had expressed their shock at the deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . But Meshbesher said his client was hiding after break-ins that had gotten increasingly more violent. ‘He . became frightened and scared to live in his own home,’ he said of . Smith, later adding, ‘He began to wear a holster and pistol in his own . house. That is how afraid he is, and became.’ Prosecutors . say as Brady descended the basement steps, Smith shot him in the chest, . then in the back while Brady fell, Wartner said. Smith fired a final . shot into Brady's head, the bullet passing through Brady's hand, Wartner . said. Smith put Brady's body on a tarp so he wouldn't get blood on his . carpet, dragged the body into his workshop, reloaded his Mini-14 rifle . and sat down again, the prosecutor said. A . few minutes later, Kifer walked down the stairs and Smith shot her, . Wartner said. He tried another shot, but his rifle jammed, Wartner said, . and Smith told police he believed Kifer laughed at him. Joker: Friends remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . ‘He . was angry,’ Wartner said. He said that Smith then pulled out his . revolver and he shot her twice in the head, once in the left eye and . once behind the left ear. Smith . dragged Kifer's body into the workshop and laid it on top of Brady's, . Wartner said. Smith told investigators he thought he heard Kifer . gasping, so he placed his revolver under her chin and fired what he told . police was a ‘good clean finishing shot to the head,’ the assistant . prosecutor said. Smith is a retired security engineer for the U.S. Department of State. Kifer and Brady were cousins. The two were well-known in the community, and both were involved in sports. After . their deaths, authorities said a car linked to Brady and Kifer . contained prescription drugs that had been stolen from another house, . apparently the day before they were killed. Court documents from another . case show Brady had burglarized Smith's property at least twice in the . months before he was killed.","Byron Smith, 65, is on trial for killing two teenagers who broke into his home - Haile Kifer, 18, and Nick Brady, 17 - on Thanksgiving Day in 2012 .

"By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent . The cost to taxpayers of refurbishing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s new Kensington Palace home has hit £1million so far, officials revealed yesterday. William and Kate are hoping to move into Apartment 1A, the 57-room residence once inhabited by Princess Margaret, with their new baby this summer. Although the couple are personally paying for fixtures and finishing – such as curtains and soft furnishings – the cost of basic building work including new heating, electrics and plastering is being met by money given to the Queen by the Government. Decorating: The taxpayer has spent £1million refurbishing Kate and William's new Kensington Palace home . Home sweet home: Kensington Palace, where the royal couple have given their apartment a £1million makeover, pictured shrouded in scaffolding and coverings . So far the internal refurbishments have cost £600,000 and the renewal of the roof a further £400,000. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess stressed that a close eye was being kept on costs but added that the work on the roof had been long overdue, while the cost of the internal refurbishments have been dramatically increased by the removal of asbestos. ‘This essential structural work needed to be completed whoever moved in. The last major works in the apartment took place around the time that Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon moved in more than 50 years ago. The cost of interior decorating and furnishing of course falls to the Royal Family privately.’ The spokesman also stressed that occupied royal palaces are held in trust for the nation, so William and Kate do not own the apartment, nor can they or the Royal Family sell it. Facade: The fake frontage of Kensington Palace was erected while work was being carried out. The enormous canvas - measuring about 25,000 sq ft - covers the south side of the building . The fabric of all of these buildings must be maintained or otherwise fall into disrepair. Apartment 1A is a spacious four-storey property with its own large south-facing walled garden. It takes up half the Clock Tower wing designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William and Queen Mary. The living space has previously included five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, nine staff bedrooms and more than 20 ‘ancillary’ rooms. Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, who moved in following a £1.5million programme of refurbishment in 1963, famously installed a ‘futuristic’ kitchen complete with sleek Formica and teak units. It has since been ripped out. Trip: At the weekend William, Kate and pet dog Lupo got a free ride back to London from a friend flying past their home in North Wales . Coming in to land: The Duchess of Cambridge can be seen through the helicopter window (right) as it touches down in Buckinghamshire . In recent years the property has been managed by the charity Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which used it as office and exhibition space. As HRP has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work, the Queen has been forced to compensate it for handing the building over to William and Kate. This cost has also been met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is understood to be more than £100,000. According to Buckingham Palace’s annual accounts released yesterday the Cambridges were also responsible for the single most expensive foreign visit by members of the Royal Family over the last 12 months. Pay rise: The Queen, pictured yesterday with the Grenadier in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, is to receive a five per cent rise in income . They racked up a bill of £370,590 on . flights last autumn for their official Diamond Jubilee tour of Asia and . the South Pacific, which saw them travel to Singapore, Malaysia, the . Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Of that £107,958 was on scheduled . flights plus a further £172,436 on a private jet and the cost of their . entourage (but not their police protection officers) both in advance and . during the tour itself. Sources stressed that the value of . the diplomatic and business benefits generated by the ten-day trip in . September was ‘incalculable’.","Government funding is being used to pay for building work .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Todd and Pam Gunter turned their son into police when they discovered a hit-list he'd made last year of school bullies he intended to harm. A year later, the couple is speaking out about the discovery of their teen son's hit list that rocked Rigby, Idaho and turned them into crusaders for more mental health resources and education in America's schools. 'The reason we tell our story isn't so that people will look differently on us. We were also looking for the solutions,' Todd recently told KSL. Horrified parents: Todd and Pam Gunter turned their son into police when they discovered a hit-list he'd made last year of school bullies he intended to harm . The Gunters believe the solution is in prevention through education and school-based mental health resources. After their son plot was uncovered by fellow parents, the Gunters were flabbergasted. 'My first reaction was the same as any parent would be — ""you've got the wrong child,""' Todd recalled. 'It's our son, what would change our son, a kind, generous, friendly, child to do something so cruel and mean. And I couldn't understand at what point he would have had to have reached to have gone to those drastic measures,' said Pam Gunter told KIDK. When the disbelief wore off, they turned the boy in to authorities and sought out professional advice. It was then that a sociologist suggested that it was perhaps the couples' unwillingness to display any sort of confict in front of their children that led him to feel so helpless when faced with it at school. The popular boy who'd run for class president and always had lots of friends was turned to violence after just a week of taunting, it was later revealed. Snapped: After a week of bullying, the boy snapped because--according to mental health professionals--he didn't have the training at home or at school on how to deal with difficult people and circumstances . 'We do have disagreements, but we don't openly fight,' Pam told KSL. ‘This is a juvenile reacting to that bullying, trying to take matters into his own hands,’ said Robin Dunn, Jefferson County prosecutor. Police said bullying led to the fight started by the boy. Police found a bag containing guns, ammunition, and knives. Investigators believe no one else was involved in planning the possible attack. Keith Hammon, Rigby’s police chief, said a police officer was looking into reports of bullying at the school before the parents reported their concerns. ‘The officer felt that there was more to what was going on with this young man and decided he needed to be evaluated,’ Hammon said. The boy was held at the St. Anthony Five County Detention and Youth Rehabilitation Center, where he underwent mental health evaluations and treatment. Included were classes on how to deal with difficult people and situations. The Gunters now believe such classes should be included in curricula at schools everywhere. As their son settles into a new school, the Gunters have developed a pilot program for dealing with bullying. 'You can't go through an experience like this and close your eyes and walk away from it. You have to take it and you have to take it, take everything you've learned and do everything in your power and control to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else,"" said Pam Gunter told KIDK. Education: The boy no longer attends Rigby Middle, but his parents are pushing for his old school, and schools in general, to create anti-bullying education programs to prevent circumstances like the one they endured .","Idaho parents Todd and Pam Gunter's 13-year-old son was found with a list of classmates and authorities he wanted to harm, guns and ammo .

"By . Francesca Chambers . In 2001 when then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama's first child was born, it was Obama's aunt Kenyan aunt Zeituni Onyango who stepped in to help new parents Barack and Michelle. Onyango, who had moved to the United States the year before on a visa, took care of baby Sasha and kept the Obama's Chicago home in tidy order. After Onyango, 61, died at a Boston, Massachusetts nursing home after battling breast cancer and respiratory issues earlier this month, President Barack Obama returned the favor by helping to pay for her funeral expenses. But the President did not attend the funeral. He hit the links and sent a condolence note, instead, a New York Times profile on Obama's relationship with his relatives released on Tuesday declares. President Barack Obama's aunt died earlier this month from respiratory issues after battling breast cancer. She is pictured here in 2009 at her apartment in Boston, Massachusetts. A photograph of the President can be seen in the background on her wall . This framed photograph of President Obama and his aunt, Zeituni Onyango, taken when he was an Illinois state senator, was displayed in her home in Boston during as a 2009 photo shoot . Family arranged for Onyango's body to be shipped back to Kenya earlier this week. The White House did not immediately return a request for clarification on how much the President contributed to his aunt's funeral fund. 'This is the president’s personal family, so we are not going to have any comment,' a White House spokesman told the New York Times when it asked about his relationship with his Kenyan relatives. The White House also refused The Boston Globe's request for comment on Onyango's passing. Obama first met his aunt during a trip to . Kenya in 1988. He references their meeting in his memoir Dreams From My Father. Onyango became the subject of media attention during Obama's 2008 presidential campaign after press found out she was living illegally in the United States at that time. A judge later waived orders for Onyango to be deported, and she has been living in the country legally since 2010. It is unclear how much contact the President has had with her since, but The New York Times notes that framed photographs of the . President and Onyango still hung on his late aunt's walls when relatives . cleaned out her apartment after her death. President Barack Obama went golfing on Saturday instead of attending his late aunt's funeral in Boston, Massachusetts. Obama is pictured here in August while on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. On Saturday, he was at his regular course at Joint Base Andrews just outside of Washington, D.C. in Prince George's County, Maryland . The Weekly Standard first drew attention to the fact Obama was golfing at the time of his aunt's funeral. On that day, Obama was at his regular golf course at Joint Andrew's Base with frequent golfing buddies Marvin and Walter Nicholson and Joe Paulson. Marvin Nicholson and Joe Paulson are aides to Obama. Walter Nicholson's tie to the golfing group is that he is Marvin's brother. Obama rarely golfs with elected officials or cabinet members, and none were on course with him the day of his aunt's funeral. While the leader of the U.S. was not at Onyango's funeral, Kenyan officials reportedly were. A Kenyan blog published photos of former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga and Mombasa, Kenya governor Ali Hassan Joho reportedly taken at Onyango's funeral. Odinga, who served as Kenya's prime minster until 2013, was already in the United States on other business. The former prime minister is from the same tribe as the Obamas and claims to be related to the President. An uncle of Barack Obama's has refuted that claim, however.","President Barack Obama's paternal aunt Zeituni Onyango died earlier this month from respiratory issues and breast cancer .

"By . Associated Press . The federal government wants to ban sales of electronic cigarettes to minors and require approval for new products and health warning labels under regulations being proposed by the Food and Drug Administration. While the proposal being issued Thursday won't immediately mean changes for the popular devices, the move is aimed at eventually taming the fast-growing e-cigarette industry. The agency said the proposal sets a foundation for regulating the products but the rules don't immediately ban the wide array of flavors of e-cigarettes, curb marketing on places like TV or set product standards. FILE - In this Feb. 20, 2014 photo, Talia Eisenberg, co-founder of the Henley Vaporium, uses her vaping device in New York. Soon, the Food and Drug Administration will propose rules for e-cigarettes. The rules will have big implications for a fast-growing industry and its legions of customers.  (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) Any further rules 'will have to be grounded in our growing body of knowledge and understanding about the use of e-cigarettes and their potential health risks or public health benefits,' Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said. Once finalized, the agency could propose more restrictions on e-cigarettes. Officials didn't provide a timetable for that action. Members of Congress and public health groups have raised concerns over e-cigarettes and questioned their marketing tactics. 'When finalized (the proposal) would result in significant public health benefits, including through reducing sales to youth, helping to correct consumer misperceptions, preventing misleading health claims and preventing new products from entering the market without scientific review by FDA,' said Mitch Zeller, the director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. The FDA said the public, members of the industry and others will have 75 days to comment on the proposal. The agency will evaluate those comments before issuing a final rule but there's no timetable for when that will happen. The regulations will be a step in a long process that many believe will ultimately end up being challenged in court. Smokers have been drawn to e-cigs because they give the impression that smoke is being inhaled but without the thousands of chemicals in cigarettes . E-cigarettes are plastic or metal tubes, usually the size of a cigarette, that heat a liquid nicotine solution instead of burning tobacco. That creates vapor that users inhale. Smokers like e-cigarettes because the nicotine-infused vapor looks like smoke but doesn't contain the thousands of chemicals, tar or odor of regular cigarettes. Some smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking tobacco, or to cut down. However, there's not much scientific evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers quit or smoke less, and it's unclear how safe they are. The industry started on the Internet and at shopping-mall kiosks and has rocketed from thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide who can choose from more than 200 brands. Sales are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013. Tobacco company executives have noted that they are eating into traditional cigarette sales, and their companies have jumped into the business. Safe? The health risk of e-cigs is unknown - some believe they are healthy while others say more research needs to be done to figure out the health effects . Some believe lightly regulating electronic cigarettes might actually be better for public health overall, if smokers switch and e-cigarettes really are safer. Others are raising alarms about the hazards of the products and a litany of questions about whether e-cigarettes will keep smokers addicted or encourage others to start using e-cigarettes, and even eventually tobacco products. 'Right now for something like e-cigarettes, there are far more questions than answers,' Zeller said, adding that the agency is conducting research to better understand the safety of the devices and who is using them. In addition to prohibiting sales to minors and requiring health labels that warn users that nicotine is an addictive chemical, e-cigarette makers also would be required to register their products with the agency and disclose ingredients. They also would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products. Regulations: The new rules would regulate e-cigs similar to how the government regulates regular cigarettes . They also couldn't use words such as 'light' or 'mild' to describe their products, give out free samples or sell their products in vending machines unless they are in a place open only to adults, such as a bar. Companies also will be required to submit applications for premarket review within two years. As long as an e-cigarette maker has submitted the application, the FDA said it will allow the products to stay on the market while they are being reviewed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nina Khosla, 26, is the daughter of billionaire Silicon Valley power couple Vinod and Neeru Khosla . The ex-boyfriend of the daughter of a prominent Indian-American family was arrested last week after it emerged that he had allegedly attempted to blackmail her family using nude photos of his ex. Nina Khosla, 26, is the daughter of billionaire Silicon Valley power couple Vinod and Neeru Khosla. Vinod, 59, is the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems who now runs his own venture capitalist firm, while wife Neeru, 59, is the co-founder and chair of the non-profit CK12 Foundation. The alleged blackmailer is Douglas Tarlow, who Nina met while studying product design at Stamford University in 2007. FBI . agents last week arrested Tarlow, 27, in connection with the alleged . extortion plot. He is scheduled to appear before a U.S. District Court . preliminary hearing on Thursday. The pair were a couple for about two years before breaking up in late-2010. During . their relationship Khosla ‘voluntarily took nude photos and video’ which she shared with Tarlow, according to detailed in a court affidavit . sworn by Agent Glenn Solomon-Hill. Although the FBI affidavit does not name Tarlow’s alleged targets, The Smoking Gun has reported that the Khoslas are the victims referred to in the document. FBI agents last week arrested Tarlow in connection with an alleged extortion plot to try and blackmail Nina and her mom using nude photos of his ex . ‘I’d prefer that you didn’t write about that,’ Nina Khosla told TSG. Tarlow is alleged to have threatened to distribute the naked images online, warning in one e-mail that, ‘Everything is going to reddit. From there, it will be impossible to remove from the internet forever.’ In a text message to Nina Khosla’s mother - who was sent several of the nude photos - Tarlow stated, ‘it seems you’re going to be the mother of the next Paris Hilton,’ investigators allege. Not long after the couple’s relationship ended, Khosla recommended Tarlow for a $125,000 job with her mom’s education foundation. Vinod Khosla, 59, is the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems who now runs his own venture capitalist firm . Neeru Khosla, 59, is the co-founder and chair of the non-profit CK12 Foundation . But relations soured just seven months later when Tarlow was fired in February 2012. In the months that followed he sent text and e-mail messages to Neeru Khosla complaining that he had been treated unfairly, and that she ‘owed him money from his tenure at the company,’ according to the FBI affidavit. In September 2012, mother and daughter both received texts from Tarlow’s phone number featuring several of the naked photos. One text to Nina asked, ‘shall I call you Paris?’ Tarlow also claimed that he was owed $72,000 for his work at the education foundation. In an October 2012 e-mail to Tarlow’s Gmail account, Nina Khosla asked why he was threatening her. A reply e-mail claimed, ‘not me. No idea what that is.’ A second e-mail stated, ‘please don’t contact me further.’ In . late-2012, the Khosla family contacted the FBI who used grand jury . subpoenas to link Tarlow to threatening texts and e-mails sent to the . two women - but he was not arrested at that time. More . than a year then passed before Tarlow allegedly re-contacted the . Khoslas last December, once again threatened to release the naked . photos.","Nina Khosla, 26, is the daughter of billionaire Silicon Valley power couple Vinod and Neeru Khosla .

"By . Associated Press . The FBI asked for the public's help today to identify at least 90 potential victims of a suspected child predator who worked at 10 American and other international schools abroad for more than 40 years before committing suicide last month in Minnesota. William James Vahey, 64, killed himself in Luverne, Minnesota, on March 21, the FBI said. That was two days after agents in Houston filed for a warrant to search a computer thumb drive that belonged to Vahey, a U.S. citizen with residences in London and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. An employee of the American Nicaraguan School in Managua, where Vahey had recently taught ninth-grade world history and geography, gave the drive to the U.S. Embassy there. Scroll down for video . William James Vahey (pictured in 2013, left and right in 2004). The FBI is asking for help to identify at least 90 victims of Vahey's, a suspected serial child predator who worked in American schools worldwide for four decades. Vahey, 64, killed himself on March 21 . The storage device contained pornographic . images of at least 90 boys, ages 12 to 14, who appeared to be drugged . and unconscious, the FBI said. The agency's spokeswoman in Houston, . Special Agent Shauna Dunlap, said that . investigators suspect all of the boys in the images were students of . Vahey's, going back to 2008, and that he had molested all of them. The images had captions and dates that matched up with places that Vahey had previously traveled with students, the FBI said . 'When confronted about the images by a school administrator, Vahey confessed that he was molested as a child and had preyed on boys his entire life, giving them sleeping pills prior to the molestation,' according to a statement posted prominently on the FBI's website with links for potential victims. The photos were catalogued with dates and locations that corresponded with overnight field trips that Vahey had taken with students since 2008, but he had led students on such trips for his entire career, the FBI said. 'I'm concerned that he may have preyed on many other students prior to 2008,' Special Agent Patrick Fransen of Houston said in the statement. 'I've never seen another case where an individual may have molested this many children over such a long period of time.' The director general of the American Nicaraguan School, Gloria Doll, said by phone from Managua that Vahey was 'famous for wanting to lead student experience trips'. William James Vahey (pictured left in 1995 and right in 1986). He confessed to a colleague in Nicaragua that he had been molesting young boys for his entire life, the FBI said . She said that's why several of his previous schools hired him. Doll said that, as far as she knew, none of her students had been molested. Vahey started teaching at her school last August but had not led any trips for her school before the allegations surfaced. She said he had been due to take a group to a model United Nations event in the Dominican Republic the very next day. 'We realized we had probably been spared what was happening,' Doll said. Doll said Vahey's flash drive had been taken by his domestic employee, who returned it to the school and urged officials to take a look. The FBI said Vahey was jailed for child molestation in California in 1969, but Doll said his arrest didn't turn up when the Nicaraguan school checked his criminal background. She said he came highly recommended and had been 'probably one of the finest teachers' at her school. Vahey's career included posts at the Tehran American School in Iran from 1972-73; the American Community School of Beirut in Lebanon, 1973-75; the American School of Madrid in Spain, 1975-76; the Passargad School in Ahwaz, Iran, 1976-78; the American Community School in Athens, Greece, 1978-80; the Saudi Aramco Schools in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 1980-92; the Jakarta International School in Indonesia, 1992-2002; the Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, Venezuela, 2002-09; and the Southbank International School in London, 2009-2013. Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, Venezuela where alleged pedophile William James Vahey taught from 2002 until 2009 . He coached boys basketball at several schools, the FBI said. Such schools typically serve a mix of students from those countries, as well as the children of U.S. diplomats, military personnel and other American citizens working abroad, and the FBI said it believes his victims are multinational. The FBI is concerned that some victims might not even know they were abused. 'He had access to children because of his position of trust,' Fransen said. 'He created a system that gave him the opportunity and the means to molest children. The manner in which he committed these acts - while the boys were unconscious - may have inhibited them from knowing what happened, making it impossible for them to come forward at the time of the molestation.' The FBI's Houston office is leading the investigation because its squad for crimes against children often goes to Latin America to assist with investigations, Dunlap said. Vahey's death didn't stop the investigation because the FBI is obligated to reach out to the potential victims, she said. The American Nicaraguan School in Managua, Nicaragua where Vahey had been teaching since last year. A colleague at the school allegedly uncovered a computer drive where he had pornographic images of young boys . FBI officials declined to say why they believe Vahey went to Luverne, a town of about 4,700 people about 160 miles southwest of Minneapolis, where he killed himself at a motel. The FBI spokesman in Minneapolis, Special Agent Kyle Loven, said it was 'plausible' that he had relatives there. Vahey is not known to have taught anywhere in Minnesota, he said. A notice in the bulletin for St. Catherine's Catholic Church in Luverne for March 29-30 asked parishioners to 'pray for eternal rest for Bill Vahey,' who was identified as the son of one parishioner and brother of another. They did not have working listed phone numbers. The notice said his funeral Mass was scheduled for 'his home parish in South Carolina'. The St. Catherine's parish administrator said she couldn't comment on whether the notice referred to the same William Vahey who committed suicide in Luverne.","William James Vahey, 64, killed himself at a motel in Luverne, Minnesota, on March 21 after an FBI investigation was launched .

"By . Meghan Keneally . The Sherpa community has threatened to strike if their insurance levels are not doubled and more financial safety nets are put in place after 16 of their colleagues died in the worst accident Mount Everest has ever seen. The Sherpas are the main breadwinners for their families in the extremely poor country and for years their relatives were paid minimal amounts if they died on the mountain. As 13 men died and three remain missing yet presumed dead after a piece of ice broke lose early Friday when they were going to fix the ropes for international groups, the compensation rate is being revisited and many of the Sherpas are demanding action before they go back to climbing. Heartbreaking: Sherpas just recently had their life insurance payouts to their relatives (like the pictured relatives of one of the Sherpas who died last week) increased from $4,600 to $10,400 which is barely enough to pay for their Buddhist funerals but now they are pushing to have that figure doubled . The payouts to Sherpas' families are minimal and many times don't even cover the costs of traditional Buddhist funeral ceremonies let alone help replace the income the guide work generated . Government-mandated death insurance for the local guides hired to help bring adventurers and their gear up the harrowing mountain was recently raised from $4,600 to $10,400, but now they are threatening to stop climbing unless they get assurances that it will be boosted to $20,800. The $4,600 death and accident insurance fee that had been the standard rate for years was never enough, and families regularly went into debt in order to give their loved ones a full Buddhist ceremony meant to speed up the soul's journey towards reincarnation. That number was doubled earlier this year, but it has not addressed the continuing problems of inequality surrounding the Everest climbs: foreign groups and adventurers pay upwards of $50,000 or $60,000 to make the storied trek, but the Sherpas see very little of that money. The Nepalese ministry of tourism gets a much larger cut, and now the Sherpas have demanded that a portion of the visa fees be set aside for a relief fund. The government has issued 334 permits this season, up from 328 last year. Emotional: Daughter of Ang Kaji Sherpa, one of the victims of the Mount Everest avalanche on 18 April, collapses during the cremation ceremony at Syambhu . A Nepalese woman holds her hands together in prayer during the cremation ceremony on Monday . Documentation: A Nepal government report names the victims of the tragedy and reveals they were on an 'NBC Everest Expedition' Outside Magazine reported last year that the Sherpas were set to receive other bumps in payments in early 2014, with their health coverage jumping from $575 to $4,000. The rescue insurance, which goes towards helicopter fees when Sherpas fall or are incapacitated at high altitudes, went from $4,000 to $11,000- but that still did not cover the costs of an emergency ride which regularly costs somewhere around $15,000. The Associated Press reported that the group's third and final demand in light of Friday's accident- calling for the creation of a monument in honor of the fallen Sherpas- is the only one that the government has already agreed to, but the others are still being considered. 'We will do what we can, keeping with the standard practice to provide compensation,' Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh said Monday. They also want assurance that the government will bring regulations to protect them in the future. The ceremony took place at the Syambhu in Kathmandu, Nepal, after the avalanche on Friday . Buddhist monks attend prayers for Nepalese mountaineers as their fellow guides threatened to boycott expeditions on Monday . Prayers were also said for the three Sherpas who were never found after the avalanche . 'The government has made no big response even after a big tragedy like this. Until they hear our pleas we will continue to put pressure,' Sherpa Pasang of the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association said, adding they plan to meet top government officials later in the week. The role as a Sherpa has always been a dangerous one but the men are relatively well compensated: more experienced guides can earn upwards of $6,000 during the three-month busy season which begins in May. By comparison, the national salary average is closer to $700. When tragedy strikes, the logistics and chains of responsibility when it comes to the hiring process also complicates the payouts. Western groups typically hire expedition companies- many of which are based in America and Europe- which then hire trekking companies based in the Nepalese capital of Katmandu or closer to the base of the mountain. Deadly force: The avalanche that killed at least thirteen Sherpas is pictured as it barrels down Mount Everest . Final moments: Rescuers recovered the body of one mountain guide on Saturday after an ice avalanche swept the lower slopes of Mount Everest, bringing the death toll to at least 13 in the deadliest accident on the world's highest mountain . In most situations, the government insurance is bought either in full by the local trekking company or is split between them and the larger- and typically more wealthy- touring company. When it comes to Friday's accident, MailOnline exclusively reported at least five of the Sherpas were on the mountain after being hired by local trekking companies to work as the crew for Peacock Productions, a film crew associated with NBC who were preparing for a now-cancelled TV special. Two of the fatalities were explicitly listed as being a part of the NBC Everest Expedition and three others were hired by Adventurist Expeditions, an Everest climbing company that the wingsuit jumper at the heart of the Discovery Channel special had previously worked with. Rescue . mission: Nepalese mountain rescue workers pictured lifting an injured . climber shortly after the avalanche on Mount Everest at around 6.30am on . Friday . Survivor: Dawa Tashi Sherpa, pictured, is one of several guides who were rescued from the mountain . NBC and Discovery officials would not specifically state which sherpas or what tour companies the networks employed at Everest when MailOnline made repeated inquiries, but a part of the Peacock . Productions crew currently at Everest Base Camp did confirm that five members of their larger crew were among the fatalities. The Peacock Productions crew had been working with Alpine Ascents International, a Washington state-based tour company who arranges Everest treks and works with different local Sherpa guides and groups. MailOnline has been in touch with the company about the Sherpas they hired but the owner who is currently in Nepal was unable to return our calls due to the busy situation at base camp. Six of the 13 dead bodies were cremated on Monday as part of an elaborate Buddhist ceremony in Katmandu that was attended by hundreds.

"By . Ashley Collman . Authorities in Virginia are warning parents to be on the lookout for a deadly designer drug after three teenage girls were hospitalized last week for ingesting the LSD-like substance. Officers were called to a residence in Lansdowne on April 14, during Virginia's Spring Break, where three girls between 13 and 18 were acting erratically. When they arrived at the residence one of the girls started yelling and kicking police officers. All three were transported to the hopital and have since been released. Scary stuff: Authorities in Loudon County, Virginia are warning parents to be on the lookout for a designer-drug called 25i which is sweeping local high schools . Authorities believe the three girls took a drug called 25i, which is also referred to as Nbomb or Smiles. The . drug was first noticed in the area around 2012, and in 2013 was . classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, making it one of the . most dangerous drugs with a high risk of dependence and abuse. '25i . can be dangerous, even at small dosages,' said Loudoun County Sheriff . Mike Chapman in a statement. 'This drug can cause violent behavior, . disorientation, seizures and death.' Varied forms: Like LSD, 25i comes in blotted paper form but can also be ingested in powder form or injected . The . drug is usually sprayed onto blotter paper, giving it the appearance of . LSD.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda was ejected for using pine tar less than two weeks after appearing to get away with using a foreign substance in another game against Boston, and the Red Sox beat New York 5-1 on Wednesday night. Pine tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same reason, particularly in cold weather. However, MLB rules say that a pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to Pineda. The right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the mound without protest. Busted: Umpires caught Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda (left) with pine tar on his neck . Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in the past.' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Pineda (2-2) had nothing on the right side of his neck in a photo of him on the mound in his tough first inning, when four of the first six batters reached on hits. He said he put it on to get a better grip on the ball. Another photo taken in the second showed a shiny horizontal substance on his upper neck below his right ear. After Pineda struck out the first two batters and had a 1-2 count on Grady Sizemore, Farrell talked to Davis. The umpire went to the mound, looked at the ball then touched the substance on Pineda's neck with his right index finger. Then he gestured with that same finger, indicating Pineda's ejection. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' The incident comes just two weeks after a 'suspicious substance' was seen on Pineda's right arm during another game against the Red Sox. Though it was never investigated by umpires, baseball analysts believe it was also pine tar. Rule 8.02(b) says a pitcher shall not 'have on his person, or in his possession, any foreign substance. For such infraction of this section the penalty shall be immediate ejection from the game. In addition, the pitcher shall be suspended automatically.' 'We will talk to the umpires tomorrow and review their report before taking any action,' Major League Baseball spokesman Michael Teevan said. In recent suspensions of pitchers for pine tar, Tampa Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Los Angeles Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped his challenge with no reduction. Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.","Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda was thrown out of Wednesday's game after the umpire found pine tar on his neck .

Around 80 active ship breaking yards line an eight-mile stretch of the coast,   employing more than 200,000 Bangladeshis and accounting for half of all the steel in Bangladesh. Ship breaking is the dismantling of ships for scrap recycling. Most ships have a lifespan of a 25-30 years before there is so   much wear that repair becomes uneconomical, but the rising cost to insure and maintain aging vessels can make even younger vessels   unprofitable to operate. Scroll down for video . A satellite image shows a mile-long stretch of the Bangladeshi coast just north of Chittagong, where ships from around the world are beached and dismantled . Arduous: At low tide ship-breakers haul a 10,000-pound cable to a beached ship to winch pieces ashore as they dismantle it . Swarms of laborers from the poorest parts of Bangladesh use acetylene . torches and their hands to slice the carcass into pieces. These are . hauled off the   beach by teams of loaders, then melted down. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be recycled. Equipment, fuel and chemicals on board the vessel can also be reused. Peter Gwin, writing for National Geographic, visited the region to see it first hand. He described the guards, razor wire-topped fences and signs   prohibiting photography there, installed following scrutiny in the ship breaker's operations after a spate of deaths. After workers spent several days cutting through the decks of the Leona I, a large section suddenly crashes, sending shards of steel flying toward the yard managers. Built in Split, Croatia, the cargo vessel was at sea for 30 years, about the average ship's life span . He said: 'In the sprawling shantytowns that have grown up around the yards, I met dozens of the workers. Many had deep, jagged scars. ""Chittagong   tattoos,"" one man called them. 'Some men were missing fingers. A few were blind in one eye. 'In one home I meet a family whose four sons worked in the yards. The oldest, Mahabub, 40, spent two weeks as a cutter's helper before witnessing a man burn to death when his torch sparked a pocket of gas belowdecks. '""I didn't even collect my pay for fear they wouldn't let me leave,"" he says, explaining that bosses often intimidate workers to keep silent about   accidents.' Fishermen place their nets at low tide in front of the ship-breaking yards in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Today Chittagong is partially soaked with oil and toxic mud. File picture . Ship breaking is dangerous work and can expose workers to toxic chemicals. File picture . The work is back-breaking because these massive ships are not designed to come apart, but withstand some of the harshest conditions imaginable at sea. They are often constructed with toxic materials, such as asbestos and lead. When ships are scrapped in the developed world, the process is more strictly   regulated and expensive, so the bulk of the world's shipbreaking is done in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, where labour is cheap and oversight is   minimal.

"By . Reuters . Women with the potentially cancer-causing human papillomavirus, or HPV, may be putting their partners at risk if they share sex toys during intimate relations, a new study suggests. Researchers gave 12 women two vibrators each and detected the virus immediately after self-use on at least one of the vibrators used by all nine participants who tested positive for HPV. Lead author Dr. Teresa Anderson, from the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the small study is the first to examine whether vibrators could be transmitting the virus between sex partners. Spreading the word: Women with the potentially cancer-causing human papillomavirus, or HPV, may be putting their partners at risk if they share sex toys during intimate relations, a new study suggests . 'Sex toys used between partners within the same sexual encounter have the potential for transmitting HPV,' Anderson told Reuters Health. 'Cleaning the sex toy has the potential to decrease the amount of HPV DNA we can detect and so can potentially decrease the risk of transmission.' Genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. It is so pervasive that it has been called the common cold of the sexually active world. HPV can be innocuous, but sometimes leads to warts and sometimes to cancer. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the virus causes an estimated 27,000 cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, head and neck cancers among Americans each year. The CDC recommends girls get one of two series of vaccines to protect against the type of HPV that causes most cervical cancers. Despite a push to immunize, less than 54per cent of U.S. girls between 13 and 17 years old were vaccinated in 2012. The CDC also recommends that boys get one of the vaccines. 'It probably would make sense for people not to share their sex toys, I'm not sure how practical it is during sex to start washing your toys' Current study participants were women between the ages of 18 and 29 who had engaged in sexual relations with both a man and a woman during the prior year. Anderson said she did not know if the participants had been vaccinated against HPV. The investigators gave each woman a cleaning product, one vibrator made of thermoplastic elastomer - known as a 'Rabbit'-style vibrator - and another made of soft silicone. They asked participants to swab the vibrators after vaginal use, immediately after cleaning and 24 hours later. Nine of the participants tested positive for HPV, and the virus was detected on at least one of the two vibrators given to each of them. Just after use, HPV was found on all but one of the thermoplastic vibrators and on six of the nine silicone vibrators. Even after cleaning, the researchers detected DNA from HPV on five of the thermoplastic vibrators and four of the silicone ones. The silicone vibrators responded better to the cleaning after 24 hours. The researchers did not detect the virus on any of the silicone vibrators a day after cleaning, but they did find HPV on two of the thermoplastic sex toys. Under the micorscope: Genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. - It can be innocuous, but sometimes leads to warts and sometimes to cancer . The difference could be related to the porosity of the material, Anderson said. She noted that the presence of HPV DNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of an infection. Additional studies would be necessary to determine whether an infection could be transmitted through sex toys, she said. Cleaning vibrators may reduce the frequency of HPV transmission, the authors write. They call for more research on sex-toy materials, design and cleaning methods to most effectively reduce the virus' spread. Once hidden in X-rated novelty shops, sex toys now line the shelves of major stores. Women also buy the devices at parties formerly reserved for kitchen products. 'I agree with the author that we need to study and identify safe and effective ways to clean sex toys,' Dr. Jeffrey Klausner told Reuters Health. He is an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles and was not involved in the current study. 'When people are intimate, they're going to share viruses and germs. The good thing is that HPV is vaccine-preventable. The bad thing is the vaccination rates are very low,' Klausner said. 'It probably would make sense for people not to share their sex toys,' he said. But he added, 'I'm not sure how practical it is during sex to start washing your toys.' Dr. Vitaly Smelov, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, told Reuters Health in an email that doctors should advise patients to clean their sex toys, particularly those shared between both same-sex and heterosexual partners. In prior studies, more than half of women between 18 and 60 years old reported using a vibrator, and more than 65per cent of bisexual women reported partnered sex toy use, the current study's authors write in Sexually Transmitted Infections. The medical community once thought that women who have sex with women were at low risk for HPV. But studies have since shown HPV infections are common among these women. Research also suggests some women who have sex with women, particularly adolescents and young women as well as women who have sex with both women and men, may be at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections.",New study from the Indiana University School of Medicine is the first to examine whether vibrators could be transmitting the virus between sex partners .
"By . Lydia Warren . A 23-year-old Lafayette College senior has become the latest arrest in a Philadelphia drug ring after he turned himself in to cops on Tuesday. Christian 'Stocky' Euler, a star lacrosse player who had previously attended the exclusive Haverford School with other suspects in the ring, turned himself into Lower Merion police and is in jail following his arraignment, NBC reported. He is just one of the nine suspects arrested for allegedly selling marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy to students at private high schools and colleges in the area. Arrest: Christian 'Stocky' Euler, pictured left and right, has turned himself in to police after he was linked to a drug ring in Philadelphia. The Lafayette lacrosse player went to the same high school as other suspects . Two graduates of Haverford School, Neil Scott, 25, and Timothy Brooks, 18, are accused of being the ring leaders of the operation, which they called the 'Main Line Take Over Project'. Authorities confiscated drugs, guns and piles of cash in a sweep related to the operation, which officials believe had been running for at least a couple of months, officials said. On Tuesday, it emerged that Scott had returned to the area after breaking up with an older girlfriend in California, while Brooks had moved back home after suffering a sports-related injury at college. Both had once played lacrosse for The . Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school where they allegedly went . on to supply drugs. Scott . graduated in 2008 and went to Connecticut College, but he dropped out . after three semesters after he was caught smoking pot and making fake . IDs, the Philadelphia Daily News reported. Afterwards, . one of his high school coaches found him a job working for a team in . California, and when that folded in February 2013, another coach in the . state gave him a job on his program. 'Ring leaders': Neil Scott, 25, (left) and Timothy . Brooks, 18, met last year after Scott broke up with his girlfriend and moved back home to Philadelphia, while Brooks returned after a sports-related injury at college . Quite the haul: The duo allegedly set up a drug ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine to schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs. Pictured, a haul of guns, cash and drugs that authorities seized . 'He told me there was nothing good at . home,' the coach, Zack Burke, told the Daily News. 'Nothing but drugs and trouble, and he wanted to get . away from it out here.' But Burke said that Scott's attitude . began to change. He added that . he thought Scott began dating a 40-year-old dermatologist who could provide him Xanax and other pills. 'I feel like she made him crazy,' he said. 'I heard he packed up his car and went back to Philly in September.' Likewise, . Brooks headed back to Philadelphia for surgery after suffering a sports . injury after one semester - and he met with Brooks, a fellow Haverford . grad who he knew through lacrosse circles. The pair allegedly bought books about street-smart drug dealers to learn the business. Prosecutors say they then hired . students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford . colleges, and at several suburban high schools. Wanted: Timothy Brooks is led into Montgomery County Magisterial District Court. Prosecutors identified Brooks as one of the leaders of a drug ring they say supplied marijuana and cocaine to colleges and schools . Partner in crime: Neil K. Scott covers his face as he is led into court. He was one of the leaders of a drug ring. Scott and the other suspect, Timothy Brooks, were both graduates of The Haverford School . The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said. 'Their . intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over . drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools . and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman . said. 'This was not a game. These people were in business, they were in business to make money and . they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one . threatened their business.' Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations. Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy. 'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said. Damning evidence: Montgomery County district attorney Risa Vetri Ferman holds a rifle that was part of the drugs, guns, money and other illegal items seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring . Haul: Drugs, money and guns were seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine a number of high schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs . Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools. If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin. Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February. In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle. Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said. Questions: As well as the two ringleaders, Garrett Johnson, 18, (left) and Daniel Mcgrath, 18, (right) were arrested in the investigation. They are both students at Scott and Brooks' former prep school . 'Sub-dealers': Willow Orr, (left), and Domenic Curcio, 29 (right) were also arrested in connection with the ring . 'Involved': Reid Cohen, 18, (left) a high school student, and John Rosemann, 20, (right) a Lafayette student . Investigators found approximately . eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of . cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault . rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along . with ammunition for all of those guns. During . the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks . advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, . investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana . at local high schools. Brooks . and Scott are former graduates of The Haverford School. They also . played lacrosse at a Montgomery County private school and coached youth . sports leagues. Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation. Scott, . who is being held on $1 million bail, covered his face and shouted . expletives at reporters attempting to get comment following his . arraignment on Monday afternoon. His attorney declined comment saying he . had just gotten the case. Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia . Caught in the act: Lafayette College another of the private coeducational liberal arts and engineering schools whose name has now been tarnished by the alleged drug ring . Brooks' parents posted the $25,000 bail to release him from jail. Brooks' attorney, Greg Pagano, says Brooks 'regrettably lost his way' and is remorseful. In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29. Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office.","Christian 'Stocky' Euler - one of 9 former or current prep school students 'involved in a drug ring' - has turned himself into police .

"By . Meghan Keneally . The frosty relationship between the late Senator Ted Kennedy's first wife and his widow has apparently improved over time. A new report in the National Enquirer claims that the famed Democrat's widow Vicki has tried comforting her predecessor Joan over the past few years after the surprise death of Joan's eldest daughter. Ted, the younger brother of former President John F Kennedy, had three children with Joan, and their eldest Kara died from an unexpected heart attack in 2011, two years after her father succumbed to a brain tumor. Easing the tensions: Senator Ted Kennedy's first wife Joan (left, front) and second wife Vicki (right, back) reportedly did not get along during his life but Vicki has supposedly tried to become closer (the two women pictured at Kennedy's sister Eunice's funeral two weeks before his death in 2009) Final year: Senator Ted Kennedy (pictured in August 2008 at the Democratic National Convention) was diagnosed with a brain tumor three months earlier . Family: He and his first wife Joan (pictured in 1991, nearly a decade after their divorce) had three children together- Kara (left), Patrick (second from left) and Ted Jr (center) 'Their animosity toward each other was evident at his funeral rites, but in the years since, Vicki has reached out to Joan,' an unidentified friend told The National Enquirer. 'Vicki's been concerned that Joan might fall off the wagon again and has repeatedly checked on her.' Joan, 77, has had a history of alcohol abuse and both been arrested for drunk driving on a number of occasions and sent to court-mandated rehabilitation programs. She was married to Kennedy for 24 years before they divorced in 1982. Kennedy married Vicki- nearly 20 years his junior- in 1992, and while the longtime Massachusetts senator was alive, the two women did not reportedly get along. Coming together: Vicki is seen in the front row during her husband's funeral in August 2009, with her stepdaughter Kara standing directly behind her and Kara's brother then-Congressman Patrick Kennedy behind . Keeping to their corners: There were reports that Vicki and Joan (pictured with her son Patrick at the Boston service following Ted's death) were kept away from each other at the Senator's funeral . Kara's sudden heart attack following her . daily work out in Washington D.C. on September 16, 2011, came as a blow . to the family that was still recovering from the loss of their last . patriarch. Time and joint grief for the children that Vicki treated as her own once she married Kennedy have apparently helped soothe the earlier tensions between the two women. 'Vicki will no doubt see Joan this summer and together they'll mourn Ted on the fifth anniversary of his passing,' the anonymous friend told The Enquirer. 'You have to think Teddy would be happy that they're friends and he'd be looking down, smiling.' His family also has some good news to celebrate, as another one of their own has decided to enter the family business. After . Joan and Ted's youngest son Patrick stepped down from Congress shortly . after his father's death, their second child Ted Jr just recently . announced that he hope to enter politics on the state-wide level. Unexpected: Kara Kennedy, seen left in April 2011 with her two children by her side, suffered a fatal heart attack five months after this photo was taken while at a gym . Watching out for Joan: A friend has revealed that Vicki has reached out to her husband's first wife (seen back center following her daughter's casket) after Kara's death because there were fears that Joan would start drinking again . The 52-year-old former healthcare lawyer is running for a seat in the Connecticut state senate. 'I've always thought my brother could be a really powerful leader, I'm not just talking elected-office sense, but leadership sense,' Patrick said about his brother before Ted Jr made his official campaign announcement. 'He's just got such a tremendous personal story. I've always thought he'd be a very compelling political figure because he's integrated work with public policy with his own personal experience.'","Ted Kennedy's widow Vicki has reportedly reached out to his first wife Joan after the sudden death of her daughter Kara .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Variety Magazine has announced their round up of this year's Power of Women honorees, all of whom grace their own covers for the May split-release issue. Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, model Iman, Broadway star Idina Menzel, and CEO of A+E networks Nancy Dubuc, all front the covers in a series of elegantly shot black and white photos. The eclectic array of philanthropists are all being publicly recognized by Variety for their individual humanitarian efforts this year. Pensive: Clare Danes joins a host of A-List philanthropists who are honored for Variety Magazine's 2014 Women of Power . Actress and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker is being commended for her plans to inject a 'modern, fresh feeling' into the long-established New York City Ballet. The 49-year-old Sex and the City star is trained in ballet herself, and has been working with the company for almost 20 years, revealing she has had 'a lifelong admiration' for dance'. 'It’s important to us as people, as Americans, to allow ourselves to appreciate the art form,' she explains to the publication. Also well-versed in the world of fashion, . Ms Jessica Parker recently invited Valentino, and a number of new, . up-and-coming designers to create costumes for ballet performances in . order to shine a different light on the art. Fashion Fairytale: Sarah Jessica Parker hopes to marry the two worlds she holds close to her heart, fashion and ballet . And last November, she produced an AOL Originals documentary, which took viewers behind the scenes of the New York City Ballet - a sacred backstage area which until then had banned cameras. 'It’s about understanding a dancer’s life, and helping people who thought it was this rarefied art form understand that it’s athletic, coupled with extraordinary artistry,' she says. Homeland . star Claire Danes, 34, has thrown her support behind Afghan Hands, which . helps Afghan women who have lost their husbands put their lives back . together. 'My . parents are artists, and one of our friends spent the 1980s going to . Afghanistan and taking photographs of the women there,' she says. 'I’ve . been affected by these images my whole life.' Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon is well known for her dedication to helping others, and this year she has focused on a school in Uganda, Africa called Hope North . Afghan hands was founded in 2009, and puts widows in Afghanistan to work embroidering scarves and pillows, to raise money so they can rebuild their financial and emotional independence. 'Widows are . basically beholden to their in-laws, and after the death of their . husbands they’re seen as a burden,' Ms Danes explains. She . was first made aware of the charity by her make-up artist Matin . Maulawizada, who co-founded the organization. 'I started collecting the . scarves pretty aggressively,' she says, adding that she is 'passionate' about every aspect of their mission. Much . as she would like to travel to Afghanistan to lend her support on the . ground, it's still too dangerous for her to do so. 'It’s going to . happen, though - it’s just a matter of time,' she vows. Timeless beauty: Supermodel Iman is dedicated to the Dr Hawa Abdi foundation, which helps educate Somalian women. 'I always believed that the future of Africa is in the women,' she says . Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon is well-known for her dedication to . helping others, and has been involved in a number of wide-spanning . charities over the years. Currently, she has her sights on Hope . North, which assists the youngest victims of Uganda’s civil war in . getting an education, in the form of a secondary school there. It’s important to us as people, as Americans, to allow ourselves to appreciate the art form . 'We’re working to keep this school afloat,' she says. Ms . Sarandon, 67, insists that although she is 'spread pretty thin' when it . comes to her humanitarian work, the organizations she lends time to are . ones she can truly 'vouch for.' 'I’m in a business that leads to empathy, which leads to action,' she says. 'Having . the ability to constantly re-frame perspective for people - that’s when . things get interesting, because it leads to dialogue.' Broadway star: Idina Menzel has started a summer camp in Massachusetts for young girls who need to 'find their voice' Somalian-born supermodel Iman, 58, takes her humanitarian role very . seriously. She and her family were forced to flee their home in Somalia back in the . Seventies, and walk to Kenya when Africa's bitter civil war broke out. She was later discovered by photographer Peter Beard while in Nairobi, and the rest is fashion history. Iman, . who is married to musician David Bowie, in an avid supporter of the Dr . Hawa Abdi foundation - a small charity which runs hospitals and schools . in Somalia. 'It’s a small foundation, on the ground, with people . who making lasting changes rather than big foundations that make a lot . of noise,' she says. Hard working: CEO of A+E networks, Nancy Dubac, is devoted to America's veterans, and is backing two support charities, Team Rubicon and The Mission Continues . The foundation is particularity concerned . with educating young girls, who wouldn't otherwise get the opportunity. 'I always believed that future of Africa is in the women,' she says. And closer to home, Broadway star Idina Menzel started A Broader Way; a summer camp held in Massachusetts for girls from urban communities, which gives them a place to express themselves in the form of songs, poems, writing and stagecraft. Having . the ability to constantly re-frame perspective for people - that’s when . things get interesting, because it leads to dialogue . 'I loved being able to reinvent myself during the summer, and not be judged by the same group of kids I saw in school,' says Ms Menzel, who started the company with her husband from whom she is now separated. Along with other stage veterans, Ms Menzel attends the 10-day camp herself, which helps a group of 60 young girls 'find their own voice' and build their self-confidence. 'There’s a beautiful intimacy about the camp. These girls get to be the authors of their own life,' she says. Last but not least, Nancy Dubac, CEO of A+E networks, has turned her efforts to support two veteran support charities, Team Rubicon and The Mission Continues, both of which help veterans transition back into their local communities. Both Ms Dubac's grandparents served in the Pacific in World War II, so it's a cause close to her heart. 'Veterans issues have always spoken to me,' she says. 'These men and women have served our country, and this is a way to honor their legacy and hopefully inspire others to do so as well.'

"By . Jill Reilly . Justin Bieber has once again sparked controversy during his worldwide travels - this time by infuriating Chinese and South Korean fans by posting photos online of his visit to a controversial Japanese shrine. The Canadian pop star put photos on his Instagram feed of Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo which commemorates Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. The shrine is highly controversial, with both China and South Korea viewing it as a glorification of Tokyo's wartime aggression, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the Korean peninsula during the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Not happy: Justin infuriated many Chinese and South Koreans by posting photos online of his visit to a controversial Japanese shrine . In bad taste: The Canadian pop star posted photos on his Instagram feed of the Yasukuni Shrine which commemorates Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals . The 20- year-old is on holiday in Japan with his mother and he posted a photo of the shrine on his Instagram account - tweeting the link to his 51 million Twitter followers. One photo, of him standing in front of the shrine, was captioned, 'Thank you for your blessings'. Another which read 'Good morning' showed a photo of him posing with a man in traditional Japanese clothing. Sorry: The teen popstar was forced into grovelling apology after the visit which he posted on his Twitter account . Holiday: The popstar poses in Japan - he has regularly been updating his Instagram page with photos from his trip . Backtracking: The photos of the shrine which have now been removed, sparked outrage among his followers . The photos, which got more than 585,000 likes, also sparked outrage among his followers. The Yasukuni shrine was built in 1869 under Emperor Meiji in memory of the country’s war dead. The shrine contains the remains of some of those commemorated, but is mostly a symbolic destination for relatives. However the souls of hundreds of convicted war criminals are also enshrined there. They include Second World War leader General Hideki Tojo, who was put to death for war crimes in 1948. China and South Korea see the shrine as a symbol of Tokyo’s aggression during the Second World War, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the Korean peninsula. Japan entered an unwritten agreement with China in the 1970s which suggested that serving leaders would not visit the shrine. One user wrote: 'The Yasukuni shrine is dedicated to [those who] killed countless Chinese prisoners ... Japanese planned Nanjing massacre killed tens of thousands of people [in] China. Please face up to history. As a Chinese ... I am so sad that you visited the Yasukuni Shrine.' Another incensed fan wrote: 'Maybe you are a giant in Japan and thats the reason why you like Japan. Anyway, please dont come to China forever, we really don't like stupid people.' The photos have now been removed and Bieber wrote on his Twitter page: 'While . in Japan I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful . shrine. I was mislead to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. 'To anyone I have offended I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I . love you Japan'. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang, said he had not been aware of Bieber’s visit to the shrine, reported the New Strait Times. But he added: “I’m not aware of this situation and I don’t know the political opinion of the so-called Canadian famous singer.' 'I hope that this Canadian singer after visiting the Yasukuni shrine can have a clear understanding of Japan’s history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan’s militarism.' Last year Bieber was forced to issue an apology after he was pictured kicking the national flag off the stage during a performance in Buenos Aires. He insisted he had believed the flag was a top, and didn't mean any disrespect by his actions, which caused outrage among many fans in the audience. The teen idol also ran into trouble after spraying graffiti on a wall in the same country. A . few months earlier he caused outrage after leaving a 'tasteless' comment in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. The . singer visited the famous home where Jewish wartime diarist Frank and . her family hid from Nazi persecution for two years during the Holocaust. After . spending an hour touring the home, which opened as a museum in 1960, . Bieber wrote a message in the guestbook, which read: 'Truly inspiring to . be able to come here. 'Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.' The Facebook post garnered hundreds of comments expressing dismay over the young pop sensation's presumptuous remarks. Many described it as 'disrespectful,' 'disgusting' and an 'embarrassment to Canadians.

Yesterday a Japanese cabinet minister and some 150 politicians visited the shrine, in a move that could further strain fraught regional ties. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent an offering to the shrine on Monday, just days before a Tokyo visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, provoking an angry response from China and South Korea, which decried it as romanticizing Japan's wartime past.

"By . Associated Press . A judge has ruled that all court documents should refer to the Wikileaks informant as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning rather than Bradley Edward Manning. This is the first legal step towards recognizing Manning’s desired gender change as the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year prison sentence for passing classified U.S. government information to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Leavenworth County District Judge David King said he'd allow the name change during a court hearing that lasted about a minute. Going by Chelsea: A military court has ruled that all references to Bradley Manning can be changed to reflect his desire to be referred to as a woman, opting for the name Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (pictured in an undated photo wearing a wig and lipstick) Manning didn't attend the hearing but issued a statement saying it was 'an exciting day.' Leavenworth County District Judge David King said he'd allow the name change during a court hearing that lasted about a minute. Manning didn't attend the hearing but issued a statement saying it was 'an exciting day.' 'Hopefully today's name change, while so meaningful to me personally, can also raise awareness of the fact that we (transgender) people exist everywhere in America today, and that we have must jump through hurdles every day just for being who we are,' Manning said. First step towards a new life: Manning, pictured in August 2013, has been diagnosed by at least two Army behavioral health specialists with gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder . The decision clears the way for . official changes to Manning's military records, but it would not compel . the military to treat Manning as a woman- which would’ve included . transferring Manning to a prison with a woman's unit. 'Likewise, . the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks is a male-only facility and prisoners . there are referred to by the title “inmate”,' Army spokesman George . Wright said. Manning, who grew up in Oklahoma, filed the court petition as the first step toward getting her Army records changed. Manning has been diagnosed by at least two Army behavioral health specialists with gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder. Manning was sentenced in August for six Espionage Act violations and 14 other offenses for leaking more than 700,000 secret military and U.S. State Department documents, along with battlefield video, while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. Past: Manning (pictured in August) has filed a grievance over the lack of a response to her request for comprehensive treatment for her gender identity disorder, including specialized gender counseling and hormone replacement therapy . An Army general upheld the convictions last week, clearing the way for appeals with the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. There was no opposition filed to the petition, though Manning included several newspaper reports indicating the desire to live publicly as a woman last August, as well as copy of an Oklahoma birth certificate. Manning  has filed a grievance with the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks commander at Fort Leavenworth over the lack of a response to her request for comprehensive treatment for her gender identity disorder, including specialized gender counseling and hormone replacement therapy. The military has said it doesn't provide hormone replacement therapy. Gender dysphoria generally disqualifies one for military service, but Manning can't be discharged while serving the prison sentence.","Judge has ruled that all court documents will be changed from Bradley Manning to Chelsea Manning .

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . Four Colorado fourth graders have been caught selling marijuana at school, after stealing the now-legal drug from their grandparents. John Gates, director of safety for Weld County School District 6, said Wednesday that the students involved, three 10-year-old boys and a 10-year-old girl at Greeley's Monfort Elementary School, faced tough discipline but not suspension or expulsion. He would not elaborate on their punishment. Only one student admitted to trying any of the drug, a small bite of an edible marijuana item, and a subsequent medical exam did not indicate any harmful effect had been caused, Gates said. The marijuana appears to have been legally purchased by adults - grandparents in two families - and no charges were expected to be filed, Gates said. School: The students involved, three 10-year-old boys and a 10-year-old girl at Greeley's Monfort Elementary School, pictured, faced tough discipline but not suspension or expulsion . He said the parents of the students were concerned and working with the school on discipline. Gates said a student who was not involved alerted school officials that a student sold marijuana to other students on Monday, and that on Tuesday a student tried to trade edible marijuana for some of the student seller's marijuana. 'This could not have happened had they secured their marijuana,' Gates said of the grandparents, urging adults to take care with the drug. 'Nothing good's going to come from having 10-year-olds find it, use it or take it to school.' In a letter sent home Tuesday, Monfort Principal Jennifer Sheldon told parents that because it's easier for adults to get marijuana, children potentially have greater access. Denver TV station KDVR posted the letter on its website: 'We urge all parents, grandparents and anyone who cares for children to treat marijuana as you would prescription drugs, alcohol or even firearms. 'This drug is potentially lethal to children, and should always be kept under lock and key, away from young people.' Legal: The marijuana appears to have been legally purchased by adults - grandparents in two families - and no charges were expected to be filed. The drug, pictured, was legalized in the state last year . Gina Carbone, who helped found the group Smart Colorado to publicize concerns about the impact on children of marijuana legalization, applauded Sheldon's letter. Days after tens of thousands publicly lit up for the annual 4/20 marijuana festival in Denver, Carbone said children and adults were hearing too from marijuana proponents, and not enough about the drug's dangers. 'Pot is celebrated and glorified and promoted. Kids are watching adults and this is the way adults are behaving,' she said. 'Here we have 4th graders trying to make a buck off marijuana.' While advocates say marijuana need not be treated as a dangerous drug and that its legal sale will have economic benefits, the experiment has so far been a challenge for Colorado. Denver police say a man ate marijuana-infused candy before shooting and killing his wife last week, an attack that dispatchers heard during a 911 call the woman placed. Her death followed that of a Wyoming college student who ate well over the recommended dose of a marijuana-laced cookie and jumped to his death from a hotel balcony in Denver. State lawmakers are debating how to increase safety regulations, and grappling with how to plan budgets amid concerns marijuana tax collections will be unpredictable.","The students attended Greeley's Monfort Elementary School in northern Colorado .

"By . Jill Reilly . and Eliza Wilson . He infuriated his Chinese and South Korean fans after attending a controversial Japanese shrine. And Justin Bieber went into damage control on Wedneday, sharing a photo on Instagram which showed him visiting children at an orphanage. 'Visited a Japanese orphanage.. Love these kids!!' the singer wrote alongside the short clip. Scroll down for video . Damage control: Justin Bieber visited a Japanese orphanage after a trip to a controversial shrine . The video showed the 20-year-old pop star hanging out with several youngsters, high-fiving, tickling and pretending to wrestle with them. The children may be too young to be fans of his, but they certainly seemed to love Bieber and he in turn couldn't wipe the huge grin off his face. The Baby hit-maker was clad in a long white top, denim and tartan shorts, along with a gold chain around his neck and a Chicago Bulls baseball cap. Child at heart: The 20-year-old was clearly having a great time wrestling, high-fiving and tickling the youngsters . In his element: Justin couldn't stop grinning and posted a video of the visit with the words: 'Love these kids' It comes after the Canadian star set tongues wagging when he put photos on his Instagram feed of Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo which commemorates Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. The shrine is highly controversial, with both China and South Korea viewing it as a glorification of Tokyo's wartime aggression, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the Korean peninsula during the Second World War. Justin is . on holiday in Japan with his mother and he posted a photo of the shrine . on his Instagram account - tweeting the link to his 51 million Twitter . followers. Cute as can be: While the children are probably too young to be fans of his, they certainly seemed to love Justin . Travelling: The Canadian pop star is currently in Japan on holiday with his mother . 'I am fashion': Earlier on Wednesday Justin shared this photo along with a very modest caption . One photo, of him standing in front of the shrine, was captioned, 'Thank you for your blessings'. Another which read 'Good morning' showed a photo of him posing with a man in traditional Japanese clothing. The photos, which got more than 585,000 likes, also sparked outrage among his followers. Not happy: Justin infuriated many Chinese and South Koreans by posting photos online of his visit to a controversial Japanese shrine . In bad taste: The Canadian pop star posted photos on his Instagram feed of the Yasukuni Shrine which commemorates Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals . One user wrote: 'The Yasukuni shrine is dedicated to [those who] killed countless Chinese prisoners ... Japanese planned Nanjing massacre killed tens of thousands of people [in] China. Please face up to history. As a Chinese ... I am so sad that you visited the Yasukuni Shrine.' Another incensed fan wrote: 'Maybe you are a giant in Japan and thats the reason why you like Japan. Anyway, please dont come to China forever, we really don't like stupid people.' The photos have now been removed and Bieber wrote on his Twitter page: 'While in Japan I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine. I was mislead to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. Sorry: The teen popstar was forced into grovelling apology after the visit which he posted on his Twitter account .

Backtracking: The photos of the shrine which have now been removed, sparked outrage among his followers . 'To anyone I have offended I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I . love you Japan'. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang, said he had not been aware of Bieber’s visit to the shrine, reported the New Strait Times. The Yasukuni shrine was built in 1869 under Emperor Meiji in memory of the country’s war dead. The shrine contains the remains of some of those commemorated, but is mostly a symbolic destination for relatives. However the souls of hundreds of convicted war criminals are also enshrined there. They include Second World War leader General Hideki Tojo, who was put to death for war crimes in 1948. China . and South Korea see the shrine as a symbol of Tokyo’s aggression during . the Second World War, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the . Korean peninsula. Japan entered an unwritten agreement with China in the 1970s which suggested that serving leaders would not visit the shrine. But he added: 'I hope that this Canadian singer after visiting the Yasukuni shrine can have a clear understanding of Japan’s history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan’s militarism.' Last year Bieber was forced to issue an apology after he was pictured kicking the national flag off the stage during a performance in Buenos Aires. He insisted he had believed the flag was a top, and didn't mean any disrespect by his actions, which caused outrage among many fans in the audience. The teen idol also ran into trouble after spraying graffiti on a wall in the same country. A . few months earlier he caused outrage after leaving a 'tasteless' comment in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. The . singer visited the famous home where Jewish wartime diarist Frank and . her family hid from Nazi persecution for two years during the Holocaust. After . spending an hour touring the home, which opened as a museum in 1960, . Bieber wrote a message in the guestbook, which read: 'Truly inspiring to . be able to come here. 'Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.' The Facebook post garnered hundreds of comments expressing dismay over the young pop sensation's presumptuous remarks. Many described it as 'disrespectful,' 'disgusting' and an 'embarrassment to Canadians. China's . ties with Japan have long been coloured by what Beijing considers . Tokyo's failure to atone for its brutal wartime occupation of parts of . the country and what it sees as whitewashing of atrocities in school . textbooks.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The wreckage of a wooden steamship carrying 106 passengers, which sank in San Francisco Bay in 1888, has been found. More than a century after the City of Chester was nearly sliced in half by a ship twice its size, sonar has located the boat 216ft below the surface. The wreckage from the bay's second-worst maritime disaster was found as oceanographers charted shipping channels before the America's Cup. Located: The wreck of the City of Chester has been found 126 years after it sank under the Golden Gate Bridge. This 2013 image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows a multi-beam sonar profile view of the shipwreck of the iron and wood steamship . Tragic: The City of Chester was carrying 90 passengers on the 1888 trip from the San Francisco bay to Eureka. She was split in two by a ship more than twice its size, killing 16 people and becoming the bay's second-worst maritime disaster . On the day the Chester sank, killing 16 people including two children and three crew members, a dense fog was filling the bay. The Chester was carrying passengers from San Francisco to Eureka when it collided with a large immigrant ship. More . than a century after it sank, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric . Administration team has found the resting place of the doomed ship. The . crew used sonic imaging equipment to capture new three-dimensional . images of the wreckage in May last year, and released their findings . this week. 'Using a . multi-beam sonar system, crews got nice three-dimensional sound pictures . of the bottom that showed a wreck sitting upright,' James Delgado, a NOAA shipwreck researcher and archaeologist who was chief scientist for the 2010 mapping of the Titanic, said. The . shipwreck's rough location was first discovered two years after it . sank, but the sonar and renewed research into the collision has . unearthed new details. Discovery: Teams using sonar to check routes for the America's Cup found the wreckage under the Golden Gate Bridge . The sonar showed the wreck's hull rising about 18ft from the sea bed, and clearly reveals the gash in the hull which caused it to sink. When researchers looked into the background of the crash, they found tons of newspaper articles and transcripts of testimony from the accident investigation. Delgado said newspapers at the time put much of the blame for the deaths on the crew of the immigrant steamer, the Oceanic, which survived the ordeal with a few dents in its hull. Yet, NOAA scientists say much of the newspaper coverage failed to include witness accounts of heroism, and that the official investigation faulted the Chester's skipper with the accident. 'The papers initially reacted, talking about the tragedy and accusations that the Chinese crew stood by and let people drown,' Delgado said. 'But what happens is you start to see things also come out ...  countering that. Some leaped in water to save a drowning child.' 'History is made up of a  lot of people who never made it into the books,' Delgado told NBC Bay Area. 'Same with this shipwreck. It was filled with everyday people who got into a situation beyond their control.' A thick fog was covering the bay on the morning of August 22, when the Chester set off, but research showed the seas were calm. But there was a big incoming tide, which created a rip current off Fort Point near the mouth of the bay, which affected the Chester's ability to move quickly. The two ships spotted each other when they were about a half-mile apart but failed to reverse their engines in time. The Oceanic's bow went 10ft into the hull of the Chester, and the Oceanic's captain kept some momentum in the ship to keep the hole plugged in an effort to give people a chance to escape. However, five or six minutes later, the Chester was gone. 'The Oceanic crew was up on the bow reaching down to survivors on the Chester, lifting them on the deck,' Robert Schwemmer, NOAA's West Coast regional maritime heritage coordinator, said. 'After the collision, in five or six minutes, the Oceanic crew went on to save a lot of people.' The sinking was the second worst maritime disaster in the Bay, after the Rio de Jeneiro struck rocks on the way into port in 1901, exploded and sank with the loss of 130 people. No attempt will be made to raise the ship but a display with the Chester's history and new images will open at San Francisco's Chrissy Field, which looks over the spot where the ship went down in front of the Golden Gate Bridge.","Sonar shows City of Chester standing upright on sea bed .

"By . Associated Press . A degenerative eye disease slowly robbed Roger Pontz of his vision. Diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa as a teenager, Pontz has been almost completely blind for years. Now, thanks to a high-tech procedure that involved the surgical implantation of a 'bionic eye,' he's regained enough of his eyesight to catch small glimpses of his wife, grandson and cat. 'It's awesome. It's exciting — seeing something new every day,' Pontz said during a recent appointment at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center. Scroll down for video . Clear to see: Roger Pontz wears special glasses that house a small video camera and transmitter at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center . Pioneering: The Kellogg Eye Center at Ann Arbor is the first facility in the U.S. to implant a ""bionic eye"" since the FDA signed off on it last year . Let there be sight: The pulses stimulate the retina¿s remaining healthy cells, causing them to relay the data to the optic nerve. The visual information then moves to the brain, where it is translated into patterns of light that can take the shape of an object's outline, allowing the patient to regain some visual function . The 55-year-old former competitive . weightlifter and factory worker is one of four people in the U.S. to . receive an artificial retina since the Food and Drug Administration . signed off on its use last year. The facility in Ann Arbor has been the site of all four such surgeries since FDA approval. A fifth is scheduled for next month. Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease that causes slow but progressive vision loss due to a gradual loss of the light-sensitive retinal cells called rods and cones. Patients experience loss of side vision and night vision, then central vision, which can result in near blindness. Not all of the 100,000 or so people in the U.S. with retinitis pigmentosa can benefit from the bionic eye. An estimated 10,000 have vision low enough, said Dr. Brian Mech, an executive with Second Sight Medical Products Inc., the Sylmar, Calif.-based company that makes the device. Of those, about 7,500 are eligible for the surgery. Technology: The glasses are part of a system developed by a California company that wirelessly transmits  images from the camera, converted into a series of electrical pulses, to an array of electrodes on the surface of Pontz' retina . Pioneers: Dr. Thiran Jayasundera, left, looks at Roger Pontz's left eye as Pontz's wife, Terri Pontz, right, looks on. The artificial implant that currently resides in Pontz¿s left eye is called the Argus II, and is part of the system developed by a California company that includes a small video camera and transmitter housed in a pair of glasses . The artificial implant in Pontz's left eye is part of a system developed by Second Sight that includes a small video camera and transmitter housed in a pair of glasses. Images from the camera are converted into a series of electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes on the surface of the retina. The pulses stimulate the retina's remaining healthy cells, causing them to relay the signal to the optic nerve. The visual information then moves to the brain, where it is translated into patterns of light that can be recognized and interpreted, allowing the patient to regain some visual function. When wearing the glasses, which Pontz refers to as his 'eyes,' he can identify and grab his cat and figure out that a flash of light is his grandson hightailing it to the kitchen. The visual improvement is sometimes startling for Pontz and his wife, Terri, who is just as amazed at her husband's progress as he is. 'I said something I never thought I'd say: 'Stop staring at me while I'm eating,' Terri Pontz said. She drives her husband the nearly 200 miles from tiny Reed City, Michigan, to Ann Arbor for check-ups and visits with occupational therapist Ashley Howson, who helps Roger Pontz reawaken his visual memory and learn techniques needed to make the most of his new vision. Seeing is believing: Images from the camera are converted into a series of electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes on the surface of the retina . Learning to see: Dr. Naheed Khan, right, works with Roger Pontz, left, on an exercise to test how well he sees shapes on a computer screen. Pontz suffers from a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa and is the second patient in the U.S. to surgically receive a 'bionic eye' At the recent visit, Howson handed Pontz white and black plates, instructed him to move them back and forth in front of light and dark backgrounds and asked that he determine their color. Back home, Terri Pontz helps her husband practice the techniques he learns in Ann Arbor. For them, the long hours on the road and the homework assignments are a blessing. 'What's it worth to see again? It's worth everything,' Terri Pontz said. The artificial retina procedure has been performed several-dozen times over the past few years in Europe, and the expectation is that it will find similar success in the U.S., where the University of Michigan is one of 12 centers accepting consultations for patients. Candidates for the retinal prosthesis must be 25 or older with end-stage retinitis pigmentosa that has progressed to the point of having 'bare light' or no light perception in both eyes. Dr. Thiran Jayasundera, one of two physicians who performed the 4.5-hour surgery on Roger Pontz, is scheduled to discuss his experiences with the retinal prosthesis process during a meeting of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery on Friday in Boston. He calls it a 'game-changer.' Pontz agrees: 'I can walk through the house with ease. If that's all I get out of this, it'd be great.'","US patient Roger Pontz has been blind for years .

"By . Associated Press . That little voice nagging you to put down the cake and lace up the running shoes is increasingly coming from your employer and is likely to grow louder with a looming change under the federal health care overhaul. More companies are starting or expanding wellness programs that aim to reduce their medical costs by improving their employees' health. They're asking workers to take physical exams, complete detailed health assessments and focus on controlling conditions such as diabetes. Along with that, many companies also are dangling the threat of higher monthly insurance premiums to prod workers into action. The Affordable Care Act is one reason the programs are spreading. The federal law calls for a 40per cent tax on expensive benefit plans starting in 2018, and many companies that offer employer-based coverage already have begun looking for ways to lower costs and avoid that tax. More companies are expanding wellness programs that aim to reduce medical costs, asking workers to take physical exams, complete health assessments and focus on controlling health conditions . 'It is a very powerful... visible wake-up call to all employers,' said Helen Darling, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit organization that represents large employers on health care issues. Businesses see wellness programs as a win for themselves and their workers. But studies have shown that the programs have a limited ability to reduce costs. They also raise concerns about privacy and discrimination against older workers or those who are more likely to have chronic conditions. Penalties also can hit lower-wage workers harder than they would executives because premiums already consume a larger portion of those workers' paychecks. 'The top-line concern is that it has a huge potential to be discriminatory,' said Lydia Mitts, a health policy analyst with the nonprofit Families USA. Benefits consultants say federal regulations help guard against that. Companies can be penalized under the overhaul for offering coverage that is considered unaffordable. Businesses also are required to offer alternatives that help workers avoid penalties like a higher premium because they can't meet a wellness program goal. Despite employee concerns, the idea of prevention as a way to reduce health care costs has been largely embraced by employers, who provide the most common form of health insurance in the U.S. For years, they have offered gift cards, cash and other rewards to employees who agree to get physical exams, fill out health assessments or take other steps to monitor their health. The goal is to at least make workers more aware of their health, and it worked for Roy Simmons, a 55-year-old nuclear power plant manager for energy provider Dominion Resources Inc. Dominion started offering a $400 premium credit a couple of years ago for employees who agreed to have a health assessment, so Mr Simmons had basics such as his weight and cholesterol measured. He then forgot about the numbers until a reminder arrived last year. Another physical told him he had gained 40lbs and his cholesterol was up. 'That was a bit of a wake-up call for me,' said Mr Simmons, who manages a Dominion plant near Williamsburg, Virginia. 'I didn't know it had happened to me. I know that sounds stupid, but I wasn't paying attention to it, and it just snuck up on me.' He cut junk food from his diet and asked his college football-playing son to become a workout partner over the summer. He has since dropped the weight. Benefits experts say companies haven't . seen enough cases like Mr Simmons', in which an incentive helps nudge an . employee to participate in a wellness program, so some employers have . started using penalties. These penalties most often stick . employees who do not participate with larger premiums or deductibles, . but they also can come in the form of a straight monthly surcharge, . deducted from paychecks. A survey of nearly 600 large U.S. companies by benefits consultant Towers Watson found that 22per cent of . companies that use financial incentives to encourage wellness program . participation structured them as penalties. That's up from 18per cent . last year. 'There's going to be more of your skin . in the game,' said Michael Wood, a Towers Watson senior consultant. 'If . you help us control costs, use the system wisely, you will be . rewarded.' Companies also are moving beyond . rewarding or penalizing employees simply for participating. More are . requiring workers to reach a health goal such as improved blood . pressure, said Beth Umland, director of health and benefits research for . the benefits consultant Mercer. Roy Simmons (pictured) works at Dominion Resources Inc nuclear power station, which offers a $400 premium credit for employees who agree to have a health assessment. Thanks to the incentive, he lost 40lbs . Whether the various versions of . wellness programs are achieving their intended effect - reducing a . company's health costs - is a matter of debate. The average annual premium for . employer-sponsored family health coverage topped $16,000 last year, . according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies . health care issues. Employers, who pay most of that bill, have watched . that figure climb faster than inflation for years, and it has more than . doubled since 2002. Rand Corp. researchers studied several . years of data from a PepsiCo wellness program to determine how it . affected health care costs. They reported in the January issue of Health . Affairs that disease management programs, which helped people with . chronic conditions, reduced hospital admissions and lowered costs. But programs that simply tried to make . employees live a healthier lifestyle did not, and the researchers said . companies should not assume those programs will lower costs. At the same time, the programs have begun generating a backlash from employees. Last fall, faculty and staff at Penn . State University objected to new wellness requirements that the . university was eventually forced to modify. After significant pushback, . the university said it would not institute a $100 monthly charge for . people who failed to complete a series of activities, including a . detailed online questionnaire. 'There's going to be more of your skin in . the game. If you . help us control costs, use the system wisely, you will be rewarded' 'They asked about pregnancy, they asked if men were doing testicular exams, they asked about depression, they asked about violence in the home,' said Matthew Woessner, a professor of political science at the Harrisburg campus. 'It was an incredible invasion of privacy.' CVS Caremark Corp. employee Roberta Watterson has filed a lawsuit in California against her company over a wellness program that offers a $600 annual premium break for participants. The cashier's lawsuit accuses the company of asking personal questions in its survey, including whether its employees are sexually active. Watterson also alleged that blood work performed in the exam is used to flag employees who are at risk for certain conditions. She declined to comment on her case. CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the company offers a lower premium for employees who complete a health assessment and screening. She said an outside company designed the questionnaire her company uses, and CVS had asked it to 'remove certain questions' before Watterson filed her complaint. She also said CVS management cannot see employee-specific information compiled in the wellness exams. Having an outside business run the wellness program is a common way for companies to counter privacy concerns. The vendor can tell a company about trends, such as whether it has a lot of employees with high blood pressure, so the employer can implement programs to address that. But it is not supposed to share details about individual employees. State and federal laws are designed to prevent employers from seeing employees' specific responses or health statistics.","More and more companies are starting or expanding .

"By . Helen Pow . A school bus driver in Olympia, Washington, has been placed on leave after he was caught on video bullying a developmentally disabled 14-year-old girl. Louanne Bay, said her daughter, Mariah, a student at Washington Middle School, had complained for more than a year that the bus driver had been calling her names and encouraging other special need students on the bus to do the same. But the girl's complaints were only acted upon recently, when footage was unearthed allegedly showing the man in the act. Bully: A school bus driver in Olympia, Washington, has been placed on leave after he was caught on video bullying Mariah Bay, pictured, a developmentally disabled 14-year-old . School buses: Mariah, a student at Washington Middle School, had complained for more than a year that the bus driver had been calling her names and encouraging other special need students on the bus to do the same . Bay said her daughter is afraid of bees after spotting one on the bus, and in the tape the bus driver can be heard telling the girl, 'I am going to bring a beehive on the bus,' among other nasty remarks. 'You can clearly hear the driver calling my daughter names, encouraging other children to bully her,' Bay, who was shown the video last week, told The Olympian. 'All of the children on the bus are special needs with a variety of disabilities, which makes it even worse.' The concerned mother added to KOBI 5: 'It was hard (to watch the video). I started to cry when the bus driver was laughing saying he was going to bring a bee hive on the bus.' Bay said her daughter, who is in the 8th grade but has the development of a 4th grader, also complained that when she asked the driver to turn down the heat in the bus, he purposely turned it up. Mariah also alleged the driver threatened to hit her on occasion, though this wasn't on the video.

"By . Ashley Collman . American University is investigating an unofficial fraternity after emails between the brothers referencing rape, assault and drug abuse were leaked last week. Epsilon Iota is not an official campus club, but the remnants of fraternity Alpha Tau Omega which was shut down in 2001 after several hazing and alcohol abuse incidents. The remaining brothers renamed themselves after their chapter name and have continued to recruit on campus. Over 70 emails and text messages between the brothers, which date back to 2012, were posted on a Tumblr account last Thursday by an anonymous source. Shocking: An unofficial fraternity at American University is drawing criticism after over 70 emails between brothers were leaked last week. Many of the emails make light of sexual abuse, like the one above . Some of the emails talk about using drugs like LSD and ADHD medication Adderall, but the most concerning exchanges reference rape. In one email about organizing a mixer, one of the brothers writes that they should set up pre-games before hand where the girls will get drunk with the guys they know and are more comfortable with. 'Then [when] they start getting f***** up we switch them from apartments so they are f***** up when they meet brothers they know less and would hook up with easier,' the brother writes. Unofficial institution: Epsilon Iota has at American University since 2001, formed when Alpha Tau Omega was shut down for hazing and alcohol abuse . Another email shows the brothers discussing how to best cover up a female's allegations that she was hit by a brother. 'Let's formulate an excuse. For the remainder of the semester, we feign ignorance - our brotherhood already met for the last time...None of us have heard anything except rumors from outside.' Another brother offered a more horrifying response: 'It seems like damage control is very straightforward: someone needs to stuff a d*** in that [redacted] girl's mouth with the quickness.' According to the Tumblr, the messages were posted in order 'to promote safety of AU students and speed up the disciplinary process for the individuals involved'. AU President Neil Kerwin issued a statement saying the emails require 'immediate attention' because 'allegations include high risk and harmful behaviors that...may represent breaches of our student conduct code and of the law.' Plotting: In one of the emails, a brother writes at length about how to best take advantage of drunk girls . Serious allegation: While discussing which girl should be named the fraternity's 'sweetheart', one of the brothers speaks about a girl whose friend was allegedly raped at the fraternity . 'That these alleged behaviors may have occurred within our community reminds us that we are not immune from the problems that have occurred on campuses across the country,' President Kerwin wrote. 'This situation cannot be viewed as an isolated set of circumstances.' And this isn't the first time the university has tried to shut the frat down. In 2006 they threatened to disband EI, saying it posed threats to the community because 'it does not follow any sort of bylaws and engages in questionable behavior such as hazing and excessive drinking'. However, it's hard to target an unofficial society and the group continued to prosper - much to the dismay of residents near the Washington, DC campus. In a single year, the fraternity was responsible for 15 neighborhood complaints including 'loud parties, public urination and trash.' But they may not be so lucky this time. In addition to criticism from the school administration, a Change.org petition to shut the group down has garnered over 1,000 signatures.","Epsilon Iota is an unofficial fraternity at the Washington, DC campus .
