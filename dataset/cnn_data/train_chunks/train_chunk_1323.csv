Hit: Elsa, the Snow Queen (voiced by Idina Menzel) is pictured performing the song in the Disney film, Frozen . Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, she said: 'A year ago, I'd meet people who, when they found out who I was, they'd say, ""Oh, we love the songs! We sing them all the time"". 'Now they're like, ""Yep, we're still listening to those songs"". I've gone from, ""Thank you"", to, ""Sorry!""' Following Frozen's release in November 2013, the Disney film quickly became the highest-grossing in its genre, netting $1.27 billion worldwide.

During the interview, Lee, whose daughter, Agatha Lee Mon, 11, sings in the film, said she remains amazed by the movie and song's global impact and their apparent resonance with young girls. She added that she often uses Frozen's 'strong female lead characters' - sisters Anna and Elsa, the Snow Queen - as inspiration for her daughter, whom she says was bullied at school. 'I was bullied a lot as a kid, too,' says Lee, 'so we try to look at the world like Anna and Elsa do - how they question, ""Is who I am OK?"" - but always manage to be true to themselves.'

"The victims of a burglary captured their alleged intruders after spotting them in the street - on the way back from another break-in. The Wyatt family's surveillance system filmed the moment a woman and two men took two TVs and numerous Christmas presents from their home in Warrior, Alabama, last Friday. Just two days later, Chris Wyatt spotted the suspects' Ford Ranger pickup truck driving down a road and swerved to block them into a corner. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Captured: This is the moment Chris Wyatt and his relatives stopped and detained their alleged home intruders . Vigilante justice: The group held a woman and two men at gunpoint until the sheriff's deputies arrived . Mr Wyatt, his wife Sarah, and two other relatives ordered them out of the car - apparently full of stolen goods - and held them at gunpoint until police arrived. According to Chief Deputy Randy Christian, officers received the 911 call on Sunday afternoon while they were interviewing the victims of another burglary. When they reached Mr Wyatt and his detainees, they found the computer monitor, trumpet, knife collection and jewelry that the second victim reported missing. The case is the latest of vigilante justice in Alabama, where home surveillance systems have soared in popularity over the past two years. After realizing they had been burglarized on Friday, the Wyatts watched the security reel which showed a woman knocking on the door. When there was no answer, she appeared to break through a window with two men before lugging out numerous items. The next day Mr Wyatt posted the footage on Facebook and said that he vowed to find the intruders, commenting: 'guns out and loaded'. But their vengeance came sooner than expected when he spotted the car from the video just hours later. 'They happened to drive by and we seen them drive by and we knew it was them and we stopped them,' Chris Wyatt told WSFA.

"Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal has gotten most of the attention from the document hack . Sony Pictures is going on the offensive against news outlets that are publishing details of tens of thousands of hacked emails that have embarrassed the company. Lawyers for the film studio sent out letters to media companies that have reported on the contents of the hacked emails. The letters state that the data was stolen from Sony Pictures and ask that media outlets destroy any of the documents that they may posses. The vast troves of data are slowly being released online by hackers calling themselves the 'Guardians of Peace.' The documents are widely available on peer-to-peer file sharing sites online. It is widely believed that North Korea is behind the hack attack.

"She was blasted during 2011's X Factor by Simon Cowell, who said she looked as though she was wearing  five gallons of hairspray before standing in the middle of a hurricane. Never one to take the music mogul's criticism lying down, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has returned to top sartorial form on this year's show. After a  four-year hiatus from the talent contest, Cheryl returned to our screens - along with a new surname and whole new dress sense - and successfully stole back her fashion crown. Scroll down for video . Style overhaul: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has used this year's X Factor to reinvent her style and beauty . And, we can reveal, the 31-year-old singer has a carefully curated 'dream team' of experts to thank. Heading up Cheryl's new glam squad is stylist Anna Hughes-Chamberlain, who is the senior fashion editor of  style bible, Hunger magazine, and has worked with Miranda Kerr, Sienna Miller and Ellie Goulding. Anna has helped Cheryl shake up her wardrobe and break away from the play-it-safe style she has previously embraced. In 2010, Cheryl came under fire for her 'tacky' and 'skimpy' dresses, while Dannii Minogue was lauded for her 'edgy and fashion forward' fashion choices and hairstyles. Cheryl took matters into her own hands this year by enlisting Anna. The super stylist added glamorous gowns courtesy of Vogue favourites, Christopher Kane, Monique Lhuillier, Zuhair Murad and Stephane Rolland, to the judge's wardrobe. Now and then: In 2010, right, Cheryl came under fire for her 'tacky' and 'skimpy' dresses, right, but now opts for glamorous, often midi-length or floor length designs, left . The judge, who sits alongside Mel B and Louis Walsh, also had couture wedding dress designer, Alida Herbst, waiting in the wings to help Anna. Alida is an extremely talented designer and seamstress who has worked with many of the world’s top designers and played a leading part in making the wedding dresses of plenty of high-profile private clients. Classic in design or a touch avant garde, Alida promises that her designs will help you feel your best on your special day - something she's most certainly helped Cheryl with this year. 'I have worked with Cheryl's stylist Anna and Cheryl herself many times before. I designed her outfit for the Capital FM Summertime Ball at Wembley earlier this year and created about 25 dresses for her Girls Aloud Ten tour,' Alida told FEMAIL. Alida, who went along to the live shows every week to help Cheryl and Anna, said that Cheryl is 'lovely' to work with and has a really good sense of humour. 'Cheryl has been looking so good on X Factor,' added Alida. Couture: High-fashion houses have been lending Cheryl the most glamorous and lavish of dresses, which she's pulled off with aplomb week after week (left, in Lanvin, and, right, in Ziad Nakad) Speaking about Cheryl's style overhaul, fashion writer Simon Glazin (www.theverysimong.com) said: 'Cheryl has come a long way since the shiny Kappa tracksuit days. She wouldn't be seen dead in one now. For her, it's all about the super high-end designers now. 'Alas, even couture houses have started lending her dresses. And, it seems, Cheryl is doing a better job at championing new designers than our very own Princess, Kate Middleton. 'Cheryl's fashion conquests have included: Thakoon - famed for dressing the First Lady herself; Monique Lhuillier - a red carpet gown genius; Zuhair Murad (including the red dress she wore for the final) - one of Jennifer Lopez's favourite designers, and Stephane Rolland couture - one of the most fantastic couturiers in the world, who dresses royals and A list stars. 'Granted, sometimes Cheryl gets it a tad wrong, some of the dresses she has worn look a little cheap on her, but overall, I've been impressed with the dresses her stylist has managed to pull in. What a difference! Speaking about Cheryl's style overhaul, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Cheryl has come a long way since the shiny Kappa tracksuit days. She wouldn't be seen dead in one now. For her, it's all about the super high-end designers now' 'She is at her best when she's in a long, sweeping gown, one that accentuates her waist, bust and delicate neck line. And she isn't afraid of colour, which is refreshing. 'I think my favourite of all her looks was the green Lanvin ruffle detail dress. I thought it would have been reserved for a Hollywood A-lister, not an ex-Girl Aloud!'. Another important member of Cheryl's glam squad is Paul Percival - one half of hair styling power duo, Percy & Reed. Their client list includes Sophie Dahl, Diane Kruger, Agyness Deyn, Anna Friel - and now Cheryl. Paul, who also tends to the tresses of Rita Ora and Mark Ronson for their VIP appearances and magazine shoots, worked backstage with the singer every weekend and was on hand between takes. Only the best for Chez: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has called on Paul Percival, a fashion favourite and celebrity hairdresser, to work his magic on her X Factor hair . His signature clean, modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and Cheryl - who married husband Jean-Bernard this year - has benefited. Speaking to FEMAIL about working with the pop icon, he said: 'I have worked with Cheryl a few times over the years on different projects. 'We both had big ideas about what we wanted to achieve this season. The main thing was that we wanted to create lots of different looks that were alternative, versatile and cool, rather than the hair being played safe all of the time. It was a really collaborative effort.' Cheryl, who, according to Paul, is very much involved in the creative process, has opted to channel French icons such as Brigitte Bardot some weeks and more urban, playful looks on others. Get the look: Cheryl, who is heavily involved in her final look, apparently wanted to channel the eternal glamour of French actresses . He says one of his favourites look this season was The Short and Sharp look he and Cheryl recently created because, he says, it was 'completely different to any of the other looks we have ever done before'. 'We created what looked like a haircut rather than a hair style just by braiding the hair which was quite a bold thing to do,' he explained. 'I also really liked the Back to Bardot style we created a few weeks back. I know Cheryl really liked the Judge’s Houses because of great texture.. Always head of the game trend-wise, Paul and Cheryl championed the sleek ponytail a lot on the show, which, he says, is one of the easiest hair styles to recreate. In terms of big news for 2015, he thinks what he calls ‘Up Cuts’ (similar to the ‘Short & Sharp’ look), will be big news. 'It’s just about creating shorter, sharper detailed silhouettes when putting the hair up,' he said. Paul, who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door, added: ‘Working with Cheryl is such a pleasure. She is never afraid to try new things and it’s a real collaborative partnership.’ 'My favourite thing about working with Cheryl is that she has fantastic eye to detail. Plus, Cheryl knows what she likes and what she doesn’t, but she’s fearless when it comes to trying out new styles.' Despite the show finishing, this isn't the end of Cheryl and Paul's creative relationship. He revealed: 'I‘m looking forward to seeing Cheryl’s new music video we just shot. Percy & Reed are also in the process of producing some very exciting new products but it’s a little too early to share yet! There are some really exciting new looks and projects that I’m working on for next year which you can stay up to date with on my Instagram - @percyhair.' Now and then: Back on 2011's X Factor, right, Simon Cowell described Cheryl's hair as 'the equivalent of five gallons of hair spray and then standing in the middle of a hurricane'.

"A mother has exposed how ‘arrogant’ doctors missed signs her eight-month-old daughter had meningitis – and simply advised her to give her Calpol. After a five-year battle to uncover the truth, an inquest has ruled that medics’ treatment of Abby Dalton’s daughter Eloise contributed to her death. Miss Dalton, 37, said that doctors had ‘dismissed’ her concerns that her baby had meningitis and sent them home from hospital. Eloise Lema Dalton - with her mother Abby - died from meningitis after doctors at Leeds General Infirmary repeatedly ruled out the fact she had the condition - insisting she simply had a virus . Missed opportunities to appropriately care for Eloise amounted to neglect, inquest heard. Her mother said: 'We always think ""what if?"" They should have given my child the care she needed. I'll never understand the reasons why' The worried mother, who had even brought a checklist of common symptoms of meningitis to the hospital, said the doctors made her feel like an ‘overly-protective parent’. They told her it was ‘just a virus’ and advised her simply to give her Calpol and ibuprofen. But Eloise’s condition worsened and she died six days later, after more blunders by medical staff at Leeds General Infirmary, the inquest heard. The hospital then told the grieving mother there was no need to involve a coroner, but Miss Dalton contacted one herself to expose the truth and the inquest has finally taken place. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner David Hinchliff said that doctors’ inadequate care for Eloise and the mistakes in treatment amounted to neglect, contributing to her death from multi-organ failure. A serious incident report detailed a total of 27 failings by the NHS trust. On the day she fell ill, Eloise (pictured here when healthy) was listless, pale, had mottled skin and a rash on her chest. But her condition was not identified - despite her mother taking a 'meningitis checklist' she had on her fridge to hospital . Miss Dalton said: 'We were made to feel like overly protective parents. There was a sense of arrogance from the doctors. I did what parents are told to do and I had the checklist of symptoms but no one listened to me' Miss Dalton, an IT manager, said: ‘If they had listened to me when we first took her in then she would have survived. ‘I would say to other parents that you need to trust your instincts. Doctors don’t always get it right. You have to push every step of the way.’ She added: ‘No one would listen to me. We faced blocker after blocker after blocker.’ Miss Dalton, of Guiseley, West Yorkshire, noticed Eloise ‘wasn’t herself’ after picking her up from nursery in December 2009. She spotted a rash and, recognising it as a possible sign of meningitis from a picture card of symptoms she kept on her fridge, took Eloise to hospital. A report into Eloise's care found a raft of failings including a failure to act on parental concerns and misdiagnosis . ‘We had to wait for what felt like an age. The doctors were really arrogant and I felt they were dismissing my concerns,’ she said. Eloise was sent home, but Miss Dalton took her back to hospital two days later when she developed an alarmingly high temperature. An investigation by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust led to a report recommending 22 changes in paediatric care, which have been implemented . Doctors again tried to send Eloise home, but Miss Dalton refused to leave. Medics stuck to their diagnosis even after Eloise suffered a 30-minute seizure. She was eventually admitted to paediatric intensive care the following day. Blood tests confirmed Eloise had meningitis two days later on December 16 – the day before she died. Sadly, by then it was too late to treat her. A report by Dr Nelly Ninis, a consultant in paediatrics from St Mary’s Hospital in London, concluded that if Eloise had been put on antibiotics at her first visit to hospital she would have survived. The inquest in Leeds also heard criticism of hospital authorities for not reporting the death to a coroner themselves. Asked if she thought the hospital had tried to cover-up failings, Miss Dalton, who has a four-year-old daughter Megan and is now separated from the girls’ father, said: ‘They wanted the whole thing to go away and we didn’t.’ The NHS trust later agreed to pay Eloise’s family an undisclosed six-figure settlement. An investigation by Leeds Teaching Hospitals recommended 22 changes in paediatric care, which have since been implemented. Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer of the NHS Trust, said: ‘I would like to extend our sincere sympathy to the family of Eloise and to apologise for the failings in her care, which we fully acknowledge and have taken detailed steps to address.’ Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms. So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Other signs in babies: .

"Bill de Blasio kept more than 100 people waiting for a commercial flight from JFK Airport to Puerto Rico because he was running late. The revelation will do nothing to alleviate New York's mayor of his reputation for tardiness. Passengers including city officials and holidaygoers had no idea why the boarding gate remained closed for 20 minutes after it was due to open on November 6. Finally, de Blasio arrived with an entourage of security, and the JetBlue flight was deemed ready for boarding. Tardy: Bill de Blasio cemented his reputation for lateness when he had a JetBlue flight held at JFK last month . The mayor and his security were seated first before others were allowed to board. It has since emerged, in documents obtained by DNAinfo New York, that airport officials were ordered to hold the plane by de Blasio's NYPD security squad who radioed over. Officials would not confirm why de Blasio was delayed en route to the Somos El Futuro Conference 2014 in San Juan. He had finished a press conference in Coney Island at noon, with the flight due to leave at 2.29pm. The flight left at 2.38pm. 'We started to make our way over to the gate, about a half-hour before the flight was due to board,' a passenger told DNAinfo New York. 'There was a long line, but there was no boarding call and no one knew why. We were saying, 'Why are we just standing here? The plane is here. We are here. So what's the holdup?'' We finally understood why. It was the mayor that was holding us up, of course, and a few people could be heard joking, 'Late again,'' the passenger said. 'He was walking quite fast, with four or five people, probably security people, and he went straight past everyone onto the plane.' Delay: More than 100 passengers including lawmakers and holidaygoers were left in the dark for 20 minutes . The incident came just a week before de Blasio enraged relatives of Flight 587 plane crash victims by turning up 20 minutes late for an annual moment of silence. He missed the silence and the ringing of the bell that has happened at 9.17am on November 12 every year since 2001 - and intially blamed the fog before later admitting he slept in. De Blasio cemented his reputation for lateness early on in his tenure when he was an hour late for a get-out-the-vote rally. He admitted to reporters at the event last year that he had overslept as he arrived at 12.30pm for the 11.30am stunt. Staffers told Politiker in 2013 that de Blasio has trouble getting up in the mornings and they had been forced to stall the start of numerous events. The Mayor's Office has yet to reply to MailOnline for a comment.","Passengers waited 20 minutes before Mayor de Blasio arrived on Nov 6 .

"More than 2,000 Amazon staff at German warehouses went on strike on Monday to press demands for better pay and conditions as the online retailer races to ensure Christmas orders are delivered on time. Labour union Verdi said almost 2,300 workers joined the action at five of Amazon's nine distribution centres in Germany, and that the action would be extended to a sixth on Tuesday - the most warehouses hit by a strike in the long-running dispute. The walkouts at the centres are set to run until the end of Wednesday's late shift and Verdi said delays to deliveries could not be ruled out as a result of the strikes. On strike: More than 2,000 Amazon staff at German warehouses went on strike on Monday to press demands for better pay and conditions. Here, employees gather in front of the Amazon distribution center in Rheinberg, Germany . Strike: A man makes his feelings clear in a Grinch mask at the Amazon distribution centre in Bad Hersfeld, Germany, while 'strike' can be seen on a sign in front of an Amazon logistics center in Leipzig . Amazon itself said customers could order up until midnight on December 21 to get gifts in time for Christmas, or even on December 23 or 24 if they pay for express delivery. 'We deliver reliably,' a spokeswoman said, adding that only a small minority of workers had joined the strikes, with around 19,000 employees working normally. Last year, Amazon orders in Germany peaked on December 15, when customers bought 4.6 million items - or 53 per second. Verdi has organised frequent strikes at Amazon since May 2013 as it seeks to force the retailer to raise pay for workers at its distribution centres in accordance with collective bargaining agreements across Germany's mail order and retail industry. In Leipzig: The walkouts at the centres are set to run until the end of Wednesday's late shift and Verdi said delays to deliveries could not be ruled out as a result of the strikes . Confident: The U.S. company has previously said the long-running dispute has not affected deliveries as the vast majority of workers in Germany have not joined the strikes and it can draw on a European network of 28 warehouses in seven countries .

The U.S. company has previously said the long-running dispute has not affected deliveries as the vast majority of workers in Germany have not joined the strikes and it can draw on a European network of 28 warehouses in seven countries. It employs almost 10,000 staff at its warehouses in Germany, its second-biggest market behind the United States, as well as more than 10,000 seasonal workers. It comes after tens of thousands of families in Britain said they have been left in a panic that gifts bought online will not arrive in time for Christmas.

Couriers delivering goods for major retailers including Amazon, Marks and Spencer, John Lewis and Waterstones were said to be in chaos as they struggled to deal with huge backlogs. They blamed an unprecedented surge in online shopping over the past fortnight. Yodel, the UK’s largest delivery company after Royal Mail, was unable to collect parcels from retailers this weekend as it is already three days behind on existing orders. It spent the weekend desperately trying to clear the thousands of gifts already piled up in warehouses, with some couriers even delivering parcels in the middle of the night. The company – employed by a string of retailers including Amazon, Boots, Argos, Waterstones and Tesco Direct – said it will not resume normal collections until today at the earliest.","2,300 workers walked out at five of Amazon's nine centres in Germany .

"Christianity has declined sharply over the past decade, according to the census returns. Numbers who choose to call themselves Christians fell by more than four million. The collapse in belief in the religion which has been central to the history of the country for 1,500 years means that fewer than six out of ten, or 59 per cent, now describe themselves as Christian. A decade ago nearly three quarters, 72 per cent, did so. The diminishing number of Christians is mirrored by a rapid growth in those who profess no religious affiliation. A quarter of the population, 14.1million, now say they have no religion, nearly double the 7.7million who said the same thing in the 2001 census.

"Somalia and North Korea are perceived as the most corrupt countries, a report released this week said. New Zealand, on the other hand, comes in at number one with the most sparkly clean reputation for corruption. The report, released by German watchdog organisation Transparency International, ranked Britain as 16th least corrupt on a 'corruption perceptions index' while the U.S. came in at number 24. North Korea and Somalia are the 'most corrupt' countries, according to a study. Here North Korean leader Kim Jong-il appears with the Korean People's Army . The bottom ranks, in front of Somalia and North Korea who tied at number 182, were occupied by Myanmar, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Sudan, Iraq, Haiti and Venezuela. In terms of the top performers, with the exception of New Zealand, Singapore at number five and Australia at number eight, most of the top spots are occupied by European nations. These include the Scandinavian nations of Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland - along with Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Ireland which were all in the top 20. Bulgaria was the lowest-performing European Union country, ranking at number 86. The top performers of the Americas include Canada which ranked 10th, Barbados 16th, Bahamas 21st and Chile at 22nd. Somalia tied at 182nd as the world's most corrupt country. Here, a displaced Somalian woman stands at Banadir hospital which serves the residents of the world's largest refugee camp .

"Mother: Rockell Coleman, 28 (pictured), was charged with two counts of felony murder and five counts of cruelty to children on Saturday after two of her sons died in a house fire . A mother-of-five has been charged with murder after her two youngest children died in a house fire this weekend. Authorities believe 28-year-old mother Rockell Coleman left her five sons, ages three to 10, in the Decatur, Georgia home alone when the mysterious fire broke out Friday. But family of the young mother say she was at a restaurant with friends, and that her children were supposed to be in the care of a female roommate. On Saturday, a judge denied bond for Coleman after she was charged with two counts of felony murder and five counts of cruelty to children in the second degree. Authorities are still investigating what caused the fire to break out on Friday night. Firefighters responding to the scene found two of Coleman's sons outside, with the remaining three trapped inside. The youngest brothers, 3-year-old Haskel and 4-year-old Preston died at the scene. Ten-year-old Jarvis was rushed to Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta to be put on life support, while his younger brothers AJ, 9, and Shamari, 5, are in better condition. Family and friends are now praising Coleman's 9-year-old son AJ as a hero, saying he rescued two of his brothers from the house and tried to go back in to get the rest but was stopped by responding firefighters.

'He got Jarvis out and got Shamari out and when he went back in to get the babies, the fireman stopped him,' AJ's uncle Christopher Marion told WSB-TV. Coleman's mother Lydia Pinckney is also defending her daughter, saying she didn't leave her children alone. Ms Pinckney told 11Alive that her son's ex-girlfriend had moved in with Coleman three weeks prior and was supposed to be looking after the children that night while Coleman went to a restaurant with friends. She says family haven't been able to contact her since the fire, although CBS 46 reports that the woman has been posting to Facebook. What's left: Family members are praising Coleman's 9-year-old son AJ, who allegedly got two of his brothers out of the house and then tried to go back into the burning building to get his two other brothers inside, but was stopped by firefighters .

'As my daughter told the police , [name redacted] was supposed to be watching them that night when all of this happened, but from that night to now, it's like she disappeared from the face of the earth,' Ms Pinckney said, adding that police did not believe her daughter's story. Ms Pinckney also claims her daughter was so distraught to lose her youngest children, that she had to be sedated when she was brought into custody, and was still under the influence of the drugs when police questioned her. 'For them to take my daughter down and to question her while she was still under narcotics - I'm not understanding why you would question somebody that you knew had got heavily sedated while they were in the emergency room,' Ms Pinckney said. Ms Pinckney is now struggling to pay for the funeral costs of her two grandchildren, since her daughter did not have insurance for the boys. Coleman is due back in court on January 5.

"A contraption designed to generate the first breathable air on Mars has reached the finals of a global competition to land experiments on the red planet. The student-designed device, named Helena, could be flown on Mars One's first unmanned lander mission, and arrive on the surface of Mars as early as 2018. The Helena payload aims to demonstrate a key-life support technology for humans, using electrolysis to produce oxygen from water extracted from Martian soil. Scroll down for video . A contraption designed to generate the first breathable air on Mars has reached the finals of a global competition to land experiments on the red planet. The device will extract water from the Martian soil using electrolysis - which is method of using a direct electric current (DC) to drive a chemical reaction . Designed by the University of Western Australia and Mars One astronaut candidate, Josh Richards, Helena is one of ten finalists in the Mars One University Competition. Its main piece of equipment is an electrolysis chamber that works alongside a pressurising mechanism, oxygen sensor and pressure release valve. The device  extracts water from the Martian soil using electrolysis - which is method of using a direct electric current (DC) to drive a chemical reaction. Electrolysis will see the production of hydrogen and oxygen in their elemental state. Electrolysis will see the production of hydrogen and oxygen in their elemental state. The Helena, named after the Shakespearean heroine who 'breathed life into stone', uses electrolysis to produce oxygen from water extracted from Martian soil . Helena will also carry a 'time capsule' in the form of a radiation-hardened DVD filled with messages and art by the public. The project, which is named after the Shakespearean heroine who 'breathed life into stone', could be the first example of life-support technology on the surface of Mars. It aims to refine technology that will allow humans to survive on the red planet, before the arrival of the Mars One colonists in 2025. 'Our experiment will hopefully pave the way to ensure the survival of the elected astronauts on the red planet, as we attempt to produce oxygen from Martian resources,' said Helena co-lead, Andre Van Vulpen. Mars One is an ambitious plan by a Dutch entrepreneur to send people to Mars next decade and start building a colony there. The proposal has received fierce criticism for its lack of realistic goals, and in October one study dealt the team a crushing blow - by saying the colonists will begin dying in 68 days. Low air pressure, habitats at risk of explosion and a lack of spare parts are among the potentially fatal dangers that apparently await anyone who makes the inaugural trip. The damning study was carried out by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In their research they found a number of ‘failure conditions’ that would ultimately lead to the demise of the crew. ‘The first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission,' the students write. First, the astronauts simply won’t have enough food. Based on Mars One’s mission plan, the students say the colonists would ultimately starve on Mars. Next, one of the goals of Mars One is to grow crops in some of the habitats on the red planet. But according to the students, this would create huge amounts of oxygen, in turn creating highly flammable environments. Oxygen would need to be vented while nitrogen levels would need to be maintained to keep up the air pressure; however, the technology to do this on another planet has not yet been invented. 'In addition to the scientific contribution, we are hoping to put together the largest crowd-sourced art collection ever sent to another planet, allowing any Earth citizen the opportunity to join us on our trip to Mars, and leave their legacy in truly 'out of this world' style.' Other entries include 'Cyano Knight', a German project that is aiming to change a small amount of the 95 per cent carbon dioxide Mars atmosphere into oxygen using cyanobacteria. Another entry from the UK will see a small greenhouse built on the red planet to attempt to grow lettuce for astronauts in a pressurised environment. The researchers also point out that even getting all the necessary equipment to Mars (shown) will require 15 launches of Space X’s upcoming super-rocket, the Falcon Heavy, at a cost of £2.8 billion ($4.5 billion). ‘The first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission,' the students write .","The device has been designed by the University of Western Australia .

"The likes of Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have warned about the potential threats posed by artificial intelligence. And now a group of researchers has fuelled this debate, saying no matter what we teach a robot, it will never know right from wrong. Ultimately they conclude robots can't determine what is the ‘right’ thing to do in certain situation, and instead will be unpredictable in their response to uncomputable moral dilemmas. Researchers at Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany claim robots (illustration shown) can never be moral. In a study, they said the famous moral dilemma called the 'trolley problem' prevents such action being programmed. As there is no 'correct' answer, robots will always be unpredictable, they warn . In their paper ‘Logical limitations to machine ethics with consequences to lethal autonomous weapons,’ the group from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany discussed the impending use of autonomous weapons. ‘Lethal autonomous weapons promise to revolutionise warfare - and raise a multitude of ethical and legal questions,’ they wrote. Although there are several versions, one aspect of the problem involves a trolley running towards a group of five people, whom it will fatally injure if it is allowed to keep running. A person standing near the switch is given the option to divert the trolley towards just a single person. The right course of action to take in the scenario is a moral dilemma, but considering there is no absolute, correct solution, it poses a problem for the future artificial intelligence. Namely, if they cannot work out the right thing to do, they will simply choose seemingly at random. While it has been suggested that robots could be employed with a ‘moral compass’, such as the Geneva Conventions, the researchers said this will not be sufficient. This is due to something known as the halting problem, which states it is not possible to tell whether an arbitrary computer program will finish running eventually, or run forever. Michael Byrne, writing for Vice, said that how this relates to artificial intelligence is that ‘algorithms do unexpected things; software has bugs.’ He continued: ‘An algorithm programmed to do the right thing might do the wrong thing.’ In the paper, the researchers give the example of the  ‘trolley problem’. Although there are several versions, one aspect of the problem involves a trolley running towards a group of five people, whom it will fatally injure if it is allowed to keep running. Will humans and robots ever be able to co-exist? Teaching a robot right from wrong might turn out to be more difficult than we think, even if we were to program them with sets of pre-determined ethical instructions such as the Geneva Convention. Shown is humanoid robot Roboy shaking hands in June 2013 . Recently Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking (shown) have both warned of the rise of artificial intelligence. The latter said that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,' he said. Our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self-driving vehicles could bring about our demise. Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at an event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argues that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' A person standing near the switch is given the option to divert the trolley towards just a single person. The right course of action to take in the scenario is a moral dilemma, but considering there is no absolute, correct solution, it poses a problem for the future artificial intelligence. Namely, if they cannot work out the right thing to do, they will simply choose seemingly at random. This means that artificial intelligence will always have an air of unpredictability to it; no matter how it is programmed. And even with the strictest and safest level of morality, there are some scenarios it simply can't handle. The scenario is reminiscent of Isaac Asimov's iRobot, in which a robot goes rogue and is accused of killing a Dr. Alfred Lanning, the co-founder of story's US Robotics (USR). To deal with the potential problem, the researchers list a number of suggestions that all future robots should be programmed with. One is that no robot should be designed with the sole or primary task of killing or harming humans. The manufacturer of a robot should also be held accountable for any actions it takes, ‘to comply with existing laws and fundamental rights and freedoms.’ Ultimately, though, future AI may require even more checks and balances - or self-imposed limitations - to prevent robots having to deal with moral dilemmas.

"Two students fell 60ft to their deaths while ‘making out’ on the balcony of a luxury apartment, an inquest heard yesterday. Anastasia Tutik, 19, and Miguel Ramos, 18, were kissing and cuddling when they lost their balance and plunged from the sixth-floor ledge. The pair, who had both been drinking, had met earlier that evening at a friend’s party in the flat in Deptford, south-east London, which has spectacular views of the Thames and Canary Wharf. Tragic accident: International students Miguel Ramos, 18 (left) and Anastasia Tutik, 19 (right) died hours after meeting each other when they fell from the balcony of a sixth-floor flat during a party in Deptford, London . Dangerous: A neighbour said she saw the couple entwined on the ledge of the flat's balcony (circled) Miss Tutik was seen sitting on the railing with her legs wrapped around Mr Ramos in the moments before they fell. Coroner Dr Andrew Harris described their deaths as a ‘tragic accident’ during the inquest at Southwark Coroner’s Court. ‘There is nothing from any witness statement that indicates they intended to take their lives,’ he said. ‘They were happy students celebrating the end of term.’ Dr Harris said his thoughts were with the families of both teenagers, who ‘have to celebrate Christmas without their young people’. The pair died from multiple injuries. Dr Harris recorded a verdict of accidental death in which alcohol was a contributing factor. Miss Tutik came to the UK from Russia in September last year and was studying for her A-levels at Bellerbys College. Mr Ramos, from Monterrey in Mexico, was taking a summer course at nearby English language school Embassy and had been in the UK for only a few weeks. His father is the former mayor of the Mexican town of Pesqueria. View: The block of flats next to the River Thames has a view of the river and financial district Canary Wharf . Prominent: Among the mourners for Mr Ramos (left) were his father Miguel Lozano Munguia (right), the former mayor of Pesqueria, Mexico, who once led the regional Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Studying: Ms Tutik had only arrived in Britain from Russia in September last year and was studying A-levels . Fellow student Alfonso Garza, who is also from Mexico and lived at the flat, said: ‘They met at the party. He liked her and she liked him so they went on to the balcony to make out – to kiss and cuddle.’ In a statement read to the inquest, he said: ‘We went out and a friend shouted “they’re not here”. ‘I couldn’t believe it. I walked over and saw them over the edge and he shouted “they’ve jumped”. I looked and could see them lying there. ‘Neither was moving and there was a lot of blood coming from Miguel’s head. Anastasia was lying either on top of him or to the side.’ Investigating officer DI Charmaine Laurencin said: 'Alcohol played a significant part in this incident. I think had neither party consumed so much alcohol potentially they would not have sat on that balcony' (pictured) Blessing Adedoyin, who saw the pair from her home in neighbouring Cornmill House, said: ‘She was sat and the man was in between her legs, which were open. ‘She had her arms around his head and he was feeling her legs. The guy especially looked drunk because he was moving around and touching her. ‘I just saw the guy’s legs tipping over and they both went down at the same time. He didn’t look very balanced or coordinated and they were locked together when they fell. I saw them go over and just gasped.’ Her partner, events manager Samson Oguntayo, 32, ran down and found the couple in a pool of blood. Emergency services were called just after midnight on June 11. The couple were pronounced dead at the scene. A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Ramos had 393 micrograms of alcohol in his blood and Miss Tutik had 85, just over the legal driving limit. No family or friends of the two students were present at the inquest.","Anastasia Tutik, 19, and Miguel Ramos, 18, died in Deptford,  London .

Special forces stormed in by land . and by air two weeks ago, coming under fire from 'several terrorist elements' that . were later 'destroyed', the French miltary said in a statement . on its website. In a later press release entitled 'French and Malian troops liberate Gao', the French ministry of defence said they were bringing back the town's mayor, Sadou Diallo, who had fled to the Malian capital Bamako. But a defence ministry official clarified that the city had not been fully liberated, and the process of freeing Gao was continuing. Gao, in north-eastern Mali, was seized by the jihadist fighters nine months ago, and the battle to retake it was expected to be tough. The rebel fighters are believed to include Algerians, Egyptians, Mauritanians, Libyans, Tunisians, Pakistanis and even Afghans.

The operation in Gao comes at the same time as airstrikes in the two other provincial capitals held by the extremists - the cities of Timbuktu and Kidal, which like Gao fell to the rebels last April, during the chaotic aftermath of a coup in the distant capital. The simultaneous aerial attacks also come as ground troops are carrying out a pincer movement, with French and African land forces heading to Gao from Niger, where Chad has sent a battalion. The Pentagon has said that the US will aid the French military with aerial refuelling missions. US aerial refuelling planes would be a boost to air support for French ground forces as they enter areas of Mali that are controlled by the extremists. The US was already helping France by transporting French troops and equipment to the West African nation. French and Malian forces are also heading to Timbuktu, via the central corridor that leads north from the central Malian city of Segou, through the recently recaptured town of Diabaly.

The bride was walked down the aisle by her father Jeff, almost three years to the day after the plane propeller accident that took her left eye and part of her left arm. Earlier this year, the beauty blogger revealed how excited she was about the ceremony - and about becoming Jason's wife. 'Jason has completely changed my life, and I could not be more thankful for who he is and how he loves me,' she told E! News. 'I can't wait to spend forever with him.' The groom added: 'God has blessed me with somebody I've been waiting for my whole life. Lauren changed everything for me and I can't believe I get to spend the rest of my life with her.' Before the show: The wedding reception was held at the Four Seasons in Dallas, Texas . Tis the season: The reception was somewhat Christmas-themed . Picture of happiness! Ms.Scruggs and Mr. Kennedy  - pictured here before their rehearsal dinner Thursday night in Dallas - are now officially married, having tied the knot on Friday night . Among the well-heeled guests at the ceremony were, of course, a slew of past and present E! personalities, including Giuliana and Bill Rancic and Ken Baker. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo and his wife, Candice, also attended, as well as Today co-host Kathie Lee Gifford. Candice Crawford Romo, Kathie Lee Gifford, Terrence J, Tony Romo and Catt Sadler. Kennedy had 11 groomsmen, who each wore their own suits. The best man was Pastor Rich Wilkinson Jr., who married Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. The happy couple had chosen a color palette of ivory, cream, champagne, blush, shades of lavender, and accents in charcoal grey and silver. Big day: Lauren Scruggs is now Mrs Jason Kennedy, and is seen here at her bridal luncheon in Thursday with fashion blogger Shannon Yoachum . Fashionable friends! Ms Scruggs and fellow fashion blogger/stylist Amy Havins (right) during Ms Scruggs bridal luncheon yesterday . All white on the night: Scruggs and her now-husband Kennedy recently bought a house together, but decided to wait until they were married before moving in . They waltzed their first dance to a cover of Keith Urban's Making Memories of Us performed by Texas band Cuvee. The wedding was to be covered by People magazine. On Thursday, Ms Scrugg's enjoyed an intimate bridal luncheon. Her friends posted pictures on Instagram from the luncheon in which she looked extra blonde and glowing. Stylist Amy Havins, who runs the blog Dallas Wardrobe, put up a photograph of herself and Ms Scruggs standing in front of a Christmas-themed mantelpiece, saying in her caption 'Celebrating the bride to be.'

Mr Kennedy and Ms Scruggs in a picture the groom-to-be posted to Instagram two days ago . Looking good! Mr Kennedy and Ms Scruggs met in 2012 and got engaged in June of this year . Dallas-based designer Nardos Imam, who created Ms Scrugg's gorgeous strapless dress for the event, also put up a picture of the bride-to-be wearing the piece in her salon, saying that she was 'a joy to work with.' Ahead of the ceremony, Mr Kennedy's E! News cohost Guiliana Rancic, who interviewed Scruggs in 2012 and then played matchmaker, setting him up with his new bride, posted a photograph of her and husband Bill Rancic in what looks to be an airport above the caption: 'Dallas-bound' and with the hashtags 'jason&lauren,' 'weddingweekend' and 'ido.' Blogger and Youtube star Angela Lanter put up an image of her and her husband wearing matching 'J [heart] Lolo' hats and said she's 'incredibly excited' to be celebrating the couple's 'big day.' Ms Scruggs and Mr Kennedy got engaged in June of this year. On their way to the party! Mr Kennedy's E!News cohost Guiliana Rancic posted this photo of her and husband Bill Rancic earlier today, saying they were 'Dallas-bound' Wearing the hats! Also attending the wedding are blogger/Youtube star Angela Lanter and her husband Matt Lanter . Symbol of love: Kennedy had his fiancee's name tattooed onto his ring finger after proposing, saying it will 'always remind me of the most permanent love' At the time, Lauren revealed that the  proposal was 'the happiest night' of her life, revealing that the TV host had gone all out in order to ensure the moment was memorable. Mr Kennedy popped the question in Dallas, in front of her family and friends, by laying out lit candles on a lawn that spelled out 'Will you marry me?' below her apartment balcony. The couple had been dating about a year before they got engaged. The pair first met in December 2012 after  Rancic interviewed Ms Scruggs for E! News following her recovery from her accident. '[Rancic] was like, 'I think you should meet Jason Kennedy,'' revealed Miss Scruggs. Smiling after tragedy: Miss Scruggs showed off her prosthetic hand during an interview with Dateline on NBC in November 2012 . Sharing her struggle: The Texan revealed part of her prosthetic arm during her TV interview in which she promoted her memoir, Still Lolo . 'I didn't know who he was. But she told me that he had this amazing Bible study in Los Angeles and had great friends. 'She texted Jason and asked if he was going to be on set. When I was asking Giuliana about places to go hiking, she told me, 'Just ask Jason places to go. He hikes all the time.'' They went hiking with Miss Scruggs' mom and a friend of Mr Kennedy's the next day, and the pair became instant friends. Miss Scruggs' amazing recovery from the tragic plane accident has been a huge inspiration to thousands of people. 'It's kind of weird to say, but I wouldn't trade it,' she told People in November 2012. 'I have seen it as a miracle. I've been through a lot but I'm living. 'Sometimes it's easy to dwell on the fact that I don't look the same. But every day I'm feeling better and better.'","The couple are currently enjoying a romantic honeymoon in Mexico .

Dunga called up the playmaker to replace injured Cruzeiro midfielder Ricardo Goulart in the match against Argentina on October 11 in Beijing and for the game against Japan in Singapore three days later. The 32-year-old Kaka, a member of Brazil's squad at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups, hadn't been called up to the Selecao since a friendly against Russia in March last year, when Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge. Goulart was dropped because of a muscle injury. Dunga also had to replace Chelsea's Ramires with Sao Paulo midfielder Souza and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos with Inter Milan's Juan. The match against Argentina, the Super Classic of the Americas, is organized by South American football's governing body. 'I'm incredibly happy to be back,' Kaka said. 'After a long time away from the national team, this comes as a reward for the work that I have been doing. It shows that I've been doing something good.'

"It is a landscape of jagged peaks and deep lakes that have never been directly seen with human eyes. And now it seems the ghostly Gamburtseve Mountains, that are buried beneath two and a half miles (4km) of ice in East Antarctica, are even stranger than scientists could have imagined. An international team of scientists has found that despite being 500 million years old - 200 million years older than the European Alps - they show almost no signs of weathering. The haunting images of the Gamburtseve Subglacial Mountains obtained by scientists have earned them the nickname the Ghost Mountains. The clusters of vertical lines in this image show water filled valleys . Instead, the peaks, which rise 8,850ft (2,700 metres) above sea level yet do not break out beyond the surface of the ice, have been preserved by the frozen sheet that lies on top of them. Stranger still, the scientists have found evidence that melt water from the bottom of the enormous ice sheet may actually be flowing up the mountains. Snow falling on the surface of the ice sheet causes the temperature close to peaks of the Gamburtsevs to fall in a process called divergent cooling. At the same time, heat radiating from the bedrock beneath the ice causes melt water to form rivers and lakes in the deep valley between the mountains. However, with the huge pressure of the ice on top of them, the water is pushed in the same direction as the ice is flowing, causing water to flow up valleys against gravity. As this uphill flow meets the colder temperatures from above towards the top of the peaks, it refreezes, protecting the ridge line from erosion. This effectively cryogenically freezes the mountains in time, making them appear much younger than they are. Forming around 550 million years ago when two continental plates collided, they should appear far more eroded than they are. Professor Timothy Creyts, a geophysicist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and lead author of the study, said that in places water is flowing uphill for thousands of metres. He said: 'Along the southern and northern margins of the Gamburtsevs, the ice surface and bed slopes oppose each other, and water is driven up steep slopes toward thinner ice. 'These elevation gains are commonly thousands of meters and make these pathways striking examples of glacially driven uphill water flow.' The research team used data gathered from two twin-engine aircraft equipped with ice penetrating radar, gravity metres and magnetometers to build up a picture of the mountain range. First discovered in 1958, it took more than 50 years before scientists were able to see what the mountains looked like beneath the ice. The fuzzy grey images they obtained of the towering crags helped to earn the Gamburtsev mountains the nickname of the ghost mountains. The landscape that emerged was one of saw toothed ridges and towering crags that are more typically associated with younger mountain ranges like the Alps and the Rockies. The scientists estimate that without the weight of the ice sheet pushing down on them, the mountains would rebound to tower more than 10,800ft (3,300 metres). In a paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, they describe how they also discovered a network of lakes and rivers in the valleys that cut through the Gamburtsevs. Although meltwater usually speeds up erosion of mountains by glaciers, it seems that in the Gamburtsevs the water refreezes on the ridgelines to protect them . Researchers used ice penetrating radar and other sensors onboard aircraft that they flew above ice to build up the first picture of the rugged landscape of the Gamburtsev mountains below. From above the ice is flat . The high pressure from the ice above pushes meltwater in the valleys below the ice uphill in the same direction as the overlying ice is flowing, creating a frozen barrier around the ridgeline that protects against erosoin . Using an underwater robot, polar scientists have been able to to build up a detailed three dimensional picture of the ice that builds up over the sea each winter. The depth of ice around Antarctica is notoriously difficult to measure due to the thick blanket of snow that covers it. But now high-resolution mapping of the sea ice using an autonomous underwater vehicle known as SeaBed has shown that it is up to 56 feet thick in some places. It was typically thought that the ice was only a few metres thick in most areas. In some places, the weight of the ice sheet forces water to flow against the pull of gravity. This uphill flow refreezes when it meets colder temperatures coming from the ice above. Professor Creyts said: 'The ice sheet acts like an anti-aging cream. 'It triggers a series of thermodynamic processes that have almost perfectly preserved the Gamburtsevs since ice began spreading across the continent.' Dr Fausto Ferraccioli, head of airborne geophysics at the British Antarctic Survey and a co-author on the paper, added that this process is thought to have been occurring for around 34 million years since glaciers began forming on Antarctica. He said: 'How mountain ranges form and are preserved in the middle of old continents for millions of years are fundamental questions in Earth Sciences. 'Our new research has important additional ramifications for our understanding of long-term climate and ice sheet change. 'This study shows that interplays between topography, water, ice sheets and tectonics must be considered in order to understand the preservation of mountain ranges such as the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains. 'If these mountains in interior East Antarctica had been more significantly eroded, then the ice sheet itself may have had a different history.' First discovered in 1958, it took more than 50 years before scientists could see what the mountains looked like beneath the ice. The mountains (marked) are two and a half miles (4km) under the east of the continent . The researchers have been able to build up the first picture of what lies beneath the ice of East Antarctica . The lost boys never aged while they were in Never Never Land in JM Barrie's book Peter Pan, and it seems that the Gamburtsev mountains beneath the antarctic ice are also protected from the ravages of time .","Images from ice penetrating radar and other sensors reveal Antarctica's Gamburtseve Mountains as a landscape of razor sharp ridges and peaks .

"Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has accepted a Football Association misconduct charge over comments he made regarding Jewish and Chinese people and has requested a non-personal hearing. The Guardian interviewed Whelan in the wake of his decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the club's new manager, at a time when the Scot was the subject of an investigation into reported racist and anti-Semitic texts sent while he was in charge of Cardiff. The newspaper claimed that when asked about Mackay's past indiscretions, Whelan replied by saying it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'chink'. Whelan was also reported to have stated: 'Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.' Wigan chairman Dave Whelan (left) has accepted the FA charge and has requested a non-personal hearing . Whelan said he would resign from his role at the Championship outfit if the FA suggested he was racist . The FA said in a statement released on Monday: 'We can confirm Mr Whelan has accepted the charge and has requested a non-personal hearing but no date has been set for that.' Whelan has indicated he would resign if the FA even suggested he was guilty of using racist language. He told ITV News last month: 'If the FA look into my affairs and they were to find me guilty, which I hope they don't - and I don't see anything like that happening because I'm absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be - however, if they have any questions I'm willing to answer it and should they even suggest I'm guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.' Malky Mackay (left) is also being investigated over texts exchanged with former colleague Iain Moody . Moody (centre) resigned from his role at Crystal Palace in August after Sportsmail revealed the contents of the text messages he exchanged with Mackay . In charging Whelan on November 27, the FA said: 'It is alleged the Wigan Athletic chairman breached FA Rule E3[1] in that his comments were abusive and/or insulting and/or constitute improper conduct and/or bring the game into disrepute. MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . 'It is further alleged that this is an 'aggravated breach' as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.' The FA is still investigating a series of texts sent between Mackay and the former head of recruitment at Cardiff, Iain Moody which it is alleged were discriminatory in nature. It has been reported that the FA may not be able to act against Mackay, should the texts be deemed as private correspondence. Cardiff owner Vincent Tan was hugely critical of Whelan's decision to appoint Mackay as successor to Uwe Rosler, telling BBC Sport that it was a case of a 'racist chairman hiring a racist manager'. Both Whelan and Mackay strongly deny that they are racist.","Dave Whelan has requested a non-personal hearing after accepting charge .

"A male model who was caught outside the Burj Khalifa with 21g of cocaine has released a rap song to spare him from a life sentence. Swedish-Iranian Farzan Athari, 29, has been in prison since his arrest on May 14 last year - outside his home in the Burj Khalifa tower. He was sentenced to life in prison for possession of drugs with intent to promote - which under UAE law amounts to 25 years but the sentence was later reduced to 10 years. He has now set up a petition, which has attracted more than 60,000 signatures, to promote his plight and recorded a song from jail asking ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid for a pardon. Scroll down for video . Swedish-Iranian model Farzan Athari, pictured left, before his imprisonment and right, in Dubai Central Prison this year, has recorded a song appealing his life sentence . The song which is called 'Save My Life' was recorded as Athari sang from a phone booth in Dubai Central Prison. In the song, Athari blames his situation on falling in with the wrong crowd and insists he has never used drugs. He sings: 'Save my life, save my life. I need you to forgive me. I'm asking you Your Highness. 'I really want you to know, I didn't use drugs. I always said no, no matter where I was.' As the song continues, he explains he was living a charmed life after finding success in Dubai as a model and TV presenter. And in a letter he wrote, which was posted on his blog, Athari insists he was entrapped and his life sentence was actually 'lenient' because he almost got the death penalty.

Addressed to the ruler of Dubai, Athari blames his situation on falling in with the wrong crowd and insists he has never used drugs . He says police testified at his trial that an informant had tipped them off that Athari was carrying drugs and intending to supply, but his video explains that his drug tests came back clean. In his letter, Athari said: 'Upon my arrest I was kept for two weeks in an empty cell with no bed or toilet, without any rights to a lawyer, no contact with the Swedish embassy, no translator or even a simple phone call to my family or friends to inform them that I’m alive. 'I was coerced into signing a confession and statements in Arabic, a language which I can’t read or understand – they didn’t give me any other choice. 'I am not a promoter or dealer of any illegal substance.' But he admitted that carrying the cocaine was 'the biggest mistake of my life'. He added: 'I have truly learnt my lesson. Athari, who says he has learnt his lesson, was living a charmed life after finding success in the city as a model and TV presenter. Pictured left, with Hollywood actors Gerard Butler, left, and right, Bradley Cooper . Lyrics in the song explain that he regrets carrying the drugs, but has never taken any himself . 'Not a day passes when I’m not afraid or concerned for my life and my health being locked in together with heavy criminals. 'At the time of my arrest, I had a great career and I was involved in a successful local business with two partners and 16 employees. 'Now, all I have is a decade of jail time before me. 'I’m asking you with all my heart for your support in a time where I need it the most I ask for mercy because everybody has made a mistake at some point in their life.' He adds that Dubai is an 'amazing city and he does not intend to criticize it. 'I have lived and worked in Dubai for three years because it is an amazing city,' he said. 'I was even in the process of writing and producing a theme song to promote the city of Dubai.'

"The SFA have charged both Rangers and Mike Ashley with breaching disciplinary rules over the Newcastle owner’s involvement in the Ibrox club. Scottish football’s governing body, concerned by issues of dual ownership, had come to an agreement with the Sports Direct billionaire to limit his influence at the fallen Glasgow giants following his initial investment back in 2012. Ashley agreed to hold no more than 10 per cent of Rangers shares and, while that remains the case, his recent tranche of loans to the Championship club, worth £3million, came with the proviso that two of his representatives would be elected to the Ibrox board. Mike Ashley has found himself in trouble after apparently breaking rules about dual ownership . The controversial billionaire owns stakes in both Rangers and Premier League side Newcastle . Derek Llambias, the former Newcastle managing director, was subsequently brought in as first a consultant before being promoted to a non-executive director’s role. Now, following Monday’s confirmation that manager Ally McCoist has tendered his resignation, the Ibrox club have been hit by more turmoil. SFA chief executive Stewart Regan had revealed last month that he was in talks with Ashley and his representatives, and hoped to have a face-to-face meeting to discuss his involvement. ‘We’ve been in regular dialogue with Mike Ashley’s lawyers through MASH Holdings,’ said Regan. The Scottish Football Association made an agreement with Ashley in 2012 to limit his influence at the club . The club confirmed Ally McCoist's resignation from the club on Monday, he will serve a 12-month notice period . ‘It’s still ongoing at the moment, we are still in dialogue. The next stage is to meet with Mike and his advisers and obviously get some clarification around some of the concerns we have got. ‘We have a situation in our articles which prevents dual interests in football clubs. We gave Mike Ashley the ability to have up to 10-per-cent shareholding in the club. ‘As part of that, there was a commitment there would be no management or influence at Rangers Football Club. ‘Clearly, we want to have a better understanding of his position in that regard.’ Now it seems that the SFA have felt compelled to speed up the process with the disciplinary action, with a meeting set to be heard at the end of January next year. If found guilty, Rangers could face a range of punishments that include a censure, fine, being thrown out of the Scottish Cup, a transfer ban or even having their membership of the SFA terminated. Ashley, meanwhile, risks a £10,000 fine if he fails to have the charges dropped. ‘The Compliance Officer has issued the following Notices of Complaint: .

"Kuntal Patel, 37, from Stratford, east London, has been jailed for three years for possession of a deadly toxin after fantasising about poisoning her mother . A graphic designer who was inspired by Breaking Bad to fantasise about poisoning her mother after she forbade her from marrying the man she loved has been jailed for three years for possession of a deadly toxin. Barclays Bank worker Kuntal Patel, from Stratford, east London, had wished her 'selfish and controlling' mother Meena Patel dead after the 61-year-old was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement, a court was told. During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the court heard the 37-year-old contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'. It was alleged Kuntal developed a murder plot after becoming 'addicted' to the American TV series and watching an episode in which drug lord Walter White kills an enemy with ricin-laced tea. But while Kuntal admitted fantasising about her mother's death, she denied ever intending to kill her. Kuntal insisted the plot was purely a fantasy and she had wanted to use the poison - which prosecutors alleged she slipped into her mother's Diet Coke - to take her own life. The jury of six men and six women, which had deliberated for just over three hours, cleared her of attempted murder. But they convicted Kuntal of acquiring a biological agent or toxin - the first time someone has been prosecuted under the Biological Weapons Act. Kuntal had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin. Sentencing her today, Justice Rabinder Singh said Kuntal had endured 'a prolonged period of severe stress' and had committed the offences after seeing 'no way out'. The judge sentenced Kuntal to three years in jail for acquiring the poison in December 2013. She was given a further 18 months for attempting to acquire poison for the second time between December and January 2014, which will run concurrently. A third count of attempting to acquire a deadly toxin was ordered to lie on file. Mr Justice Singh said: 'You have worked hard both in higher education and in your profession as a graphic designer throughout your adult life. 'In my view you had to endure a prolonged period of severe stress in the two years leading up to your offences. It is clear that you were a devoted and obedient daughter. Kuntal ordered deadly poison - which was sent to her concealed in a red candle (right) - off the 'dark web' but said she had only fantasised about killing her mother Meena Patel, 61 (left) 'It is also clear that your mother was a devoted and caring mother, who worked hard to raise you and your sister, having been separated from your father when you were very young. He added: 'On the other hand, in the two-year period leading up to your offences, she subjected you to a barrage of abuse, often verbal and at times physical, for example, slapping you. 'She would send you emails and texts of the most vile kind, abusing not only you but also your friends and in particular the man you wished to marry. The court heard Kuntal, pictured,  committed the offences after living in a 'pressure cooker of emotion' 'You found yourself in the autumn of 2013 torn between your devotion to your mother and family as a dutiful daughter, and your desire to find happiness for yourself with the man that you wanted to spend a lifetime with. 'Ultimately you could see no way out and became increasingly depressed and isolated, contemplating killing your mother and yourself.' Kuntal, who appeared in the dock in a blue and white long sleeved top, wept as the sentence was read. Her sister Poonam, 33, who attended every day of the trial, was also seen crying in the public gallery. During the trial, the court heard Meena worked as a community relations officer at Newham Council for Racial Equality and sat on the bench at Thames Magistrates' Court in east London. But she barred her daughter from marrying the man she loved, describing Niraj Kakad, who lived in Phoenix, Arizona, as a 'black b******'. She also instructed her daughter to 'behave like a decent person, you are not a white woman'. The court heard she even banged her head against the walls  and said she would kill herself if Kuntal left for the U.S to marry Mr Kakad. She slapped and strangled both Kuntal and Poonam, jurors were told. She also sent scores of hate-filled texts throughout the day and night, telling Kuntal she was a 'f***** up brain girl' and that she was  'ashamed' of her daughter. Defence counsel Peter Rowlands told the court: 'Her state of mind at the time was one of psychological disturbance. The defendant over a period of two years found herself in a pressure cooker of emotion. 'She looked to the one person, her mother, who might have shored up her increasing emotional distress and you may recall what she got instead.' The court heard that, after this treatment, Kuntal snapped and used the secretive 'dark web' to buy the toxin. A jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted Kuntal of acquiring the deadly poison, but acquitted her of attempted murder after deliberating for just three hours . She used £950 in Bitcoins from a site called Black Market Reloaded. The poison was then sent by dealer Jesse Korff, who dubbed himself 'Snowman840', disguised in a red scented candle. She duped her close friend Julie Wong into having the package containing the deadly poison delivered to her home in Streatham, south London by saying Mr Kakad was sending her a gift. Kuntal dubbed the dealer 'Heisenberg' after the teacher turned chemist in the American TV series. In emails Korff boasted of a plan to manufacture methamphetamine, the same substance perfected by Walter White and Jessie Pinkman in Breaking Bad. But the FBI was investigating Korff. When he was arrested, the  officers passed on information about Kuntal to the Metropolitan Police. Kuntal was arrested on January 26 this year after officers swooped at the £450,000 home she shared with her family. Detectives and specialist officers trained in dealing with biological and nuclear substances searched Kuntal's home in Stratford, on January 26. They had earlier raided Ms Wong's home and stormed the home of Ms Wong's neighbour James Sutcliffe - the son of Foreign Office diplomat Nicholas Sutcliffe - after he innocently took delivery of the package. Meena did not cooperate with investigators and did not appear as a prosecution witness. But the court heard she reconciled with her daughter during tearful telephone calls to prison where she confessed that she was the only person to blame.","Kuntal Patel, 37, was cleared of trying to kill mother Meena by poisoning her .

"Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera was  among a host of footballing figures named by Spain's anti-corruption prosecutor on Monday in an alleged case of matchfixing involving a La Liga game in the 2010-11 season. The United midfielder was mentioned alongside other prominent names such as Atletico Madrid captain Gabi and Japan coach Javier Aguirre.

Former Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias and the club itself were also named as defendants, along with the rest of the players from both teams. In its court filing published on Monday, the prosecutor alleged that the Levante players were paid a total of €965,000 (£766,000) in cash to deliberately lose the game. Gabi (right), now at Atletico Madrid, has also been named in the alleged case of matchfixing . Zaragoza allegedly first made bank transfers to their players and officials, including Aguirre, Herrera and Gabi, and  then took the money out of their accounts in cash and passed it on to the Levante players, the prosecutor said.

"Paul Ince has told under-fire Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers to sell summer signing Mario Balotelli in order to improve the struggling side's team spirit. Balotelli, who sealed a £16million move to Anfield in August, has failed to score a Premier League goal since joining. Ince has questioned the 24-year-old's ability after the Italy forward failed to impress after replacing Adam Lallana at half-time during his side's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United.

The Italy forward is yet to score a Premier League goal - he was foiled by David de Gea on Sunday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has failed to get the best out of the £16million summer signing . Ince, speaking to talkSPORT, said: 'I just watched him play [against Manchester United] and he plays for himself. You can see the frustration in the other players. There was a time when he could have put another player in but he didn’t. 'It seems like people are frightened to say something to him in case he goes the other way. They keep saying what a great, talented player he is but I’m yet to see it.' Former Liverpool midfielder Ince believes Rodgers should have steered clear of Balotelli after seeing Jose Mourinho and Roberto Mancini struggle to get the best out of him. Roberto Mancini (left) and Jose Mourinho (right) couldn't control Balotelli, according to Ince . 'It was a strange decision bringing Balotelli in,' added Ince. 'Brendan [Rodgers] thought he could take that gamble because of losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona but if Jose Mourinho couldn't control him (Balotelli) and Roberto Mancini couldn't control him then I don’t understand why Brendan thought he could. 'I think the quicker Brendan Rodgers sees it and can get rid of him the better, to be honest, and the better it will be for everyone because there is a lack of spirit in that Liverpool side.'","Mario Balotelli is yet to score a Premier League goal since joining the club .

Spain technically is a great league and maybe it's still a little more tactical than England but that has improved a lot here. 'That doesn't mean in Spain it is more difficult to beat the opponent because in England — especially with the fans, passion and commitment — when we play away it is always difficult; all the teams want to attack.'

"Monday's Europa League might not have been the main event in Nyon but it still managed to throw-up some intriguing knockout ties for Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Celtic. All four British clubs face tough last 32 matches as they battle to make it all the way to next May's final in Warsaw - a match which now has the added prize of a Champions League spot for the winners. With the Reds coming up against Turkish giants Besiktas, Spurs facing Italian outfit Fiorentina, Everton travelling to Switzerland to take on Young Boys and Celtic and Inter Milan playing out a repeat of the 1976 European Cup final, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the next stage of the Europa League. The winners of the Europa League will win this trophy and a spot in next season's Champions League . LIVERPOOL vs BESIKTAS . Will Liverpool be happy with the draw? Sort of. Brendan Rodgers will be pleased to avoid former Reds boss Rafa Benitez and his Napoli side, while Inter Milan, Fiorentina, Sporting Lisbon and Zenit St Petersburg would all have provided stern tests. But Besiktas, who won their group ahead of Tottenham, will not be a pushover and could cause the out-of-form Merseysiders problems, particularly in Turkey. Steven Gerrard and his Liverpool team-mates were dumped out of the Champions League early on . Star man - Demba Ba . Former Chelsea and Newcastle striker Ba has been in excellent form for Besiktas since swapping London for Istanbul last summer. The 29-year-old netted five goals in four group stage appearances and will be keen to impress against Premier League opposition in February next year. Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba (second from left) will be a threat against Liverpool in February . Have they met before? Yes. The two teams came up against each other in the group stage of the Champions in 2007-08, with the Reds losing 2-1 in Turkey before thrashing Besiktas 8-0 at Anfield. Peter Crouch scores Liverpool's opening goal in their 8-0 demolition of Besiktas in 2007 . EVERTON vs YOUNG BOYS . Will Everton be happy with the draw? Yes. Considering the Toffees could have drawn Roma, Ajax and Sevilla, facing the Swiss side gives Roberto Martinez's men a fantastic chance of reaching the last 16. Everton boss Roberto Martinez will be pleased with his side's draw against Young Boys of Switzerland . Star man - Guillaume Hoarau . With five goals in six Europa League group games, Hoarau will pose the biggest threat to Everton's chances of advancing further in the competition. The former Paris Saint-Germain striker, who has five caps for France, is will be looking to make an impression when Young Boys host their Premier League counterparts on February 19. Have they met before? No. February's two-legged tie will be the first time the two sides have clashed. Young Boys striker Guillaume Hoarau (right) will be keen to continue his form in the Europa League . TOTTENHAM vs FIORENTINA . Will Tottenham be happy with the draw? Not really. The trip to Florence will be tough, particularly given the hostile atmosphere created at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. Spurs could have faced Club Brugges, Red Bull Salzburg and Legia Warsaw, all of which would've been easier ties on paper. Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen (L-R) can expect a trip to Italy in February . Star man - Juan Cuadrado . Heavily linked with the likes of Barcelona and Manchester United last summer, Cuadrado has continued to impress for the Italian outfit this season. The Colombian international has struck four goals in Serie A and the Europa League this term and also has three assists to his name. Juan Cuadrado (right), pictured in action against Juventus, is Fiorentina's most wanted player . Have they met before? Never. The first-leg at White Hart Lane on February 19 will be their first ever meeting. CELTIC vs INTER MILAN . Will Celtic be happy with the draw? It could’ve been a lot worse for Celtic, but they won’t be overly confident of upsetting the odds against one of Europe’s biggest names, even if Inter have fallen on tough times recently. Celtic are drawn to play Inter Milan during the Europa League last 32 draw in Nyon, Switzerland, on Monday . Star man - Samir Handanovic . It’s coming to something when your goalkeeper is a definite star man, but Handanovic is the only player to consistently put in decent performances and who genuinely could earn a move elsewhere. Have they met before? Celtic’s greatest night in their history came against Inter back in 1967. The Lisbon Lions defeat the Italian giants 2-1 in the European Cup final on an evening to have gone down in folklaw. Inter have never beaten the Bhoys, with the pair drawing both games in 1972.

"An English striker with a hunger for goals and an even bigger appetite for hard work, Harry Kane may not be Spurs’ most polished player, but he is certainly shining right now. He scored his 11th of the season to set his team on their way during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Swansea, a powerful header his latest instinctive effort from inside the penalty area. It was the third time that Kane has scored in a 2-1 triumph away from home this term, the points to which those goals equate proving the difference between seventh and 11th. Scroll down for the top 10 distances covered by forwards this season . Harry Kane rose above the rest to score the opening goal during Tottenham's win against Swansea City . It is patently obvious what playing for his boyhood club means to the striker . And this, don’t forget, from a 21-year-old who started the campaign as very much the understudy to leading man Emmanuel Adebayor. The Spurs strikers define polar opposites of the scale measured by effort, energy and endeavour. Kane is all action, he wears his heart on both sleeves. At the Liberty Stadium he ran a staggering 8.2miles, a distance only matched by Christian Eriksen among the visiting team. Some may argue he lacks the finesse of the very top forwards, but if goals are the currency in which strikers trade, Kane is cash rich. From 23 senior starts for Spurs, he has 17 goals. The manner in which he first sniffs out chances and then disposes of them is at times effortless, a natural instinct which very few boast. He certainly won’t hide should opportunities go begging, either. But there is more to his game. His performance in last month’s 2-1 win over Everton – in which he didn’t score but assisted both goals – drew praise from Jamie Carragher, the Sky pundit and Sportsmail columnist, declaring that Kane had been the best player on the pitch. He invigorates others with an urgency and enthusiasm sadly lacking in too many residing at White Hart Lane in recent seasons. The Chingford-born Spurs fan is a mascot for supporters – ‘Harry Kane, he’s one of our own’ – and with him in the team it injects belief and excitement. Kane is a completely different striker to the much-maligned Emmanuel Adebayor . Roy Hodgson (pictured posing for a selfie with a young fan) would do worse than to look at Kane for England . Kane's desire and work ethic have made him a firm fans' favourite in under a season around the first team . He has won his place in the side through a single-minded determination – there is no big price tag or inflated reputation to justify his inclusion, it is down to the will of the player alone. In an age where academy graduates are all too expectant of progression and bemoan a lack of opportunity, Kane has served his time at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester. From League One to the Premier League and eight goals in the Europa League, Kane is proving himself very able. Perhaps Roy Hodgson should check on his progress. For Kane – who is also eligible for Republic of Ireland – has already announced his intention to break in to the England senior team. And when Harry Kane sets his target, you wouldn’t bet against him hitting it. Player . Harry Kane . Harry Kane . Ashley Barnes . Marouane Chamakh . Wayne Rooney . Ashley Barnes . Bojan .

"Another day another diver! Referees are struggling to accurately identify what is simulation and what isn’t in the Premier League. There is an inconsistent approach to this major issue and makes you consider the subjectivity of a lot of the incidents. Here, Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll looks at the incidents from recent match weekends and explains where the inconsistencies have been in referees' decision making... VIDEO Scroll down for Steve Bruce on simulation in the Premier League . Willian goes to ground theatrically at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-0 victory over Hull City . THE ISSUES . This weekend: . Of the three players above cautioned for diving I thought two were correct and one. However, the three others should have been booked too. Chris Foy (centre) brandishes a yellow card to Diego Costa, wrongly, after believing he dived during the match . Chris Foy (right) booked Chelsea's Willian for diving against Hull at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Willian (left) goes down under a challenge from Curtis Davies, who tried to pull away from it . Gary Cahill (obscured, centre) goes down theatrically in the box for Chelsea against Hull City . West Bromwich Albion's Sebastien Pocognoli (left) was rightly booked for simulation against Aston Villa . Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane (bottom) goes down in the penalty area but no decision was given either way . Previous weekend: . The weekend before similar issues were highlighted in the Premier League: . Then, of course, the most startling caution for simulation this season came on November 30 when Mike Jones decided that Manchester City's Sergio Aguero had dived and cautioned him after he was clearly wiped out by Jose Fonte against Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. Ross Barkley (right) was wrongly booked for diving  after being brought down by Frank Lampard . Connor Wickham (left) appeared to go down theatrically in the box against Liverpool . THE DIFFICULTY IN DETECTING . What is clear is that the select group of referees in the Premier League are unable to consistently detect and punish the guilty parties whilst protecting those who are fouled. This is partly down to the ability of the referees themselves but mostly due to the players and their approach. There is a tendency now for players to do two things which fuel the fire of inconsistency and they were in evidence this weekend. Exaggerating contact: . Tottenham’s Harry Kane appeared to feel slight contact on his boot from behind as he was running into the penalty area. He stubbed his toe into the turf - which only he can know if that was deliberate - and went sprawling down. He certainly looked for a penalty and was clearly annoyed when Bobby Madley failed to award one. Had he been heading straight towards goal with a good chance to score then I am sure he would have stayed on his feet and tried to get a second for Spurs. Kane (left) appeared to feel slight contract from behind and then stubbed his toe into the turf . Anticipating contact: . Chelsea’s Costa saw Tom Huddlestone dangle a leg out in front of him and felt that, had he continued his normal run, he would have been knocked to the ground and perhaps injured. Therefore, to avoid contact with Huddlestone’s leg, he went over it. I would argue that the Hull player's action impeded his progress and so it was a foul. However, when Costa’s team-mate Gary Cahill thought that two Hull defenders were going to impede him, he jumped through the middle of them. They had withdrawn from their act and therefore Cahill had dived. Costa (right) was booked for simulation after a challenge on him from Tom Huddlestone . THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS . Replays: . These decisions are fine margins and subtle differences which are so hard to get right at full speed in the intensity of major football matches. Slow-motion replays help massively and as they are available it seems incongruous that the resource is not used. However, there appears to be no prospect of this being introduced in the foreseeable future. Chelsea centre back Cahill (left) was left in shock by Foy's decision not to award him a penalty . Extra officials: . The widely-respected Pierluigi Collina is in favour of additional match officials helping out in all aspects of the game and this includes simulation. I have seen no evidence to suggest this helps and the higher the number of different people who look at subjective situations, the less consistent the action tends to be. Foy did not buy the dive and rightly booked Willian for simulation against Hull . Retrospective action: . A few ex-players have mooted the idea of a panel sitting after match days to adjudicate on incidents of simulation. I think this is an excellent option; if just two people are allowed to sit together, perhaps an ex-player and a former referee, there will be greater consistency. They should sit and adjudicate on incidents on a Monday and have the power to impose an immediate retrospective one-game ban for those found guilty who have already escaped the attention of the match-day referee. But referees should still be encouraged to detect and punish at the time and given additional training to ensure they think in harmony with the panel, of who only two should sit at any one time. What is clear is that some action is required - and quickly - before this spirals into an even bigger issue that affects every game. Retrospective action should be introduced for incidents such as Cahill's dive against Hull .","There were lots of contentious decisions in Premier League this weekend .
Simulation is returning to the game and it needs to be eradicated .
Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll talks through how to resolve this problem .
Chelsea’s Willian and Diego Costa cautioned for simulation while Gary Cahill was not during the Blues' 2-0 victory over Hull City.
Adam Johnson awarded a penalty for Sunderland for what appeared to be a dive against West Ham United. The Black Cats scored the penalty and the match finished 1-1.

"Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Schalke centre back Benedikt Howedes. Representatives were in the stands for the 4-0 win over Stuttgart last week and Howedes is liked as he is able to play left back, which is where he has figured for Germany. The 26-year-old has admitted he is keen to move to England but has two years left on his contract and his Bundesliga club are reluctant to sell while they are still in the Champions League. Schalke defender Benedikt Howedes (right) goes for the ball during a Champions League tie with Maribor . Howedes, pictured hugging team-mate Max Meyer, is rated at around £15million by his club Schalke . Schalke, who face Real Madrid in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition, value Howedes around £15million. Wenger wants cover for his defence but Howedes would expect to start regularly if he moved. Arsenal have struggled in central defence this season after selling Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona last summer. Laurent Koscielny missed a number of games due to injury, with Calum Chambers and full backs Nacho Monreal and Mathieu Debuchy having to fill in alongside Per Mertesacker. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is keen to strengthen his defensive options in the January transfer window .","Arsenal scouts watched Benedikt Howedes against Stuttgart .

"Queens Park Rangers are watching Blackburn strike pair Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they weigh up a January bid. Manager Harry Redknapp is keen to bring in a goalscorer to bolster his side's fight for Premier League survival and ideally wants players who can bed in quickly. He has reservations that Rhodes can not play as a lone striker but his goalscoring record means he has to be considered. The 24-year-old has 59 goals in 106 games for Blackburn with 73 in 108 for previous club Huddersfield. QPR are interested in signing Blackburn duo Jordan Rhodes (left) and Rudy Gestede in January . He has scored seven this season and was on the bench for Saturday's game at Brentford, where Redknapp was joined in the stands by assistant Kevin Bond. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer started with Gestede up front at Brentford and the 26-year-old continued his rich vein of form with his 12th goal of the season in just 20 games. Gestede impressed Redknapp last season also and has now scored 23 goals in 38 games since joining from Cardiff City. Rhodes has also been watched by Real Sociedad while Hull City failed with a £10million offer for the Scotland striker in the summer. Gestede (right) was on target at Brentford on Satruday- despite their 3-1 Championship defeat . Blackburn may well have been wiser to take that offer in light of their transfer embargo imposed by the Football League on Monday. They will now be under restrictions to what, if any player, they can bring in. There is also interest mounting in Rovers' 23-year-old winger Ben Marshall, with several Premier League and Championship clubs represented at recent games. QPR have considered moves for the likes of Peter Crouch, Gary Hooper, Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe but Keane will be staying in the MLS and Defoe is expensive. Stoke want to keep Crouch and Hooper is still struggling for form. A suitable offer for either Gestede or Rhodes could be timely. QPR are also interested in signing Stoke striker Peter Crouch but the Potters want to keep the 33-year-old . Premier League clubs have been alerted to the fact Fulham are willing to listen to offers for striker Ross McCormack just six months after signing him from Leeds United for £11million. The 28-year-old is content in London but the struggling Championship side are considering means to strengthen their squad elsewhere and a sizeable offer for McCormack would be considered. Fulham have put  clubs on alert with news they're willing to listen to offers for striker Ross McCormack (left) Although Kit Symons has steadied the ship, Fulham are still 10 points off the play-off places following their poor start under Felix Magath and their prospects of promotion look slim. They are evaluating the squad and are prepared to make changes in January. Aston Villa are also among clubs keen on midfielder Bryan Ruiz. There is interest in the 29-year-old Costa Rica star from Holland and Spain also but Paul Lambert hopes to persuade him to make a quick return to the Premier League with Villa. McCormack's team-mate Bryan Ruiz (left) is attracting interest from Premier League side Aston Villa . Gremio want Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva. The 27-year-old is in and out of Brendan Rodgers' side at the moment and the Brazilian club sense he could be open to a return home. Lucas, however, has made it clear he would prefer to stay at Anfield if he has a fair chance of contributing. Napoli have been linked consistently also but Rafa Benitez is struggling to get the financial support he wants to push the Italian club forward. Liverpool want to sell to raise money for January re-inforcements and Italian striker Fabio Borini is at the top of that list. The club hope to raise around £10m to £12m for the 24-year-old but may yet find a replacement on loan rather than commit even more transfer funds with Daniel Sturridge due back from injury and Divock Origi arriving in the summer. Gremio want to sign Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva (left), despite his preference to stay at Anfield . Manchester United are looking at Belgian brothers Indy and Seppe Boonen. Indy, 15, is a left back who left Genk last year and has already had trials at United. He is training with United's youth sides at the moment while his younger brother 13-year-old Seppe is a promising goalkeeper. They are hoping to sign a professional contract with United when they turn 16. United have held off competition from neighbours Manchester City to sign Portuguese winger Venancio da Silva Monteiro. The 15-year-old left Benfica in April to train with United in the hope of winning a deal but his performances had attracted interest from City who were also keen to sign him. West Ham are reviving interest in Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani. The 26-year-old Algeria forward impressed at the World Cup and is keen on a move to the Premier League. One concern though is Slimani's involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations. West Ham will listen to offers for Mauro Zarate. The 27-year-old forward has been used sparingly this season and wants more game time. Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani (right) is being monitored by West Ham . West Ham will need cover for Diafra Sakho, who is also due at the Africa Cup of Nations in January but Zarate wants a regular role. He wants to play for his adopted country Chile when they host the 2015 Copa America but will struggle to stake a claim having played just eight games this season. Southampton are among clubs to have shown an interest so far but Zarate also has clubs from Spain, Brazil and Italy who are keen to take him either permanently or on loan. Meanwhile the Hammers are willing to listen to offers for 27-year-old striker Mauro Zarate . Orlando City are closing on a deal for Stoke City winger Brek Shea. Former Everton and Manchester City midfielder Adrian Heath is in charge of the MLS side and hopes to wrap up the transfer in the coming days. The 24-year-old Shea has struggled to win a first team role at the Britannia Stadium since the club fought to secure him a work permit in January 2013. The £2.5m signing has only made one start, in the League Cup, and has struggled to make a positive impression in loan spells at Barnsley and Birmingham City. Shea trained with Orlando in the summer but insisted he still wanted to prove himself in Europe. Stoke winger Brek Shea (left) has struggled to make a positive impression on loan at Birmingham City . Swansea City are keen to make Tom Carroll's loan from Tottenham into a permanent deal. The 22-year-old has impressed manager Garry Monk and is happy to make the switch from White Hart Lane, where competition among midfielders is fierce. Tottenham want to bring in three or four players themselves in January but are struggling to offload some of their surplus squad members. Swansea also have a liking for Kyle Naughton. Monk is in talks over bringing in a new full-back and a defensive midfielder with Exeter's Matt Grimes a confirmed target. A striker is also on Monk's wishlist with Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham among those continuing to admire £20m-rated Wilfried Bony.

"Trinny Woodall (right) has vowed to give her 11-year-old daughter the perfect Christmas after the  death of her ex-husband Johnny Elichaoff, 55 (left) Trinny Woodall has vowed to give her 11-year-old daughter the perfect Christmas after the tragic death of her ex-husband who fell from the roof of a shopping centre. The fashion expert's former husband Johnny Elichaoff, 55, died last month after he apparently fell from Whiteley’s shopping centre in Bayswater. Ms Woodall, 50, who is dating art mogul Charles Saatchi, and Mr Elichaoff were married for ten years and had a daughter, Lyla, before they divorced in 2009. The What Not To Wear presenter had remained friends with financial advisor and antiques dealer Mr Elichaoff, and was described as being 'grief-stricken' following his death. Describing the festive season as 'poignant', she said today that she would be making sure the holiday period was as normal as possible for their young daughter. 'My daughter’s father and I were separated, or divorced, for a few years. We were friends,' she told Evening Standard editor Sarah Sands on London Live today. 'So it’s about making it a really great Christmas for my daughter, making it feel kind of it’s everything she wanted to look forward to.' In her first interview since Mr Elichaoff's death, Ms Woodall said she would be spending Christmas in London with her sister. 'A friend of mine says we’re a tiny cog in a very large wheel, so you have something that’s quite a direct personal tragedy but we’re a part of this big picture as well,' she said. 'So it’s about picking up the reins again and moving forward.' Although police said they were not treating Mr Elichaoff's death as suspicious, he has been linked to four other businessmen who died in unusual circumstances. These include tycoon Scot Young, who died last week after falling four storeys from a window at his £3million Marylebone penthouse. Mr Elichaoff, who became friends with Mr Young through work, was known to have business problems and is believed to have been talked down from the roof of the shopping centre just weeks before his death. Among floral arrangements and photographs of the musician was a small white card believed to have been left by his estranged wife, reading: 'Miss you always, T'. Ms Woodall, 50,  is dating art mogul Charles Saatchi, the former husband of Nigella Lawson . It was accompanied by a picture of the 55-year-old with Lyla. Another photograph of Mr Elichaoff and his son from a previous marriage was also left among tributes. Scotland Yard has confirmed the 55-year-old's death was not being treated as suspicious. Mr Elichaoff regularly featured on the Channel 4 programme Four Rooms, in which members of the public pitch weird and wonderful objects to professional dealers. He and Ms Woodall had married in Knightsbridge in 1999 at St Columba's church where she was christened, her parents had married and her grandfather was buried. Trinny, pictured with Lyla in 2009, says she wants to make it 'a really great Christmas' for her daughter . Ms Woodall's wedding dress was made by designer Elspeth Gibson, but she created the designs for her bridesmaids' dresses, while their shoes were made by Christian Louboutin and differed according to the shape of the bridesmaids' ankles. Back in 1982, it had been Mr Elichaoff who first found fame, as a madcap rock drummer who toured the world supporting U2 and Siouxsie Sioux. Nicknamed Johnny Too Bad, he played in a Seventies band called Stark Naked And The Car Thieves before defecting to the equally bizarrely named Baby And The Black Spots and then playing in guitarist Robert Fripp's League Of Gentlemen. His musical career was interrupted by a two-year spell in the Army in 1984, and he went on to help manage rock bands Tears For Fears and Fairground Attraction before becoming a financial adviser. However, he developed an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2006 when he had 20 operations after breaking his leg in a motorbike accident. He was then treated in a Californian rehab clinic in October that year. Following their split in 2009, the couple remained on good terms and would regularly dine out together with Lyla. Friends said the marriage had broken down partly because of Ms Woodall's busy work schedule but his dependence on painkillers proved a strain. Mr Elichaoff suffered from an addiction to prescription painkillers. Ms Woodall also had her own battle with substance and alcohol abuse. The couple had both spoken openly about their issues. He said of his wife before their divorce: 'Trinny comes across as cold and aloof, but in fact she is the kindest woman I have ever met. She has a heart of gold. The steeliness people see in her is really a cover for her chronic shyness, believe me.' Ms Woodall began a relationship with Saatchi, 71, in the summer of 2012, eight weeks after he split from his former wife, Nigella Lawson. The couple's 10-year marriage ended after Mr Saatchi was photographed clutching the celebrity chef's neck outside Mayfair restaurant, Scott's – one of the art dealer's favourite haunts. This summer, less than 12 months after the incident, Ms Woodall was pictured with Mr Saatchi sobbing at a table outside the same restaurant.","Trinny Woodall's ex-husband Johnny Elichaoff died last month .

"David de Gea produced save after save in another match-winning performance for Manchester United on Sunday as their old rivals Liverpool were swept aside 3-0. The Spanish keeper's prowess in one-on-one situations and also his outstanding reactions and shot-stopping left Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli infuriated at Old Trafford. De Gea's class isn't in doubt, but where does he rank among the world's best right now? We count down our top 10. Feel free to add your list in the comments section below. VIDEO Scroll down to see our number one pick in action . David De Gea produced another outstanding performance as Manchester United beat Liverpool on Sunday . De Gea reaches out a hand to somehow deny Raheem Sterling in a one-on-one during the first half . 10. Keylor Navas (Real Madrid and Costa Rica) His excellent performances for surprise package Costa Rica at the World Cup earned Navas a move from Levante, where he had also impressed, to Real Madrid. Though he is playing second fiddle to Iker Casillas for now, Navas is clearly a capable stand-in and one for the long-term. Keylor Navas makes a penalty save from Greece's Fanis Gekas while playing for Costa Rica at the World Cup . 9. Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan and Slovenia) These may be far from vintage times for Inter Milan but in Slovenian stopper Handanovic they have a well-regarded and consistent performer. Penalty saves are a speciality, with five in Serie A and one in the UEFA Europa League this season. Samir Handanovic (right) jumps for the ball with Udinese's Guilherme during a recent match at San Siro . 8. Salvatore Sirigu (Paris Saint-Germain and Italy) Long considered the heir-apparent to Gianluigi Buffon, Sirigu continued to wait his turn on the international stage while excelling for his club, Paris Saint-Germain, who dominated the French league last season and are looking for an extended run in the Champions League this time round. Salvatore Sirigu in action for Paris Saint-Germain at Guingamp over the weekend . 7. Iker Casillas (Real Madrid and Spain) It looked for a while as though it might all be over for the legendary Spain keeper when he lost his place in Real's team for league matches two seasons ago. But he responded by helping them to a 10th Champions League crown. and, hey presto, he's back to being No 1 for this campaign. Casillas is approaching 700 career appearances for his one club and also has 160 caps for Spain - and he's still top class. Iker Casillas lifts the European Cup after Real's 4-1 win over Atletico Madrid in Lisbon back in May . 6. Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur and France) While Tottenham's season may not be going entirely to plan, Lloris has preserved his reputation as one of the world's best keepers. Maybe it's a sign of their vulnerable defence that Lloris has had to make more saves this season than many of the others in this list but he's made them nonetheless and won many points as a result. Hugo Lloris makes a flying save  for Tottenham in a Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade . 5. Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus and Italy) It is 13 years since Buffon's big money move to Juventus and yet the 36-year-old retains his class and influence for both club and country. Just look at the stats: Buffon has kept 10 clean sheets in 14 league matches for Juventus this season, the second highest in Europe's top leagues, and he has conceded just five goals in those games. He's been performing to the highest standards throughout the 727 club matches and 146 appearances for Italy and long may it continue. Gianluigi Buffon celebrates after Juventus secured their place in the Champions League knockout round . 4. Joe Hart (Manchester City and England) His abilities were called into question last season as a couple of high-profile mistakes saw him replaced by Costel Pantilimon in Manchester City's line-up. But Hart wasn't deterred and has roared back to form, making crucial, match-defining saves to keep his team in contention in both the Premier League and the Champions League. He also remains indisputably No 1 for England and this return to his best will be rewarded with a new long-term contract. Joe Hart at full stretch to make a save during Manchester City's weekend win at Leicester . 3. Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea and Belgium) It seemed like Courtois was waiting for ages for his chance at Chelsea, impressing consistently on loan for Atletico Madrid and for his country Belgium, but he's seized it with both hands. With his maturity and well-honed shot-stopping skills, it's often hard to forget that Courtois is still only 22. As expected, he has replaced Petr Cech as Chelsea's No 1 straight away and hasn't put a foot wrong as Chelsea have set the pace in the Premier League. Thibaut Courtois rolls the ball out during Chelsea's Premier League match with Leicester earlier this season . 2. David de Gea (Manchester United and Spain) The Spanish keeper looked initially uncomfortable with the physicality of the Premier League but has grown in stature, seeming to improve with every match. He has been absolutely indispensable to Manchester United this season and it's no exaggeration to suggest they might be in the bottom half without him. De Gea is excellent in one-on-one situations, as he proved against Sterling on Sunday, and has incredible reflexes to keep out shots, even at close quarters. Will undoubtedly establish himself as Spain's No 1 in the future. David De Gea goes toe-to-toe with Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero during the Manchester derby . 1. Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany) With his World Cup winners' medal and Ballon d'Or nomination, few would argue that Neuer is the world's best stopper at the moment. He was a rock-solid presence for Germany, keeping four clean sheets and winning the Golden Glove accolade for the tournament's best keeper. That came off the back of another dominant season with Bayern, who won a Bundesliga and German Cup double, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Most impressive about Neuer is that he has reinvented a role on the pitch, with his 'sweeper keeper' approach that often sees him charge 30 or 40 yards from his line to mug opposing strikers of the ball. Manuel Neuer makes a stunning one-handed save from France's Karim Benzema during the World Cup . Neuer, in his role as sweeper keeper, comes out and tackles Algeria's Sofiane Feghouli .

'If we can snatch a good result in the first leg, it will be an advantage to be playing the second leg at home.' Everton club ambassador Ian Snodin confidently targeted overall victory in the competition. He told Sky Sports News HQ: 'We want to ideally win the tie in the first leg but we know we've got the advantage of being at Goodison in the second leg. But we know it's going to be difficult so the boys have got to go out there and perform. 'Spectators have travelled in their thousands to Lille and to Wolfsburg and the players are enjoying it, but first and foremost you want to win the competition. Everton need some silverware, it's been a long, long time.' Feyenoord coach Fred Rutten said: 'This is a tough draw. Roma have a good team and are second in Serie A for a reason - that says all you need to know about the strength of our opponents. 'This match is an attractive one, but the only thing that counts for me is that we will go out to win. We play away first so we have to take care to get a good result there.' Ajax counterpart Frank de Boer was pleased to see his side paired with their Polish opponents. 'My first reaction is that the draw could have been much worse,' he said. 'That does not mean I underestimate Legia Warsaw, but just look at the other strong teams we could have drawn, like Dynamo Moscow, Zenit or Napoli.'","Liverpool have been drawn with Besiktas in Europa League last 32 .

"A chilling letter written by serial killer Dennis Nilsen in which he coolly analyses the murders he committed and brands himself a ‘creative psychopath’ was revealed today. Nilsen explains his ‘overwhelming desire to kill’ in the never-seen-before document, written shortly after his arrest in 1983 for killing and dismembering a string of young men at two homes in London. He tells in the unpublished letter how he longed to be caught for his crimes - which involved luring men to his home, strangling them, dissecting their dead bodies and then disposing of the parts. Serial killer: Dennis Nilsen (pictured in 1993) explains his 'overwhelming desire to kill' in the document . And he claims he got a kick out of reviving some of his victims instead of killing them. The letter was written on March 24, 1983, six weeks after his arrest while he was awaiting trial in HMP Brixton. Its existence was unknown until a collector listed it for sale with Fraser Autographs in central London. Little is known about how the letter entered private hands, but it has been verified by experts and is now expected to fetch £1,000 when it goes under the hammer this Thursday. In the letter, titled Mental Condition Notes, Nilsen claims he did not know why he was compelled to kill his 15 victims and attempt to murder a further eight over a five-year period. Notes: The first page of serial killer Nilsen's letter. Click on the bottom right to see the enlarged version . He said: ‘I have felt that since my . teenage days that I am a creative psychopath. Since I have committed 15 . killings and 8 attempted killings I feel able to go further on this self . assessment. 'I have felt that since my teenage days that I am a creative psychopath' Dennis Nilsen . ‘In times of . acute emotional pressure and under the triggering influence of spirits . i.e. alcohol, usually dormant mental forces have been released which . have made mine the actions of a destructive psychopath.’ Nilsen, a civil servant, carried out the vile killings at 195 Melrose Avenue and 23 Cranley Gardens in the Muswell Hill area of north-west London between 1978 and 1983. His victims were all young men between the ages of 14 and 30. After killing them, he would ritually wash their bodies before dissecting them. Musings: The second page of the letter. Its existence was unknown until a collector listed it for sale . He wrote: ‘The greater the beauty (in . my estimation) of the man, the greater was the sense of loss and grief. Their dead naked bodies fascinated me but I would have done anything to . have them back alive. 'Their dead naked bodies fascinated me but I would have done anything to have them back alive' Dennis Nilsen . ‘At . least three of the attempts I managed to revive and felt like I had . actually saved their lives. These successes brought great happiness to . me. I couldn’t understand why I had apparently tried to kill them in the . first place.’ He also claimed that he felt remorse for killing his last victim, 20-year-old Steven Sinclair. He . said: ‘I still have a warm affection for him and would have wanted to . help him with his drug problem, look after him and sleep with him. Murdered: Two of Nilsen's victims in London were Kenneth Ockenden (left) and William Sutherland (right) ‘I would have liked to have a long and close social and sexual (normal sexual) relationship with him. I did not like to see him suffer. 'At least three of the attempts I managed to revive and felt like I had actually saved their lives' Dennis Nilsen . ‘After his death I washed him and when I laid him naked on the bed there was a conciliatory comfort in seeing him at peace.’ Nilsen pleaded not guilty to the killings but was found guilty after a two-week trial at the Old Bailey. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years, but it was upgraded to a full life tariff in 1994. Now 68, he is serving out his sentence at Full Sutton in East Yorkshire, the jail where ‘Britain's most notorious prisoner’ Charles Bronson is also held. Investigation: Police digging up squared off sections of the garden of 195 Melrose Avenue in Muswell Hill, north-west London, searching for remains of murderer Nilsen's victims in February 1983 . Dr Philip Best, an expert at Fraser Autographs, said: ‘This extraordinary document gives a fascinating insight into one of the more intriguing British criminals of the last 50 years. 'His self analysis is ruthless and he has a forensic coolness in his description of his crimes' Dr Philip Best, Fraser Autographs . ‘Nilsen wrote it days after his arrest and even at this early stage it shows him seeking to understand and explain how he came to be one of Britain’s most notorious serial killers. ‘He is approaching what he had done and trying to understand it with a degree of self examination that is not common among criminals of his kind. ‘His self analysis is ruthless and he has a forensic coolness in his description of his crimes. Nilsen’s very measured approach to his crimes is shocking because how could one take such an approach to such atrocities? Tie, rope and knife: Exhibits from the trial of Nilsen, as seen in 1983. He was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 25 years, but it was upgraded to a full life tariff in 1994 . ‘In this letter we see Nilsen setting out the template for the position he has kept for the last 25 years. Nilsen was remarkably open to trying to understand his own psychopathy. 'Nilsen’s very measured approach to his crimes is shocking because how could one take such an approach to such atrocities?' Dr Philip Best, Fraser Autographs . ‘Even though he expresses remorse it is questionable how deep that remorse goes. The letter has come to light after a member of the auction trade was offered it and brought it to us. ‘Its history before that is murky but it is 100 per cent genuine. It is unmistakably Nilsen’s writing and the tone of the letter is in keeping with his style. ‘It’s pure, classic Nilsen and has never been published before. I think this will appeal to a collector with an intellectual interest in Nilsen.’","Chilling self-appraisal from 1983 sees Nilsen coolly analyse his murders .

"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren again said this morning that she's not running for president, regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016. 'You know, I'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance. That's what I'm in this fight for, and I'm in this fight all the way,' Warren told NPR today during an interview to discuss her latest battle to keep in place reforms that rein in Wall Street. The left-wing darling was careful not to say that she was 'never' running, however, leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she's letting on publicly. If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ultimately decides not to take a second go at higher office, Warren's supporters hope she'll pick up the torch. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, right, is pictured here with Rep. Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, at a press conference last week to express their outrage that a huge, $1.1 trillion spending bill put forward by the Republican-controlled House contains changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that regulates complex financial instruments known as derivatives . Warren led the charge on Capitol Hill last week against a provision in the $1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that would roll back restrictions on financial institutions passed in the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill. In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor that has been characterized as a career-defining moment for the freshman legislator, Warren ripped the rider as a measure that 'would do nothing for the middle class, do nothing for community banks, do nothing but raise the risk that taxpayers will have to bail out the biggest banks once again.' 'So let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi[group]. I agree with you Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces,' she said, directing her anger at the multinational banking group whose lobbyists are credited with authoring the offending measure. 'Instead of passing laws that create new bailout opportunities for too big to fail banks, let's pass...something...that would help break up these giant banks,' she said. Continuing, Warren said, 'Enough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have seen in the executive branch. 'Washington already works really well for the billionaires and the big corporations and the lawyers and the lobbyists. 'But what about the families who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings the last time Citigroup bet big on derivatives and lost? What about the families who are living paycheck to paycheck and saw their tax dollars go to bail out Citi just 6 years ago?' she asked. Warren said that lawmakers were sent to the nation's capitol 'to fight for those families,' and it 'tt is time - it is past time' for them to start living up to that mandate. While she ultimately failed to convince a majority of her party to oppose the bill and it passed both chambers of Congress, the move set alight new calls from the left for her to compete for the presidency in next year's contest. The left-wing lawmaker, beloved by progressives for her unwavering commitment to holding big banks accountable and fighting for laws she believes will benefit the middle class, comes nowhere close to earning the support of Clinton in polls of Democratic voters. Warren often trails party frontrunner Clinton by 40 or more points. Hard-core Warren supporters believe that 'Hillary fatigue' could create an opening for their icon to seek and win the Democratic nomination, however. Even if Clinton does continue to track well, the Warren wing of Democratic Party wants the Massachusetts Senator to enter the 2016 horse race to force the party to the left on marquee issues. In a statement released by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee today, the organization's co-founder Stephanie Taylor said 'it is time for Democrats to remold the party around Elizabeth Warren's big economic populist ideas -- like breaking up ""too big to fail"" banks, expanding Social Security, and making college way more affordable.' 'The way for Democrats to inspire the public is to give Americans the debate about big ideas that we deserve -- and that means following Elizabeth Warren's lead,' she said. Former Secretary of State and 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton is pictured here at a press conference today. Clinton has not announced her intentions to run for president yet, but she is widely expected to do so in the coming months. Either way, Warren supporters believe their candidate should enter the race. Of specific concern to Warren's supporters is Clinton's cozy relationship with financial institutions. As a candidate for office in the past, Clinton accepted funds from wealthy financiers progressives believe are responsible for the 2008 financial meltdown. Since leaving the Obama administration last year she's collected checks in excess of $200,000 a piece from some of the same institutions who benefited from government bailouts six years ago while on the speaking circuit. Progressives fear that Clinton won't be an effective check on the big banks currently lining her pockets if elected to office and have fiercely advocated on behalf of alternative candidate Warren. 'I’d love to see [Clinton] match [Warren’s] talking points in terms of the economy, just reforming Wall Street,' Nick Moe, a political activist from Alaska told Politico over the weekend during a progressive gathering in Washington, D.C. 'She’s [Clinton's] been absolutely silent as the Dodd-Frank legislation is being rolled back. Where was she?' he continued. In off-chance that Warren changes her mind and does decide to run for higher office next year, a group of Democratic operatives has set up a political action committee called Ready for Warren to collect information on probable supporters that it can then pass on to Warren's official campaign if she jumps in the race. The Ready for Warren operation mimics the strategy of a similar group set up in Clinton's name. The movement to draft Warren has gained steam in recent weeks, as several other possible presidential candidates' self-imposed deadlines to announce their intentions draws near. At the same time Warren's latest stand against big banks on Capitol Hill has the political class buzzing as the move put her in direct opposition to the White House. As support for the massive appropriations bill to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year waned last Thursday, the Obama administration came out in favor of the compromise legislation and strongly urged Democratic lawmakers to do the same.

The White House made clear that it too was unhappy with the provision of the bill that eliminated restrictions on Wall Street but warned that Democrats would likely end up with even less preferable legislation if they forced the issue. 'This is ultimately not a difference over the value of the provision, it’s a difference -- at least among Democrats -- over the strategy,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Friday. 'The President is certainly sympathetic to those who say this is a terrible provision...the President himself has concerns about the provision and opposes it,' Earnest explained. 'But the President did make a strategic decision about the wisdom of signing the agreement that was before him, as opposed to kicking the can down the road and trying to broker an agreement in which Republicans had more leverage,' he said. In January when the new Congress convenes Republicans will outnumber Democrats in both legislative chambers, giving them the upper hand until the next set of federal elections, two years from now. Warren acknowledged the difficult position the White House found itself in when considering whether to back the legislation in her interview with NPR today and conceded that approving the legislation was ultimately the correct call. 'You know, once the House passed an omnibus bill with this in it and threw it over to the Senate — and then the House left town — at that point, there was very little choice but either to pass the omnibus, even with this thing in it, or shut down the government,' she said. 'And we didn't want to shut down the government.' Sticking by her principles, though, she derided the provision's supporters for the way they went about making changes to the regulatory system. 'I know for sure that this shouldn't be slipped into an omnibus spending bill — a bill that must pass in order to keep the government open,' she said. 'And what it means, if this works, is they can just kinda keep slipping grenades and attach them to, you know, must-pass spending bills, and pretty soon we have no financial regulations at all,' she warned.","' I'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance.

"Hostages caught in Sydney's 17-hour terror siege have revealed how some of them managed to escape when the gunman's back was turned. Before the siege in Sydney's Martin Place came to a dramatic end, the world watched as individuals and small groups emerged from the premises with terror in their eyes. At first it was thought the self-styled sheikh Man Haron Monis had released them, but it was later confirmed that they fled when he dropped his guard. Scroll down for video . Chilling warning: Gunman Man Haron Monis told hostages he would start killing them if they tried to escape in 'an eye for an eye' after five captives managed to get free, including cafe worker Elly Chen . Five hostages escaped hours before the final showdown with police left two hostages and the gunman dead . Their brave escape prompted an angry response from Monis, who threatened to take 'an eye for an eye'. A 19-year-old who was being held captive rang The Daily Telegraph newspaper to tell of his ordeal and relay the gunman's demands. 'If someone else runs, someone dies,’ the terrified young man quoted Monis as telling his captives. The hostage described the moment Monas, 49, who was charged with ordering the killing of his ex-wife, put a gun to his head and told him to broadcast his demands to the media. The hostage crisis was confirmed to have ended at 3am Tuesday morning after seven hostages fled the cafe . At approximately 2.10am on Tuesday morning the crisis ended dramatically, with police using live ammunition and stun grenades to disorient the gunman and attempt to rescue the hostages remaining inside the building . ‘I have had a shotgun put at my head and all (he) wants is (the demands met). We are all afraid. I don’t think you need to have ever had a shotgun placed at your head,’ ‘Yes we do need help, but that will only happen if demands are met. We have been treated very well,’ he said. The call came after five of up to 20 hostages taken when Monis stormed the cafe around 9.30am on Monday managed to escape out of a fire door. Hours later, at shortly after 2am on Tuesday morning the crisis ended dramatically, with police using live ammunition and stun grenades as they stormed the cafe moments after six of the remaining hostages made a break for it and appeared outside the cafe. Police confirmed that at least two people had been killed in the extraordinary operation. Police confirmed that at least two people had been killed in the extraordinary operation . Reason reported that Monas became enraged when several of his captives bolted out of the small Sydney cafe this afternoon . Sheikh Monis was confirmed dead, and another hostage is believed to have been killed during the crisis. Earlier on Monday night, Seven Network reporter Chris Reason had been live tweeting the hostage’s ordeal from his vantage point inside the Seven newsroom in Martin Place. Reason reported that Monas became enraged when several of his captives bolted out of the small Sydney cafe this afternoon. The Daily Telegraph reported that the hostages attempted to flee when they saw a moment of opportunity, and were not released by Monis as originally believed. 'The gunman became extremely agitated and started shouting (the moment they escaped). I'm assuming that, I must confess,' Reason told ABC radio.. 'They would have all been a bit more calm, hands on heads (if they had been let go). This was a sheer bolt for freedom.' Elly Chen was one of the few to escape in the early hours of Monday afternoon, fleeing into the waiting arms of the Police Rescue squad. Sheikh Monis (above), a self-proclaimed spiritual leader, was killed during the hostage crisis . The siege came to a dramatic and bloody end when police stormed the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place . The 22-year-old barista and student was the fifth hostage to escape, followed by one of her colleagues. As photos emerged of the hostages pressed up against the window of the Lindt Café, Reason tweeted that he was so close he could see the redness in their eyes as they sobbed. 'We can see the faces of hostages - pained, strained, eyes red and raw,' he tweeted, noting that one of the hostages had their 'head in their hands'. The explicit and detailed demands of Monis were made via messages to the hostage’s loved ones and statuses posted on social media, which revealed disturbing details of Monas’ mindset. Three videos were posted onto YouTube, showing three women reciting demands Monas had instructed them to deliver, for Prime Minister Tony Abbott to speak directly to the self-style Islamic leader. A video showing a middle-aged woman standing in front of the makeshift ISIL flag revealed another innocent person caught in the middle of the terrifying situation. Seven Network reporter Chris Reason had been live tweeting the hostage’s ordeal from his vantage point inside the Seven newsroom in Martin Place . As photos emerged of the hostages pressed up against the window of the Lindt Café, Reason tweeted that he was so close he could see the redness in their eyes as they sobbed . ‘The brother has looked after us all, we are very tired, we’ve got pregnant ladies in here and sick and elderly and the very, very young staff who deserve to have a decent normal life,’ the woman said. The unidentified woman said that Monis was standing right next to her, and that she couldn’t say anymore out of fear of ‘compromising myself and my fellow hostages.’ She made a heartfelt plea at the end of the video asking the police and the Australian public, ‘Get us the hell out of here please.’ Throughout the day members of the Australian public were reporting posts from friends and loved ones held hostage inside the café requesting that Monis’ demands be met. The posts warned that there were other bombs hidden in the city, in streets surrounding Martin Place, and that there were two other ‘brothers’ in control of the detonation of the devices if the requests were not met. Channel Nine was contacted by several hostages inside the café, and reports surfaced of family members being contacted by loved ones. Mel, the mother of an apprentice plumber, told Radio 2GB's Ray Hadley she received a message from her son saying, 'Mum, I'm in the Lindt chocolate cafe in Sydney. 'My heart just dropped,' she told Hadley, who says he has had three telephone conversations with a terrified hostage inside the shop. 'I sent him a text message saying, ""What's going on, are you OK?"" He said, ""I'm OK mum, can't talk.' 'I haven't heard anything since,' the woman said late on Monday afternoon.","Details have emerged from inside the hostage crisis in central Sydney cafe .

"The Premier League's three remaining sides in Europe's top club competition found out who they will face in the Champions League last 16 on Monday. Arsene Wenger will go toe to toe with former club Monaco, after expressing his wish to see Arsenal line up against the French side. Meanwhile Chelsea and Manchester City face harder opposition in Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona respectively. Real Madrid will defend their crown against Roberto Di Matteo's Schalke. Host commentator . And we finish with Basel vs Porto. Yawn. That's a decent morning for the English sides I'd suggest. Arsenal have a dream draw, while Chelsea say they wanted PSG. Manchester City shouldn't really be fearing Barcelona this season, although that is the most daunting draw of the three. DRAW IN FULL . PSG vs Chelsea . Manchester City vs Barcelona . Bayer Leverkusen vs Atletico Madrid . Juventus vs Dortmund . Schalke vs Real Madrid . Shakhtar vs Bayern Munich . Arsenal vs Monaco . Basel vs Porto . So here is the confirmation of Arsenal playing either Monaco or Porto, and it is Wenger's past employers. Shakhtar... get Bayern Munich!!! What a morning for Arsene Wenger! Brilliant news for Arsenal fans. Schalke up next... ... and excellent news for Arsenal as Real Madrid will face the Germans. Bayern still in the hat. Here are Juventus. And they play Borussia Dortmund. Nice one for the hipsters, you'd suggest. 'All big games at this stage,' Infatino says before Bayer Leverkusen are drawn out. Brilliant, you can't make that up. And the Germans face Atletico Madrid. Big game, that. Eh? No? Now Manchester City are drawn... AGAINST BARCELONA!!! Manuel, I am so sorry. Martin Demichelis can't wait, by the way. PSG ARE OUT FIRST... ...Chelsea? It's who Mourinho wanted? And yes it is! Chelsea! They've gone on and on about the specifics behind the convoluted rules of the draw, but here we go! It's on! The camera has just panned to Pavel Nedved, looking resplendent as ever and politely clapping as Infantino continues with the tantalising rubbish. Meanwhile - and make sure you're sitting down for this - Riedle says his 1997 triumph with Dortmund was the highlight of his career! BULLSEYE! Liverpool fans, come and have a look at what you could've won. Infantino will conduct the draw alongside Giorgio Marchetti and ambassador 1997 winner Karl Heinz-Riedle. There's plenty of guff being spewed over in Nyon at the moment. I shan't bore you with the details. Bayern Munich, Schalke, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen make up a quarter of the draw. Infantino said: 'I don't think we should be surprised. Germany are the world champions and they perform very well. Four very strong teams, even if some aren't performing in the Bundesliga.' The final is in Berlin, of course. 'It's quite a simple draw in the sense that the group winners play against the runners-up. There are two additional conditions: teams of the same country or in the same group can't play each other.' Solid enough. 'We're at the real heat of the competition. It's felt here at the draw. There are eight nationalities represented with six former winners.' There are many ways for Arsene Wenger to defend his record at Arsenal: two 4-1 wins in a week are a fair start. Specious claims about the Champions League, however, are not. ‘Since I arrived we have played over 180 Champions League games,’ Wenger said. ‘You will see that before then they didn’t play too many.’ There are a couple of guesses as to who Arsenal might get flying around the office. The most popular suggestion is they'll probably be drawn against Bayern Munich. Sod's law, but you wouldn't be surprised. I'm not sure whether Chelsea are going to be overly bothered who they get today. Juventus and PSG are the toughest tests in the unseeded pot - Mourinho said he actually wants the latter - and the Blues should breeze through. They've been imperious all year. Basel, Bayer Leverkusen and Shakhtar make up the sides quaking in their proverbials. Schalke escape. As an aside, City can't face Bayern Munich, while Arsenal are exempt from a going over by Dortmund. They both avoid Premier League leaders Chelsea, too. There will be a few nervous directors in Nyon, not least those from the Etihad and the Emirates. Arsenal and Manchester City are both here because they finished twice in their groups and have the great and the good of European football waiting for them, including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. Oh, plus Monaco and Porto. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

"Jose Mourinho is used to winning at Chelsea - and his record as boss is so impressive that he has become the quickest ever to reach 400 Premier League points. During his two spells at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho has been in charge of 174 matches, racking up 401 points in the process. His latest victory was against Hull City - 2-0 on Saturday with Eden Hazard and Diego Costa scoring the goals.

To see the full table of Premier League managers to reach 400 points, scroll down. Sir Alex Ferguson took 191 games with Manchester United to reach the 400-point milestone, while Arsene Wenger hit the same mark after 208 matches with Arsenal. Rafael Benitez (209 matches), Gerard Houllier (235), Kenny Dalglish (235) and David O'Leary (255) follow behind the Premier League's three most-successful managers. Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge saw him win the Premier League title in 2005 and 2006 - his first two seasons in charge of the Blues - before leaving in 2007.

"Liverpool are set to face Turkish side Besiktas in the Europa League after failing to qualify for the Champions League last 16. Celtic have been handed the mouthwatering prospect of a two-legged affair against 1967 European Cup final opponents Inter Milan in the last 32 of the Europa League. The Lisbon Lions beat the Italians 2-1 on the night of the club's greatest ever achievement. Tottenham and Fiorentina also play each other, while Everton have the easiest draws of the British teams, against Swiss side Young Boys. Host commentator .

And Celtic vs Inter Milan. The east end of Glasgow should be a little bit lively for that one! That's a repeat of some final in 1967. And now Tottenham are into the draw. Inter or Fiorentina left, and it's the latter. Horrible draw. Liverpool! Besiktas! They won't fancy that trip whatsoever! PSV out of the hat, with some big names left... and it's AVB's Zenit, who won the competition at the Etihad in 2008. Just over halfway through, and here are Roma. Against Feyenoord! Ace draw! Villarreal - who beat Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Sunday - host Salzburg in the first leg. Guingamp, in their first last 32 draw, face... Dinamo Kiev. Very beatable. Trabzonspor are with us, playing against Napoli. Feisty! Olympiacos. Nobody will want to go there. Dnipro are the unlucky ones. Anderlecht - who've dropped out of the Champions League - next. Dynamo Moscow will be their opponents. Camera pans to Alexey Smertin, who is very much all smiles. Denmark's Aalborg now, and they'll come up against Club Brugge. Similarly uninspiring. Ajax are out now, vs Legia Warsaw. Not a classic. Hello, here are Nicklas Bendtner's Wolfsburg. Against Nani's Sporting Lisbon. Battle of the Premier League flops. Reigning champions Sevilla are next out of the hat. Borussia Monchengladbach. Now it's Torini, who face... Bilbao. Tasty draw for the purists, that one. Young Boys out first... and they play EVERTON! Evertonians should be absolutely delighted with that. 'After this epic moment of the technical explanation,' Infantino starts. Erm... yeah, well epic. JERZY DUDEK'S IN THE HOUSE!!! How will Liverpool fare? 'Well, they can no longer compete for the Champions League...' he says. Alright, don't rub it in. We're sitting through a lovely montage of goals and action from the group stage, but I'd rather they got on with it. Right, Infantino's spiel has begun! 'May I extend my congratulations to all of the clubs who have made it to the round of 32,' he says. Bet they're well chuffed with that. It'll be interesting to see how our clubs treat this competition from now on. With the exception of Tottenham, they've struggled domestically and may see this as their real chance of a bit of silverware.

"After crashing out of the Champions League and then losing 3-0 at arch-rivals Manchester United, it's been a week to forget for Liverpool. The Reds' last two matches have been a microcosm of their season so far. After playing a brand of swashbuckling football that saw them close to winning the title last season, Brendan Rodgers' side now look devoid of ideas and lacking in a killer instinct up front. Sportsmail's Dominic King assesses where (and why) things have gone so wrong at Anfield this campaign. 1. What is the minimum Liverpool must achieve this season? The expectation from Fenway Sports Group back in the summer was to retain their place in the top four and secure another adventure in the Champions League. No matter how bad the team's form has been, there will not be reassessing of goals from FSG. They have to get back in the Champions League and whether they do it by finishing in the top four - or winning the Europa League - is immaterial. Brendan Rodgers cut a forlorn figure as his Liverpool side dropped to 10th in the Premier League on Sunday . Rodgers says his players are honest, and will keep working hard to get results as the season goes on . 2. Will they take the Europa League seriously? And can they realistic compete on two fronts (Thursdays and Sundays)? For reasons outlined above, they cannot doing anything other than take it seriously. It might actually be their best chance of qualifying for the Champions League, plus winning a European trophy would be a positive for their reputation. They have the numbers to compete with a Thursday-Sunday schedule but whether they have the quality is another matter entirely. Liverpool will have to juggle playing on Thursdays and Sundays after they dropped into the Europa League . The Reds were knocked out of the Champions League after drawing 1-1 at home to Basle . 3. Who had final say on signing the players Liverpool bought in the summer? The manager. For all the talk of the transfer committee, the policy Liverpool follow and their preference for buying young, unproven talent, the buck always stops with Rodgers. He might have different ideas sometimes to those on the committee on certain players - the other members are Michael Edwards (head of analysis), Dave Fallows (head of scouting), Barry Hunter (chief scout), Ian Ayre (chief executive) and Mike Gordon (FSG board member). But he doesn't have players imposed on him. This is what he said on May 28 earlier this year. 'We will never bring in a player here who the manager doesn’t want in. That’s a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club. We work very closely together – it’s worth stressing that. It’s key that we are very much one club.' Summer signing Lazar Markovic (far right) was sent off in Liverpool's draw against Basle . 4. Why does Rodgers think Raheem Sterling can play centre forward? Sterling has speed and scored 10 goals last season. He was also prolific during his time as an academy player and on the opening day of the season, he actually combined well against Southampton, scoring the opening goal of the campaign from a central position. On that day, remember, it was being said that he and Daniel Sturridge could form a new 'SAS' partnership. Sterling had a bad day in front of goal against Manchester United. If had taken his opportunities - which he should have done - Rodgers decision to deploy him in that role would have been vindicated. Winger Raheem Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United up front . Mario Balotelli (left) and Sterling cut dejected figures as prepare to kick-off after conceding at Old Trafford . 5. How embarrassing are the purchases of Mario Balotelli and Dejan Lovren? Nobody was saying Lovren was an embarrassing purchase in July when he arrived for £20m but his start has been a calamity. He looks an accident waiting to happen every time he goes on the pitch and Rodgers' assertion that Lovren was the natural replacement for Jamie Carragher looks hopelessly misguided at present. As for Balotelli, Liverpool actually improved when he came on at Old Trafford but what you see with him is what you get. He isn't a 20 goal-a-season man, he isn't someone who will set the tone with relentless working and he is always liable to command a negative headline. The experiment needs to be ended sooner rather than later but which club would take him? Dejan Lovren (left) and  Balotelli have both disappointed since joining Liverpool this summer . Balotelli (right) came on as a second half substitute but failed to find the net again in the league for the Reds . 6. Which players do LFC need to buy in January? They need a goalkeeper, a top-class central midfielder and a striker. In an ideal world, Petr Cech would be the keeper but Chelsea are reluctant to do business with Liverpool any longer in the transfer market. He is also 32, which would be a negative in terms of his possible recruitment. Liverpool have a striker, Divock Origi, on loan at Lille but there is little chance of him arriving at Anfield next month. It would also be unfair to expect an untried 19-year-old (who is currently struggling himself in France) to transform the season. Chelsea keeper Petr Cech would be an ideal signing for Liverpool but the Blues are reluctant to sell to Anfield . 7. Are funds available… and will Rodgers be trusted to spend it? There isn't a great deal of money available but they could be creative by raising funds by, say, selling Fabio Borini. A more pertinent question is, which players would want to come in January with Liverpool's form being so wretched? Fabio Borini (left) could be sold in January to help raise funds for the club's other transfer targets . 8. How bad are the dressing room issues? Liverpool have just been knocked out of the Champions League, they have no chance of winning the Barclays Premier League and their form has been awful - no dressing room in the world would be happy given those circumstances. There has been huge change in recent months in terms of personnel and the spirit of last season has not yet been recreated. Perhaps they need a night out to clear their heads but, at the minute, there is no opportunity in the calendar. The amount of games they are playing is relentless. Liverpool will look to captain Steven Gerrard to turnaround a fractured dressing room . 9. Will Steven Gerrard stay? Still too early to answer that question. Gerrard will make his decision in his own time. If he stays at Liverpool, it will because he believes he can still contribute next season. The Liverpool captain  (right) contract at the club runs out this summer and hasn't put penned a new one yet . 10. Is John Henry’s trigger finger twitching? Henry remains the most well known of Liverpool's owners but he is not as hands on as he used to be. He has only tweeted twice about football matters since March 30 - once was to commend a victory over Tottenham, the other was a picture of Liverpool fans in Boston on July 23 - and the key FSG figures are Tom Werner, Liverpool's chairman, and the influential Mike Gordon, who is most involved in day-to-day business. FSG have faith in Rodgers and they will back him because he is their man. They are an organisation, though, that will not shirk away from making decisions and Rodgers knows he must turn things around. Patience is not limitless when results are bad and money is at stake. Rodgers still has the full support of Liverpool's owners including  John W Henry (centre)","Liverpool lost 3-0 at bitter rivals Manchester United on Sunday .

"For fourth-grade teacher Mary Deshaies, it was the scariest thing she had ever faced. As she walked her class back from an outing to the beach a gang of thugs suddenly attacked them shouting racial slurs and hurling rocks. Two of the little girls in her care -  one black and one white - were hit in the head by the barrage of stones. Others panicked and ran as she tried to protect them. One of the boys attempted to defend her. 'Don't you hurt my teacher,' he yelled at the assailants. Now, nearly 30 years later Mary Belmonte, as she is now known, is having to relive the incident. For one of those louts was a teenage Mark Wahlberg and now he is begging for an official pardon for his actions on the mean streets of Boston's Southside. Scroll down for video . Lesson learned: Mary Belmonte, formerly Mary Deshaies, agrees that Mark  Wahlberg should receive the pardon from outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick — although she would like a face-to-face apology from the man who turned from a racist street tough into one of Hollywood's hottest actors of his generation . Mean street: The intersection of Bay St. (in foreground) and Maryland St. in Dorchester, Massachusetts where fourth grade students and their teacher were reportedly accosted by the teen trio of Mark Wahlberg, Derek Furkart and Michael Guilfoyle. The teens reportedly yelled racial epithets and threw rocks as the school children walked back to their school from an outing with their teacher in 1986 . Belmonte agrees that Wahlberg, 43, should receive the pardon from outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick — although she would like a face-to-face apology from the man who turned from a racist street tough into one of Hollywood's hottest actors of his generation. '""I'm sorry"" goes a long way,' Belmonte told MailOnline in the kitchen of her home in Westwood, a leafy commuter town 15 miles southwest of Boston. 'But I am one who believes in forgiveness.' It was the last Monday of the school year in 1986 at Mather Elementary in Dorchester, Massachusetts — the country's oldest public school — when Mrs. Deshaies decided to take her kids out for a treat, an hour or so playing on the sand at Savin Hill Beach. 'It was a lovely, warm June day,' she remembered. Her class of 32 children was predominantly African-American despite the local area being a working-class white stronghold. 'It was the days of busing. There were just three white kids.' As the grade schoolers walked to the beach, one boy, Jesse Coleman, became agitated. He saw Wahlberg and two other teens on the street. Just the day before the same trio had attacked Jesse, his brother and his sister. The older boys had chased the siblings on their mopeds, chanting: 'Kill the n*****! Kill the n*****!' according to court papers. One of the boys yelled: 'We don't like black n*****s in the area so f*** off out of the area.' Wahlberg has appealed to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick for a pardon. Wahlberg breached the judgment related to the elementary class incident when he got in trouble again two years later, attacking two Vietnamese men in another race-motivated attack, hitting one with a stick and punching the other in the eye . Back in the day: Marky Mark (Mark Wahlberg), rapper and actor, circa 1991, five years after the attack . Clippings: Over the years retired school teacher Mary Belmonte has saved news clippings of now-Hollywood celebrity Mark Wahlberg's early brushes with the law and of his recent successes . 'Jesse said those are not very nice people,' said Belmonte — who reverted to her maiden name after a divorce. 'He told me the names they had called him. I said don't pay any attention to them.' It was on the way back, as they walked up Bay Street, passing a nursing home, that things got ugly as they once again ran into Wahlberg, then 15, and his two cohorts Michael Guilfoyle, 15, and Derek Furkart, 13. according to court papers. 'Several kids said: ""They're calling us names."" I tried to hurry them up,' said Belmonte. But Wahlberg's group joined up with a gang of other boys hanging out on the street and the older boys picked up rocks and started throwing them at the terrified pre-teens. 'There were seven or eight other boys, all around the 13-15 age group,' she added. 'These were rocks they were throwing, not pebbles, but rocks.' Students Kristyn Atwood and Emily Harr were both hit in the head by the missiles. Atwood, now 38 and living in Georgia, told the Boston Globe she does not think it is fair that Wahlberg should get his conviction overturned and 'make it seem like it never happened.' Eventually an ambulance driver who was just leaving the nursing home came to the teacher's aid, court records show. 'He managed to block them with his ambulance so we could get on back to school,' said Belmonte, now a 68-year-old grandmother. 'It was very frightening.' When the class returned to school, Belmonte reported the incident. One of the children recognized Wahlberg as both went to the Colonel Daniel Marr Boys Club. Police opened an investigation, but it wasn't until August 1986, two months after the June 16 attack, that arrests were made. The cases against Wahlberg and Furkart were settled by consent judgments, under which they agreed never to harass the teacher, Atwood, Coleman or Harr or their families. In court, Guilfoyle claimed the injunction should not apply to him as he was a juvenile. However his case was thrown out. He appealed and lost again. Brave: Mary said she was also pleased to hear that Michael Guilfoyle (left)  had put his past behind him and is now a lieutenant with the Boston Fire Department. When approached by MailOnline, Guilfoyle declined comment . But Wahlberg breached the judgment when he got in trouble again two years later, attacking two Vietnamese men in another race-motivated attack, hitting one with a stick and punching the other in the eye. For that offence Wahlberg, the youngest of nine children, was sentenced to three months in jail, but served 45 days. It is for the conviction for those 1988 assaults that the actor is requesting a pardon from Governor Deval Patrick. As MailOnline reported exclusively last week, one of the men, Johnny Trinh - who was known at the time as Hoa Trinh - said he forgives the megastar, and Wahlberg has now invited him to fly to Los Angeles from his new home in Texas for a face-to-face meeting. Belmonte said she too would like to meet Wahlberg to hear an apology. 'The kids were really frightened,' she said. 'I grew up on the streets of Boston, an Italian living in a largely Irish area, and I was called all sorts of names. You say it, I've heard it. 'I wasn't afraid to go anywhere, but once they started to throw rocks at little children, I got scared. I was thinking how nothing had changed since I was a child, people would still call you names just because of the way you look.' The attack took its toll. 'I could never take another group to the beach,' said Belmonte. 'I felt I could never put other children at risk.' Belmonte first discovered that one of her attackers had become famous when a Village Voice reporter contacted her in 1993 for a story he was writing on the young rapper and Calvin Klein underwear model 'Marky Mark'. Mather Elementary School in Dorchester, the country's oldest public school . Retired teacher Mary, with her partner Nick Fiorentino at their home in Westwood, Massachusetts, recounts the day the teen trio attacked her class . 'I had heard of Marky Mark and of course I knew the name Mark Wahlberg from the case. But I didn't realize they were one and the same person,' she said. 'Everyone should be forgiven at some point,' she added. 'Mark Wahlberg has really made something of himself and he should be commended — lots of kids in his situation would have ended up in jail.' She said she was also pleased to hear that Guilfoyle had put his past behind him and is now a lieutenant with the Boston Fire Department. When approached by MailOnline, Guilfoyle declined comment, stressing that the attack on the school group had occurred when he was a juvenile. Belmonte said she is happy that Wahlberg — who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in Martin Scorsese's 2006 movie 'The Departed' — has reached out to Trinh. 'I'm really glad about that. It really shows a lot,' she said. Her partner of 17 years, retired construction supervisor Nick Fiorentino, 70, added: 'I'm ready to forgive him. But it is all very well for him to stand up on television and say he is sorry. He really should go to the people he terrorized — like Mary — and say sorry to them personally. 'A personal apology means a lot,' added Fiorentino.","Mary Belmonte tells MailOnline how a class outing to play in the sand turned into a nightmare for her mostly African-Americans students .

"These photographs taken by shocked travellers aboard a Thai AirAsia flight reveal the dramatic moment a female flight attendant was scalded with hot water by an unruly passenger. The female passenger, from China, attacked the flight attendant with a cup of noodles in a violent row that began when she found out that she wouldn't be sitting next to her boyfriend on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China. Passengers pulled out their smartphones as the mid-air drama unfolded in front of them, snapping pictures as the injured flight attendant covered her face and shouted in pain. Scroll down for video . Photos posted on the Weibo social-networking website show a flight attendant covering her face . The flight attendant received first air from her co-workers while the plane returned to Bangkok . Noodles are pictured on the floor of the aircraft after they were thrown at the female flight attendant . Additional photos show noodles all over the floor of one of the aisles and, once the plane landed, authorities boarding the aircraft to restore order and remove the passenger and her entourage. The cabin erupted in chaos after the flight attendant was berated and splashed with hot water - even after a cabin crew member helped the couple change seats. During the chaos a man believed to be the woman's boyfriend jumped out of his seat and angrily threatened to blow up the plane as the injured flight attendant was tended to by her co-workers. But the man accused of making the threat later said the attendant was scalded by accident during a tussle over a receipt they had requested for the hot water. A passenger captured a video of an angry man after a flight attendant was scalded with hot noodles . Passengers suffered a five-hour delay after the pilot decided to turn around and fly back to Bangkok . Authorities boarded (right) and ordered the unruly passengers to leave as others snapped photos . As a result the pilot decided to abort the 90-minute journey to eastern China and return to the airport in Bangkok, where the plane made an emergency landing. One of the photos that emerged on the Weibo social-networking website shows a man carrying a girl through the cabin while being escorted by authorities. At the airport, airline staff spoke to the woman and her entourage and they all came to an 'amicable' agreement, although the group was forced to return home on a different flight. The U-turn led to a five-hour delay for other travellers. The air rage incident has gained worldwide attention and led to the Chinese travellers being called 'barbarians' by China's state-run media. A man carries a girl through the aircraft cabin after authorities boarded the plane in Bangkok . Thai AirAsia flight attendants plead for calm after one of their colleagues was assaulted . But that will be the least of their concerns as Chinese authorities vowed to severely punish the group for giving Chinese tourists a black eye. In a scathing statement, China’s National Tourism Administration said the tourists disrupted the flight, hurt other passengers and ‘badly damaged the overall image of the Chinese people.’ The Jiangsu Provincial Tourism Bureau told the South China Morning Post that they had asked the provincial tourism association to blacklist the rowdy group. It is not known what penalties those on the blacklist will be subjected to, but the tour guide who led the group has had their licence suspended for a year. The passengers were reportedly ordered to pay 50,000 Thai baht (approximately £970) in compensation to the injured flight attendant. The woman who threw the cup of hot water and noodles was fined an additional 200 Thai baht (approximately £3.80). The cabin erupted in chaos after the flight attendant was berated and splashed with hot water . Thai AirAsia says the passenger berated the female flight attendant before scalding her with hot water . Friday's incident comes at a time when the Chinese are travelling more but also becoming notorious for rough behaviour. More than 100 million people from China have travelled overseas this year, more than any other country. Incidents involving Chinese tourists making angry outbursts have prompted Beijing to issue stern guidelines on behaving abroad. In February, according to Thai and Chinese news reports, 27 members of a Chinese tour group were ejected from a China Eastern Airlines flight before take-off from the Thai resort island of Phuket after brawling over seating arrangements. During a recent visit to the Maldives, President Xi Jinping asked the Chinese not to litter and destroy coral reefs.","Thai AirAsia flight was en route to Nanjing, China from Bangkok .

"A Democratic congressman accidentally accused Eli and Peyton Manning of sexually assaulting their wives while attempting to answer a question about a real sexual assault case involving a National Football League player from his home state. Asked by a reporter about allegations that Tennessee Titans player Sammie Hill sexually assaulted an Atlanta, Georgia, woman earlier this month, Rep. Steve Cohen professed ignorance on both the case and on football generally. 'I never heard of him. I don’t keep up with football, except college football, except Eli Manning or Peyton Manning,' he said. 'And Eli and Peyton don’t do sexual assaults against people other than their wives.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dem Rep. Steve Cohen is pictured here at a news conference last year on Capitol Hill. Cohen is under scrutiny this week for accidentally accusing NFL starts Eli and Peyton Manning of sexually assaulting their wives . Cohen made the gaffe while responding to a question from a reporter about sexual assault charges levied at Tennessee Titans player Sammie Hill . After TMZ published a video of the encounter, the Tennessee lawmaker's office said he 'misspoke' and does not think that the NFL players mistreat their wives. 'Congressman Cohen misspoke, abhors sexual violence of any kind, is a fan of both Manning brothers, and deeply regrets any confusion,' a spokesman for legislator said. 'His intention was simply to indicate that Eli and Peyton are in committed, monogamous marriages.' Hill has been accused by the Atlanta police of sexually assaulting the woman in question on Dec. 2. Last week an lawyer for the NFL star said it is a 'completely bogus charge.' 'Sammie did absolutely nothing wrong. We are cooperating fully with the Atlanta police investigation. I expect there to be no charges brought when the truth is known,' attorney Ed Garland said, according to ESPN. New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning, 33, has been married to his wife Abby, with whom he has two children, since 2008. His elder brother, Peyton, a 38-year-old Denver Broncos quarterback, has been married to his wife Ashley since 2001. The couple also has two children. Cohen, 65, is a four-term member of Congress who recently survived a reelection challenge after finding himself at the center of a paternity test scandal last year. The unmarried Congressman was memorably caught telling a 24-year-old model over Twitter that he loved her during the the president's State of the Union address in 2013. In response to the incident the congressman revealed that she was his out of wedlock daughter. Months later a paternity test showed that Cohen was not in fact the girl's father as he had been led to believe for the past three and a half years, a development he called 'stunning.' Still, Cohen easily kept his seat in November's midterm election, beating his Republican opponent by more than 50 points.","Made the gaffe while attempting to answer a question about sexual assault charges levied at Tennessee Titans player Sammie Hill .

"Director Cameron Crowe's latest star-studded film isn't due out until May and it's already being deemed a flop by Sony Pictures executives, hacked emails reveal. The romantic comedy - which still doesn't have a title - has big Hollywood names attached. It stars Bradley Cooper as a military contractor who falls in love with an Air Force officer played by Emma Stone. Rachel McAdams, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, John Krasinski and Danny McBride have all signed on to play supporting characters, as well. Scroll down for video .

'We have this movie in for a lot of dough and we better look at that,' Pascal writes. Her assessment of the movie - which was formerly called 'Deep Tiki' - was based on a series of test screenings that Sony did with audiences in New York City and Huntington Beach, California - a Los Angeles suburb. Pascal believes that even red-hot names like Bradley Cooper (left) and Emma Stone (right) can't save the film from a problematic script . 'Scores are same as last time and way way worse in ny,' Pascal writes. In the film industry, making movies is a financial gamble. Some are blockbusters, some are box office flops that don't break even. It seems Pascal is anticipating that Crowe's new film will be a flop before it's even released.

'I'm never starting a movie again when the script is ridiculous. And we al (sic) know it. I don't care how much I love the director and the actors. It never. Not even once. Ever works.'

She was charged with sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust or authority. Last Wednesday, she pleaded guilty to one count of fourth-degree rape, Delaware Online reported. But on Monday, the 23-year-old escaped jail after being sentenced to 18 months' probation by Superior Court Judge, Robert B. Young. She must also register as a Tier II sex offender. Following her sentencing, reporters attempted to contact Seabury at her family home. A man who answered the door told them to call her lawyer, before adding: 'She's innocent.' Guilty: Seabury, who had taught English at the school since August last year, turned herself into police on April 28. Above,  the Long Island, New York, native is pictured leaving the police station after handing herself in . According to police, investigators contacted officials at Fred Fifer III on March 13 - a day after the boy complained of being assaulted at Seabury's apartment in the 1300 block of S. Farmview Drive. Staff confirmed that the victim was one of Seabury's students. While working with police, they also located the surveillance footage showing the pair leaving the school together on the day of the rape. 'It was a very highly inappropriate relationship,' said Dover Police Corporal, Mark Hoffman, last week. 'Especially with a 13-year-old and a 22-year-old, and, of course, being a teacher.' Seabury, a Long Island, New York, native and University of Delaware graduate, has also been ordered to have no contact with either the victim or other children.

"She's more used to convincing others about her interest in world peace and environmental protection. But this former Miss Great Britain is now pleading for something a lot simpler altogether - a willing housemate. Stunning underwear model Sophie Gradon - who dated rugby star Danny Cipriani in 2013 - has taken out an advert to try and find the perfect would-be flatmate. Scroll down for video . Could this be the UK's most attractive housemate? Former Miss Great Britain Sophie Gradon is looking for a new flatmate . The leggy 27-year-old from Newcastle is back on the property market after her current landlord decided to sell the property in which she lives . The leggy 27-year-old from Newcastle is back on the property market after her current landlord decided to sell the property in which she lives. Now, she has written advert on the Spare Room website about the sort of person with whom she wants to live. In the advert - entitled 'Girl about town' - Ms Gradon says she wants her future housemate to be no older than 35. And the model - who famously dumped Cipriani for being 'too boring' - makes clear that anyone who isn't sociable or fun need not apply. She wrote: 'I'm extremely sociable and love nothing more than a good night out or drink in the house on a weekend with some chilled house music, candles & good vibes. 'I'm not a serious person, I like to laugh, a lot. I have zero tolerance for complainers or negativity!' The advert, posted on the Spare Room website, is entitled 'Girl about town' - said Ms Gradon has 'zero tolerance for complainers or negativity' Ms Gradon, a marketing director, famously dumped rugby star Danny Cipriani after saying she 'got bored' with him . Ms Gradon had been dating the player for two months, after he split with model Kelly Brook, when she ended their relationship. At the time, she said: 'I got bored of Danny and have now swapped him for someone incredible'. In the advert- which is peppered with emoticons - Ms Gradon goes on to describe her perfect evening as cooking good meals, watching films and going to the gym. The marketing director also says that anyone who is 'positive, considerate and knows how to have fun' would be a suitable match. She says she is looking to pay £600 all in for the room. But potential suitors should expect fireworks, too. In 2010, 65 years of pageant tradition was broken when Ms Gradon failed to pass on her Miss Great Britain crown at a ceremony in Somerset. She had been banned from attending because of a row over her train fare. If you are positive and considerate and know how to have fun then we'll get along just fine :-D .

"Milan police is being forced to remove an underwear billboard because it has proven to be too distracting for drivers. The advertisements featuring Argentinian-born model and presenter Belén Rodríguez will be taken down after residents complained that they were jeopardizing road safety in central Milan. One of the billboards show the 30-year-old seemingly removing her underwear and another sees posing seductively on a bed. Dangerous curves: This Milan billboard featuring model  Belén Rodríguez is set to be taken down . Shortly after the billboards advertising an Italian underwear brand went up, residents began complaining that they were 'a serious danger for vehicular circulation'. A local residents committee referred the road safety complaints to police and authorities are now set to tear down both the billboards. Ms Rodriguez herself said the campaign was 'sensual, but elegant', and denied that the images, which are several storeys high, would cause crashes, The Times reports. This is not the first time an underwear billboard has been cause for concern for road safety. The iconic Wonderbra 'Hello Boys' billboard advertising campaign featuring Eva Herzigova was blamed for a slew of traffic accidents when it premiered in 1994. No risk: Argentinian-born model and presenter Belén Rodríguez said the campaign was 'sensual, but elegant', and denied that the images would cause traffic problems . Iconic: The 1994 Wonderbra billboard featuring Eva Herzigova was blamed for a slew of traffic accidents . A 1993 H&M campaign featuring the late Anna NIcole Smith proved so distracting to drivers in Norway that it had to be banned. A 2013 study by researchers at the University of Alberta found that risque billboards really can cause traffic accidents as drivers dramatically alter their speed depending on the kind of billboard they are passing. The say even the wording of giant roadside advertisments can have a dramatic effect on driver's speed. 'Driver distraction is estimated to be one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents,' the team say. 'However, little is known about the role of emotional distraction on driving, despite evidence that attention is highly biased toward emotion.' In a driving simulation study carried out on University of Alberta students, researchers Michelle Chan and Anthony Singhal found that drivers passing signs with negative words such as abuse, stress, prison or war, tended afterward to slow down and drift from their lane. Drivers passing signs with positive words like cash, fame, sex and win did the opposite, speeding up on the simulated road.","Underwear billboards will be taken down from building in Milan .

"'Killer': Sylvia Majewska, 65, allegedly killed her 29-year-old son and his daughter in November . A 'controlling' grandmother accused of slicing her mentally-disabled son's throat before beating his seven-month-old daughter to death had previously fought a bitter battle to keep him away from his wife, court records show. Documents reveal the startling - and ultimately successful - lengths that Sylvia Majewska, 65, went to to keep Daryne Gailey, 29, away from Amanda Hendrick after they started dating in the mid-2000s. Other records, revealed by the Detroit Free Press, show that Majewska, an artist from Oxford, Michigan, also dragged her ex-husband and neighbors through the courts. Last month, she allegedly sliced her son's throat with a box cutter while he was in bed before fatally beating his daughter, Charley Lillian Hendrick, and then attempting to take her own life. But she was alive when authorities went to the home on November 23 - after Gailey failed to return his daughter to her mother - and was taken to hospital, where she was arraigned. She was released from hospital on Tuesday and is now on suicide watch in the Oakland County Jail. While she has not yet been interviewed, authorities previously said they believe she carried out the killings because she thought her son, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures, and his baby daughter would be better off dead. She had long tried to stop Gailey's relationship with his baby's mother and feared that the former couple would rekindle their romance and go on to have more children, one attorney involved in the case told the Free Press. Split: When her son, Daryne Gailey (right) married Amanda Hendrick (left) last year, she refused to go to the wedding and sought an annulment after. She was legal guardian of Daryne, who had learning difficulties . 'Daryne loved Amanda, and he wanted to be with her,' said attorney Thomas Brennan Fraser, who was appointed by the courts to oversee Gailey's financial affairs. 'He wanted to be married to her. There was nothing to keep him from disappearing and marrying her again, and Sylvia was never going to let that happen.' Before she allegedly took his life, she had repeatedly intervened in their relationship. Gailey fell in love with Amanda Hendrick in the mid-2000s. She had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to court documents. On learning about their relationship, Majewska filed motions in in Oakland County Probate Court to become her son's legal guardian, along with his father, Andrew Gailey, the Free Post reported. She also insisted that he draft a will and leave out Hendrick and any children they might later have, and leave his home to her instead, records show. Murdered: Gailey's neck was sliced with a box cutter while his seven-month-old daughter, Charley Hendrick, had been beaten to death when they were found killed inside his mother's home on November 23 . Loss: Baby Charley, left and right with her mother Amanda, was found tucked up in her crib after she died . Majewska refused to attend their August 2013 wedding and then promptly filed motions to have the marriage annulled, the Free Press reported. When that bid failed, she sought a divorce. She also sought a personal protection order against Hendrick, claiming she had physically assaulted her son - which Hendrick and Gailey both denied. It was granted but later lifted. Fraser, the attorney, said that as Gailey's relationship continued, his mother became 'very, very angry' - to the point that he was worried for his staff's safety. He would only meet her in the courthouse after she had gone through metal detectors, he said. Just 17 days after the divorce was granted, Majewska allegedly killed her son and granddaughter. Other, earlier records also show that she repeatedly took her neighbors to court and also divorced her husband - Gailey's father - within weeks of sharing $1 million he had inherited. She claimed half the money was hers, records show. As their divorce and custody battle waged on, she also claimed her ex-husband abused her son during visits, which he denied. Ultimately, her ex-husband allowed his wife to take control of their son's affairs, Fraser said. 'Controlling': Majewska, an artist, also accused Amanda of acting violently towards her son, which she has denied. Other records show she dragged her husband and neighbors through the courts . 'It was just to hard to go up against Sylvia,' he said. In the hours before she allegedly killed her son, she mailed an annual accounting of her son's progress to the courts, as is legally-required. She wrote that her son was 'much improved' because 'that manipulative woman is gone' and said that 'his family relationships have stabilized'. By the time the courts received the document, her son was already dead. Gailey and his baby were found dead by authorities carrying out a welfare check on November 23.They found Charley tucked up in her crib, dead from blunt force trauma to the head, and discovered her father in the bathroom with a deep laceration from a boxcutter to his neck. Majewska was on the couch with her arms slit and was 'bleeding into a bucket', Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told the Detroit Press said. The box cutter was nearby. Bouchard said Majewska 'came to the conclusion that the son and the child would be better off if they weren't alive'. Scene: Authorities found the bodies after Gailey failed to return his daughter to her mother in November . Bouchard said investigators found several handwritten notes and other documents in the case. They found a new baby seat with a receipt, suggesting Majewska was planning to return it, police said. Authorities added that she was apparently a controlling mother to her mentally impaired son. 'We certainly have information that she was an angry woman and a controlling woman,' he said, citing surveillance video showing the mother and son's interaction inside a store before the murders. 'She was very much in charge, berating him, in that encounter in the store,' he said. Gailey had worked as a clerk at a Kroger grocery store in Lake Orion for 15 years, employees said. They told the Free Press that he 'had a big heart'.","Sylvia Majewska 'sliced her son's neck with a box cutter, beat her granddaughter to death and then tried to take her own life in November'

"It may come as a surprise to the houseproud and 'clean freaks' among us but the kitchen sponge is one of the dirtiest places in the home - 200,000 times dirtier than a toilet seat. And it is not just harmless bacteria lurking on your cleaning cloths and utensils. Experts have linked germs found on sponges, cloths and chopping boards with a bacteria which can cause paralysis. Friend or foe? Far from being a tool to clean your home, the sponge could be making it dirtier and more dangerous . The Hygiene Council advises all cloths, sponges and towels should be washed above 60C to kill germs or they should be disinfected regularly. An alternative would be to use disposable antibacterial wipes to discourage the spread of bacteria . Clean and disinfect the kitchen work surfaces and chopping boards with antibacterial sprays and wipes . As hands are the main route of transmission of germs during food preparation try not to touch items in the kitchen with dirty hands . Thorough hand washing with soap and water at key times during food preparation is essential to help prevent foodborne illness at home . Good home hygiene habits are essential and regular cleaning and ‘targeted disinfection’ of all surfaces that are regularly touched such as door handles, taps, switches and bin lids can help to reduce the spread of germs around the home . Some experts recommend microwaving dish cloths and sponges to kill germs instantly . A new study has found there are around . 10million bacteria per square inch of a kitchen sponge and a million per . square inch on a dish cloth. And you would be better off chopping your vegetables on a toilet seat than on a chopping board when it comes to germs, scientists have claimed. Dr Charles Gerba, professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona, leads studies on how diseases are transferred through the environment. His work involves swabbing household items and measuring the type and growth of bacteria. He told the BBC the toilet seat is one of the cleanest things you'll run across in terms of micro-organisms. But he said we should be more worried about other household items, such as sponges, dish cloths, and reusable shopping bags. Professor Hugh Pennington, one of . Britain’s leading microbiologists, agreed the kitchen and in particular . the sponge was among the dirtiest places in the home. He told MailOnline: 'It would be fine to use the sponge to wash up with, wiping food off the plates in hot water, but never, never use a sponge to wipe a plate clean. 'There is a science to this sort of thing, and it's not rocket science. There is a certain amount of common sense.' Prof Pennington said one of the biggest targets for the Health Protection Agency was a bacteria called campylobacter - which can cause paralysis and is commonly found on kitchen sponges. He said: 'It is naturally occurring and comes from poultry. 'It can cause something called Guillain-Barre syndrome. Dirty truth: A new study has found there are around 10million bacteria per square inch of a kitchen sponge and a million per square inch on a dish cloth . 'It doesn't affect your thinking or feeling, but it can spread to the peripheral nerves around the brain and effect movement. A Hygiene in the Home Study tested 180 homes in Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, UK and US . Bathroom seals caused most concern, with 70per cent failing bacterial tests . Fridge interiors came second - more than 40per cent of homes failed tests on bacteria and mould build-up . Kitchen towels were found to be unsatisfactory or unacceptably dirty in 36per cent of homes . Cleanest surface tested was pushchair with only six per cent failing bacterial tests . 'People can be effectively locked in.' In the majority of cases, people will get better, but recovery can take weeks, months or years. 'Always the dirtiest thing by far is the kitchen sponge,' adds John Oxford, professor of virology at the University of London and chair of the Hygiene Council - the body that compares hygiene standards across the world. In its latest study the council examines samples from homes in nine different countries, and finds that 21per cent of 'clean' kitchen cloths actually have high levels of contamination. The study identifies faecal bacteria in other places around the home, and this varies from one country to another. According to the study Saudi Arabia has the dirtiest fridges, with 95 per cent of the fridges in the study failing the bacteriology test for E.coli. In South Africa, the dirtiest item is the bath seal, with almost two-thirds with concerning levels of E.coli and 40per cent for mould.","There are 10million bacteria per square inch of a kitchen sponge and 1m per .

"A Bronze Age skeleton found buried with one of the earliest bronze daggers in the UK was an important warrior chief who bled to death in combat, experts have revealed. The virtually-complete skeleton, dating back more than 4,000 years, was found on farmland in the hamlet of Racton, near Chichester, West Sussex, in 1989. Its background has long been a source of intrigue to historians because the skeleton - nicknamed Racton Man - was found with an extremely rare and valuable dagger. Warrior chief: The Bronze Age skeleton found is thought to have been a high-ranking warrior chief who died in combat, experts claim. The virtually-complete skeleton dating back more than 4,000 years was found on farmland in the hamlet of Racton, near Chichester, West Sussex, in 1989 . He was buried lying on his left side, clasping the dagger in front of his face. The dagger was decorated with tiny studs that would have glistened in the light. Technological advances have enabled experts from to scientifically analyse the mysterious male's teeth, bones and dagger to help piece together some of the details of who he was. At the Novium Museum in Chichester, where the skeleton and the dagger is now on display, specialists unravelled the mystery of Racton Man by revealing their findings for the first time. Site excavator and planning archaeologist, James Kenny, said he was at least 45 years of age at the time of his death, and was a 'big man' who was at least 6ft (182cm) tall. Mystery: The skeleton - nicknamed Racton Man - was found with an extremely rare and valuable dagger. At the Novium Museum in Chichester, where the skeleton and the dagger is now on display, specialists unravelled the mystery of Racton Man by revealing their findings for the first time . Rare: Dr Stuart Kenny, a Bronze Age specialist who pulled together the research, said the dagger had a rare rivet-studded hilt, and it would have gleamed. It was not ceremonial as it had been sharpened for battle . Racton man was over the age of 45 when he died. He was a 'big man' who was at least 6ft (182cm) tall. He grew up in southern Britain, possibly around modern-day West Sussex. He was buried with one the earliest bronze daggers ever found in the UK. The dagger had a rare design but was not ceremonial as it had been sharpened. He was a man of extremely high status  was almost certainly a warrior chief. Racton man suffered from a number of conditions including spinal degeneration, a sinus infection and tooth decay. He had an unhealed sword cut near his elbow which probably caused him to bleed to death. The warrior died between 2300BC and 2150BC. But it was the discovery of a dagger alongside him that set him apart from ordinary members of society. and someone who was probably a tribal leader, Mr Kenny said. 'To start with, the fact that this man had a bronze dagger would have been phenomenally rare then, let alone now,' said Mr Kenny. 'This would have been right at the start of the introduction of this type of technology and would have been one of the first bronze daggers in existence in this country. 'There are so few burials back to the early Bronze Age, especially in the Chichester region. 'It's also rare to find such a distinctive burial that has been archaeologically excavated.' Mr Kenny added: 'He was a man of extremely high status buried with an extremely rare dagger and he was almost certainly a warrior chief.' Dr Stuart Kenny, a Bronze Age specialist who pulled together the research, said the dagger had a rare rivet-studded hilt, and it would have gleamed like gold. He added: 'Its design is distinctively British, but of greater significance is the fact that it dates to the transition from copper to bronze metallurgy. 'This dagger is bronze and so this item would have been incredibly rare at the time. Its colour and keen hard edge would have distinguished it from the more common copper objects in use. Decay: Racton man was over the age of 45 when he died. He was a 'big man' who was at least 6ft (182cm) tall. Racton man suffered from a number of conditions including spinal degeneration and tooth decay . Fighter: Racton man had an unhealed sword cut near his elbow that probably caused him to bleed to death. Radiocarbon dating of the remains by the Scottish Universities Environmental Research centre in Glasgow show he died sometime around 2150BC to 2300BC . Tribal leader: Twenty-three years after the skeleton was found in Racton, archaeologists have discovered his rare dagger was the oldest bronze object ever found in . 'We don't understand the social structure of this time, but he would have been a very prominent member of society, someone of great seniority.' Isotope analysis of Racton Man's teeth at Durham University suggest he could have been brought up in southern Britain, possibly somewhere west of Sussex. Radiocarbon dating of the remains by the Scottish Universities Environmental Research centre in Glasgow show he died sometime around 2150BC to 2300BC. And analysis of his bones suggest he had spinal degeneration, thought to be age-related. He also suffered chronic sinus infection, and an abscess, with tooth decay. Experts also discovered signs of a cut to Racton Man's right upper arm bone, close to the elbow, and which had not healed. It suggests he had his elbow bent above his head to protect it from a blow or strike from a weapon during combat, according to historians. Bronze Age beads (left) in Denmark matched the blue glass found in Tutankhamun's death mask (right) Another recent Bronze Age discovery this week unearthed previously unknown trade routes for glass between Egypt, the Middle East and Denmark. The discovery was made after Bronze Age beads found in Denmark matched the blue glass inlays found in Tutankhamun's gold death mask. Twenty-three blue beads unearthed in an Ølby grave, south of Copenhagen, were analysed using a technique known as plasma-spectrometry, . The method allowed researchers to analyse the fragile bead and compare the chemical composition of trace elements with material from Amarna in Egypt and Nippur in Mesopotamia. The comparison showed that the chemicals matched exactly, marking the first time that Bronze Age Egyptian and Middle Eastern cobalt glass has been found outside the Mediterranean area. Researchers from the National Museum in Denmark and the Institute of Archaeomaterials Research in France say the latest study shows that as well as amber, Denmark and Egypt traded glass 3,400 years ago . They also believe it links two ancient sun cults, based on the fact that sunlight is able to penetrate the surface of both amber and glass.

"Melting ice from the coast of Greenland could make a much bigger contribution to rising sea levels than was first thought. Scientists believe a previously overlooked side-effect of global warming - the formation of lakes on top of glaciers - could greatly increase the rate of melting of the vast Greenland ice sheet. Previous predictions said Greenland would contribute eight inches (22cm) to global sea levels by 2100, but the new findings   indicate this figure is significantly too low. University of Leeds researchers say sea levels could rise more quickly. They say lakes on top of glaciers - called supraglacial lakes - could cause Greenland's ice (shown) to slip into the sea more rapidly. This will increase Greenland's contribution to sea levels above the eight inches (22cm) predicted by 2100 . The ice in Greenland covers 656,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometres) - an area three times the size of Texas. If all the ice melted and flowed into the sea, oceans around the world would rise by as much as 20ft (six metres), causing extensive damage to coastal communities. While such a disaster is not expected to happen, ice losses from Greenland were predicted to contribute eight inches (22cm) to global sea levels by 2100. But the new findings related to lakes formed from melted ice and snow indicate that this figure is off the mark. Scientists have created a new type of ice that could help geologists better understand the planet’s inner workings, as well as combat climate change. Named Ice XVI, it is the least dense of all known forms of ice and has a delicate cage-like structure that can trap gaseous molecules. These molecules can be anything from methane to carbon dioxide, and are contained in ‘clathrate’ cages beneath the sea floor. By uncovering the intricate structure of these clathrates, scientists hope they can use it for carbon capture and storage, by removing methane from the sea floor and replacing it with CO2. Scientists at University of Göttingen in Germany and the Institut Laue Langevin in France suspected that the structure of an empty clathrate may look like, but up until now it was hypothetical. The study shows that as Arctic temperatures rise, Greenland will develop a rash of these 'supraglacial' lakes, expected to spread much further inland. By 2060, the amount of land they cover could be double what it is today. One key effect the lakes have, once they reach a critical size, is to drain through fractures in the ice to reach the ice sheet base. Like a lubricant, the lake water causes the melting ice to slide more rapidly into the ocean. The lakes also have a direct impact on ice sheet melting because, being darker than ice, they absorb more of the sun's heat. Lead researcher Dr Amber Leeson, from the University of Leeds' School of Earth and Environment, said: 'Supraglacial lakes can increase the speed at which the ice sheet melts and flows, and our research shows that by 2060 the area of Greenland covered by them will double. 'When you pour pancake batter into a pan, if it rushes quickly to the edges of the pan, you end up with a thin pancake. 'It's similar to what happens with ice sheets: the faster it flows, the thinner it will be. 'When the ice sheet is thinner, it is at a slightly lower elevation and at the mercy of warmer air temperatures than it would have been if it were thicker, increasing the size of the melt zone around the edge of the ice sheet.' Shown here is a supraglacial lake in Alaska. These form on top of glaciers and can cause ice to slip into the ocean more quickly, leading the scientists to predict that Greenland may contribute more to rising global sea levels than previously thought . Shown here is a simulated distribution of supraglacial lakes in 2050 to 2060 under projections of climate change. Coloured shapes indicate new lakes that appear in each scenario. Likely subglacial drainage pathways are indicated in blue, highlighting how much additional ice could be dragged into the water . The scientists based their findings on observations of the ice sheet from Esa satellites and predictions of future ice melting from a climate simulation model. Until now, supraglacial lakes have been restricted to a 62-mile (100km) wide low-lying band around Greenland's coastline. At higher elevations further inland it has been too cold for lakes to form. The new results suggest that warmer temperatures will cause the lakes to spread up to 68 miles (110km) further inland by 2060, doubling the size of the area they cover. Dr Leeson added: 'The location of these new lakes is important; they will be far enough inland so that water leaking from them will not drain into the oceans as effectively as it does from today's lakes that are near to the coastline and connected to a network of drainage channels. 'In contrast, water draining from lakes farther inland could lubricate the ice more effectively, causing it to speed up.' Supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet can be seen as dark blue specks in the centre and to the right of this satellite image. The scientists based their findings on observations of the ice sheet from Esa satellites and predictions of future ice melting from a climate simulation model . The research is published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the multi-institution Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), who is also from the University of Leeds, said: 'Because ice losses from Greenland are a key signal of global climate change, it's important that we consider all factors that could affect the rate at which it will lose ice as climate warms. 'Our findings will help to improve the next generation of ice sheet models, so that we can have greater confidence in projections of future sea-level rise. 'In the meantime, we will continue to monitor changes in the ice sheet losses using satellite measurements.'","University of Leeds researchers claim sea levels could rise more quickly .

"Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle want state delegate Joe Morrissey to resign but he may commute to work soon from jail as part of a work-release program. Morrissey began serving a six-month jail sentence on Friday after accepting a plea deal in a criminal case that could have sent him to prison for 41 years. Prosecutors said he engaged in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female office assistant, who is now pregnant, and sent a naked photo of her to a friend. Part of the evidence against him, which he read to reporters on the courthouse steps in July, was a text allegedly from his young paramour to a third-party, reading: 'OMG, I just f***ed my boss.' He claimed the photo and the text messages were planted by a 24-year-old female named Brittany McKinney who grew jealous after the now-18-year-old college freshman rejected her lesbian advances.

The 57-year-old has seen his law license suspended and revoked, has paid a $500,000 judgment to a man he brutally beat in 1999, lost a job teaching law in Australia for hiding his disbarment, and earned his nickname – 'Fightin' Joe' – for engaging in a courtroom fistfight while he was a prosecutor in 1991. And the noted gun-control advocate brandished an AK-47 rifle during a 2013 debate in the Richmond, Virginia statehouse. That brought back memories of a 1994 incident when police recovered an Uzi submachine gun in from a heroin dealer – a gun that police had loaned Morrissey, then a prosecutor, for use as a prop when he spoke at schools about drugs and violence. All that was before he police found him and a teenage girl at his townhouse. Special prosecutor William Neely told the Richmond Times-Dispatch at the time that Morrissey 'had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it.' Morrissey, who has three daughters including a toddler with three different women, faced grand jury indictments on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor, possession of pornographic images of an underage female, and solicitation to obtain the images. The young woman, now 18 and pregnant, has been identified publicly by Morrissey only as 'Kayla.' She had been on the job as an assistant in Morrissey's office for less than two weeks, court records show, when he began taking her with him to official events. Both Morrissey and the younger girl denied engaging in sex, and her mother and grandmother both backed her up. At the time he was charged with the felonies, Morrissey vowed that there was 'not a snowball’s chance in hell' that he would resign his House of Delegates seat. That hasn't changed, even though he sits in a county jail. Morrissey entered what's known as an Alford plea on Friday, acknowledging that the government had sufficient evidence to convict him of a single misdemeanor charge. He did not admit any specific wrongdoing. His 6-month sentence will likely be over in just 90 days if he maintains good behavior behind bars. And a judge has approved a work-release arrangement that would allow him to leave the jail with an ankle-monitor in order to perform his official duties for 10 hours each day. Some of Morrissey's colleagues are howling. Republican Delegate Gregory Habeeb tweeted on Friday that 'Joe Morrissey should IMMEDIATELY resign his seat in the House of Delegates and disappear. FOREVER!' Democrats in the state legislature are more guarded, with one telling the Times-Dispatch that they might pressure him to quit. Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, however, wants no part of him. On Saturday he called for Morrissey's 'immediate resignation.' On Sunday the embattled lawmaker said he's asked his lawyer to examine the Virginia Constitution to see what his options are. He's also planning to sue his accusers, including Special Prosecutor William Neely, who persuaded a Grand Jury to indict him in 2013. Neely unsuccessfully opposed the reinstatement of Morrissey's law license in 2011, claiming he 'completely lacks any moral compass' and engaged in 'notoriously unethical practices.' That opinion came with a litany of evidence. He landed two fists on the face of a flamboyant defense attorney during the 1991 courtroom brawl, landing in jail. In 1993 the Virginia State Bar Association yanked his license to practice law after he was indicted on a bribery charge. That case concerned his decision to dismiss a rape charge against a defendant whose father allegedly paid his victim $25,000 to get himself off the hook, and another $25,000 to a list of charities Morrissey chose. Charges against Morrissey in that case were later dismissed. NOT SHOOTING STRAIGHT: Morrissey brandished an AK-47 during a floor debate about gun rights, but had earlier admitted losing track of an Uzi that law enforcement officers had loaned him for use as a prop during speeches . Five years later, his license was suspended a second time after a 90-day stint in jail for contempt of court, for tainting a drug prosecution by leaking information to reporters. A judge in that proceeding banned him from arguing cases in court for two years. In 1999 Morrissey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after physically assaulting a home contractor. According to a legal brief filed by the home contractor's attorneys, Morrissey shouted, 'I'm going to kill you. I'm going to beat your head in,' before beating the victim and 'smash(ing) his head into the corner of a brick wall.' In 2002 the victim won a judgment against him in civil court, which he paid off with a $500,000 check in 2007, The Daily Caller reported. But Morrissey wasn't as diligent with his community-service sentence: A court found he tried submitted phony documentation showing how many hours he had worked off, and sent him to jail for another 90 days. The bar association 'disbarred' him for that offense, tearing up his law license permanently – but relented a decade later and reinstated him in 2012. But meanwhile, Morrissey made headlines for losing his job teaching law in Australia when authorities there learned of his disbarment in the U.S.","Joseph Morrissey's decades-long legal career includes a disbarment that he hid from clients – and from an Australian university where he taught .
Last year he was arrested for allegedly sleeping with a 17-year-old office assistant and sending a naked picture of the now-pregnant girl to a friend .
Both denied a sexual relationship despite mounting evidence of time they spent together; he claimed a hacker planted photos and texts on his phone .
One text, allegedly from the young girl, read: 'OMG, I just f***ed my boss.'
'Fightin' Joe' Morrissey got his nickname from a 1991 courtroom fistfight during his years as a prosecutor .
In 2007 Morrissey paid a man $500,000 to settle a court judgment against him for a separate 1999 physical assault ."
"A woman who was held hostage by a gunman in the terrorist siege at Sydney's Lindt cafe was forced to record a chilling video message by her captor with a list of demands. Marcia Mikhael, who works as a Westpac executive, also warned via social media that Iranian-born gunman Man Haron Monis was 'threatening to start killing us' as she huddled with 17 other terrified hostages inside the Martin Place cafe on Monday afternoon. Ms Mikhael, 42, was one of several hostages forced to stand in front of a black Islamic flag and relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman who she referred to as 'The Brother'. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael, who works as a Westpac executive, was forced to record this chilling video message in front of a black Islamic flag as she was held hostage in the terrorist siege at Sydney's Lindt cafe . 'This is a message to Tony Abbott. We're held here hostage and The Brother has three requests,' Ms Mikhael said in the video. She said the gunman had demanded an Islamic State flag, to speak with the Prime Minister and to let the media know of two other bombs in the Sydney CBD in exchange for hostages. 'We don't understand why these demands haven't been met yet, they are not unreasonable,' she said. Ms Mikhael, who also works as a fitness business owner, delivered a frightening eyewitness account from inside the cafe when she was also forced to post the demands on her Facebook page. 'Dear friends and family,' she wrote. 'I'm at the Lindt café at Martin Place being held hostage by a member of the ISI. The man who is keeping us hostage has asked for small and simple requests and none have been met. 'He is now threatening to start killing us. We need help right now. The man wants the world to know that Australia is under attack by the Islamic State.' After roughly 16 hours huddled in the cafe, Ms Mikhael emerged shortly before 2am on Tuesday morning carried by two emergency service workers with blood pouring down her legs . She was also forced to post a list of demands on her Facebook page saying the 17 hostages needed help . She was one of several hostages forced to stand in front of a black Islamic flag and relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman who she referred to as 'The Brother' NSW Police were aware of the social media posts yesterday, but asked the media and the public not to share them as they tried to negotiate with the gunman. Her family also called for people to include Ms Mikhael in your 'prayers not your posts'. 'Please do not share or spread any messages released by the hostages on fb as the terrorist is using them as a means of communication,' her niece, Christine Mikhael, wrote. 'This could put my aunty and the others in grave danger.' Ms Mikhael also warned in a Facebook post the gunman  was 'threatening to start killing us' as she huddled with 17 other terrified hostages inside the Martin Place cafe on Monday afternoon . After roughly 16 hours huddled in the cafe, Ms Mikhael emerged shortly before 2am carried by two emergency service workers. Despite being visibly distressed and with blood pouring down her legs, Ms Mikhael's family described her being rescued as 'the best footage on TV for 2014'. She was carried to a waiting ambulance wearing the same business suit she was pictured wearing in the chilling video. Two other hostages - a 34-year-old man and 38-year-old woman - were killed alongside gunman Man Haron Monis. The gunman first came to the attention of authorities when he started sending hate mail to the families of Australian dead soldiers between 2007 and 2009. The 42-year-old works as a Westpac executive who has offices in Martin Place where the siege occurred . Ms Mikhael's niece Christine asked friends and family not to share posts by hostages as the siege unfolded .","Marcia Mikhael, 42, was forced to stand in front of a black Islamic flag while she was held hostage at Sydney's Lindt cafe .

"A woman who was arrested for attending a football match in Saudi Arabia disguised as a man has claimed she did not know the stadium was for male fans only. The female spectator covered her hair in a hat and wore a black and white football stand as she sat in the away section of the new al-Jawhara stadium in the Red Sea city of Jiddah. However, she was reportedly spotted by security staff at Friday night's game between home side al-Ittihad and Riyadh's al-Shabab and arrested for 'impersonating' a man. Arrested: YouTube footage appeared to show a woman who was arrested for attending a football match in Saudi Arabia disguised as a man sitting on her own in the away section wearing a hat and scarf . Saudi Arabia enforces a strict segregation of the sexes, and football stadiums are out of bounds to women. However, authorities have announced plans for 'family' areas from where women can watch matches. A video posted on YouTube, which has since been removed, appeared to show the woman sitting by herself among some empty seats in a section reserved for visiting fans. A man nearby appears to be looking intently at the woman, who also sported sunglasses with her scarf in al-Shabab's black and white colours for the match, which the team won 1-0. The arrested woman, whose name has not been made public, said she bought a ticket online without any problems, and according to the state-linked Okaz newspaper, did not know women were prohibited from going to the male-only stadiums. Stadium: The woman was spotted by security staff in the away section of the new al-Jawhara stadium in  Jiddah, where she watched Friday night's game between home side al-Ittihad and Riyadh's al-Shabab . Men only: A more traditional Saudi football crowd, made up entirely of men as women are banned . Police spokesman Atti al-Qurashi said security spotted her at the stadium 'deliberately disguised' in male attire to avoid detection, according to state-linked news website Twasul. Officers reportedly questioned the woman, who is in her twenties, for 'impersonating' a man by wearing trousers, a long-sleeve top, a hat and sunglasses. Most women in Saudi Arabia cover their hair and face with a veil known as the niqab and all women are required to wear a loose black dress known as the abaya in public. Okaz reported that the woman has been in police custody since Friday and is being held at a center for girls in the western province of Mecca. No charges have yet been brought against her. Mr al-Qurashi said the presence of the woman was 'against the regulations', and said her case 'has been forwarded to the specialised authorities.' He also 'confirmed the need to comply with the instructions and regulations issued by the official authorities with regard to this matter.' Protest: Earlier this month, Loujain Hathloul, 25, from Riyadh, was arrested as she tried to drive into Saudi Arabia, where women are barred from driving, from the United Arab Emirates . Ultraconservative Saudi clerics shun female access to exercise and women's teams are not part of the kingdom's federation that oversees sports. Women often struggle to find facilities to train and are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums. However, there have been exceptions for foreign women. In October, an Australian female supporter of Western Sydney Wanderers Football Club was permitted to attend a match at Riyadh's main stadium. And in January, a group of American women traveling with members of U.S. Congress watched a local club match, also in Riyadh. Saudi women still need permission from a male guardian to work and marry, and restaurants are divided into 'family sections' with separate areas for single men. Fight: Princess Ameerah, the former wife of a multi-billionaire Saudi Arabian royal, has vowed to fight to win the right for women in the kingdom to drive . Saudi Arabia is also the only country in the world which does not allow women to drive, and those who challenge the ban risk arrest. Earlier this month, Loujain Hathloul, 25, from Riyadh, was arrested as she tried to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates. Women have been barred from driving since the establishment of the state in 1932 and earlier this year, a woman reportedly received 150 lashes after being caught behind the wheel. Protests and acts of defiance against the ban have grown in recent years, with women posting videos of them behind the wheel to social media. The last mass protest was launched in October last year, when 60 women took to the streets of Saudi Arabia driving cars and posting videos of themselves singing to Bob Marley's hit 'No Woman No Cry' with the words 'No Woman No Drive'. The ultra-conservative Salafist tradition of Islam is predominant in the kingdom, where it applies to both religious and political life. Last month, Princess Ameerah, the former wife of a multi-billionaire Saudi Arabian royal, vowed to fight to win the basic right for women in the kingdom to drive a car, telling MailOnline it 'can happen overnight'. She told MailOnline at the 5th Abu Dhabi Media Summit in the United Arab Emirates last week: 'It is my job and duty to use my power and influence to highlight these kind of issues and to try to find solutions. 'I am offered platforms to speak around the world, and I must use them to try to change things. 'I don't believe the ban will go on indefinitely. It will be like the decree calling for 20 per cent of Parliament to be made up of women – a surprising development, but one which happened very rapidly. 'I believe that it is the generation of young people in Saudi Arabia which is going to accelerate change in the country.' In June, London law graduate Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested  after she tried to watch a volleyball match at the Azadi stadium, in Tehran, Iran - which women are banned from attending. Miss Ghavami, 25, was charged with 'propaganda against the regime' – a charge that carries a possible prison term of several years, and faces trial in front of Tehran’s notorious revolutionary court.","Female spectator wore a hat with black and white football scarf .

Ms Lunsford, who runs her own legal firm Lunsford Legal Group and represents a number of inmates at the jail, has been banned from visiting any of her clients. 'We believe that there's been a false police report prepared, we have not seen the police report so we don't know what lies have been told,' Lunsford's attorney, Mary Lynn Belsher, told CBS13. 'There was nothing that happened between Amber Lunsford and her client,' said Belsher. 'Her client wants her to continue with her representation.' Ms Lunsford believes this is a retaliation after she complained about the way her client was being treated in hail. 'Smear': Ms Lunsford claims she complained about her client's treatment which prompted this backlash . 'It had to do with deprivation of health care, deprivation of proper writing utensils like paper and pencils for the inmates and the fact the inmates were being denied the opportunity to have access to their discovery delivered by the attorney so they could prepare and know what was going on in their cases,' Belsher explained. 'I think they are trying to gain an unfair advantage in court by disparaging her reputation before the court.'

"The Obama administration has confirmed that it knew within 24 hours that U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens had been killed in a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged by an anti-Islam film. The White House claimed for a week that the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was 'spontaneous' and sparked by the controversial movie, before finally admitting that  the 9/11 anniversary attack was orchestrated by terrorists. But senior U.S. officials have now confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act almost immediately after it happened, and even knew that the perpetrators had links to al Qaeda. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flames: The White House has admitted they knew the deadly assault, pictured, was an act of terrorism within 24 hours . Two unnamed officials told Fox News that the administration internally flagged the strike 'terrorism' from day one, setting off the proper protocols and mobilising resources. The government had also been informed by September 12 that U.S. intelligence agencies were hunting on specific suspect - militant Ansar al-Shariah and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, who were likely responsible for the deadly attack. 'No one ... believed that the mortars, indirect and direct fire, and the RPGs were just the work of a mob -- no one,' one of the officials told Fox. But one intelligence official clarified to Fox News there was not a 'definitive' lead on who might have been responsible for the fiery attacks in the immediate aftermath, but that officials had an idea of the suspects. 'It's inaccurate to suggest that within the first 24 hours there was a definitive calling card and home address for the perpetrators of the Benghazi attack. Potential suspects and data points emerge early on, but it still takes time to be certain who is responsible,' the official said. Deadly attack: The consulate was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks . A congressional source said some members . of the House Intelligence Committee found it 'shocking' when CIA . Director David Petraeus told them three days after the attack that . out-of-control demonstrators were responsible for the killings. Meanwhile, more than two weeks after the strike, which killed Stevens and three other Americans - the FBI hasn't been granted access to investigate in the city and what's left of the Benghazi consulate hasn't been secured, according to CNN. According to the TV station, law enforcement officials have reached Tripoli but they haven't made it to Benghazi. 'They had difficulty, and we understand there was some bureaucratic infighting between the FBI and Justice Department on the one hand, and the State Department on the other, and so it took them longer than they would have liked to get into country. They've now gotten there. But they still are unable to get permission to go to Benghazi,' CNN National Security Analyst Fran Townsend said. According to CNN, FBI agents have made a request through the U.S. State Department for the crime scene to be secured but that it has not happened. 'The senior law enforcement official I spoke to said, 'If we get there now, it's not clear that it will be of any use to us,'' Townsend said. Response: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised a full and open inquiry into the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 . Mrs Clinton, pictured earlier attending a UN Security Council meeting on peace and security in the Middle East during the general assembly . Yesterday, Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton admitted there was an explicit link between the al Qaeda network . in North Africa and the deadly attacks on the U.S. consulate in Libya, . backtracking from what the State Department had said previously. Speaking at a Security Council . meeting at the United Nations, Mrs Clinton said an Algerian-founded . branch of the al Qaeda network was situated in the area, using their . location to plan and execute attacks, like the one in Benghazi on . September 11. This . goes directly against the initial statements of the White House and . President Obama, who acknowledged that the consulate attack, which . killed Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, was a . terrorist attack but that al Qaeda’s involvement's was unclear. The secretary of state did not cite any new information to make these claims, the New York Times reported. The White House told reporters on Tuesday that President Obama now believes the assault on the embassy was the work of a terrorist attack. ‘It is our view as an administration, the president’s view, that it was a terrorist attack,’ press secretary Jay Carney said, according to ABC News. The White House said that President Obama, pictured today at Kent State University in Ohio, has now acknowledged the deadly attacks to be the work of terrorists . The administration had initially said the violent and fiery attacks were fuelled by rage from an anti-Islam film produced in Calirfornia. Mr . Carney said that 'there was no reason (the president) chose the words . he did beyond trying to provide a full explanation of his views and his . assessment that we need to await further information that the . investigation will uncover.' The government's admission comes after Libyan president Mohamed Magarief . claimed the deadly 9/11 anniversary attack on the U.S. Consulate in . Benghazi was undoubtedly a 'pre-planned act of terrorism.' President Magarief quashed the idea the assault on the consulate was . prompted by the film ', adding that he has 'no doubt' it was a . premeditated act of terrorism targeting American citizens. 'It's a pre-planned act of terrorism,' he told NBC's Ann Curry, adding that the anti-Islam film had 'nothing to do with this attack.' Terrorism: Libyan President Mohamed Magarief, speaking to NBC, said he had 'no doubt' the attack on the U.S. Consulate was pre-planned . Significant: Magarief, pictured right with Ann Curry, said the fact the attack occurred on September 11 was of great significance . The Libyan president's remarks also come as a report in The Daily Beast . claims U.S. intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that the fire . fight at the Benghazi consulate building was orchestrated by al . Qaeda-affiliates hiding in Eastern Libya. Unnamed officials said they had even tracked down the location of one suspect within this time, using social media. In . the interview with NBC, Magarief said the fact the attack occurred on . September 11 was hugely significant, and provided further evidence that . it was orchestrated by extremists rather than spontaneous protesters. He added that there were no protesters . at the consulate before the assault, which he told the TV station came . in two waves - the first involving rocket-propelled grenades on the . consulate then with mortars at a safe house. 'Reaction . (to the anti-Islam film) should have been six months . earlier. So it was postponed until the 11th of September. They chose this date to carry a certain message.' -Libyan president Mohamed Magarief . The U.S. government initially denied that the attacks were planned, instead linking them directly to protests over the film. It wasn't until late last week that the Obama administration formally acknowledged the deadly 9/11 assault was in fact a terrorist attack. Magarief said the video had been available for months before the Benghazi attack and therefore wasn't the catalyst. 'Reaction . should have been, if it was genuine, should have been six months . earlier. So it was postponed until the 11th of September,' he told NBC. 'They chose this date, 11th of September to carry a certain message.' When asked by Curry what his evidence . was that the attack was pre-planned, he said: 'Number one, is choosing . the date, 11th of September has all the significance. If we take the . facts about the way it was executed we can see there is enough proof . that it is a pre-planned act of terrorism.' Assault: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks . He said it was too early for him to give the minute details of the attack but he said the perpetrators must have had experience. 'It . was launched with a high degree of accuracy which means the . perpetrators must have some kind of exercise on how to hit and how to . launch these acts,' he said. Magarief said he thinks that al Qaeda . was behind the assault but he added there was so far no direct evidence . to prove that is the case. 'As the investigation progresses that is the likelihood we will reach that,' he said. The Daily Beast was the first to report that U.S. intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that al Qaeda-affiliated operatives were behind the deadly assault. Three separate unnamed officials told the website that early information was enough to show the attack was planned and orchestrated by groups in Eastern Libya linked to al Qaeda. They said U.S. intelligence agencies . developed leads on four of the participants within 24 hours of the fire . fight that killed Stevens as well as information management officer Sean . Smith and security personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . For one of the suspects, the U.S. agencies were able to track his location using social media within that time. 'We had two kinds of intelligence on one guy,' the official told The Daily Beast. 'We believe we had enough to target him.' Another U.S. intelligence official told the website: 'There was very good information on this in the first 24 hours. These guys have a return address. There are camps of people and a wide variety of things we could do.' A third U.S. intelligence official said he could not get into specific numbers 'but soon after the attack we had a pretty good bead on some individuals involved.' The sources didn't reveal whether the agencies had targeted or arrested any of the suspected assailants, stressing that the complex investigation was continuing.","U.S. Government privately labelled attack on U.S. Consulate a terrorist act almost immediately and knew CIA was chasing specific suspect .

He walked around to the back of the car to show Robinson the dealer tags, which would make the vehicle legally exempt from having an inspection. But Robinson arrested Vasquez for the expired sticker and grabbed his arm, to which the pensioner pulled away and raised his other arm to swat him away. Robinson then pushed Vasquez down on the hood of the police cruiser and wrapped both arms under his shoulders so the pair fell to the ground. When the cop is next seen in frame, he was yelling and holding up a stun gun. Police said the officer used the Taser on Vasquez twice while he was on the ground. 'He just acted like a pit bull, and that was it,' Vasquez said. 'For a while, I thought he was going to pull his gun and shoot me.' When other officers arrive on the scene, they ask Vasquez for his side of the story and check to see if he is injured. 'Are you hurting anywhere?' the unidentified officer can be heard asking on the video. 'Not yet,' Vasquez replies. 'Probably later on. I'm 76 years old.'

"The Skylon air breathing rocket that could power a plane anywhere in the world in four hours and get to space in 15 minutes has moved a step closer to blasting off as a major project review said it was possible to operate the plane. A feasibility study carried out earlier this year as part of the European Space Agency's 'New European Launch Service' requirements for lowering the cost of European launch services by 2014 by using a radical new type of engine, have backed the plans - paving the way for it to blast off in 2019. The engine is called Sabre, which stands for Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, and was built by British firm Reaction Engines. Scroll down for video . Reaction Engines claims Sabre can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph 'spaceplane' called Skylon (pictured) An ESA study found if it were operated from Europe's launch site in French Guiana, together with a reusable upper stage, the project can meet all Europe's launch operator requirements - and be far cheaper than any other option . The European Space Agency report, released earlier this year found: . Skylon is potentially Europe's most cost effective space access solution, and is able to compete with existing and anticipated competition. Systems reusable design has the potential to undercut any other launch system currently in operation. Once operational, Skylon could be operated independently of subsidies. Sklyon could launch payloads of upto 15 tonnes into low earth orbit. Also offer opportunities for spacecraft return, in-orbit servicing and human passengers. The €1M ESA-­funded study identified proved that all current mission requirements for launches can be met. It also said vehicles operated from Europe's launch site in French Guiana, together with a reusable upper stage, can meet all Europe's launch operator requirements. Reaction Engines claims Sabre can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph 'spaceplane' called Skylon. Now, it is believed the firm is putting the finishing touches to the plan to launch the aircraft - possibly in 2019. It has been earmarked as a 'high priority' technology project by the UK government following the favourable technical reports from ESA's propulsion experts. 'For example, an aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from Europe to Australia in about four hours,' said Alan Bond, chief engineer, in a video. The aircraft will be able to fly Mach 5 - five times the speed of sound - because of the engine, named Sabre, according to Bond. Modern-day traditional aviation engines have to carry tanks of liquid oxygen when travelling at more than 1,900mph because they can't 'breathe' oxygen. Oxygen helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion. Reaction Engine's Sabre design uses a system of pipes, filled with . helium. The air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat and the oxygen is carried to the engine. Once in space, the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode. This means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and used to launch satellites, for example. Last year the UK Government has announced plans to provide £60 million for a revolutionary new rocket enginecapable of taking people to Earth's . stratosphere in just 15 minutes. David Willetts, minister for . universities and science, said the investment in Sabre would provide support at a 'crucial stage' to . allow a full-scale prototype to be built. 'We're investing £60 million in this and we expect them to go out and find private support as well,' Willetts told Radio Five Live. The Lapcat A2, a passenger plane using the an aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from Europe to Australia in about four hours . The A2 vehicle, which is designed to be propelled by the Scimitar engine, has exceptional range (ca. 20,000 km both subsonic and supersonic) and is therefore able to service a large number of routes whilst simultaneously avoiding supersonic overflight of populated areas and the related sonic booms that can be heard on the ground. Its good subsonic performance enables it to service conventional subsonic overland routes. 'But we're backing this because it's technology that has been tested in the lab, it's been assessed by outside experts as right in principle. 'Now it needs to be built on a full-scale prototype before it can get commercial. 'We think it's right to support it through that crucial stage. A passenger version, called the Lapcat A2, is also unver development. The A2 vehicle, which is designed to be propelled by the Scimitar engine, has exceptional range (ca. 20,000 km both subsonic and supersonic) and is 'able to service a large number of routes whilst simultaneously avoiding supersonic overflight of populated areas and the related sonic booms that can be heard on the ground,' the firm says.

The weight problem means it . costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite. 'The basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high . speed it instantly heats up to 1,000C - which is unmanageably hot. 'The challenge was to cool it back down to 140C in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine.' Bond continued: '[Sabre] would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply, to build space . stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to . earth. We could even construct spaceships for missions to other . planets.' Skylon is likely to be viewed a competitor to Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic business, in which people can experience six minutes of weightlessness during a sub-orbital spaceflights. Sir Branson and his Virgin Galactic company offer trips into . space, that include six minutes of weightlessness, for around £121,000. Skylon is expected to offer similar flights for cheaper, but has not announced any prices. Figures from the company believe the Skylon space place could cut the cost of space launches by around 95 per cent. The Sabre engine has taken part in 100 successful test runs and its design was recently validated by the European Space Agency to validate the design.

"Heartless: Isabel Gloria McDaniel, 30 (pictured), stands accused of fatally hitting a  67-year-old man with her car and then continuing to drive while he was stuck on top of the vehicle . Police in Springfield, Oregon, believe a driver hit a pedestrian and fled with him on top of her car, carrying the man for half a mile before removing him and leaving him in the street to die. The Register-Guard reports that Isabel Gloria McDaniel, 30, of Veneta was arrested Saturday. She's accused of hitting both Julio Ortiz, 39, and his father 67-year-old Mexican national Daniel Ortiz-Reynaga on Thursday. Julio was only clipped by McDaniel, but his father was hit harder and the impact caused him to flip on top of the vehicle. McDaniel continued to drive for another 11 blocks before the victim was dropped. Sgt Richard Scharboneau told KMTR that officers were trying to help Julio, when the man realized his father was missing and they located him down the street. Investigators believe McDaniel  took the victim off the car and kept going. Ortiz-Reynaga was pronounced dead at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center. McDaniel was arrested without incident Saturday night, after police released a description of her vehicle, and sources led authorities to the car parked in her garage. She remained jailed Monday. Scharboneau says McDaniel is scheduled for arraignment Monday afternoon on a felony hit-and-run charge, where she may have a lawyer appointed. Police say McDaniel's 24-year-old husband, Gary Louis McDaniel, was cited for tampering with evidence. The victim's grandson, who shares the same first and last name, told KMTR that he had a happy last meeting with his grandfather, talking about a trip to Mexico the younger Daniel had to miss. He doesn't understand what would cause someone to heartlessly leave his grandfather to die. 'I would just ask them why they kept driving,' the grandson said. 'I want to know their point of view because I really don't understand.'

"Cindy Crawford's 13-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber looks like an angel modeling a pair of wings on Instagram. The image was taken by Kaia's older brother Presley, 15, and shared on the siblings' shared Instagram account earlier today. And despite her young age, fans were quick to comment how mature the teenage model appeared - with many of them suggesting that she could easily hold her own among some of Victoria's Secret's most experienced Angels. Scroll down for video . Angel in training: Kaia Gerber, 13, posted an image of herself sporting a pair of feathered wings on Instagram . Seeing double: The teenager is the spitting image of her supermodel mother Cindy Crawford (L) 'Better than a VS Angel,' one Instagram user commented, while another added: 'The soon to be Victoria's Secret Angel.' Kaia, who is the daughter of Cindy and her husband of 16 years Rande Gerber, made her fashion big fashion debut aged 10, when she appeared in the first ever Young Versace ad. The similarities in appearance between the youngster and her supermodel mother, now 48, quickly caught the attention of the industry's elite, many of whom were quick to label the youngster as one to watch for the future. At the time however, former Vogue cover star Cindy insisted her daughter would have to wait a while before throwing herself into a full-time fashion career. 'At this point, she’s too young to pursue a career,' she told The Daily Front Row. 'There aren’t even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. But if she’s 17 and wants to try it... of course, what can I say? She’s really into singing and acting. Model genes: While Kaia (R) has insisted she doesn't look anything like her mother (L), the similarities between the pair are incredibly obvious to most . 'She kind of jokingly said - I’m not even sure if it was jokingly - ""I might model first because you don’t have to know how to do anything, but then I want to be a baby nurse.""' But it seems that Cindy has since changed her mind - and is now happily encouraging her daughter's burgeoning career as a professional model. Earlier this month, the teen made her magazine debut on the cover of Teen Vogue, a move which Cindy admits she was 100 per cent in favor of. 'I’m happy for her to be happy,' she told the UK's Evening Standard. 'She’s kind of chomping at the bit and the Teen Vogue piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do. 'I am very comfortable with the photographer, who is a woman I’ve worked with a lot and is a mother herself.'",The photo of budding model was taken by her older brother Presley and posted to the siblings' shared Instagram account .

"New York Yankees player Jorge Posada has lost $11 million in a money-management scam that lawyers have branded 'jaw-dropping'. The All Star catcher from Puerto Rico, once worth $117 million, was approached by a Cuban-American duo in 1999 who targeted Latin American baseball stars. Juan Carlos Collar and Anthony Fernandez proceeded to take absolute control of Posada's finances and regularly request blind sign-offs while he was on the road, Vice Sports reported. Scroll down for video . Scam: Jorge Posada and wife Laura put Juan Carlos Collar and Anthony Fernandez in charge of their money . The full extent of their alleged conspiracies will emerge in court next year as Posada and wife Laura prepare to sue Collar and Fernandez for $11.2 million in damages. Posada did not discover the conspiracy until after he fired Collar and Fernandez, who operated under their own company Quantum Family Office Group, for unrelated reasons in 2010. An independent audit by a new company unearthed the discrepancies. According to documents seen by Vice Sports, the scams did not start until after the pair left Merrill Lynch to start up their own firm. In one dramatic misplacement of funds, reported by the New York Post, the pair put $3 million of Posada's money into a plot of land their firm owned in Florida. Posada was told they were 'developing an elite equestrian-themed community for the wealthy' that he could have a stake in. Blind sign-offs: The pair would approach Posada, a former Yankees All Star, for sign-offs on anything . Lost out: At least $3 million of his money was put into a farm in Florida that he has no legal stake in . The land is now rented by a farmer and Posada has no control over it. Posada's attorney Barry Lax told Vice Sports: 'I’ve never heard of anything like that. It’s jaw-dropping. 'They would go to Jorge and they would have a stack of documents to sign, and they would just say ""Sign here"". 'And Jorge would sign it. He completely trusted these guys with all of their finances. 'All of their money. Whatever the Posadas made went directly into their accounts with these guys. That’s the kind of trust they had.

"Laid to rest: Private First Class Anthony La Rossa was reported missing in action in 1951. His remains were finally buried next to his mother's in New York . More than 60 years after Private First Class Anthony La Rossa went missing while serving during the Korean War, his remains have been buried next to the mother who died never knowing his fate. 'It was very difficult for her,' said La Rossa's niece, Donna La Rossa, after a gravesite service at St. Charles Cemetery on Long Island, New York on Monday. 'He was only a teenager and would write in his letters home how he was missing his mom's spaghetti. She struggled the rest of her life.' His remains were buried beside those of his mother, Marie, at the cemetery in Farmingdale. 'We felt like it would be best if they were together,' Donna La Rossa said. La Rossa was just 18 when his unit, the Army's 2nd Infantry Division, was attacked in South Korea by Chinese forces in February 1951. He was reported missing in action two days later. His remains were among those turned over to the U.S. by North Korea in the early 1990s but were only recently identified. Donna La Rossa said the family kept scrapbooks of photos of her uncle, whose nickname was Buddy, but very little was known of his fate. Relatives believe he may have spent time in a North Korean prisoner of war camp; a statement from the military said reports that he died in captivity were never substantiated by any eyewitness accounts of American POWs who returned. Remembered: A soldier salutes during a graveside service for Anthony La Rossa in Farmingdale on Monday. The soldier, whose remains were only recently idenified, received full military honors at the funeral . Tribute: His niece, Donna La Rossa, receives an American flag during Monday's graveside service . Service:  The 18-year-old soldier was listed for decades as missing in action during the Korean War . After his disappearance, letters sent to him by his mother, Marie, and brother, Donald - Donna's father - were returned unanswered. Marie La Rossa died in 1976 at 73. Donald, who has also died, successfully fought in the 1990s to have Anthony La Rossa's name included on a list of casualties at the Korean War memorial in Washington. She believes it was during that time that military officials took a sample of her father's DNA that eventually helped them find a match to identify her uncle's remains. Before the burial, a funeral Mass was held at a nearby Roman Catholic church. 'I think in so many ways we're not just honoring him, but we're honoring so many, literally millions of young men and women who have time and time again stepped forward and decided they had an obligation to serve, an obligation to give back to this country they love,' said the Rev. James Lisante, pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Massapequa. About two dozen relatives and a modest contingent of veterans from the local American Legion and Veterans of Foreign War posts attended the burial service, which included an Army honor guard and drill team. Memories: Joe Krawczynski, the great nephew of Anthony La Rossa, shares a picture of La Rossa when he was eight years old during his funeral in Farmingdale on Long Island, New York on Mondy .

Somber: Mourners watch as a casket containing the remains of Anthony La Rossa is a carried out of a church during his funeral service in Massapequa Park, New York on Monday . Saying goodbye: The casket is carried out of the church to be buried beside his mother's . Governor Andrew Cuomo directed flags on state government buildings to be flown at half-staff Monday in honor of La Rossa. 'After far too many years unaccounted for, Pfc. La Rossa has finally come home,' Cuomo said. 'As we lay this brave soldier to rest, I join with all New Yorkers in honoring his service to our nation with gratitude and pride. My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and family of all service members who remain unaccounted for.' According to the Defense Department, North Korea turned over 208 boxes believed to contain the remains of more than 400 U.S. servicemen from 1991 to 1994. Today, 7,867 Americans remain unaccounted for from the Korean War. The military continues its work to identify some of the remains it received two decades ago.","Anthony La Rossa went missing while serving in South Korea in 1951 .

"Arming Syria's rebels will put guns in the hands of extremists who 'eat the organs' of their enemies, Vladimir Putin warned David Cameron last night. The Prime Minister hoped to get Mr Putin to soften his stance against Western intervention. But in an extraordinary joint press conference in Downing Street, the Russian president accused the Prime Minister and Barack Obama of trying to arm terrorists. And in a blood-curdling reference to video footage of a rebel fighter apparently eating the liver of a dead Syrian soldier, he even suggested the Prime Minister was siding with cannibals. Scroll down for video . Warning: Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (right) leads Russia's President Vladimir Putin into 10 Downing Street . Mr Cameron was holding talks with  Putin on Syria's civil war, a meeting which could set the tone for the G8 summit, with the West at odds with Moscow over how to handle the conflict . Reacting to comments from Mr Cameron . that those arming the Damascus regime had the 'blood of the children of . Syria' on their hands, a furious Mr Putin said: 'The blood is on the . hands of both parties. 'There is always a question as to who is to blame. One should hardly back those who kill enemies and eat their organs. 'It is hardly in relation to the . humanitarian and cultural values Europe has been professing for . centuries.' Mr Putin dismissed calls from Mr Cameron and the West to . stop arming the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad, saying Russia was . supplying 'the legitimate government of Syria in full compliance with . the norms of international law'. The two leaders did manage to find . common ground, paying tribute to the heroism of the British crews of the . wartime Arctic Convoys – as the Russian president awarded them with a . special gallantry medal. But a senior Russian source said the . talks had gone badly. 'We have lots of very serious disagreements on . Syria,' they said – adding that America's announcement last week that it . would now arm Syria's rebels had made it much harder to reach a deal. The excruciating press conference came . as the policy of arming the rebels came under fire from Boris Johnson, . Nick Clegg, MPs and military figures. Differences: Mr Cameron acknowledged there were 'big differences' between Britain and Russia on who was to blame for the conflict but insisted they could be overcome . Larry, the Prime Minister's cat walks past the red carpet shortly before President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister David Cameron meet at 10 Downing Street . Inspecting the scene: The Prime Minister's cat before President Vladimir Putin and David Cameron arrived . In a partial echo of Mr Putin, the . London mayor warned that any weapons sent to the country's opposition . could end up in the hands of 'Al Qaeda-affiliated thugs'. He added: 'This is not the moment to . send more arms. We can't use Syria as an arena for geopolitical . point-scoring or muscle-flexing, and we won't get a ceasefire by . pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs.' Mr Cameron has been told by . Conservative whips that, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats likely to . join as many as two-thirds of Tory MPs in opposing arming the Syrian . opposition, a Commons vote would almost certainly be lost. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg has . insisted the idea of a unilateral British intervention is 'fanciful' and . Tory MP Julian Lewis said arming the Syrian rebels would be 'suicidal' for Britain. At war: Syrian army troops patrol a ravaged street in Qusayr in Syria's central Homs province . Putin defended supplying arms to President Bashar Assad's government . Half of the ministers in the Cabinet . are also against ratcheting up Britain's involvement, while the top . brass have expressed grave concern at the prospect of fresh demands on . the Armed Forces at a time of a funding squeeze. General Lord Dannatt, the former head . of the Army, said ministers must not forget the lessons of Iraq and . Afghanistan when the UK became bogged down in bloody conflicts. He warned: 'If we have learned . anything from the last few years it is that we don't get involved in . another intervention without having a very clear idea of what we're . going to do, who we're going to help, what the plan is and what the exit . strategy is. Surely we've not forgotten the lessons of Iraq and . Afghanistan so quickly.' 'The blood is on the hands of both parties.There is always a question as to who is to blame for that.' Vladimir Putin . There were signs yesterday that Mr . Cameron is backing away from the prospect of directly arming the . rebels. The Prime Minister suggested the 'greatest assistance' the UK . can give is in technical support and training. With the issue set to dominate the G8 . summit opening today in Northern Ireland, he signalled that the prospect . of him pushing for the UK to arm rebels is receding now that the US has . suggested it will step in. He went on: 'I think where we can actually . give the greatest assistance to the official proper Syrian opposition, . is advice, is training and is technicalsupport. That is where we can . play the greatest role.' However, Mr Cameron made an . impassioned case for the West coming to Syria's aid. 'President Assad is . now guilty of the most appalling crimes against his people – 90,000 . dead and some of them through the use of appalling chemical weapons,' the   said. 'What we all want is an international . peace conference and an international agreement for a transitional . government in Syria, that the Syrian people can have confidence in, and . then elections and a new Syrian government. That's what everybody wants. 'The disagreement is obviously how we get there.' Sources insisted Mr Cameron still has . hopes of hammering  out a framework for a peace deal in the coming days, . and co-operate with Russia to ease Syria's dire humanitarian situation.","Vladimir Putin's comments follow tense talks in Downing Street .

"It looks like any recession-hit high street, with a ladies’ hair salon, a cut-price TV store and, in between, a disused kebab shop. But secreted above the shuttered premises that once sold Middle Eastern food is an altogether different import from the Arab world. The cramped flat in Cricklewood, North West London, is now the centre of operations for Egypt’s once-mighty Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood are reported to have set up their new headquarters above a disused kebab shop on Cricklewood high-street . It is from here that the . controversial Islamist organisation, expelled from power in a bloody . military coup in Cairo, is plotting its comeback. The .

Founded in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood advocates Sharia law and rejects Western values. It made its name fighting British rule in Egypt and was linked to the 1981 assassination of President Sadat.

"'Big row'? Mel B admitted having an argument with her husband Stephen Belafonte in an interview with gossip magazine Grazia published online last night . The husband of Mel B yesterday vehemently rejected claims he might be responsible for apparent marks on her face and body. The former Spice Girl provoked fevered speculation after she returned to The X Factor on Sunday with what appeared to be scratches and a bruised cheek. The judge came back for the final after being admitted to hospital on Thursday but there was no explanation for her absence. Viewers took to Twitter to make comments about the mysterious marks, linking them to her husband Stephen Belafonte, who has previously been accused of being violent and possessive towards a girlfriend. But yesterday he described the remarks as ‘disgusting’. He said, using typical celeb Twitter speak: ‘I don’t usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting wife which I think are quite disgusting untrue. ‘Mel was very ill a bunch of doctors help her get better if fans can’t just relax B4 being negative they r not real fans of Mel B.’ It was just a month ago that Belafonte presented his wife with a wedding ring ‘upgrade’ – a seven-carat diamond the size of a ten-pence piece. He handed her the ring just as she was about to go on air for The X Factor – a dramatic, romantic gesture. On Sunday night, however, the giant bauble was visibly absent from Mel Brown’s wedding finger. According to a well-placed source on The X Factor, Belafonte, 39, did not visit his wife of seven years during the three days she spent in hospital. Nor, says the source, was Belafonte with her at The X Factor studios for the final on Sunday. The fact that Mel B has removed her wedding ring ‘upgrade’ is surely an indicator that the seven-year marriage is in serious trouble. Could it be all over between them? It is telling that when the Mail contacted Mel B’s agent and publicist yesterday and asked whether the marriage was over, neither would confirm or deny the suggestion. The source revealed that Belafonte is not liked by other members of The X Factor team. ‘None of that means that he has ever laid a finger on Mel, but he is not an easy person to be with, that is obvious to see. It was a physical and emotional collapse. There was an emotional element to it, Mel has been under a lot of stress. ‘He didn’t come to the show on Sunday as far as I am aware. He wasn't in her dressing room. I don’t believe he visited her in hospital, either.’ Mel B was three hours late for an interview with Grazia, published online last night, in which she was described as 'not in the best of moods' and reportedly admitted an argument with Belafonte. 'I walked in pissed off because I had a big row with my husband about stupid stuff,' Grazia's Olivia Foster quoted the former Spice Girl as saying. 'Sometimes he p***** me off like no other, but he gets me.' 'Disgusting': Stephen Belafonte took to Twitter to slam speculation he was linked to marks seen on the star . Bruised? Fans took to Twitter during X Factor on Sunday to claim that Mel's face look bruised . Swollen? Some viewers said that Mel B's left cheek looked bruised during the X Factor final on Sunday night, while others remarked on apparent marks seen on her shoulders and the inside of her elbow (circled above) On Sunday, Belafonte was seen outside the Kensington block of flats where he and Mel, 39, have been renting an apartment since October, overseeing the loading of about 20 suitcases into a minivan. So what do we know of the events of the past few days? According to the X Factor source, Mel B was on her way to Wembley Arena on Thursday afternoon for a press conference with the judges and finalists when she was taken ill. ‘The driver, who has known Mel for a while and is a good guy, took her to A&E – he was that concerned – and she was admitted. ‘She was discharged on Sunday after asking the doctors if she could go at lunchtime.’ The source says that reports that Mel was in a high dependency unit may not be accurate. ‘That’s not to say that she wasn’t unwell, because she was.’ The source says Mel underwent tests, but would not say what these tests revealed. No wedding ring: Mel B appeared on X Factor on Sunday without her wedding ring. It's just a month since Belafonte presented her with a wedding ring ‘upgrade’ – a seven-carat diamond the size of a ten-pence piece . Speculation about the marriage has been so intense partly on account of Belafonte’s history. In 2007, shortly after their marriage in June that year, it emerged that Belafonte had been charged with battery in America after being arrested for attacking his then girlfriend, Nicole Contreras. He pleaded ‘no contest’ to the battery charge – which the judge stated was the same as a guilty plea – and was ordered to take part in a ‘Domestic Violence Batterers’ Programme’. In 2008, around the time Mel and Belafonte had a wedding blessing in Egypt, a friend of Miss Contreras told a newspaper about his violent and possessive character. Nicole is said to have told her friend: ‘I fear for Melanie because a leopard does not change his spots. ‘He seems utterly charming – but I’m afraid it won’t be long before his mask slips.’ Nicole told her friend that Stephen was over-possessive. ‘I would be away on photo shoots and Stephen would call my hotel room hundreds of times a night demanding: “Who the **** are you with, Nikki?” ‘One time we went out partying in Hollywood and Stephen was convinced a man in the bar was eyeing me up, which was total rubbish. Stephen followed him out of the bar and beat him senseless.’ Miss Contreras’s friend told the newspaper the relationship became on and off and finally ended after Belafonte told Nicole he’d met someone else. Nicole told the friend: ‘One night he turned to me and said, “Nikki, I’ve met someone who is very famous and very rich and wants to marry me but if you will have me back then I’ll forget it”. He wouldn’t say who she was but said, “She is so rich she could change my life”.’ Of course, these could be the observations of a woman scorned. But Mel B is certainly rich – she is worth an estimated £35million. The situation is messy. Since the marriage, Mel B has been estranged from her family. When her family learned she had been admitted to hospital, her mother, Andrea Brown, was forced to post a series of messages on Twitter pleading for information about her daughter. At her home in Leeds yesterday, Mrs Brown said she did not know any more about what had happened to her daughter than anyone else. Cursed? Couples who speak to Hello! about their idyllic relationships sometimes split shortly afterwards . Only last week, Mel B was Hello! Magazine’s cover story. It is customary for interviewees in Hello! to present a perfect family life and Mel was no exception. But has the famous curse of Hello! – by which couples who speak about their idyllic relationship split up shortly afterwards – struck again? In one photograph, Mel B is seated on a sofa with her husband and three daughters – Phoenix, 15, from her first marriage to dancer Jimmy Gulzar, seven-year-old Angel, from her relationship with actor Eddie Murphy, and Madison, she and Stephen’s three-year-old daughter. Mel gushed about how happy she was with Stephen. ‘He’s the first man I’ve ever trusted, he’s my rock and he’s the beginning and the end of who I am.’ In America, where she now lives, Mel B appears as a judge on America’s Got Talent and has starred in her own reality show, Mel B: It’s A Scary World. Mel was unsure whether the girl best known here as Scary Spice would go down well on X Factor, but the risk paid off and has revived her name in the UK. But the X Factor final of 2014, won by Ben Haenow, will now be remembered for all the mystery surrounding Mel’s hospital dash. Back in 2010, there were reports that the couple had split in the run-up to It’s A Scary World, but it was later claimed that the ‘split’ was a publicity stunt. Some may believe this latest episode, too, is a publicity stunt, a way of getting even with fellow judge and X Factor supremo, Simon Cowell, who had been critical of her act, Andrea Faustini. If it is a stunt, it’s a highly convincing act. Backstage on X Factor, it did not go unnoticed that Mel’s demeanour changed whenever her husband was about. Maybe that influence is slipping now and Mel has decided to break away.","X Factor viewers were shocked to see Mel B apparently bruised during final .

"He flies the world in a blood-red private jet, has an access-all-areas Formula 1 pass worth a cool £1 million and is fresh from the red carpet at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, resplendent in a solid gold chain worthy of a superstar rapper. And like most A-listers, this particular star is not without a few unpleasant habits. Support staff at the BBC awards can attest as much, having been tasked with picking up after him. Welcome to the world of Roscoe Hamilton, a two-year-old bulldog who lives a life of absurd luxury. Scroll down for video . Roscoe (centre) lounges about while on holiday with Lewis Hamilton and his other dog, bulldog bitch Coco . As the adored pet of Lewis Hamilton, reigning Formula 1 world champion, his is an existence of five-star pampering. Home is a £10 million apartment in Monaco, which he shares with Hamilton, his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and a bulldog bitch called Coco. Yet there is no question who rules the roost. Since padding into Lewis’s life in February 2013, Roscoe has taken centre stage. Take the family’s sleeping arrangements. Hamilton may be dating one of the most desired women on the planet in Nicole, but when the day ends, it is Roscoe who snuggles between the Egyptian cotton sheets alongside his master. (Ms Scherzinger is based for much of the year in America.) And as the racing driver jets between the U.S. and Europe in that gleaming £20 million Bombardier CL-600, he does so with Roscoe sitting beside him on his personal cream leather seat. Double act: The pair together at last night's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards . Indeed, Roscoe has his own passport as well as that pass to the Formula 1 paddock, which was given to him by Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire overlord of the sport. Sponsors pay upwards of £1 million for these passes, yet Roscoe’s, which features a photograph of the bulldog in a pair of expensive Beats headphones, was a gift. While many people were nonplussed to see a celebrity turning up to the televised awards with his pet, to those who know Hamilton well it was no surprise to see the pooch waddling along the red carpet on Sunday night, complete with gold chain. Hamilton was wearing this jewellery at some of his public appearances towards the end of the Formula 1 season, and is happy to share his substantial worldly goods with his dog. This is a fastidious professional who obsesses over the tiniest detail to give him a racing advantage. Yet he allows Roscoe to play with his race helmet as if it was a toy ball. And this is no ordinary piece of kit. It takes three days to make one and they cost £3,300 apiece. That said, they are designed to withstand 800c flames and huge impacts, so an encounter with an enthusiastic bulldog is unlikely to cause too much of a problem. The helmet is adorned with an image of Hamilton with Nicole and — you guessed it — Roscoe. The extent of the driver’s canine infatuation has ruffled feathers, however, with questions raised about whether it is appropriate to allow a dog into the racing paddock. Legendary commentator Murray Walker did not mince his words: ‘I have the utmost respect and admiration for Lewis, but the F1 paddock is no place for a dog. Think of the safety reasons. Think, too, of how a dog’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human’s — and my hearing has been destroyed by F1 cars. I am utterly amazed he’s allowed to take the dog in. I can’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about. It’s madness.’ All of which presented a dilemma for Hamilton’s racing team, Mercedes. By that point, Roscoe had his own bespoke canine racing suit, while Lewis spent £220,000 on hiring a luxury motor home for the European season — because the hotels frequented by the Formula 1 hierarchy do not allow dogs. Some race tracks, seduced by the glamour of the driver and his designer dog, use them as an advertising tool. For the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap. Roscoe, however, does not sleep in a kennel. And when his master is otherwise disposed, only the very best treatment will do. The X Factor: A friendly nuzzle for Lewis's girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The singer spends half the year in America - leaving a space in the couple's bed for Roscoe to slip between the Egyptian cotton sheets . High flyers: UK-bound with Roscoe (left), Coco (centre) and Lewis Hamilton on board a private jet . Marie-Pierre Hansom, senior ‘host’ at Mercedes-Benz World in Surrey — the carmaker’s flagship centre — was left in no doubt about this earlier this year. Accustomed to dealing with the biggest star names, she was taken aback by what happened when the driver arrived to film a commercial. With Lewis fed, watered, made up and safely installed on set, she was settling down for a cup of coffee when the phone rang. ‘It was our reception desk advising me that two of his guests had arrived on site,’ she says. ‘Most of the entourage were here by then, so I thought: “Who could it be?” What's up, dawg: In Beats headphones. The two-year-old bulldog even has his own pass to the Formula 1 paddock . ‘I went to introduce myself and I’m faced with two little bulldogs. Panic inside, we don’t allow dogs in the building, what am I going to do? I need to move them pretty quickly. ‘I make it to the suite, get them set up very quickly. They need water, they need food, they need cushions. They had to be taken for various things such as comfort breaks. We even had to call the cleaning team for help at one point, because I don’t deal with things like that. I started the day expecting one celebrity. I finished it with three. ‘I hope I made them happy, and by the snores coming out of Roscoe I think they all had a good time.’ Since arriving in Hamilton’s life, Roscoe has become a social media star. There is footage of him in Lewis’s bed, on aircraft and even on a trip to a bowling alley. Hamilton, who doesn’t have children, is fond of dressing up his beloved dog in designer hats, headphones and jewellery. He also brings along Roscoe to interviews (on one occasion having to apologise when the mutt’s loud snoring drowned out his answers). Yet it’s plain Roscoe has fulfilled an important role in his master’s life. Raised in the rarefied atmosphere of motor racing, anointed as the chosen one since his teens, it is hardly surprising Hamilton is not the most worldly of individuals. Blessed — or cursed — with a prickliness particular to the uber-competitive, he clearly takes great comfort from the unquestioning adoration of his dogs. Roscoe was joined last year by the bulldog bitch Coco, yet she has been comparatively anonymous, due in part to health problems. She has had to undergo two tricky operations to treat a problem with her tongue, so by and large Roscoe has travelled with Lewis while she stayed at home. Lewis grew up with pet labradors, though, so why a bulldog? The answer may lie in his controversial relationship with his nationality. Playtime: Making friends with Lewis's nephew, Kalden, when Hamilton spent a day with his mother and sister . Roscoe  has his own passport and for the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap . In his acceptance speech after winning Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday night, much was made of his pride in his British heritage. Yet this is a man who, the moment the big bucks started rolling in, decamped to Switzerland and then Monaco as a tax exile. Twitter immediately lit up with outraged comments about the BBC’s sporting champion not even paying a licence fee. He may believe that by having a British bulldog by his side, the public will subconsciously associate him with all things patriotic. But perhaps not when the dog is Roscoe Hamilton, surely the most pampered ‘non-dom’ in the canine world.

"Christmas shopping is undoubtedly stressful, but who knew it could give you a heart attack? This month, scientists warned that air pollution levels are so high on London’s Oxford Street that spending just two hours there can cause significant stiffening of the arteries. In susceptible people, this can cause blockage, cutting off blood supply to the heart leading to a heart attack. Cities are the areas where pollution levels tend to be highest, but people in the countryside can be affected too if they live or work near a busy road . The effects on arteries lasted for 24 hours after exposure and were seen both in people with existing health conditions and healthy volunteers. It’s the latest in a flurry of reports warning of the dangers of air pollution. Exposure to fumes from factories and vehicles, particularly diesel engines, is now widely agreed to have both instant and long-term effects on the body. Scientists from King’s College London even warned this week that wood-burning stoves are contributing to harmful levels of air pollution. Government figures show that 28,000 deaths every year in the UK are related to contaminated air — largely due to heart and lung problems and cancer. Just last week, a group of MPs called for planning guidelines to be changed so schools and care homes could no longer be built near pollution hotspots. ‘Although pollution is invisible, it can be toxic to the human body,’ says Jonathan Grigg, professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University of London. ‘We are seeing many effects — the more we look at, the more we find. ‘It can make existing conditions worse and it can have a role in setting the scene for new conditions to develop. ‘We are finding that being exposed in the womb, or during childhood, can impair development of the lungs. 'That imprint carries on throughout your whole life and raises the risk of problems such as asthma.’ One in 50 heart attacks that lead to admissions at London hospitals may be triggered by air pollution, according to a study at St George’s Hospital, South London . The culprits are tiny particles of carbon, found in air polluted by traffic or factory emissions, known as PM10s and, particularly, PM2.5s. These are particles less than ten or 2.5 microns wide — a micron being a millionth of a metre. When we breathe in, mucus in the airways traps dust and pollutants to stop them getting into the body. But PM10s and PM2.5s are so small they get past this filtering system. Cities are the areas where pollution levels tend to be highest, but people in the countryside can be affected too if they live or work near a busy road. And while experts believe the most important step is to reduce car use, there are steps you can take to minimise the impact: for example, take quieter streets instead of main roads where you can — especially if you have a heart or lung condition — and during summer months, avoid running or cycling in the afternoons when pollution levels are highest. Here, we look at the problems linked to the air we breathe . . . DIRTY AIR WILL GIVE YOU WRINKLES . Polluted urban air speeds up ageing of the skin by 10 per cent. A study of 200 women in Beijing found that regardless of lifestyle and cleaning regimens, those living in the most polluted districts had more damage and inflammation to their skin, which accelerates the formation of wrinkles. ‘Pollutants seem to aggravate the effect of UVA light [the component in sunlight that causes wrinkles] causing inflammation in the skin,’ says Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation trustee. ‘This damages collagen, which forms the structural integrity of skin. 'Losing it is a bit like losing the stuffing in a mattress. It makes skin look saggy and older.’ Air pollution has also been linked to melasma — brown patches found on the face. These are most common in women and are driven by the hormone oestrogen, but UVA rays contaminated by pollution may worsen the problem. Pollution can also worsen inflammation in people with eczema. Dr Shergill advises keeping a good cleaning routine, and keeping skin moisturised. IT MAY CAUSE ONE IN 50 HEART ATTACKS . Air pollution’s effects on the heart are well established. In those with existing conditions such as heart disease, breathing very polluted air can trigger heart attacks and abnormalities in rhythms, called arrhythmias. One in 50 heart attacks that lead to admissions at London hospitals may be triggered by air pollution, according to a study at St George’s Hospital, South London. ‘When small particles of carbon get into the lungs, they set up an inflammatory response and that releases chemicals into the blood which increases its stickiness,’ says Jon Ayres, professor of environmental and respiratory medicine at the University of Birmingham. ‘If you already have narrowed arteries, that increases the risk of heart attack, as it can cause blood clots.’ A study last year by Edinburgh University found that just a tiny increase in pollution levels — a rise of one part per billion — is enough to increase the number of adverse events and deaths in people with heart failure, where the heart fails to pump blood around the body as it should. Some evidence suggests that air pollution is also related to heart failure starting in the first place, says Professor Grigg. ‘That suggests it isn’t just what happens in the last 24 hours in an at-risk person: air pollution has the capacity to influence the cardiovascular system in the long term.’ SMOG AGES THE BRAIN . Some studies suggest pollution could have effects on the brain, including speeding up cognitive decline and memory loss. A 2012 study of nearly 14,000 American adults over 50 found those living in areas with high levels of fine pollution particles in the air — the type associated with vehicle engines — scored worse on cognitive function tests. The link remained even after allowing for factors such as age, smoking and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Some studies suggest pollution could have effects on the brain, including speeding up cognitive decline and memory loss (pictured above: smog over London) The researchers, from the University of Southern California, said the difference between this group and those living in areas with cleaner air equated to ageing three years. Another study, of 20,000 women in Chicago, concluded that living in a polluted area was related to faster declines in memory and thinking skills. ‘There is a theory about Alzheimer’s and pollution,’ says Professor Ayres. ‘But the studies are far from conclusive, and it’s still not clear how the pollutants would reach the brain. ‘We know that when they are breathed in, they can theoretically get into the olfactory nerves in the nose and go straight to the brain, but whether this is true in relation to Alzheimer’s is not known.’ THE THREAT OF CHILDHOOD DIABETES . Children living in polluted areas are significantly more likely to develop insulin resistance . One of the more surprising findings in the study of air pollution has been a link to type 2 diabetes. In 2012, a study from Boston University found that women who lived in areas with higher levels of nitrous oxides and PM2.5 particles were more likely to have high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, scientists in Munich found children living in polluted areas are significantly more likely to develop insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, by the age of ten. The researchers suggested that this could be down to inflammation in the body caused by cells reacting to air pollution particles. Another theory is that babies exposed to fumes in the womb tend to be born smaller, and low birth weight is known to raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. CANCER: THE PROOF . In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer — part of the World Health Organisation — classified air pollution as cancer-causing. As well as finding it triggered disease in the lungs, the group found a link with bladder cancer. Some 10,000 people are diagnosed with this in the UK every year, and the condition is strongly associated with smoking, explains Nick James, professor of clinical oncology at Warwick Medical School. ‘Once we’ve inhaled a toxin, it’s the kidneys’ job to eliminate it from the body. 'Urine concentrates these toxins, so the kidneys and the whole urinary system, including the bladder, are exposed to higher concentrations of them than other parts of the body.’ DAMAGES YOUNG LUNGS FOR LIFE . air pollution can worsen symptoms in those with asthma, emphysema and bronchitis. Hospital admissions for asthma attacks increase on high pollution days. However, scientists now believe that air pollution may also actually cause such conditions to develop in the first place. An analysis of studies concluded there was a higher incidence and prevalence of asthma among children who lived near busy roads. ‘There’s robust evidence that cumulative exposure to air pollution during childhood results in reduced lung function,’ says Alastair Lewis, professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York. And the effect is permanent. ‘Even if you move to the countryside you won’t get better.’ That’s because the lungs reach their peak capacity at 18. After that there’s an inevitable decline, but if the lungs never reached their optimum there’s less reserve for the decline, meaning a raised risk of conditions such as asthma. REDUCES MALE FERTILITY . A 2008 study assessed the fertilisation rates of donor sperm taken from Upper Silesia, the most polluted region in Poland, compared with the rest of the country and found significantly fewer pregnancies. Researchers speculated that the high levels of air pollution could be to blame. Another study, in the Czech Republic, showed the DNA in young men’s sperm was more fragmented during winter, when air pollution was much higher due to the burning of coal. However, Dr Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, adds: ‘While studies have showed problems in men who spend a large proportion of their time on a busy road — such as those collecting road-toll payments — I don’t think the general population should be too worried.’","28,000 deaths every year in the UK are related to contaminated air .

"For years, Margaret Keane was kept behind locked doors - painting the pictures of the wide-eyed waifs that made her husband Walter Keane an art sensation. Feted by celebrities during the 1950s and 60s, Walter, ever a showman, took credit for his wife's work until Margaret found the courage to come forward and tell the truth. Her story is told in new movie Big Eyes, which premieres tonight in New York. Amy Adams plays Margaret, while Christoph Waltz is the controlling, egomaniac Walter. Both actors have won Golden Globe nominations for their work. In a softly spoken voice, Margaret, now 87, tells MailOnline: 'I think Walter would have enjoyed every minute of it - all he cared about was being a celebrity, and of course,' she muses: 'he would have just claimed he was an artist until the very end, he would have loved the attention.' Scroll down for video . Art mirroring life: Amy Adams with painter Margaret Keane, whom she portrays in new movie Big Eyes . Famous: Margaret Keane is famous for her depictions of big-eyed children, as seen in Beach Bums II . She adds: 'Christoph did a wonderful job, I think he's portrayed Walter exactly as he was, but I think Walter was maybe a little crazier! 'He doesn't go over the top enough to show how nutty my husband was - but he had to make it believable.' With a soft chuckle, Margaret says: 'I think Christoph thinks HE did the paintings now!' After viewing the movie, directed by Tim Burton and produced by The Weinstein Corporation, Margaret admits: 'It was a very emotional experience, it was very traumatic to see it. 'To see it so big and intensified, it was quite an experience. I cried and I laughed and then I cried again, I really was in shock for about two days afterwards. 'My daughter had the same reaction, she was in shock too - it made it all come back alive to us. It was really emotionally overwhelming.' But, she says: 'It really is wonderful to have the whole truth come out and it's very satisfying to have it really portrayed like it really happened.' Locked up and forced to paint: Although this November 1961 photo shows Walter and Margaret Keane busy painting actress Natalie Wood in her Bel Air home, they would divorce four years later and Margaret would tell how she was locked up while Walter took credit for her work . Lifelike: Christoph Waltz and Amy Adams as Walter and Margaret Keane in Big Eyes. Margaret says: 'I think Walter would have loved it...all he cared about was being a celebrity' Egotistical: Margaret Keane was awarded $4 million in court in 1986 - but has never seen a penny . Margaret met Walter in 1955 when he charmed her at an outdoor art exhibition in San Francisco. Divorced, with a daughter, they soon married - and soon Walter was passing off Margaret's paintings of the sad children as his own, along with the story that they were based on youngsters he had seen in postwar Berlin in 1946. One night, Margaret accompanied her husband to San Francisco beatnik cub, The Hungry i, where Walter sold the paintings as comics such as Bill Cosby and Lenny Bruce performed on stage. When a customer asked her 'Do you paint too?' she realized Walter was taking the credit for her work. Staying with Walter for the sake of her daughter - while the paintings were printed on to postcards and posters sold in millions across America - Margaret was kept a virtual prisoner in her own home while her husband frolicked in the pool outside - and brought other women into their bed. Banned from having her own friends, she told The Guardian: 'The door was always locked, the curtains closed...when he wasn’t home he’d usually call every hour to make sure I hadn’t gone out. I was in jail. 'He was always  pressuring me to do more. 'Do one with a clown costume'.’ Or: ‘Do two children on a rocking horse.' Behind the smiles: Walter Keane could not paint - but took credit for his wife Margaret's portrayals of wide-eyed children that became beloved by celebrities. The couple are pictured in 1963 . Art elite: Diana Picasso, a granddaughter of the artist (right) joins actress Meredith Ostrom (left) at a Manhattan screening of Big Eyes earlier this month . Feted: Eileen Guggenheim (left) attends the screening of Big Eyes . Walter, it must be said, could not paint, a fact Margaret would seize upon, when finally in a court case in a 1986 - 21 years after they divorced - she was declared to be the true creator of the paintings. The verdict came only after a judge asked both Margaret and Walter to paint in court. Walter claimed he had a sore shoulder and could not pick up a brush. Margaret was awarded $4 million, but she never saw a penny of it as Walter, an alcoholic, had drunk his fortune away. A court psychologist diagnosed him with a rare mental condition called delusional disorder. Walter died in 2000 and making the decision to turn her life story and what was once so painful into a movie, was not an easy decision, Margaret says.

Asked about Amy Adams' portrayal of her, Margaret tells how the pair bonded before filming and said that Amy looks just like her in the movie, 'only prettier', adding: 'I knew she'd do a good job, but I had no idea it would be so fantastic.' The movie has already been screened at Art Basel in Miami, while art royalty including Diana Picasso and  Eileen Guggenheim attended a screening hosted by mega-art dealer Larry Gagosian with the film's Oscar-winning star Christoph Waltz at Manhattan's Crosby St. Hotel.

"Saudi authorities have beheaded a murderer and crucified his body after he killed and raped a Pakistani national. The kingdom's interior ministry announced the execution, stating that the man had murdered and sodomised another male. Both actions are punishable by death. 'The Yemeni citizen Mohammed Rashad Khairi Hussain killed a Pakistani, Pashteh Sayed Khan, after he committed sodomy with him,' said a statement carried by state news agency SPA. Beheading: The Yemeni citizen was beheaded and crucified for his crimes (Stock Image) Hussain was also convicted of robbery and carrying out a series of attacks. The execution, in the southern city of Jizan, was followed by crucifixion, a punishment used by the ultra-conservative country for serious crimes. Saudi Arabia have been criticised in the international community for their harsh punishments, including executions by beheading and firing squad. There have been 28 people beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year. Death by beheading has always been a source of tension between Saudi Arabia (capital Riyadh pictured) and the international community . Human rights campaigners protest against beheadings in Saudi Arabia after eight Bangladeshi men were executed for an alleged murder . In 2012, they executed 76 people, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, while the US-based Human Rights Watch put the number at 69. The oil-rich kingdom follows a strict implementation of Islamic law, or . Shariah, under which people convicted of murder, rape or armed robbery . can be executed, usually by sword. The announcement comes after Amnesty International released the final words of a man sentenced to death by firing squad. He was allegedly forced to confess after the authorities threatened to torture his mother. Seven juveniles were arrested and convicted for armed robbery and sentenced to death in the Southern city of Abha after their appeals to the king were rejected. One of the robbers was interviewed by the human rights charity before his death. Families of the robbers had pleaded to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah for clemency but the executions were carried out as planned . He said: 'I have nine hours left until I die. We found this out through friends and relatives who saw the market square being prepared for the execution. 'There are now seven spots in the square for seven people to be shot. It's going to be in public, in the market, in the city of Abha. 'We don't know what we are supposed to have done wrong. 'We were forced to make confessions. We were mistreated by the investigators - they took our clothes and it was winter. They tortured us by suspending us from chains on the wall. 'They also used psychological torture such as threatening they would bring in our mothers and torture them in front of us. 'I didn't kill anyone - we were tried for robbery and we were forced to confess. I hope the execution will be stopped. 'I wish for it to be stopped and for a fair trial and for a reinvestigation. The trial was totally unjust.' One of the men told The Associated Press . last month he was only 15 when he was arrested as part of a ring that . stole jewelry in 2004 and 2005.It was also reported that they had no access to lawyers. The south has been marginalized and . suffered discrimination by the powerful central Saudi region where the . capital, Riyadh, and holy shrines of Mecca and Medina are located. It was reported on March 13 that the execution went ahead despite appeals from human rights charities. There was also an international outcry, including from human rights groups, after a Sri Lankan maid, Rizana Nafeek, was beheaded in public by sword last month. Miss Nafeek was sentenced to death aged 17 in 2007 after her Saudi employer accused her of strangling his four-month-old baby two years earlier after a dispute with the child's mother. A government spokesman said Riyadh: ‘deplores the statements made... about the execution of a Sri Lankan maid who had plotted and killed an infant by suffocating him to death one week after she arrived in the kingdom.' The case soured the kingdom's diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka, which on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia in protest. The UN's main human rights body on Friday expressed ‘deep dismay’ at the beheading, while the European Union said it had asked Saudi authorities to commute the death penalty. Riyadh, however, rejected the statements as ‘external interference’ in its domestic affairs. The spokesman said: Saudi Arabia ‘respects... all rules and laws and protects the rights of its people and residents, and completely rejects any intervention in its affairs and judicial verdicts, whatever the excuse.'","Mohammed Rashad Khairi Hussain was convicted of murder and sodomy .

"Amy Pascal, the Sony Pictures honcho who was the victim of a hack attack, is in hot water all over again . Sony boss Amy Pascal is facing another race row over details made public from her email account. RadarOnline reports that buried in her email sent folder is a message to another Sony executive saying that TV deals were becoming so popular in Hollywood that they were 'the new black baby' that everyone wants. The comment appears to be a racially charged jibe at white Hollywood stars like Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron and Sandra Bullock who adopt African or African-American children, according to Radar. Pascal's remarks imply that such adoptions were little more than a hot fashion accessory in her eyes. Pascal has previously been under fire for suggesting that she talk only about a series of slavery-related movies during a brief meeting with President Barack Obama. She later apologized for those comments. In the newly-released email, Pascal - the co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment - is communicating with Sony Television President Steve Mosko, who was angry that he wasn't looped in on a new TV rights deal that Sony had struck. Pascal replied that the deal mostly had to do with films. 'But like everyone with half a brain these days television is the thing they want to do,' she wrote. She then told Mr Mosko that he was 'not used to TV being the new black baby,' according to emails viewed by Radar. Calls had already been rising for the influential Sony executive to be fired in the wake of the scandal. Now, the pressure will likely increase. Pascal was forced to apologize after media organizations published the content of emails from an exchange with film producer Scott Rubin. 'What should I ask the president at this stupid ... breakfast?' asks. Sandra Bullock (left) adopted her son Louis from New Orleans in 2010, while still with husband Jesse James. Angelina Jolie (right) adopted daughter Zahara Marley from Ethiopia in 2005 after meeting her in an orphanage when she was just six months old . She then offers that the president probably liked 'Django Unchained' - a violent film about a slave freeing himself. Mr Rubin counters with '12 Years a Slave' and then 'Ride-along.' 'Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' Mr Rubin writes. In the new emails, Pascal hits close to home for many top stars. Sandra Bullock adopted her African-American son Louis from New Orleans in 2010, while still with husband Jesse James. When the two split up, she completed adoption proceedings and currently parents him as a single mother. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt adopted daughter Zahara Marley from Ethiopia in 2005 after meeting her in an orphanage when she was just six months old. Charlize Theron adopted African-American son Jackson in 2012. In 2006, Madonna adopted son David Banda from the African nation of Malawi. Director Stephen Spielberg and wife Kate Capshaw have two black adopted children. 'Nashville' star Connie Britton adopted son Eyob 'Yoby' from Ethiopia in 2011. 'Sex and the City' star Kristin Davis adopted an African-American child in 2011.

"A drainpipe might have been a perfect bolthole for Rolo the hamster when she escaped from her cage, but she soon found she was stuck. Once her worried owners James Hammond and Sharon Weaver tracked her down via a small hole under their kitchen sink – and the sound of her claws scrabbling on the pipework – they spent four days dropping in food to try to coax her up. Eventually, though, they realised she was simply making herself at home in the pipe and enjoying her hand-delivered meals. Nutty: Rolo the hamster (pictured) escaped with the help of an enticing peanut dangled on a piece of string . Cheeky: The hamster spent several days down the drainage pipe as part of a failed escape bid . It was time to call in expert help in the form of drainage engineer Darren Hatfield, who used a small camera to pinpoint Rolo’s location three metres down the pipe. Next, he pushed a small piece of mesh into the pipe to act as a ladder and dropped in a peanut attached to a piece of string. It worked a treat. As Mr Hatfield slowly withdrew the nut, Rolo followed. She is now safely back in her cage in her owners’ Sheffield home. ‘She’s got big padlocks on her cage now – it can’t happen again,’ said Mr Hammond. Mr Hammond,  40, who works in motorcycle sales, said he and pharmacy assistant Sharon, 52, were relieved to have Rolo back after believing they had lost her for good. 'It was crazy,' he said. 'Sharon was in tears when we got her back and Rolo was just looking at me as if she was asking what the problem was.' Quite at home: The couple had been dropping down food to their pet, but she was just eating it all . Mr Hammond, left with his partner Sharon Weaver, said: 'I thought hamsters were supposed to be quite quiet' The couple, who also have a guinea pig called Sevvy and a budgie, Smoky, said Rolo has proved to have a restless personality since they bought her three months ago. Mr Hammond said: 'She just never keeps still. You can tell she’s clever. 'I thought hamsters were supposed to be quite quiet and slept all day, but she is always on the go.'","Worried owners tracked down the female in their Sheffield home .

"The Senate on Monday approved President Barack Obama's nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to serve as U.S. surgeon general, despite opposition from Republicans and some Democrats over his support for gun control. Murthy, 37, a physician at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School, won confirmation on a vote of 51-43. He's a co-founder of Doctors for America – originally called Doctors for Obama – a group that has pushed for affordable health care and supports Obama's health care law. Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso said most of Murthy's career has been spent as an activist focused on gun control and other political issues, rather than on treating patients. 'Americans don't want a surgeon general who might use this position of trust to promote his own personal campaign against the Second Amendment of the Constitution,' Barrasso said. Supporters said Murthy is well-qualified and noted his promise not to use the position as a bully pulpit for gun control. Scroll down for video . CONFIRMED: Dr. Vivek Murthy is a political partisan whose gun-control views have Second Amendment defenders worried . LIBERAL'S LIBERAL: Murthy chummed up with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of America's left-most politicians, during his February confirmation hearing . Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said Murthy has been 'pilloried and excoriated' by the National Rifle Association and its supporters for his backing of stricter gun laws, including an assault weapons ban, and past statements that gun violence is a public health issue. Murthy has made clear he is not 'aspiring to be the leading doctor in America to engage in a political debate, but rather to engage in public health debates about obesity and tobacco and things that make a dramatic difference to the lives of so many people who live in this country,' Durbin said. Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the NRA had 'spun a specious smokescreen' to block Murthy 'simply because he stated the obvious fact that gun violence is a public health issue.' The vote to confirm Murthy came two years after a school shooting in Newtown, Conn. Murthy expressed support for gun control in a letter to Congress after the shooting, drawing opposition from the NRA and holding up his confirmation vote. 'America's next surgeon general should not be a political operative whose professional inexperience has been a source of bipartisan concern,' said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. Murthy's nomination was endorsed by more than 100 health organizations, including the American College of Physicians, the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a staunch supporter of gun rights, did not mention guns in a statement opposing Murthy but said he does not believe it's appropriate for America's top doctor to participate in political activism. While he does not question Murthy's medical qualifications, Manchin said he wonders whether the public will believe that Murthy 'can separate his political beliefs from his public health views.' The vote to confirm Murthy came more than a year after Obama nominated him. The surgeon general doesn't set policy but is an advocate for the people's health. Before founding Doctors for America, Murthy created a nonprofit that focused on HIV/AIDS education in India and the U.S. And he co-founded a technology company, TrialNetworks, that helps drug developers collaborate on clinical trials. At a Senate hearing in February, Murthy said he wouldn't use the position to push gun control. He said his priorities include fighting obesity and helping communities promote healthier living. DOCTORS FOR OBAMA: Murthy (left) came to Capitol Hill in 2009 to lobby lawmakers to pass the Obamacare law, bringing xray-lightboxes with gimmick messages to reach members of Congress . The son of immigrants from India, Murthy told senators he was inspired to become a doctor while helping out on weekends at his father's family medicine clinic in Miami. Dr. David Satcher, a former surgeon general, said Murthy's youth and technological and business expertise would serve him well. 'We need a surgeon general now who is quite visible when it comes to dealing directly with the American people about their role of improving their health and the health of their communities,' Satcher said. Visibility is tough for surgeons general. The only one who became a household name was the bow-tied Dr. C. Everett Koop, who during the Reagan administration brought frank talk about AIDS to a reluctant nation and crusaded against smoking. The White House was quick to signal its enthusiasm for Murthy, issuing a statement from the president that said he would 'bring his lifetime of experience promoting public health to bear on priorities ranging from stopping new diseases to helping our kids grow up healthy and strong. Vivek will also help us build on the progress we've made combatting (sic) Ebola, both in our country and at its source.' Obama's statement did not mention the contentious Second Amendment issue.","Vivek Murthy attracted opposition from gun-rights advocates because of his belief that doctors should ask patients about guns in the home .

"A council employee went on a rampage with a JCB causing £300,000 worth of damage at the recycling plant where he worked. Trevor Lewis, 59, used the digger to wreak havoc at the Eastwood Recycling Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire after growing depressed with work after suffering a knee injury last year. Today, Lewis of Hebeden Bridge was jailed for three years at Bradford Crown Court after pleading guilty to a charge of criminal damage. The damage caused at the Eastwood Recycling Plant in Todmorden, West Yorkshire after employee Trevor Lewis went on a rampage with a JCB digger . The site is still closed after the incident in July with the local council estimating that the rampage caused more than £300,000 worth of damage . Lewis arrived at the plant early on July 19 of this year and set fire to a container after buying £15 worth of diesel at a garage the night before causing the damage . The court heard how one of the reasons he embarked on his rampage was that the site had made it difficult for him to work there by introducing steps during a recent refurbishment . As well as setting fire to a container, he also smashed six glass recycling contaiers, glass bottle cages and tore down railings and fencing, crushing yards of steel work . The court heard how one of the reasons he embarked on his rampage was that the site had made it difficult for him to work there by introducing steps during a recent refurbishment. The hearing was told how Lewis bought £15 worth of diesel from a garage the night before the rampage at the centre on July 19 this year. After arriving at the plant in the early morning, he set a container at the site alight before using the JCB to destroy everything he could by tearing down railings and fencing and crushing yards of steelworks. The court heard he smashed six glass recycling containers, glass bottle cages, a number of lamp posts, site gates and several section of perimeter fencing. Bradford Crown Court heard that once inside the site, Lewis gathered together used tyres in order to set fire to a temporary building at the recycling plant . A burnt out container at the recycling plant, which Lewis set fire to. The court also heard how several police units were sent to the site where they saw the container completely ablaze . Over the period of time the sire has been closed for, the cost incurred to the council is thought to be worth £5,000 per month . Duncan Ritchie, prosecuting, told the court Lewis had been depressed after suffering an injury to his knee 18 months previously. He said that new steps had been added to the site after the recent upgrade had caused Lewis feelings of frustration and depression due to his knee injury. A complaint had also been lodged against him by a member of the public just days before the rampage. The court heard he felt unable to tell his managers of his struggles with the steps for fear that they would hire somebody younger to take his place and decided he needed to destroy the site. On the morning of the incident Lewis left his wife a note saying that he loved her. As well as setting fire to a container and damaging recycling bins, Lewis also went around tearing down the perimeter fence and the railings inside . Mr Ritchie said: 'The defendant used his keys and replaced the company padlocks with his own padlocks. Once inside he gathered used tyres and set fire to the porta-cabin on site. 'The defendant climbed into the JCB and embarked on the systematic destruction of all the equipment on site. He used the excavator to crush or knock down the equipment.” The court heard that several police units were sent to the site where they saw the container completely ablaze. Mr Ritchie added: 'They saw him trying to smash anything which could be damaged on the site. 'A PC approached the site at one stage and the defendant gestured toward the officer warning him away from the gate. He then brought down the gate. The court heard how at one point, Lewis gestured towards a police officer warning him away from the gate before he tore it down . As well as tearing down the fence, Lewis also pulled down railings as well as damaging neigbouring property around the recycling centre . 'The defendant went to some lengths to ensure that he was the only person on the site at the time of the offence.” Kieron Green, defending, told the court: 'There had been a build up of frustration and depression. The site had taken on almost human form. He became obsessed that the site was ruining his life. 'He felt he could not continue unless the source of his despair and depression was removed.' An estimated 15,000 residents are said to have lost the use of the site - which had only just undergone a £600,000 upgrade. Over the period of time it has been closed and the cost incurred to the council is thought to be £5,000 per month. Sentencing Lewis, Judge David Hatton QC said: 'You destroyed just about everything that was capable of being destroyed. The cost of your actions was immense in financial terms. Lewis, who was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court today, said that he had suffered a knee injury last year, which caused him to become disillusioned with his job . 'It was planned and thought out. Thought out to the extent of obtaining alternative padlocks. I accept you have had and continue to have unhappy symptoms of depression. 'But I cannot ignore the enormous destruction that you caused and I cannot ignore the enormous cost to the public of that destruction and the effect on the community.' After the case, Jan Lamping, Senior District Crown Prosecutor at CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: 'Trevor Lewis took a JCB digger and systematically destroyed the recently refurbished Eastwood waste recycling facility. 'This act of wanton vandalism caused an estimated £300,000 damage to the site, as well as some damage to a neighbouring property. It has also resulted in considerable inconvenience to local residents while the site is closed for rebuilding. 'Today Lewis has been sentenced to three years in prison which I hope will demonstrate how seriously this type of crime is viewed by the police, by the CPS, and by the courts.'","Trevor Lewis used a digger to wreak havoc at the Eastwood Recycling Centre in Todmorden where he worked .

"Abdullah bin Bayyah met with members of the Obama administration's national security team on June 13, despite his close ties with a Muslim Brotherhood leader who advocates for the destruction of Israel and has been banned from the U.S. since 1999 . The White House's National Security Council has confirmed that staffers held a June 13 meeting with Shaykh Abdallah bin Bayyah, an Islamist cleric who shares leadership of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, where he is vice-president and the terror supporter Yusuf al-Qaradawi is president. The meeting occurred on the same day the Obama administration announced plans to arm Syria's rebel factions, in the wake of a determination that President Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people. The Investigative Project on Terrorism, . which released a report Late Tuesday covering the circumstances of the meeting, wrote that bin Bayyah has referred to the anti-Semitic . Islamist al-Qaradawi 'as ""a mountain upon whose peak there is light” and . as ""a great reformer"" who ""spreads knowledge and wisdom.""' MailOnline . saw a late draft of that report. 'Like many in the global Muslim . Brotherhood movement who pose as moderates to the press and to liberal . intellectuals by issuing condemnations of al-Qaida,' it read in part, . 'Bin Bayyah refuses to label the acts of groups such as Hamas, Hizballah . or Palestinian Islamic Jihad as terrorism.' He . has also issued 'an endorsement of the push by Muslim intellectuals to . criminalize blasphemy against the Muslim prophet Muhammad and Islam,' the group reported. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Gayle Smith, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Development and Democracy at the National Security Council, met with Shaykh Abdallah bin Bayyah on June 13 . Bin Bayyah (2nd L) released this photo on his website, showing the June 13 meeting with Obama administration officials including Gayle Smith (2nd R) and Rashad Hussain (4th L) Bin Bayyah wrote on his website in . the days following that meeting that he 'visited the White House where . he met with Ms. Gayle Smith, a senior aide to President Barack Obama, . and Mr. Rashad Hussain, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of the . Islamic Conference.' 'He . also met with a number of experts,' that claim continued, 'including the . director of public relations in the White House, the national security . adviser, and representatives from seven government agencies.' Smith is Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Development and Democracy at . the National Security Council. Hussain is the lawyer tapped to . implement the 'new beginning with Muslims around the world' which . President Obama promised during a June 4, 2009 speech in Cairo, Egypt. Bin . Bayyah cultivates an image as a Muslim moderate despite his views. Al-Qaradawi, meanwhile, is a more vocal proponent of Muslim suicide . bombers killing Jews, especially in portions of Israel that Palestinians claim as their territory. Yusuf al-Qaradawi (R), shown with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh (L), leads the International Union of Muslim Scholars. His second-in-command, Abdallah bin Bayyah, was welcomed into the White House on June 13 . Al-Qaradawi . is generally considered the leading Islamic scholar affiliated with the . Muslim Brotherhood. He has called openly for the destruction of Israel . and the deaths of all Jews, called Adolf Hitler a divine punishment for . the 'misdeeds of the Jews' and claimed the Nazi Holocaust has been . popularly exaggerated. Al-Qaradawi has also said he wants to . die 'in the service of jihad' by blowing himself up in Israel and . killing Jews in the process. 'I have supported [suicide bombings] for the past 20 years,' he said in 2008. 'I . do not automatically support martyrdom operations,' he continued. “I . permit them under specific constraints, when necessary, like in the case . of our Palestinian brothers who are forced to defend themselves by . turning themselves into bombs.' The . two clerics' close association has caused reputational trouble for bin . Bayyah among Western governments, and the U.S. State Department has . denied al-Qaradawi entry into the country since 1999. But the Obama . administration welcomed bin Bayyah into the White House. Bin . Bayyah's own views about Palestinian terror attacks on Israeli targets . may have made inviting him to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue a difficult call. Barack Obama has made overtures to the Israel lobby since the days of his first presidential candidacy, but members of his national security team met secretly with the vice president of a leading anti-Israel group this month . Shaykh Abdallah bin Bayyah, circled in red, is shown at the December 2012 International Union of Muslim Scholars' board meeting in Doha, Qatar. Yusuf al-Qaradawi is shown to his left (camera-right). The meeting ended with a call for the destruction of the state of Israel . 'That the Obama Administration would . invite to the United States a radical Muslim cleric whose organization . supports terrorism and whose leaders have issued fatwas calling for the . killing of Americans and Jews is beyond comprehension.,' Investigative . Project on Terrorism executive director Steve Emerson told MailOnline. Emerson called on Congress to investigate 'immediately.' 'In . my 30 years of covering terrorism, I have never in my life been so . appalled and outraged at what can only be called criminal behavior by . this administration,' he said. NSC communications director Caitlin Hayden told MailOnline in an email that she was 'unfamiliar with this meeting,' but later allowed that she was 'not disputing it.' Separately, a senior administration official confirmed to MailOnline that 'Gayle Smith and members of the National Security Staff met with Shaykh Bin Bayyah to discuss a wide range of issues including poverty,  global health efforts, and Bin Bayyah’s efforts to counter the al Qaeda narrative.' 'Ms. Smith stated that she looked forward to working with him,' the official added, 'and with other faith leaders on issues of mutual interest.' Abdallah bin Bayyah's English-language website initially reported that 'the national security adviser' of the U.S., Tom Donilon, was a participant in the June 13 meeting . After MailOnline inquired with the White House, but before bin Bayyah's organization was approached, the 'national security adviser' language disappeared . Yusuf al-Qaradawi claimed in 2009 that the Nazi Holocaust was a 'divine punishment' directed at Jews. Abdallah bin Bayyah, who met with National Security Council staff in the White House, is al-Qaradawi's deputy as vice president of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, which al-Qaradawi leads . The account of the meeting on bin Bayyah's website also mentions that he 'called for the protection of the Syrian people and the Muslim minority in Myanmar.' But less than 12 hours after MailOnline made inquiries with the NSC, that account was . altered to remove any reference to National Security Adviser Tom . Donilon having attended the meeting. The site still claims 'the director . of public relations in the White House' - likely a reference to . communications director Jennifer Palmieri - did attend. There . has been no confirmation from the White House or from bin Bayyah that . either Palmieri or Donilon participated in the June 13 meeting. A second web page on bin Bayyah's site was also changed within hours of MailOnline's inquiries. According to translations provided by . the Investigative Project on Terrorism, an Arabic language account of . the June 13 meeting originally mentioned the 'Director of Public . Relations in the White House' and 'the National Security Adviser.' It . was changed to refer to 'Deputy Director of Public Relations in the . White House' and 'Deputy National Security Adviser.' The National Security Council would not confirm the attendance of any specific West Wing deputy. Rashad Hussain, US envoy to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, is the Obama administration official tasked with rebooting America's relationships in the Muslim world . During an April 2013 TV interview, prominent International Union of . Muslim Scholars member Tareq Hawwas wished openly of Europe's Jews that 'Hitler had finished them off, thus relieving humanity of them' Any connection with the International . Union of Muslim Scholars could be problematic for the Obama . administration, since that organization ended its December 2012 board . meeting by calling for all of Israel to be returned to Palestinians, and for the return of . those Palestinians who were exiled after the Israeli War of Independence in . 1948. Its most prominent members have also expressed openly anti-Semitic views. Lebanese . Islamic scholar Tareq Hawwas, for instance, said in April on Al-Quds TV . that Jews 'are cowards' and 'the most miserly of all peoples ... If . only Hitler had finished them off, thus relieving humanity of them.' And Hamas parliament member Marwan Abu Ras, another International Union of Muslim Scholars member, claimed on the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV that 'Jews are behind each and every catastrophe on the face of the Earth. This is not open to debate. ... Any catastrophe on the face of this Earth, the Jews must be behind it.' That assessment came on Sept. 12, 2012, as the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya lay in ruins and ashes. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for information about whether it recommended against issuing a visa to bin Bayyah for his June 13 meeting. Typically, a former DHS official told MailOnline, that agency would have been consulted before the state Department began the process to clear him for entry into the country. Speaking of the International union . of Muslim Scholars, the Investigative Project on Terrorism's Emerson . claimed 'the United States Government has just . legitimized a group that is basically no different that Hamas or . Hizbollah, except that this group is the one issuing the religious . edicts . to those Islamic terrorist groups to carry out jihad against Israel and . the United States.' 'This is the equivalent of inviting Al Qaeda to the . White House.'","The UK and U.S. have banned Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who leads the anti-Israel International Union of Muslim Scholars.

The organization ended its December 2012 board meeting by calling for the end of Israel and the return of its lands to the Palestinians .

Ambassadorial posts require Senate confirmation, and Tsunis's cringe-worthy performance in a January 2014 hearing virtually guaranteed that he wouldn't be getting a thumbs-up. Tsunis, chairman of Chartwell Hotels, is a major Democratic fundraiser who plowed $267,244 into party coffers in 2012 – including $75,800 to the Obama Victory Fund – and 'bundled' $988,550 from his business connections to benefit Obama's re-election effort. He also donated $300,000 to Democratic super PACs. During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, however, he bungled questions about Norway's political parties and spoke of the nation's 'president' – even though it is a constitutional monarchy with a king and a prime minister. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . George Tsunis (center) gave a disastrous performance of historic proportions in January when senators questioned him on his knowledge of Norway during a hearing that also featured Colleen Bradley Bell (left), ambassador nominee for Hungary, who is a soap opera producer . NO SUCH MINISTER: Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg is out of a job according to Tsunis, who made references to the country's 'president' instead during his Senate testimony . Tsunis also claimed that the Progress Party, a Norwegian anti-Islamist party that opposes immigration above a token 1,000 people per year and advocates for AIDS testing for all new arrivals, was a fringe group and nothing more. 'You get some fringe elements that have a microphone and spew their hatred,' he complained. 'And although I will tell you Norway has been very quick to denounce them, we’re going to continue to work with Norway to make sure –' A stunned Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain interrupted Tsunis to remind him that the Progress Party was considered a mainstream political influence in Oslo. It's actually the third-largest party in Norway's parliament, and its leader Siv Jensen is the country's current finance minister. 'The government has denounced them?' McCain asked. 'They're part of the coalition of the government.' 'Well, I would say – You know what? I stand, I stand corrected,' a slapped-down Tsunis responded. That exchange came minutes after McCain asked: 'Mr. Tsunis, have you been to Norway?' 'I have not,' an ashen-faced Tsunis admitted. He told reporters in multiple statements over the weekend that senators wouldn't have him to kick around anymore. 'I have elected not to renew my nomination for the next Senate session as I did last year, and will let the nomination expire,' he said in one. With the ambassadorial slot left unfilled for more than a year, he said the elapsed time was 'too long not to have an ambassador in any country.' Minnesota's two Democratic senators, Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar, were among the first to oppose his nomination. Their state is home to large concentrations of Scandinavians expats and multi-generational immigrants from Sweden and Norway. NOT THE ONLY ONE: Newly confirmed US Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell is a soap-opera producer with no other discernible credentials . REALLY? Sen. John McCain was shocked to hear Tsunis claim that a governing-coalition party in Norway was a hate-group that the Norwegian government had denounced . 'It's a tight community and we heard from them,' Franken told NPR in June. 'We want diplomats to be pretty good under pressure anyway and he seemed not to be and he displayed a tremendous amount of ignorance about Norway.' Cornered in June on the question of whether Tsunis and other apparently unqualified nominees should be installed in embassies overseas, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest signalled the Obama administration's intention to stand firm. 'We've got full confidence in their ability to do these jobs,' Earnest said. 'I think it is short-sighted to automatically rule out nominees that aren't career Foreign Service officers.' 'If that were the case, that means that Caroline Kennedy would not be serving as the ambassador to Japan. I think most people, even some Republicans, would agree that she’s doing a pretty good job over there.' But a group of House Democrats and Republicans insisted over the summer that Tsunis's 'embarrassing lack of knowledge' about Norway made him unqualified. Hotelier George Tsunis flubbed line after line during his January Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, drawing eye-rolls from senators on both sides of the political aisle as he struggled to demonstrate why he should be America's ambassador to Norway. Here are the most memorable gaffes from his limited time on the international stage. 'The answers provided by Mr. Tsunis clearly demonstrate that he is unqualified for this position and may damage an important international bond if confirmed,' wrote 32 lawmakers, including six Democrats, many from the Midwest, home to many Norwegian-Americans. They said that in light of military aggression from Russian president Vladimir Putin, it was critical for the United States to have a knowledgeable and respected ambassador in a nearby nation like Norway. 'His ill-informed comments deeply offended several Norwegian officials and have caused many to doubt his ability to serve as an effective ambassador,' the lawmakers wrote. In a separate statement, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino said Obama should do 'what is best for Norway and America, not what is politically expedient for his fundraisers and cronies.' In March the union that represents U.S. diplomats threatened to sue the State Department unless it released documents attesting to the qualifications of Tsunis and other ambassadorial nominees. The American Foreign Service Association said it would ask a court to compel the production of the documents, known as 'Certificates of Demonstrated Competence,' if the department didn't cough them up voluntarily. The AFSA claimed State had ignored requests to have the documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Tsunis's attempt to leap into foreign service from a political fundraising nomination was nothing new: past administrations have rewarded money-men and women with prime ambassadorships for decades. But President Obama has eclipsed both George Bushes, and Bill Clinton, in that regard, filling an estimated 37 per cent of his ambassadorial posts with fundraising rock stars and other political cronies whose qualifications have been called into question. Collectively, they were responsible for at least $13.6 million in political donations. Oslo Mayor Fabian Stang responded to Tsunis's January implosion by telling Norwegian Broadcasting, in an English translation,that it 'would be very sad for Norwegian-American relations if the Norwegian people are made to feel like second-class citizens by getting an unprofessional ambassador. 'He is surely a fine man and has surely done an excellent [job] for himself and for Obama's election campaign,' Stang said. 'But given what we saw from his hearing, he doesn't seem very interested in Norway.' A senior White House official told MailOnline on Monday that the administration has no plan for a new personnel announcement that might introduce a new nominee to replace Tsunis.","George Tsunis appeared in a disastrous Senate confirmation hearing this year during which he admitted he had never been to Norway .

"An eight-year-old child bride has died in Yemen of internal bleeding sustained during her wedding night after being forced to marry a man five times her age, activists have claimed. The girl, identified only as Rawan, died in the tribal area of Hardh in northwestern Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia. Activists are now calling for the groom, who is believed to be around 40 years old, and her family to be arrested so they can face justice in the courts. Rural: The girl, identified only as Rawan, died in the tribal area of Hardh in northwestern Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia . They say arrests would help put a stop to the practice of marrying very young girls to older men in the impoverished region. Angry Man, a blogger, posted that the man was 'an animal who deserved to be punished severely for his crime'. Child bride: The practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages . 'All those who supported such a crime should also be punished,' he added. Another blogger, called Omar, wrote: 'Rawan’s family members are not humans. They do not deserve to have children.' Despite numerous  campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. There are currently some 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. Forty-six per cent of women in India were married before the age of 18, according to the National Family Health Survey-3. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. But . another blogger, called 'Sad', appeared more sympathetic to the custom. He wrote: 'Her family and her groom could have waited for some time . before having this marriage,' Sad said. 'It was not fair at all and the . marriage should not have happened even if some tribes believe that it is . a good custom.'

"'Cocaine habit': An accountant overseeing Scot Young’s bankruptcy said the businessman had a drug problem. Mr Young is pictured with Noelle Reno . The bankrupt tycoon who fell to his death last week was addicted to cocaine, it has been claimed. Scot Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich, plunged on to railings outside a £3million apartment in London last Monday. He had been at the centre of a notorious divorce case, with ex-wife Michelle, 50, accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. It led to his imprisonment for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth. Yesterday, David Ingram, senior partner at Grant Thornton, who was the accountant overseeing Mr Young’s bankruptcy, said of Mr Young: ‘He said he wanted to enter into an individual voluntary arrangement, whereby he would agree to pay back his creditors an amount he could afford. ‘[But] I don’t think it was a secret that he had his ups and downs. He provided me with letters from doctors and specialists that he was bipolar and he was taking medication for that. ‘He also had a non-prescription drug habit, cocaine. And there were times he came to my office smelling of alcohol.’ Mr Ingram added: ‘He smoked too, he would go outside for a cigarette, for all I know he went outside for a cigarette, if he’d had a few drinks, who knows what happened? ‘He was desperate to get back on his feet and we were trying to work out a plan where he would do that.’ It comes after Mr Young’s ex-fiancée, American Noelle Reno, 32, reportedly told friends she had a furious row with Mr Young on the day of his death after he turned up ‘high’ at their flat. Miss Reno and Mr Young, who met in 2008, had separated after a series of rows and she had asked him to move out of the duplex they were renting in Montagu Square, Marylebone. She is said to have told friends that on the day he died, he turned up at the flat but would not leave so she left and called police. He was, friends said, ‘manic, crazy and probably high’. She had also reportedly told friends that Mr Young ‘was not in a good place’, had embarrassed her at a number of society events and had at times smelled of alcohol. Miss Reno, a star of Bravo's Ladies of London, was however, reluctant to publicise the news of their split because of his fragile mental state - he had already attempted suicide, had been into rehab and been sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act. Mr Young was once described as billionaire but little is known about how he made - and then lost - his fortune. Born in Dundee, Mr and Mrs Young met when he was a rising property entrepreneur and she was working in the retail industry. During the course or their marriage he went on to amass a fortune. Champagne: David Ingram, senior partner at Grant Thornton, who was overseeing Mr Young’s bankruptcy, said Mr Young 'had a non-prescription drug habit,' and said he sometimes turned up smelling of alcohol . Good times: But Mr Young’s ex-fiancée, American reality star Noelle Reno, 32, reportedly told friends she had a furious row with Mr Young on the day of his death after he turned up ‘high’ at their flat . The family lived in a £19million home in Egham, Surrey, which Mr Young later sold to billionaire Russian dissident Boris Berezovsky. He also had a £4.5million house in Miami and a series of properties in Mayfair and Knightsbridge worth at least £32million. His close friends included billionaire entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, and Topshop boss, Sir Philip Green. The family, who had also had a fleet of cars, were said to only ever travel by private jet. But in 2006 after Mrs Young reportedly round out he had been unfaithful, the couple separated. A year later, after she had filed for divorce, he claimed to be £27million in debt and insolvent having lost his fortune in a mysterious property deal called, Project Moscow. He was decanted bankrupt in 2010. Mrs Young has always claimed that he was worth ‘billions’ and that he had gone to great lengths to hide his assets. Last year, the courts found in her favour, and ordered Mr Young to pay £20 million. Young vs Young: Mr Young, left, arriving at the High Court for a hearing in his £300million divorce battle with his former wife Michelle Young, the mother of his children. She is pictured right leaving the High Court . Mr Ingram, whose job it is to recover assets for Mr Young’s creditors, said that, as far as he was aware, Mr Young did not have any money when he died. ‘He did find Michelle’s position extremely frustrating,’ he said. ‘We know that he was living on handouts from his friends. He may have done a few deals but her certainly did not seem to be living the lifestyle that he once did. He knew a lot of wealthy individuals who for whatever reason were quite generous. ‘He never particularly articulated what he was going to do [to start making money again]. He was a deal maker, whether that was money laundering or what I don’t know, but he was someone who would set up and put deals together and then take commission.’ Scene: Mr Young died in Marylebone, central London, where police are not saying whether he left a note . Mr Young's body was found by horrified residents in Marylebone on Monday afternoon. He had fallen 60ft onto the iron railings below his flat and police moved quickly to hide the distressing scene from onlookers . Mr Young’s links to Mr Berezovsky, who was found dead at his home last year, and his links to other Russian businessmen have led to speculation he was murdered by gangsters over unpaid debts. But Mr Ingram dismissed the claims as ‘conspiracy theories’. ‘I would hope for Noelle’s sake and his daughters that this was some sort of tragic accident rather than suicide,’ he said. ‘The danger is that they may then blame their mother, they have already lost their dad.’ Mr Ingram said he was now making attempts, through Mr Young’s solicitors, to establish if he had made a will before he died. Scotland Yard have said Mr Young’s death is not suspicious. An inquest is due to open in the coming days, although a date has not yet been set.","Scot Young was impaled on railings after plunging to his death last week .

"More Americans than not believe that harsh interrogation tactics used by the CIA during the Bush administration were 'justified' and produced worthwhile intelligence, even if they were 'torture,' a poll released today shows. Survey-takers discovered that a plurality of interviewees believe the brutal interrogations were justified, 49 percent, and resulted in reliable intelligence, 57 percent. But even while giving the CIA their blessing to forcefully question suspected terrorists, nearly seven in 10 in Americans said they consider waterboarding - one of the 13 approved Bush-era techniques - to be 'torture,' a CBS News poll found. Scroll down for video . Pluralities of Americans believe that enhanced interrogation techniques used by the George W. Bush administration's CIA were both 'justified' and worthwhile . A majority also said that threatening to sexually assault detainees' mothers equaled torture, 73 percent, as were the forced ice water baths they were given, 57 percent, and the sleep deprivation they were subjected to, 70 percent. Republicans were most likely to approve of the program that was carried out in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks during Republican president George W. Bush's tenure, 75 percent, followed by Democrats, 54 percent, and independent voters, 50 percent. Similarly, Republicans were least likely to say that waterboarding constitutes torture and that terrorism suspects should have the same rights as other suspected criminals. Legal rights for detainees with known terrorist ties was not popular with respondents of any political persuasion, however, and 56 percent of all Americans questioned said they were not in favor of such a measure. A second survey performed by Pew Research Center revealed similar attitudes among Americans. That poll found that 51 percent backed the CIA's use of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques compared to the 29 percent who said they were 'not justified.' A fifth of those polled said they did not know what to think. The same survey discovered that 56 percent of Americans believe that the aggressive treatment led terrorism suspects to provide 'intelligence that prevented terrorist attacks.' Likewise, 28 percent said they agreed with a Senate report released that claims it did not, and 16 percent said said they were unsure. And as in the CBS poll, those surveyed were more likely to be in favor of the CIA program if they self-identified as Republican, 76 percent, than were Democrats, 37 percent, or independents, 49 percent. Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say that the measures were justified and helped to prevent future terrorist attacks . Respondents to the Pew poll were split over whether the Senate should have released a declassified, 600-page version review of the CIA program at all, with 42 percent saying they were for it and 43 percent saying they were against it. Perhaps more revealing was the percentage of Americans who told Pew that they kept a close eye on the national debate following the Tuesday release of the Senate document at all: 23 percent. The report took a back seat, Pew discovered, to news on the monthly jobs numbers and on protests against police brutality.","Nearly seven in 10 in Americans said they consider waterboarding - one of the 13 approved Bush-era techniques - to be 'torture'

"Owners of high-end super cars are not afraid of making a statement. And the driver of this Rolls Royce is no exception - splashing out thousands of pounds to have the £300,000 model wrapped in black velvet. The car, a Phantom drophead coupe, was spotted outside Harrods in the exclusive area of Knightsbridge, central London, where it attracted a few looks - and strokes - from passers-by. Scroll down for video . Sleek: The velvet-covered Rolls Royce Phantom drophead coupe was spotted on the streets of London . Attention-grabbing: Two curious passers-by stop to stroke the vehicle, which costs an estimated £300,000 . Statement: The velvet wrap, which cost roughly £3,000, is the latest trend in super car customisation . The velvet wrap, which comes in a range of colours, is one of the latest trends in super car customisation - offering owners a bold alternative to 'boring' paintwork. Raccoon, a British garage that has carried out treatments on similar cars, estimated that the finish would have cost the Rolls Royce's owner £3,000. Created by Velvet Car, a French company specialising in luxurious films and accessories, the service involves ‘wrapping’ the cars in a durable and weather resistant fibre. Named the Velvet Elite 9100, the wrap is available for all vehicle types. It comes in a range of colours, including fuchsia pink and orange - designed to be a bold alternative to those bored with paint. The wrap is coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather conditions. The material, which lasts for roughly three years, can be cleaned by hand or using a jet wash and does not need special products. The first velvet-covered car in Britain was spotted on the streets of London last summer. A spokesman for the firm, which supplies the material to garages in the UK and overseas, said that the material, called Velvet Elite 9100, allows car owners to better express their style. The fibre comes in a range of colours - including fuchsia pink and orange - and is available for all vehicle types. It is coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather condition. The material will last roughly three years and, if the mystery owner has a change of heart, the wrap can be removed by professionals restoring the car to a just off the production line state. It can be cleaned by hand or using a normal jet wash, without requiring any special products. A British company, Raccoon, was responsible for the UK's first velvet-covered car - a black Porsche that became an internet sensation when it was seen in London last summer. Durable: The velvet material, which comes in a range of colours, will last for roughly three years . Striking: One British garage said that the wrap was chosen by car owners looking to make a statement . Flash: Onlookers stop to look at the vehicle, which was seen parked on the road outside Harrods yesterday . Spokeswoman Alison Clark, said that since then the firm had completed eight wrappings - mainly for customers who were looking to stand out. She told MailOnline: 'We have done a couple, but it tends to be people looking to make a statement.' Though the company did not wrap the black Rolls Royce, Ms Clark estimated that the treatment would have cost the owner roughly £3,000. Vibrant: The material comes in a range of other colours, including blue, orange - and this shocking hot pink . Bespoke: The owner of this car asked Raccoon to include a red gold panel in the centre of the black velvet . Midnight blue: This Range Rover Evoque was covered by Raccoon in a more subtle blue version of the fabric .

"Nadia Mohamed Ali and her seven children have been jailed for 15 years in Egypt after converting back to Christianity from Islam . A mother and her seven children have been jailed for 15 years for converting back to Christianity from Islam in Egypt. Nadia Mohamed Ali was raised a Christian but converted to Islam 23 years ago when she married Mohamed Abdel-Wahhab Mustafa. Following his death, she planned to convert back to her original faith, along with the rest of her family. But a criminal court in Beni Suef, in central Egypt, sentenced them to jail for 15 years last week, according to reports. Seven other people, who were involved in the case, were also sentenced to five years in jail. Human rights advocates have now warned the sentence is a sign of things to come in Egypt under the Islamist government, according to Fox News. The conversion came to light after the family attempted to get new identity cards in 2004. According to Sky News, one of her children was arrested two years later and confessed the documents had been changed illegally when police noticed he had changed his name and became suspicious. Nadia, her children and the clerks who processed the identity cards were subsequently arrested and charged. Christians in the country have said they face difficulties if they have converted to Islam and wish to switch back, leading some to forge the documents, which could land them in jail. Samuel Tadros, a research fellow at Hudson Institute's Center for Religious Freedom, has said while similar conversions had been common, the new Sharia-based constitution in Egypt was 'a real disaster' for religious freedom, according to Fox News. He said: 'The cases will increase in the future. 'It will be much harder for people to return to Christianity.' The constitution was pushed through last year by President Mohamed Morsi, who succeeded Hosni Mubarak following an election last June. Secular and liberal groups, as well as Coptic Christians, opposed the constitution and protested against it at the time it was passed. Human rights advocates have warned the sentence is a sign of things to come under the new constitution brought in by President Mohamed Morsi .","Nadia Mohamed Ali and seven children jailed after converting to Christianity .

"E-cigarettes could be luring teens into trying smoking - and lead them onto smoking 'real' cigarettes, researchers have warned. They found one-third of Hawaiian teens have tried e-cigarettes - half of whom have never used another tobacco product. They claim if a similar pattern was repeated in the US, it could lead to a 'epidemic of teen tobacco use'. Scroll down for video . E-cigarettes were found to be less addictive - but researchers say they could still be harmful to health . There are currently more than 400 brands of 'e-cigs' available. E-cigs contain far fewer cancer-causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes, however their long-term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown. The popularity of e-cigarettes, which typically deliver nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and flavorings through inhaled vapor, has increased in the past five years. 'The concern is that e-cigarette advertising is recruiting intermediate risk adolescents to nicotine use- kids who would not otherwise have started smoking,' said James Sargent, of Dartmouth Hitchcock's Norris Cotton Cancer Center in a paper published  in the journal Pediatrics. 'These are kids who might go on to smoke cigarettes, which are much better at delivering nicotine than e-cigarettes. 'If this pattern of use is adopted by adolescents in the continental U.S., we could be in for an epidemic of teen tobacco use in this country that could greatly reduce the overall benefits to public health of e-cigarettes.' Researchers from Dartmouth and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center collaborated in the 2013 survey-based study of 1,941 adolescents aged 14-15 years old in public and private schools in Hawaii. Cigarettes are highly taxed in Hawaii and e-cigarettes, with their potent combination of lower cost and kid-friendly flavours such as mango and pineapple, may be more attractive to teens. Thomas Wills, PhD, of the UH Cancer Center, said e-cigarettes, which are widely available in Hawaii, marketing is 'very aggressive here.' He added that manufacturers place ads in venues such as movie theaters where adolescents socialize, as well as on radio and television. Nearly nine per cent of eighth graders have admitted using an e-cigarette, compared with four per cent who have taken a normal cigarette. Professor Lloyd Jonson of the University of Michigan said: 'I worry that the tremendous progress that we've made over the last almost two decades in smoking could be reversed on us by the introduction of e-cigarettes.' E-cigarettes have been on sale in the United States since 2006, but this is the first year that the Centers for Disease Control  has measured their use. 'This is a markedly different pattern of use compared to their peers in the continental U.S., where teen e-cigarette use is less than half that rate and e-cigarette users are mainly also cigarette smokers (dual-users),' reported the team. Sargent and collaborators were so concerned about the findings that they submitted them to the FDA docket to inform proposed regulations on e-cigarettes. They note that favouring packaging, and marketing of e-cigarettes is not regulated, and that manufacturers' opportunities to target adolescents are wide open, absent FDA regulation of these products. A recent study found e-cigarettes are less addictive than cigarettes for former smokers, researchers have proved. The research sheds new light on how nicotine addiction works. However, experts warn the long term health risk of e-cigarettes are still unknown. 'We found that e-cigarettes appear to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes in a large sample of long-term users,' said Jonathan Foulds, professor of public health sciences and psychiatry, Penn State College of Medicine. The popularity of e-cigarettes, which typically deliver nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and flavourings through inhaled vapour, has increased in the past five years. The investigators assessed risk status for three groups (non-users, e-cigarette-only users, and dual-users) on variables that predict future use of cigarettes, and found the e-cigarette-only users to have risk that was in between the never-smokers and dual-users. Statistical analysis examined risk and protective variables across a spectrum of use, comparing never-smokers with e-cigarette-only users and e-cigarette-only users with dual-users. Risk factors for smoking cigarettes include protective variables such as parental support and academic involvement, in addition to risk factors including peer smoking and sensation seeking. On almost all of those measures, e-cigarette users ranked somewhere between the never-smokers and the dual-users. There are currently more than 400 brands of 'e-cigs' available in the US. E-cigs contain far fewer cancer-causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes, however their long-term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown. To study e-cigarette dependence, the researchers developed an online survey, including questions designed to assess previous dependence on cigarettes and almost identical questions to assess current dependence on e-cigs. More than 3,500 current users of e-cigs who were ex-cigarette smokers completed the Penn State Cigarette Dependence Index and the Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index. Higher nicotine concentration in e-cig liquid, as well as use of advanced second-generation e-cigs, which deliver nicotine more efficiently than earlier 'cigalikes,' predicted dependence. Consumers who had used e-cigs longer also appeared to be more addicted.","Currently more than 400 brands of e-cigarettes available in the US .

"A Colorado man has been sentenced  to 80 years in prison for kidnapping and murdering a Montana teacher just moments after she had left her home in 2012. Lester Van Waters Jr., 50, was found guilty of killing Sherry Arnold, 43, in Sidney, Montana, and burying her body 50 miles away in North Dakota while high on crack cocaine. His accomplice Michael Keith Spell, 24, pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide in October. Lester Van Waters Jr. 50, one of two suspects charged with the aggravated kidnapping of 43-year-old teacher Sherry Arnold from Sidney, Montana, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison . Waters will not be eligible for parole for at least 20 years under the terms of the sentence after pleading guilty last year to deliberate homicide by accountability. Authorities said Waters and Spell killed the Sidney High School math teacher during an attempted abduction just blocks from her house on January 7, 2012. The court heard that Arnold struggled as she was dragged to a vehicle and ultimately lost consciousness. Her body was found more than two months later buried in a rural area of North Dakota. Spell and Waters had traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and previous testimony from the men. They had told friends and family they were searching for work in the Bakken oil fields along the Montana-North Dakota border, where an oil boom has boosted agricultural communities but brought a spike in crime. The 43-year-old was out jogging just blocks away from her home when Waters and his accomplice Michael Keith Spell tried to abduct her while high on crack cocaine . During their journey from Colorado, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack 'brought the devil out in him' and began talking about kidnapping and killing a female, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Authorities said Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated after Spell tried to grab her. Spell said during a change-of-plea hearing in October that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Waters made a deal with prosecutors that called for him to testify against Spell if the case went to trial. In exchange, Waters was spared the death penalty and prosecutors recommended he receive 100 years prison with 20 years suspended. His accomplice Michael Keith Spell, 24, pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide in October. He told the court Arnold struggled as they tried to drag her to a car and she ultimately lost consciousness . Prosecutors called two people to testify during Monday's hearing: FBI agent Craig Overby and state probation officer Wally Peter. Private investigator Richard Wood testified on behalf of the defense. Waters had a lengthy criminal background in Florida, where he lived until after his most recent release from prison in August 2010. Beginning in the late 1980s, he had several stints in jail in Florida's Indian River County and served three state prison sentences between 2002 and 2010. Spell has pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide. His sentencing has not been scheduled.","Lester Van Waters Jr., 50 was found guilty of murdering Sherry Arnold, 43 .

"Arrested: 33-year-old Adam Robin Green broke into a downtown Salt Lake City theater . Authorities are investigating after a man was arrested, accused of allegedly trying to kidnap a girl at knife-point at a theater over the weekend. Police in Utah haven now arrested 33-year-old Adam Robin Green who they say broke into a downtown Salt Lake City theater and tried to abduct 12-year-old actress. Salt Lake City police say  Green entered the Off Broadway Theatre through a backdoor on Saturday night and entered a hallway restricted to cast and crew. He had a knife and waited for a 12-year-old girl to walk down the hallway before jumping out behind her. When the girl turned, she told authorities she saw Green with a knife in his right hand and she ran the other way. Salt Lake City Police Detective Greg Wilking says the girl ran and Green fled the theater. A short time later, police were called to a fast food restaurant where a man was acting 'bizarre.' Arriving officers said Green was talking to himself and 'behaving strangely.' When the officers realized he matched the description from the Off Broadway Theatre incident, he was taken into custody. Scene: Green was spotted with a knife in his hand and he went to attack the 12-year-old actress at the Off Broadway Theatre . Wilking says there are no indications Green targeted the girl before seeing her in the hallway. Green is being held in Salt Lake County jail on suspicion of burglary, kidnapping and assault. The man was already facing a charge or aggravated assault for a separate November 1st incident, according to court records. In that case, Green allegedly threatened to 'smash' his roommate's head for moving his chairs. He then hit his roommate on the head with a broom, attempted to hit him with a rock, strangled his roommate and extinguished a cigarette on his forehead, charging documents state.","33-year-old Adam Robin Green broke into a downtown Salt Lake City theater .

"A barrister who is 19 weeks pregnant escaped from the Sydney siege only to hear the heartbreaking news that her friend and colleague had tragically not survived. Julie Taylor worked with another barrister Katrina Dawson, 38, at Eighth Floor Selborne chambers in Phillip Street near to where the hostage crisis took place inside the Lindt Chocolat Cafe. It is believed that the two were getting coffee together in the cafe when Man Haron Monis, 49, entered and suddenly brought Sydney to a standstill. Taylor survived the terrifying ordeal only to later hear the devastating news that her colleague at the law firm and mother-of-three, Dawson, 38, had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital after the siege. Scroll down for video . Taylor is a barrister with Eighth Floor Selborne chambers in Phillip Street near Martin Place . Taylor, 35, is in hospital being assessed. She is in a stable condition. During the hostage crisis Taylor had been chosen by Monis to give a speech on a chilling video outlining his demands. 'I'm Julie Taylor. I'm a barrister in Sydney. This is a message for Tony Abbott,' she said. Julie Taylor was picked by hostage taker Man Haron Monis to be in a video to list his demands . Katrina Dawson tragically died of a heart attack in hospital after the siege in Sydney . 'I ask for three simple things. That Tony Abbott calls him (the hostage taker) to have a short conversation if he does that five of us will be allowed to go. We can't understand why that hasn't happened. 'The second is that he wants the politicians to announce the truth – that this is an attack by Islamic State on  Australia. And if that is done two of us will be allowed to go. 'The third is that he wants an Islamic State flag delivered to us here, and if you do that then one of us will be allowed to go.' Taylor looked tired and drained, but composed as she made the speech. She gave it in front of a black and white Shahada flag held up by another hostage. The video lasted 44 seconds. The barrister specialises in commercial law and was admitted to the NSW Bar in 2007. She studied at the University of Western Australia and was admitted to practice as a lawyer in 2005. Just before all hell broke loose in the cafe Taylor was able to escape with two other hostages and they ran towards police with their arms raised. Fifteen minutes later police stormed the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in a hail of bullets. In the aftermath it was revealed that although Taylor had survived her colleague Dawson had not been so lucky.

"In 1950, Detroit was America's fifth largest city and one of the most prosperous on the back of its booming motor industry. It prompted the construction of skyscrapers on the banks of the river and the development of vast suburban housing projects in the surrounding areas. But almost 55 years on, a dwindling motor industry and a dramatic fall in blue collar jobs has caused people to leave the Michigan city, abandoning their homes and businesses. These aerial photos reveal the tiny urban island that is left - a clutter of high-rises surrounded by empty housing plots now covered in grass. There are vast areas of open spaces dotted with crumbling industrial buildings and barely-standing Victorian homes until you reach the upmarket suburbs. The land then fills up  with gated communities and huge estates complete with swimming pools, tennis courts and multi-car garages. Scroll down for video . Aerial photos show how downtown Detroit has been turned into a tiny urban island, surrounded by abandoned housing blocks . A  city block, that was once the site of the John A. Own Elementary School, has been covered in grass to hide the rubble and the remains of the building. It was demolished as part of an initiative to get rid of vacant schools . The Jefferson/Mack neighborhood, which has suffered high rates of abandonment. Since 1950, when Detroit was the fifth largest city in America, around 1.3million people have left . Few homes remain in the Brush Park neighborhood outside of the city, however work is being done to regenerate the area . Graffiti covers the walls of Victorian homes in the area. Many of the two-storey properties stand alone while the surrounding roads are practically cleared of cars . The Packard plant on the outskirts of the city, regarded as a sophisticated auto production facility when it opened in the early 1900s, is now in ruins. It is surrounded by blocks of houses that have been left empty . This area at the edge of downtown Detroit is covered with parking lots. Many are completely empty and some have simply been abandoned . The photos taken by pilot and aerial photographer Alex MacLean, and first published in the New York Times, show the empty parking lots in the city bordering rows where only one or two houses are left. Following the recession in 2008, the metropolitan area was covered in rubble left from demolished homes as the the foundations in between the remaining properties. Now these spaces have been covered over with grass creating a countryside just outside the dense urban area. One building, The Packard Plant, was home to a sophisticated automobile production facility in the early 1900s, now it lies in complete ruin. In Detroit, the median household income is just $26,955 - with many of the poorest residents taking home much less - compared to a higher $101,094 in the suburb Grosse Pointe Park. Similarly, the Motor City last year declared the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, while its neighbor's quaint shops, beer gardens and antiques stores are thriving with residents. And in relation to crime rate, Detroit's Precinct 4 takes an average of 30 minutes to respond to an incident, while Grosse Pointe Park police typically arrive in just 3.4. This is perhaps unsurprising considering that Detroit, once the industrial capital of the nation, was voted the most dangerous city in the country in 2012, for the fourth year in a row. The city, left ravaged by dwindling blue-collar jobs, the decline of the auto industry and rising unemployment. It has lost more than 200,000 residents in the last decade - and 1.3million since the 1950s - as citizens have fled the blighted city for better-off suburbs with lower crime and better education. Cordons surround the foundations where houses have been knocked down in the Fitzgerald neighborhood. Those still standing have boarded-up doors and windows . Beyond the collection of empty properties and crumbling industrial buildings lie the sprawling estates. This home in West Bloomfield, Michigan, is around 25 miles outside of Detroit . Just 10 miles from downtown Detroit is this mansion which sits on the banks of Lake St. Clair. The gated communities outside of the city have remained despite the 2008 recession and the declaration of bankruptcy . The historic James Scott Mansion, that was built in 1877, was abandoned and its structure is now crumbling. Developers have reportedly said it will take $7million of investment to restore it . Some of the spaces left vacant by abandoned houses have been turned into community gardens. In this North Cass Community Garden, there are 75 plots distributed to local businesses and residents . An enormous swimming pool and tennis court can be seen outside this enormous property in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, around 25 miles northwest of downtown Detroit . Earlier this year, the 'haves' of Grosse Pointe Park erected a fence on Kercheval Road, one of the few streets via which drivers can access Detroit. Officials claimed it was set up for a farmers' market, but the move sparked anger among Detroit residents. And last winter, the suburb allegedly deliberately plowed snow to form another barrier. The tension is such that at the five Grosse Pointe municipalities, dubbed 'the Pointes', residents must show an ID to enter public parks. It has also been reported that newly-elected Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has now signed a deal with Grosse Pointe Park that could help ease the tensions. In accordance with the deal, Detroit will tear down some of the dilapidated houses around the border, while Grosse Pointe Park will remove the 'haves/have-nots' fences in return, it is said. In the booming post-Second World War era, Detroit was America's fifth-largest city, boasting an enormous population of 1,850,000 in 1950. The roofs of the houses in have crumbled and some have burned in Buena Vista Street in West Highland Park. Only one car sits outside a house on the street . Graffiti covers the walls of the buildings left in the East Market District. Many are still occupied but some have been left surrounded by rubble and debris .

"British artist Jane Perkins, a self-described 're-maker,' uses discarded plastic objects to re-create iconic portraits, including those of the Mona Lisa, Michael Jackson, Albert Einstein and the Royal Family.

'I tend to live with a piece for a while to make sure it works,' she explains of her process, which takes an average of three weeks per portrait. 'Usually, I run out of a particular color and have to go out searching in order to finish a piece.' Ms Perkins uses a glue gun to affix the objects initially, so that she can 'pull things off' and move them around. 'When I'm happy with the final result, I paint the whole work with a layer of diluted PVA glue,' she writes.

"The parents of the 34-year-old Lindt café manager who was taken hostage and killed during the 16-hour siege in Sydney have paid tribute to their ‘beautiful boy’. Tori Johnson, who was working at the café in Martin Place on Monday when self-described radical cleric Man Haron Monis stormed the building with a gun, has been hailed a hero after details emerged of how he tried to overpower the gunman to protect his staff and customers. Mr Johnson’s parents Ken and Rowena said, in a statement via radio host Ben Fordham: ‘We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for.’ The devastated family said they ‘feel heartfelt sorrow for the family of Katrina Dawson’, a 38-year-old mother of three and the second victim of the siege. Tori Johnson worked as a manager at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, central Sydney, for two years . ‘We'd like to thank not only our friends and loved ones for their support, but the people of Sydney; Australia and those around the world for reaching out with their thoughts and prayers,’ they said. ‘Our deepest gratitude to the NSW police, armed forces and paramedics for their tireless efforts. ‘We ask that the media respects our privacy in this difficult time. Let us all pray for peace on earth.’ Meanwhile, Mr Johnson’s former boss at Adria restaurant in Sydney’s Darling Harbour, Peter Manettas, told Daily Mail Australia that he was ‘one of the most selfless men I ever met’. ‘He was the kind of person to put his staff before himself every day of the week, he was an extraordinary and hospitable leader and we are all deeply saddened,’ Mr Manettas said. Asked whether he was surprised at reports that Mr Johnson may have tried to wrestle the gunman to help others to safety, Mr Manettas said: ‘He was a leader… he was a leader in every aspect of the word.’ The 34-year-old has been described as an 'extraordinary and hospitable leader' Mr Johnson's brave actions reportedly prompted police to storm the cafe with assault rifles and stun grenades as the 16-hour siege was ended . After Mr Johnson left his role as restaurant manager at Adria and began working at the Lindt café in October 2012, he stayed in touch with his former colleagues. ‘We’re a family run company and everyone who works with us is a part of that family. We still had a lot of contact with Tori after he left and he gave them advice and taught them things in every aspect of what he did,’ he said. Mr Manettas explained Mr Johnson was from a close family: ‘I know how much his family meant to him and a day wouldn’t go by when he didn’t talk about them and their achievements. ‘He was a very proud man.’ Friend of Tori Johnson, Genevieve Collier, wrote a tribute to her former colleague on Facebook . A friend and former colleague, Genevieve Collier, wrote on Facebook: 'R.I.P Tori Johnson, at times we both hated each other, and at other times we'd be hysterically laughing. 'You gave me so many chances even when I was a little s**t eating all the lindor balls and pretending I was a barista. You had a good heart, and I knew you were in there protecting everyone.' Mr Johnson's brave actions reportedly prompted police to storm the cafe with assault rifles and stun grenades. But the 34-year-old man paid with his own life as Monis, 50, turned a shotgun on him and fired. Premier Mike Baird lays flowers at a memorial near the Lindt chocolate cafe in Martin Place on Tuesday . A New South Wales police officer carries a bouquet under a police line . Representatives of the Muslim community came to lay flowers at the memorial . Monis was also shot dead after police burst into the Martin Place cafe at 2.11am Tuesday and opened fire. It has emerged the gunman was a self-styled sheik from Iran who arrived in Australia in 1996 and was on bail for being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, allegedly carried out by his current partner. Monis also faced 40 charges of indecent and sexual assault during his time as a 'spiritual healer' and has appeared in court for sending hate-filled letters to the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Also killed in the siege was barrister and mother of three, Katrina Dawson, 38, who worked in legal chambers opposite the café.

"President Obama left a New Jersey military audience awkwardly silent Monday with an awkward Christmas joke that totally bombed. 'You never stop giving,' Obama told a Fort Dix audience of military members and their families. 'You guys are like Santa in fatigues.' Only a polite chuckle followed. Scroll down for video... Bombed: President Obama's 'Santa in fatigues' joke bombed at a New Jersey military base . Crickets: The audience fell silent following the joke, which the president made Monday at Ft. Dix in New Jersey . According to Business Insider, the president managed to salvage the humorous moment with another joke comparing a cargo plane that sat nearby to Santa's reindeer-drawn ride. 'Although I'll bet one of those C-130's is a little more efficient than Santa's sleigh,' he said. The audience reacted slightly better that time. Obama spoke to hundreds of the camouflage-wearing troops in a hangar at Fort Dix to thank the U.S. military for its actions around the world. In a display of bipartisan support for the troops, Obama was joined by New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie, a potential candidate to succeed Obama in 2016. The U.S.-led coalition in Syria and Iraq has had some successes against the Islamic State group but has yet to force a major rollback from the territorial gains the extremists made in seizing large swathes of Iraq last summer. 'Make no mistake. Our coalition isn't just going to degrade this barbaric terrorist organization. We're going to destroy it,' Obama said. 'Although I'll bet one of those C-130's is a little more efficient than Santa's sleigh,' was the president's follow-up quip. It got a bit more of a laugh . Obama said gains are being made. Hundreds of vehicles and tanks and more than 1,000 fighting positions have been taken out, he said. 'We are hammering these terrorists,' he said. 'They may think that they can chalk up some quick victories, but our reach is long. We do not give up. You threaten America, you will have no safe haven. We will find you and like petty tyrants and terrorists before you, the world is going to leave you behind and keep moving on without you, because we will get you,' Obama said. Obama also said the United States is on track to end its combat mission in Afghanistan at year's end, leaving behind a force dedicated to training Afghan security forces and carrying out counter-terrorism operations. Obama last month approved a slight expansion in the U.S. role in the counter-terrorism operations. There are concerns in Afghanistan, however, about increasing Taliban attacks in the capital, Kabul. Obama, who made ending the war in Afghanistan a priority, said challenges remain there. New Jersey mayor and potential Obama replacement Chris Christie was there to greet the president, as were Newark mayor turned U.S. Senator Cory Booker and Senator Robert Menendez .","The president got nothing but a polite chuckle or two after comparing his audience with Saint Nick on Monday .

"They were guests at the royal wedding and count the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge among their closest friends. But the connections were not much use when TV adventurer Ben Fogle and his wife ordered birthday decorations from the Middleton family firm, Party Pieces. The company failed to deliver items in time for Ludo Fogle’s fifth birthday celebration and could only manage a lacklustre apology when his mother confronted them about the ‘disappointing’ service.

The Party Pieces message read: ‘@FogleMarina Apologies again, we understand our customer services manager has refunded you and is sending a small gift by way of apology.’ But there was no reply from Mrs Fogle, a former party planner and caterer, who organised a children’s party at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s 80th birthday.

"Hundreds of online gamers saw months of work building gigantic warships in a massive community sci-fi game go up in smoke - all thanks to the rather earthly reason of an unpaid bill. The virtual payment was supposed to ensure that an area of the galaxy in EVE Online was fortified, but the lapse allowed one side to launch a surprise attack. Some were asleep when it happened and woke up to text alerts telling them the bad news. Scroll down for video . An unpaid bill in the online role-playing game EVE Online has led to a virtual space battle involving thousands of players with costly losses in real-world money . In EVE Online, more than 500,000 players . pilot starships, trade goods and engage in sci-fi espionage – and on . Monday morning, the biggest battle the game has ever seen lasting 14 hours and involving . more than 4,000 players, erupted. EVE Online uses an in-game currency that can be calculated in real-world cash, and the damage from Monday's conflict would have cost $300,000 in the real world. During the encounter more than 100 Titan vessels were destroyed. The megaships, which are akin to the Death Star from Star Wars, are the largest ships in the game and are worth about $3,000 each in real-world money. Players from one side saw months of work building warships go up in smoke because an unpaid online bill enable their enemies to launch a surprise attack . Monday's EVE Online battle was so huge that it actually put the game's servers under strain . The Titans also take months for gamers to build - that's months in real time, a lot of nights, weekends and days-off actually spent building. The battle was so complex that at the time of writing, the full results still hadn't been calculated. Monday’s skirmish first erupted after a member of gamer James Carl’s coalition missed a payment to protect an area that's been used as a staging ground for a war raging between Carl's Pandemic and N3 coalition versus CFC and Russian forces. The 29-year-old from Costa Mesa, California, said: ‘Supposedly, it was set up for auto-pay, just like any other bill in real life, but either that didn't happen or the money wasn't in the wallet, and then everything just escalated out of control from there. ‘The dust is still settling on that issue. Everyone is just focused right now on fighting to try to regain control of the system.’ Carl was awakened by a messaging app on his phone used by alliance members alerting him that their system B-R5RB was under attack by rivals. He wasn't scheduled to work in real life Monday, so he spent the entire day sending virtual ships into the fray. He said dozens of his alliance members took the day off work to join the fight, which is being waged by more than 4,000 players - and spectated by thousands more on the game streaming service Twitch. Monday’s battle was so huge that it actually put the game’s servers under strain. ‘I'd be lying if I said our servers weren't sweating a bit,’ said ‘EVE Online’ spokesman Ned Coker of CCP Games, the Reykjavik, Iceland-based video game developer who created the online universe. ‘Allowing players free movement wherever they want in a game with over half a million players means for some pretty tricky technological requirements.’ To compensate for thousands of starship captains battling each other online, Coker said CCP Games instituted what it calls ‘time dilation,’ which slows down the game's servers to about 10 percent of normal time, so players aren't dropped and their commands are issued in the order in which they were received. Carl said it's made for a massive but slow battle. The real-world value of ‘EVE Online’ currency is based on an actual exchange rate set up for the game. But the primary basis for value in the game's virtual economy is the time and skill that gamers put into such concepts as the mining of minerals, the selling of goods and services, or the stealing of goods and money (just don't get caught). However, if players want a shortcut, they can put real-world money into the game to buy ‘EVE’ currency determined by the exchange rate, but the money can only be exchanged from real to virtual. Meanwhile, Carl is optimistic his coalition will recover from the latest ‘EVE’ upheaval. ‘It looks like CFC is winning, but we're hoping now that all of our U.S. players are online, we'll turn the tide,’ said Carl. ‘Whatever happens, we'll keep going. `EVE' is a universe full of grudges and constantly changing politics. If we were to lose, we'll rebuild. Then, we'll go back and start another war.’","Multiplayer game EVE Online saw its biggest ever battle erupt on Monday .

"Egypt's ruling party is paying gangs of thugs to sexually assault women protesting in Cairo's Tahrir Square against President Mohamed Morsi, activists said. They also said the Muslim Brotherhood is paying gangs to beat up men who are taking part in the latest round of protests, which followed a decree by President Morsi to give himself sweeping new powers. It comes as the Muslim Brotherhood co-ordinated a demonstration today in support of President Mohamed Morsi, who is rushing through a constitution to try to defuse opposition fury over his newly expanded powers. Scroll down for video . Danger: women protesting in Cairo's Tahrir Square face the increased danger of sexual assault by large gangs of men . Egyptian supporters of Muslim Brotherhood taking part in a  demonstration near Cairo University, in Cairo, in support of President Mohamed Morsi's recent constitutional declaration . Just 24 hours earlier around 200,000 . people gathered in Tahrir Square, the heart of last year's revolution . which toppled President Hosni Mubarak, yesterday to protest against a . new draft constitution. Large marches from around Cairo flowed into the square, chanting 'Constitution: Void!' and The people want to bring down the regime.' But amid the calls for democracy a sinister threat has emerged. Magda Adly, the director of the Nadeem Centre for Human Rights, said that under Mubarak, the Government paid thugs to beat male protestors and sexually assault women. 'This is still happening now,' she told The Times. 'I believe thugs are being paid money to do this ... the Muslim Brotherhood have the same political approaches as Mubarak,' she said. Huge rally: Tens of thousands of Islamists demonstrated in Cairo today in support of Morsi . Devout: Muslim Brotherhood supporters  perform a prayer as they stage a rally in front of Cairo's University . One protestor, Yasmine, told the . newspaper how she had been in the square filming the demonstrations for a . few hours when the crowd suddenly turned. Before . she knew what was happening, about 50 men had surrounded her and began . grabbing her breasts. She said they ripped off her clothes, starting . with her headscarf and for nearly an hour, indecently assaulted her with . their hands. A few men . tried to help her but they were beaten away. Eventually some residents . who had seen the attack from their windows came to her aid and an . elderly couple pulled her into their home. She suffered internal . injuries and was unable to walk for a week. Four of Yasmine's friends were also sexually assaulted in the square that day, in the summer. Show of force: Today's rally, organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, are an attempt to counteract large opposition protests held earlier this week by liberal and secular groups . Protest: liberal opponents of President Morsi took to the streets yesterday angry at his decision to grant himself sweeping new powers . Afaf el-Sayed, a journalist and . activist, told the newspaper she was assaulted by a group of men while . protesting in Tahrir Square just over a month ago and she was sure her . attackers were 'thugs from the Muslim Brotherhood'. In February 2011 the correspondent for the American network CBS, Lara Logan, . endured a half-hour sexual assault in Tahrir Square by a group of men. She said after the ordeal that she had been 'raped with their hands'. While . the exact frequency of these attacks is unknown, activists have . reported nearly 20 attacks in the last ten days and say there has been a . dramatic increase in mob sex attacks on protestors in the last year. Most . attacks take place in one particular corner of the square, at roughly . the same time every evening, and usually starts with a group of men . forming a human chain around women as if to protect them. Sit in: Anti-Morsi protesters gather in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night . Terror: CBS Correspondent Lara Logan described her assault by a mob in Tahrir Square as being 'raped with their hands'. This photo was taken moments before the attack . Yasmine said she was almost sure the . assault was planned. She managed to throw her camera to a friend and was . able to watch the footage later. She told The Times: 'Just before the . attack it looks like men are getting into position. They look like . they're up to something, they don't look like random protestors.' The . newspaper spoke to two men who admitted they were paid to target female . protestors. Victor and Tutu, both in their thirties, said they operate . in a group of around 65 local men and got paid between £10 and £20 a . time. But they would not reveal who pays them. 'We're . told to go out and sexually harass girls so they leave the . demonstration,' Victor told The Times. He said the aim was to cause . disruption and instil fear in protesters. He said members of the public . sometimes joined in. Protestors in Tahrir Square yesterday angrily vowed to bring down a draft constitution approved by allies of President Morsi. Face-off: Some demonstrators yesterday wore masks, such as this man, who has an 'anonymous' mask on the back of his head similar to those worn by Occupy protestors in the US last year . Religious liberty: although this protestor holds up a Qu'ran and a crucifix, human rights groups warn that the draft constitution is bad news for minorities in Egypt such as the Coptic Christian community . The protests have highlighted an . increasingly united opposition leadership of prominent liberal and . secular politicians trying to direct public anger against Morsi and the . Islamists - a contrast to the leaderless youth uprising last year which . toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Figures . from a new leadership coalition took the stage to address the crowds. The coalition, known as the National Salvation Front, includes prominent . democracy advocate Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, leftist . Hamdeen Sabbahi and former Arab League chief Amr Moussa. 'We . are determined to continue with all peaceful means, whatever it takes . to defend our legitimate rights,' ElBaradei told the crowd. He later . posted on Twitter that Morsi and his allies are ""staging a coup against . democracy"" and that the regime's legitimacy 'is eroding'. Sabbahi vowed protests would go on until 'we topple the constitution'. The . opposition announced plans for an intensified street campaign of . protests and civil disobedience and even a possible march on Morsi's . presidential palace to prevent him from calling a nationwide referendum . on the draft, which it must pass to come into effect. Top judges . announced Friday they may refuse to monitor any referendum, rendering it . invalid. Oppression: An anti-Morsi protester chains his hands during yesterday's demonstrations, to symbolise the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood . A protester in a Pharaoh headdress holds up a placard reading 'no to a dictator' during a demonstration on Tahrir Square on Friday . If a referendum is called, 'we will go to him at the palace and topple him,' insisted one protester, Yasser Said, a businessman who said he voted for Morsi in last summer's presidential election. Islamists, however, are gearing up as well. The Muslim Brotherhood drummed up supporters for its own mass rally today and boasted the turnout would show that the public supports Morsi's efforts to push through a constitution. Brotherhood activists in several cities handed out fliers calling for people to come out and ""support Islamic law"". A number of Muslim clerics in Friday sermons in the southern city of Assiut called the president's opponents ""enemies of God and Islam"". The week-long unrest has already seen . clashes between Islamists and the opposition that left two dead and . hundreds injured. On Friday, Morsi opponents and supporters rained . stones and firebombs on each other in the cities of Alexandria and . Luxor. Struggle: opponents of President Morsi vowed to keep fighting until the constitution rushed through by the Government is thrown out . Supporters of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi chant pro-Morsi slogans during a protest in front of the Sultan Hassan and Refaie Mosques' at the old town in Cairo on Friday . The Islamist-led assembly that worked on the draft for months passed it in a rushed, 16-hour session that lasted until sunrise on Friday. The vote was abruptly moved up to pass the draft before Egypt's Constitutional Court rules on Sunday whether to dissolve the assembly. Liberal, secular and Christian members and secular members had already quit the council to protest what they call Islamists' hijacking of the process. The draft was to be sent to Morsi today to decide on a date for a referendum, possibly in mid-December. The draft has a distinctive Islamic bent - enough to worry many that civil liberties could be restricted, though its provisions for enforcing Sharia, or Islamic law, are not as firm as ultra-conservatives wished. Protests were first sparked when Morsi last week issued decrees granting himself sweeping powers that neutralized the judiciary. Morsi said the move was needed to stop the courts - where anti-Islamist or Mubarak-era judges hold many powerful posts - from dissolving the assembly and further delaying Egypt's transition. Opponents, however, accused Morsi of grabbing near-dictatorial powers by sidelining the one branch of government he doesn't control.","Activists claim there have been nearly 20 attacks in the last 10 days .

"The PGA of America president referred to Ian Poulter as a little girl on two social media accounts  for his criticism of the jobs Nick Faldo and Tom Watson did as Ryder Cup captains. Faldo, who won six majors and is regarded among Britain's greatest players, was captain of the last European team that lost the Ryder Cup in 2008. Watson, who has five British Open titles among his eight majors, was captain of the US team that lost at Gleneagles last month. Poulter, a European stalwart with a 12-4-2 record in the Ryder Cup, criticised both in his book, 'No Limits,' which was released this week. Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter has been slammed for his criticism of Nick Faldo and Tom Watson . PGA President Ted Bishop was with Faldo on Thursday at The Greenbrier for the 'Faldo Series' junior program when he tweeted to Poulter: 'Faldo's record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl.' In a separate posting on his Facebook page, Bishop lamented that athletes who had 'lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticised the icons.' He mentioned Watson's eight majors and 10-3-1 record in the Ryder Cup, and Faldo's six majors and record with most Ryder Cup points in history getting 'bashed' by Poulter. 'Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C'MON MAN!' USA's Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson has come under fire from Poulter for his performance at the Ryder Cup . The PGA of America said Bishop 'realised that his post was inappropriate and promptly removed it'. Bishop said in an email Thursday night: 'Obviously I could have selected some different ways to express my thoughts on Poulter's remarks. Golf had always been a sport where respect was shown to its icons. That seems to have gone by the wayside.' Poulter had tweeted before leaving for China: 'I guess we can only have opinions if you won a major or 6.' He was not aware of Bishop's tweet until he landed and was inundated with messages. Poulter said in a brief telephone interview that he was disappointed in Bishop's tweet and that he would comment later. Nick Faldo, skipper of the last European team that lost in 2008, has also come in for some stick . Watson benched Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley for both sessions on Saturday at the Ryder Cup as the Americans fell behind. He also played Webb Simpson, one of his captain's picks, only once. Europe won 16 1/2-11 1/2, its eighth win in the last 10 Ryder Cups. Mickelson indirectly criticised Watson in the closing press conference by saying the Americans had strayed from a winning formula and there was no room for player input under Watson's captaincy. Watson later wrote an 'open letter' accepting responsibility for his style. Poulter in his book said that Watson's decision-making 'completely baffles me'. He was referring to benching Mickelson and Keegan Bradley on Saturday. Ted Bishop (right) called Poulter a 'lil girl' on social media, but later deleted the posts . Faldo stirred up the European team on Friday when he said during his Golf Channel commentary that Sergio Garcia was 'useless' in 2008 during the European loss at Valhalla and that he had a 'bad attitude'. Faldo later explained in an interview with the AP that Garcia has emotional and physical problems and at one point told Faldo he didn't want to play. 'Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,' Poulter said in his book. He noted that it was Europe's only loss in the last 15 years and Faldo was the captain. 'So who's useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.' Poulter was a captain's pick that year. Bishop's two-year term as president expires next month at the PGA annual meeting. Bishop chose Watson as the Ryder Cup captain - at 65, the oldest in Ryder Cup history. He recently announced a task force to help solve America's recent losing streak in the Ryder Cup.","Ian Poulter slammed Nick Faldo and Tom Watson .

"The next 9/11-style terrorist attack will come from Iraq and Syria if the Iraqi government collapses, Senator Lindsey Graham said on Sunday. 'According . to our own Director of National Intelligence, FBI director, . the next 9/11 is coming from here,' Graham (R-S.C.) said to Bob Schieffer on CBS's 'Face the Nation.' When asked about his personal opinion, Graham said he agreed with that statement and that another 9/11 attack was 'inevitable.' 'The seeds of 9/11s are being planted all over Iraq and Syria,' he said. Graham made the remarks while speaking about militant Sunni group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) movement toward Baghdad. Scroll down for video . 'Inevitable': Sen. Lindsey Graham, pictured on 'Face the Nation,' said the next 9/11-style terrorist attack will come from Iraq and Syria if ISIS takes Baghdad . 'You . don't have to believe me,' Graham continued. 'This is what they're telling . you they're going to do. They're not hiding their agenda. They want an . Islamic caliphate that runs through Syria and Iraq. 'They're . going to take the king of Jordan down because he's an infidel in their . eyes as much as we are and they plan to drive us out of the Mideast by . attacking us here at home.' Graham also said the United States' '[needs] air power immediately to stop the [ISIS] advance toward Baghdad.' ISIS, he said, will also move into Jordan and Lebanon. While speaking on 'Face the Nation,' Graham criticized the leadership of Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's leadership - and said he must step down. Get out! Graham, seen in this file photo, also called for al-Maliki to step down . 'Maliki is a flawed, leader, Bob. He - he has to go. There's no way that Maliki can bring this country back together,' Graham said on the CBS program. Though Graham advocated air support in Baghdad, he noted the possibility of civilian casualties. 'The Iraqi Air Force is basically grounded,' he said. 'Without American air power it's going to be hard to turn the tide.' Graham said the US will 'probably' need help from the Sunni Iranians, whom he said wanted southern Iraq, but compared the partnership to working with Stalin during World War II. 'We're going to have to have some dialogue with Iranians that say, let's coordinate our efforts, but put a redline to the Iranians,' he said.

"A student suffered horrific burns after he was forced to peel his arm off a searing-hot radiator which he had fallen asleep against when he was drunk. The 21-year-old, who did not want to be named, said he had come home after a night out in Plymouth in Devon and decided to take a nap against the radiator, which he said was cold at the time. But the third year engineering student at Plymouth University soon found himself in hospital and on an IV drip after he suffered severe burns when he woke up with his arm stuck to the hot radiator. A 21-year-old student was left with horrific burns (left) and scars (right) after he drunkenly fell asleep against a radiator after a night out, and woke up at his home in Plymouth to find he had been stuck to the hot radiator . He still has scars from the incident and was also given antibiotics to treat his arm. 'It all started when I was out at the Christmas party for a gay pub I used to work at,' he said. 'The vodka and beers were flying everywhere and I took it a bit far. 'When I came back I was hammered and I fell asleep against the radiator which was cold at the time. 'I woke up a few hours later when the radiator was steaming hot. 'I thought ""Jesus, my arm's stuck on a radiator, what am I going to do?"" I had to peel myself off. It really hurt.' The third year engineering student burnt himself using a UV lamp he mistook for a heater just days later . The student immediately took himself to hospital where doctors put him on a drip because they were concerned about his circulation in the burned arm. He received specialist burn treatment. He added: 'They gave me a special burn cream, painkillers and even antibiotics. I didn't take those in the end. 'It looked really nasty. My friends have been asking me if I'm okay and if I need any aloe vera.' And it appeared the student had failed to learn his lesson as just days later he managed to burn himself again, this time on a UV lamp that he had mistook for a heater at his student house.","Student came home after drunken party and took nap against cold radiator .

"They say you’re only as old as you feel. Now scientists have discovered the adage might actually be true. A study showed those who feel younger than they really are have a better life expectancy. Those who felt their age were more likely to die young – and people who felt older were at the greatest risk. Scientists have found that the younger people feel the longer they live - and maintaining a healthy weight helped increase life expectancy . Psychologists say self-perceived age is a quick and easy way to predict longevity. They claim that feeling younger than your actual age could be a combination of healthy lifestyle factors and a greater ‘will to live’. The research involved 6,500 older adults taking part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, who were asked to assess how old they felt and their death rates were analysed. The study led by University College London (UCL) scientists follows previous research which linked happiness and having a sense of purpose in life with a lower risk of death. Co-author Andrew Steptoe, British Heart Foundation Professor of Psychology, said many older people feel younger than their actual age. He said ‘People’s judgements about how old they feel are likely influenced by a number of factors – aches and pains, serious illness, feelings of vitality, what sorts of social and physical activity we do, and so on. Researchers asked 6,500 older people how old they felt then studied their health over an eight-year period . ‘What is interesting in this study is that when we took people’s health state, mobility and functioning into account, we still found an association between feeling older than one’s real age and greater mortality over the next eight years. ‘So some other factors seem to be contributing to the association between how old you feel and survival. ‘I don’t think that people should worry about this. But it’s certainly something that I as a medical researcher should try and understand. ‘The fact that such a quick and simple measure predicts longevity makes it worth pursuing. Perhaps these feelings tell us something that other measures of health and wellbeing do not capture.’ Of those who felt younger, 14 per cent had died in eight-year period compared to 25 per cent who said they felt older . The study participants had an average chronological age of 65.8 years but their average self-perceived age was 56.8 years. Almost 70 per cent felt three or more years younger than their actual age, while a quarter had a self-perceived age close to their real age. Around one in 20 felt more than a year older than their chronological age, says a report in JAMA Internal Medicine. Death rates over a follow-up period of eight years were 14.3 per cent in adults who felt younger and 18.5 percent in those who felt about their actual age. The rate reached its highest level of almost 25 per cent in those adults who felt older than they really were, according to the study results. The relationship between self-perceived age and cardiovascular death was strong but there was no link between self-perceived age and cancer death. The report said maintaining a healthy weight and following medical advice were typical of the healthy living behaviours that were measured. But, it said, other factors might be influential such as ‘greater resilience, sense of mastery and will to live’ among those who feel younger than their age. ‘Self-perceived age has the potential to change, so interventions may be possible. ‘Individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviours and attitudes toward aging’ the study concludes. The study comes after the Government has made a priority of improving national wellbeing through a series of measures at work and in the community.","Scientists from University College London asked people how old they felt .

"Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. Kicking-off in Spain, AS have made the bold statement that Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is better than the combined talents of Barcelona trio Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. Ronaldo is enjoying a stellar season, having netted 25 goals in 14 La Liga appearances for Real as they sit top of the table. Spain's AS (left) writes that Cristiano Ronaldo is better  than Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez combined . The 29-year-old's astonishing tally is one more than the total of Barcelona's front three - who all drew a blank in a frustrating 0-0 draw away to Getafe on Saturday. Real's No 7, who won the overseas BBC Sports Personality of the Year award on Sunday, is currently preparing for their Club World Cup challenge this month. Carlo Ancelotti's side go straight into the semi-finals of the tournament with AS and Marca both reporting on their relocation of their match in Morocco. Leading with the headline 'Operation Desert Storm', Marca states that a violent downpour has left the stadium in Rabat almost unplayable and that the European champions will now play their clash against CONCACAF winners Cruz Azul in Marrakech on Tuesday. Real drew Schalke in the Champions League draw on Monday, while Barcelona will face Manchester City. Over in Italy, Corriere dello Sport (right) leads with Roma closing the gap on league leaders Juventus to a point . Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo reports an 'imbalance' of penalty decisions in favour of Real this season, stating that the Bernabeu outfit have been awarded six more than Barcelona. Taking it further, Mundo's figures show that during his reign as Real president, Florentino Perez has seen his stars win an extra 18 penalties - emphasising the conspiracy theories that exists between both clubs. Over in Italy, the focus is on the title race in Serie A as second-place Roma reduced the gap to league leaders Juventus to one point. Corriere dello Sport reports that Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri was furious at his side drawing a 1-1 at home to Sampdoria on Sunday, while Radja Nainggolan's decisive strike at Genoa moves Roma closer to the summit of the league. Portugal papers A Bola (left) and Record both report on Benfica's 2-0 win at title rivals Porto on Sunday . Finally in Portugal, the fallout of Sunday's top of the table clash between Porto and Benfica continues. Brazilian forward Lima scored two opportunist goals to give champions Benfica a 2-0 away win over their rivals in the first Portuguese Classico of the season. The result was a significant one for the Eagles who claimed their first away triumph over their great rivals in the league for seven years - a historic feat that is noted both papers A Bola and Record.","Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 25 La Liga goals already this season .

"A fizzy drinks tax could save thousands of children from diabetes, a study has claimed (file photo) Thousands of children would be saved from diabetes, cancer and heart disease later in life if a 20p tax is added to the cost of sugary drinks, researchers have claimed. Health experts and Boris Johnson’s food adviser in London are pushing the idea under moves by the mayor and local authorities to devolve some taxation powers to the capital. Academics from the University of Liverpool calculated the effects of introducing a tax equivalent to 20p per litre in London with the aim of reducing consumption of the high-calorie drinks over 20 years. They calculated the levy would prevent 1,100 cases of cancer in the capital, reduce the number of people who develop diabetes by 6,300 and cut 4,300 from the total of those who suffer from coronary heart disease or strokes. The work also suggests the health service in London would save around £39million over 20 years. Based on these numbers, tens of thousands of disease cases nationwide could be prevented if the 20p per litre tax was adopted across the entire country. The figures were released by the Children’s Food Campaign, which proposes that any revenue generated by the tax would pay for programmes to improve children’s health. Malcolm Clark, Campaign co-ordinator of the CFC, said: ‘A duty on sugary drinks of 20 pence per litre would be the most practical and effective way of tackling a significant source of unnecessary calories and sugar in children and young people’s diets. ‘Mexico, France and Hungary have introduced a sugary drinks duty, and their citizens are reaping the benefits. 'Our politicians can no longer hide behind the idea that it wouldn’t be popular, or is an untried policy. ‘We urge London’s mayor and council leaders to include a sugary drinks duty in their review of how London might manage devolved taxation powers, and to make the case to Westminster for the introduction of such a duty nationally.' More than 60 organisations – including the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the British Dietetic Association, the Faculty of Public Health, CitizensUK, Netmums and Unison – have already backed the campaign. Rosie Boycott, who was appointed by Mr Johnson to run the London Food Board, said: ‘We need a tax on sugary drinks. Unhealthy: The proposed measure is the latest in a long line to curb deteriorating public health (file photo) ‘Sweetened fizzy drinks offer nothing to a city already suffering high levels of obesity-related diseases and dental decay,’ she said. ‘It would be good for our health and the environment if we drank less of them. In many areas, London has already been leading the charge in the battle to eat well. 'But we also need national action to ensure firms contribute to the overall health bill and encourage consumers to swap to healthier products.' Soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged four to ten and teenagers. A tax of 20p a litre would add around 7p to the price of a can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi. The idea is also supported by the internationally renowned surgeon Lord Darzi, of Imperial College London. Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: ‘This is a poorly thought out political proposal which will hit the poorest hardest while doing nothing to curb obesity, the causes of which are far more complex than this simplistic approach implies. ‘Evidence from France shows that while sales of soft drinks fell after a tax was introduced in 2012, they have increased since, with sales up 6 per cent in the first four months of this year. ‘Policy should be based on evidence, not a tendentious report based on a flawed model.’","Tax proposed by Children's Food Campaign would be 20p per litre .

"Ian Poulter has hit back at the president of the PGA of America for calling him a 'Lil Girl', labelling the comments 'pretty shocking and disappointing'.

Ted Bishop thought Poulter airing his opinion was disrespectful towards two of the greatest players of the game and made his thoughts known in a series of outbursts on his personal Twitter and Facebook pages in posts that have since been deleted.

He first wrote on Twitter: '@IanJamesPoulter -Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl. @NickFaldo006 @pgaofamerica.' Bishop then expanded his point on Facebook, saying: “Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticized the icons. 'Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really?

Nick Faldo, skipper of the last European team that lost in 2008, also came in for some stick . The 38-year-old questioned Watson in his book, saying his captaincy at the recent Ryder Cup - which Europe won 16 1/2-11 1/2 - was “utterly bizarre” and handed the initiative to Europe. Faldo, Europe’s all-time leading points scorer, also came in for criticism from Poulter for saying Sergio Garcia was 'useless' in 2008 in television commentary. 'Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,” Poulter wrote in ‘No Limits’. '[2008] is the only Ryder Cup we’ve lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain.

"It's a white supremacist organisation notorious for homophobic and racist violence, including the lynchings of black people. But the Ku Klux Klan is now looking to diversify and increase its membership to include Jews, black people, homosexuals and those of Hispanic origin with a re-branding as 'the new Klan'. All those wanting to join the extreme right-wing group will still have to wear the white robes, masks and conical hats and take part in rituals, according to founder John Abarr. The Ku Klux Klan is  looking to diversify and increase its membership to include Jews, black people, homosexuals and those of Hispanic origin with a re-branding as 'the new Klan' The rebranded organisation, called the Rocky Mountain Knights, claims to now stand for 'a strong America' rather than irrational hatred. 'White supremacy is the old Klan. This is the new Klan. The KKK is for a strong America,' said Mr Abarr. The move comes after the Klan organiser met with the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People. He said: 'I thought it was a really good organisation. I don't feel we need to be separate.' But Klan members have said Mr Abarr is trying to make the changes to further his own political career. The rebranded organisation, called the Rocky Mountain Knights, claims to now stand for 'a strong America' rather than irrational hatred . Bradley Jenkins, Imperial Wizard of the KKK, said: 'That man's going against everything the bylaws of the constitution of the KKK say. He's trying to hide behind the KKK to further his political career.' The Klan is classified as a hate group by the anti-semitism organistion Anti-Defamation League and the civil rights law firm Southern Poverty Law Center. But some black people have apparently already expressed an interest in joining, after Mr Abarr organised a summit with civil rights groups. The requirements for joining the new KKK group are to be aged over 18 and live in the Pacific Northwest. The first Klan was founded in 1865 in Pulaski, Tennessee, by six veterans of the Confederate Army. Similar groups spread throughout the South as an insurgent movement during the Reconstruction era in the United States. As a secret vigilante group, the Klan targeted freedmen and their allies and sought to restore white supremacy by threats and violence, including murder, against black and white Republicans. Today the organisation is made up of small, unconnected groups that use the KKK name and have emphasised secrecy and distinctive costumes. Recent estimates suggest there are between 5,000 and 8,000 members.","White supremacist group Ku Klux Klan  is re-branding as 'the new Klan'

"Shocking footage has surfaced of a Sudanese man being publicly beheaded in Saudi Arabia for being a 'sorcerer'. Crouched on his knees and blindfolded, Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki was executed in a car park Medina, in the west of the country, as dozens looked on last month. The grainy footage - which MailOnline believes is too graphic to publish - shows the executioner lining his sword up on the back of Abdul Hamid's neck, before one swift stroke decapitates him. Condemned: An executioner lines up his sword as he prepares to behead Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki for being a 'sorcerer' last year . The killer draws his sword back as dozens of people watch in the car park . The Sudanese man, who was killed on September 20, is believed to have been the 44th person executed in Saudi Arabia this year - and the 11th foreign national. The total for 2011 is 17 more than for the whole of 2010. Lebanese TV host  Ali Hussain Sibat, who was sentenced to death over making predictions of the future on his show, had been scheduled to be beheaded on Friday. His attorney May El Khansa said the execution did not take place on that day - but that did not mean Sibat has been given a reprieve. The alarming rise in the number of executions in the country has led to criticism from a number of human rights charities. Saudis are understood to prefer beheading by a sharp sword, as they think it more humane and quicker than electrocution and lethal injection. Amnesty International pleaded with King Abdullah but the Saudi monarch still allowed the killing of Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki for sorcery . And while the crime of 'sorcery' is undefined in . Saudi Arabian law, it has been used to punish people for the . legitimate exercise of their human rights. Abdul Hamid is understood to have been arrested in 2005 after he was entrapped by a man working . for the Mutawa'een (religious police). He was asked to concoct a spell . that would cause the officer's father to leave his second wife. According . to the officer's account Abdul Hamid agreed to carry out the curse in . exchange for 6,000 Saudi Arabian riyals (approximately £1,000). He was beaten after his arrest and thought to have been forced to admit to acts of sorcery. In a secret trial, where he was not allowed legal representation, he was sentenced to death by the General . Court in Medina in March 2007. Few details are available about his . trial but he is reported to have been tried behind closed doors and . without legal representation. At the time of his arrest, English language Saudi daily The Saudi Gazette ran an article entitled Magic Maids which said that 'we must face up to the threats from some maids and servants and their satanic games of witchcraft and sorcery, their robbery, murder, entrapment of husbands, corruption of children and other countless stories of crime that have been highlighted by both experts and victims of these crimes'. Sentenced to death: Lebanese TV host Ali Hussain Sibat still faces execution for 'predicting the future' Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Director for the Middle East and North Africa, heavily criticised the killing. He said: 'Abdul Hamid's execution is appalling as is Saudi Arabia's continuing use of this most cruel and extreme penalty. 'That he should have been executed without having committed anything that would appear to constitute a crime is yet another deeply upsetting example of why the Saudi Arabian government should immediately cease executions and take steps to abolish the death penalty.' The charity had campaigned on Abdul Hamid's behalf following his arrest and had urged Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to prevent his execution. But it has been to no avail, and since the end of the holy month of Ramadan a few weeks ago, the Saudi Arabian authorities have resumed executions at an alarming pace. According to Amnesty International seven people have been executed since the killings resumed on September 5. Some 140 prisoners are believed to be facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. And last December, Saudi Arabia was one of a minority of states that voted against a UN general assembly resolution calling for the worldwide moratorium on executions.","44 people have been executed in Saudi Arabia this year .

'The court-directed mediation process failed over the weekend to resolve the issue.' With a hearing expected to take place in February, McIlroy has opted to withdraw from two events in Shanghai at the end of this month and early next, the BMW Masters and World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions tournament, to prepare for the case, with millions of pounds at stake. McIlroy signed to Horizon in late 2011, only to begin proceedings against them almost a year ago, alleging the contract to be 'unconscionable' due to 'excessive commissions'. The Northern Irish golfer had hoped to settle the case via court-directed mediation, but that has failed . McIlroy will not play the BMW Masters and World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions tournament . Via a counter lawsuit, Horizon, instrumental in McIlroy's five-year contract with Nike worth £62million, are citing breach of contract and loss of future commissions. Calls for an out-of-court settlement from Mr Justice Peter McGovern, who predominantly sits on Ireland's Commercial Court, fell on deaf ears. McIlroy won back to back majors in 2014, the Open Championship followed by the PGA Championship . McIlroy will hope to be back on the course in time for 2015's first major, the Masters, which is in April . The concern now is how the trial will affect McIlroy's preparations for The Masters which is due to begin on April 9. At present, McIlroy is scheduled to play in two events in the Middle East in mid-to-late January, early February, along with the Honda Classic in West Palm Beach from February 26.

"If Accrington Stanley beat Yeovil on Tuesday, it could be worth as much as £250,000 to the club. But playing Manchester United would be about far more than money. They’re a lovely bunch of lads – just imagine how they’ll feel if Accy decide to switch the game to Old Trafford and they’re walking out at the Theatre of Dreams on January 4! Stop me if I’ve mentioned this before, but I’m a non-executive director at Accrington, and I can tell you they’ve got a smashing set-up there. Accrington players celebrate Shay McCartan's decisive goal against Morecambe in October . Luke Joyce celebrates scoring for Accrington in the same match earlier this season . Accrington could face a trip to Old Trafford if they make it through to the next round of the FA Cup . The chief executive, Alan Pickup, works for nowt. Our chairman, Peter Marsden, keeps a tight rein on things, and we’re solvent – just about. Our manager and his No 2 – John Coleman and Jimmy Bell – are a couple of Scousers who know Accy through and through. My own association with the club goes back a long way. Unfortunately I was born a year after their only previous game against United – we drew 2-2 with them in the 1946 FA Cup, then lost the replay 5-1. We’ve had a few years to mull that one over… . But I went to school – like everyone else in my family – at Peel Park, which was right next door to where Accy used to play until they were dissolved in 1963. Jimmy Ball says for Accrington to have people like Jimmy Bell involved at the club is invaluable . John Coleman will be delighted if his side can set up a FA Cup third round clash with Manchester United . Accrington players could be celebrating like this again if they overcome Yeovil in their FA Cup replay . I grew up with them in my bones. In the 1950s, their manager was a Scot called Walter Galbraith. Virtually the whole team were Scottish, and they used to stay in a local guesthouse, where my Aunty Edith was the housekeeper. I used to wander in and out as I pleased. You may not know this, but I also played for the youth side after they went down to the Lancashire Combination. I was an inside-left – fancied myself as a bit of a Johnny Haynes. Not everyone saw it that way, though, and I was transferred to Rosendale United, for – as the local paper put it – “an undisclosed sum”. Suffice to say I didn’t make my fortune, so I carried on playing cricket. I wish I could be cheering the lads on, but I’ll be on an Emirates flight out of Colombo after England’s seventh and final one-day international here in Sri Lanka. Perhaps the pilot will let us have the score. All I’ll say is that the players won’t need more motivation than to be reminded of the first three words of our team song, ‘On Stanley, On…’","Accrington Stanley could face a trip to Manchester United in the FA Cup third round if they beat Yeovil on Tuesday .

"The results of Monday's Champions League draw may have been unsurprising to Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, with his side being picked to face Barcelona at the same stage for the second year running. Although City aren't the only English side facing familiar opposition as Chelsea must travel to Paris Saint Germain - their opponents in last season's quarter final. With that in mind, Sportsmail brings you all you need to know about the upcoming fixtures in the last 16 of Europe's most prestigious club tournament.

Barcelona wins: 2 . Manchester City vs Barcelona: Tuesday February 24, 2015 - The Etihad Stadium (second leg: Wednesday, March 18 - Nou Camp) MANAGER: Luis Enrique . STAR MAN: Lionel Messi. Helped shred City’s defence when the sides met last season and can do so again. Being outshone by Cristiano Ronaldo but still has 21 goals so far this campaign. Luis Suarez was great to watch in the Premier League and will make his return to England against City . ONE TO WATCH: Neymar. After his World Cup injury heartache, the Brazil star is taking it out on Spanish defences. He has 14 goals in 18 games this season. FAMILIAR FACE: Luis Suarez. Back in England just months after leaving Liverpool. Suarez has taken time to settle but is now part of a fearsome attacking trio. Last year’s last-16 tie was the first time the two sides had met. Barcelona took control in the first leg when Martin Demichelis saw red on the way to a 2-0 loss. City improved in the return match at the Nou Camp but could still only manage a 2-1 defeat.

PSG vs Chelsea: Tuesday February 17, 2015 - Parc des Princes (second leg: Wednesday, March 11 - Stamford Bridge) MANAGER: Laurent Blanc . STAR MAN: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Injured when the teams met in April but is the club’s joint-top scorer this season. ONE TO WATCH: Lucas Moura. Lightning fast and has six goals this season, second only to Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani (both 12). FAMILIAR FACE: Yohan Cabaye. Left Newcastle in January and is now one of a host of midfield options for PSG. The teams met in last year’s quarter final, with Chelsea going through after a 2-0 home win reversed the damage done by a 3-1 defeat in Paris. Their previous meetings came in the 2004-05 group stage during Jose Mourinho’s first spell. Lucas Moura (left) and Yohan Cabaye (right) will be a threat to the Gunners when they come to blows .

The sides have never met in a competitive game. STAR MAN: Dimitar Berbatov. Not set the world alight since his January move with five goals in 17 games this season. Still a classy player, though. ONE TO WATCH: Joao Moutinho. He and James Rodriguez cost £60m in 2013. Rodriguez has left but Moutinho still runs the Monaco midfield. FAMILIAR FACE: Ricardo Carvalho.

"A middle-aged British mother-of-two has joined Islamic State extremists after running away to wage jihad with her toyboy husband. Muslim convert Sally Jones, 45 –who has spent a lifetime on state benefits – ranted online about how she wants to behead Christians with a ‘blunt knife’. The unemployed mother, who was once an aspiring rock musician, claims to have joined bloodthirsty jihadis roaming the lawless border between Syria and Iraq. Scroll down for video . Chaotic lifestyle: Mother-of-two Sally Jones - who has spent a lifetime on state benefits - before she left Britain to marry a British hacker turned jihadi who she met online . A video posted on YouTube, and then deleted, is believed to show Sally Jones playing in a rock band in the early 1990s. It is thought Jones may have converted to Islam and travelled to Syria . On an account attributed to Umm Hussain al-Britani, this pictured was posted showing a female fighter holding an AK-47 . She is believed to have abandoned her two . young sons to marry one of the   British suspects in the beheading of . US journalist James Foley. Jones, who now calls herself Sakinah . Hussain, wears traditional Islamic dress and has swapped her home in . Chatham, Kent, for Raqqa, the Syrian stronghold of terror group IS. Last . night her brother Patrick, 52, who runs his own paving company, said . his family are deeply shocked by her conversion to radical Islam. Speaking at his £500,000 home in Oxted, Surrey, he said: ‘This is a very . upsetting and distressing time for my family and I just don’t want them . to be a part of it. She fell in love and went away.’ Jones is . thought to have sneaked into Syria at the end of last year after an . online romance with Junaid Hussain, 20. She has posted a series of . chilling threats on social networking sites and posed for photos with an . AK-47, while dressed in black with her face veiled. Using the . pseudonym Umm Hussain al-Britani, she has abused Jews and praised Osama . bin Laden. Married: According to her Twitter profile, Umm Hussain al-Britani (left) married British computer hacker-turned jihadi Junaid Hussain . British computer hacker-turned jihadi Junaid Hussain pictured online posing with a scarf over his face and a rifle in his hands . Just days ago, she warned: ‘You Christians all need beheading . with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa...  Come . here I’ll do it for you!’ Her husband Hussain is a computer hacker . who fled Britain while on police bail suspected of violent disorder in . Birmingham. He was jailed for six months in 2012 for stealing sensitive . information from an aide of Tony Blair and blocking a government . anti-terrorist hotline with prank calls. Hussain travelled to the . warzone with Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, a former rapper dubbed the ‘hip . hop jihadi’. Both men now fight for IS and are suspects in the killing . of Mr Foley. Jones is an unlikely Islamic convert and even more . unlikely member of the terrorist militia. In the early 1990s she was the . lead guitarist in an all-girl rock band called Krunch who played a . series of gigs in the South East. A clip of one of her performances . posted online shows her with a shock of blonde hair and wearing a . leather mini-skirt. In recent years she developed an interest in art, . attempting to sell fantasy pictures as well as T-shirts, mugs and key . rings through a niche website. On August 10 Umm Hussain tweeted that her and her husband had made it to the 'Caliphate' She has also posted up a series of warning, the most extreme of which have recently been removed . She adopted several online personas such as Skya and Catgel, and contributed to forums on  conspiracy theories, witchcraft and black magic. One bizarre picture showed her dressed as a nun while pointing a large handgun. She later forged an online romance with Hussain, who was the leader of a computer hacking group known as Team Poison. Using identities such as Pu55yTheGod and Pu55y Hussain, she posted dozens of messages denouncing rivals. Speaking near Jones’s former two-bedroom council house in Chatham,  neighbour Julie Horton, 58, said yesterday: ‘She was very scatty, everything was always a drama. Her language wasn’t  good, her children were unruly and she was extremely loud. Men came and went but she lived mainly as a single mum with her two boys.’ Another neighbour added: ‘She was a nightmare. Always screaming and shouting and up all hours of the night. Everything about her was extreme. She had problems with debts so one minute she was there, the next she’d scarpered. She started to go through a phase of thinking she was a witch. ‘She’d post pictures on Facebook of her dressed in a cloak and said things about being able to talk to spirits.’ It is not known what has happened to her sons, aged around ten and 14, whom she described in photographs posted online in 2010 as the ‘loves of my life’.  After being contacted by journalists, Jones deleted messages, including the threat to behead Christians. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said yesterday: ‘We appeal to the public to help identify for us  aspiring terrorists.’","Muslim convert who went to Syria may be Sally Jones from Chatham .

"Wasps will unlock the doors to the Ricoh Arena this week boosted by the news that Christian Wade is in contention to make his comeback in the Coventry curtain-raiser against London Irish. Sportsmail understands the England winger resumed full training on Monday and hopes to feature on Sunday for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in last month’s Aviva Premiership defeat by Exeter. Wasps winger Christian Wade resumed full training on Monday . It has been a frustrating six months for the 23-year-old, who was ruled out of the club’s last ever game at Adams Park and also missed both the autumn series and summer tour of New Zealand. But he hopes to return for Sunday’s landmark fixture, which could bring logistical teething problems for the newly Midlands-based side, who will stay in a Coventry hotel on Saturday night. ‘I don’t think there will be a lot of disruption,’ said captain James Haskell. ‘Being in a hotel on site will get a lot of the boys out of their comfort zone, which I don’t think is a bad thing. ‘You can get spoiled with a bit of luxury. I learned not to be precious and spoiled pretty early on and that teaches you to get on with it and focus on what makes you tick. Wade suffered an ankle injury in last month’s Aviva Premiership defeat by Exeter . ‘We’re going to “Waspify” the changing room. We have been very respectful to Coventry, but we’ll put banners up and make it very Wasps. We’re not changing the seating or anything like that so I hope the off-field team at Wasps have flags and things prepared for the crowd to lay a marker down.’ Attendance figures are expected to reach a season’s high in Sunday’s fixture, with ticket sales already surpassing the previous record of 22,700. The club are laying on transport for supporters from High Wycombe, where they struggled to attract decent-sized crowds in recent years. Haskell is the club’s longest- serving player, having made his senior debut back in 2002. He has been involved with the ex-London side for most of their 12-year association with Adams Park, but is not fazed by the relocation. Wasps captain James Haskell is looking forward to playing at Ricoh Arena . ‘If you asked any other member of the squad they will probably tell you it will be weird,’ said Haskell. ‘For me, it doesn’t matter. The most important thing is the performance and making sure we are there emotionally. That’s going to be the biggest test. ‘If I’m being frank, for 99 per cent of the guys Sunday was another day at the office. They don’t all share that emotion with Adams Park and this team is completely different from when I came in. The only things the same are the name, the kit man and me.’ Meanwhile, Exeter flanker Tom Johnson will make his comeback in an A League game next week having missed the season so far with a neck injury.","Winger Christian Wade resumed full training on Monday .

"British jewellery designer Sandra D’Auriol suffered extreme postoperative delirium . When British jewellery designer Sandra D’Auriol came round from the general anaesthetic she’d been given for facelift surgery in January, it rapidly became clear something was wrong. The married mother-of-three, a wealthy socialite, awoke gripped by panic, fought with a nurse, then fled from a security guard and climbed to the top of the hospital block. There, the 53-year-old stripped naked and leapt to her death. In April this year, a coroner’s inquiry in Los Angeles ruled that D’Auriol’s death in Beverly Hills was accidental and ‘linked to her suffering a postoperative neurobehavioral disturbance’. In Britain, the condition is commonly known as postoperative delirium. D’Auriol’s death appears to have been an extreme case. But according to the NHS treatment watchdog NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), the condition in its milder forms can affect up to half of patients who undergo surgery in Britain. Too often, the symptoms go entirely unrecognised and unreported, says NICE. It is believed to be a specific problem with general anaesthetics but not local, arising because of the time spent in a deep state of unconsciousness. Research shows that patients with acute forms may not recognise even close family. They may become paranoid, developing an extreme and irrational fear or distrust of people. Other symptoms may include restless behaviour, sleepiness or physical changes such as difficulty in walking, swallowing or speaking. For many the symptoms are mild and last only hours or days. But one in 20 who develops the condition suffers symptoms for a month or more, according to the NHS. In extreme cases the condition may cause changes in personality, such as easygoing people becoming aggressive — and it may leave them mentally debilitated for life, with memory and attention problems. Doctors have known about postoperative delirium since the Fifties, though debate continues about its exact causes. Until recently, anaesthesis was thought unlikely to be responsible. Surgeons pointed to alternative causes, including the theory that the stress of surgery may exacerbate existing brain problems such as depression or early-stage dementias. Research shows that patients with acute forms of postoperative delirium may not recognise even close family. They may become paranoid, developing an extreme and irrational fear or distrust of people . But in recent years, evidence has emerged that the risk of postoperative delirium rises when patients are given substantial doses of anaesthetics that put them into deep states of unconsciousness, rather than lighter doses that induce ‘regional anaesthesia’ to block sensations from specific areas of nerves, as happens in epidurals. In a study at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore, U.S., researchers compared 57 elderly hip surgery patients given low doses of the drug propofol as a regional anaesthetic with 57 patients given large doses of the same drug as a general anaesthetic. Eleven of the patients given local anaesthetic became delirious after the operation, compared with 23 of the general anaesthetic patients. However, other theories suggest that some people’s brains are more vulnerable to harm caused by anaesthetic drugs than others. This may be especially true of older people. Anaesthetics are believed to work by targeting proteins on the surface of neurons (nerve cells) that are essential for controlling functions such as sleep, attention, learning and memory. Ageing brains tend to have fewer proteins on these neurons, so anaesthetics may somehow overpower the neurons and cause lasting damage. Anaesthetics are also thought to work by disrupting communications between regions of the brain, and this may also induce unconsciousness. In some people, the brain is thought to have more trouble re-establishing communications after the patient has come round. A University of Massachusetts Medical School study followed 225 patients aged 60 and over, for a year after heart surgery. In tests of memory and attention, those who did not develop delirium generally took less than a month to recover mentally. But those who had suffered post-op delirium for more than three days after surgery had still not regained their mental powers a year later, suffering problems similar to those found in the early stages of dementia. Such studies have prompted experts to suggest that the anaesthetics cause problems with ageing brain cells’ ability to communicate with each other, which may affect people from their mid-40s onwards. Children’s growing brains can also be seriously disrupted by surgery — a condition called paediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium. In May, a study by experts at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children found that up to one child in five may show behavioural problems a week after going under general anaesthetic to have teeth taken out. Now, new research from the same hospital suggests children may be spared the worst effects of post-op delirium by giving them a sedative called an a2-adrenergic agonist while they are under the anaesthetic. Amelia Pickard, who led the analysis, says this may reduce their risk of emerging from surgery in a state of traumatised delirium. This class of drug has been found to protect brain cells from damage when the brain is anaesthetised. In April’s edition of the British Journal of Anaesthesia, Dr Pickard adds that previous studies indicate that the drug may slow children’s recovery slightly, though she doesn’t believe this delay will cause problems. Dr Valerie Page, a consultant in intensive care at Watford General Hospital, maintains that the NHS can do much more to prevent postoperative delirium. She is currently researching whether a statin drug may relieve symptoms — Simvastatin may help by reducing inflammation in the brain, she says. Such inflammation can cause nerve damage. But it is not yet certain what causes it — the trauma of surgery, the anaesthetic or a combination of both. Meanwhile, Dr Page says, simple steps such as ensuring patients drink enough water can make a huge difference. Good hydration helps to improve blood flow to the brain. Getting patients out of bed can help them regain their sense of orientation, while sleeping well helps them regain their bearings. In the case of postoperative delirium, such straightforward care can make the difference between a healthy recovery and long-term mental problems — or even fatal tragedy.","Sandra D’Auriol was given a general anaesthetic  for facelift surgery .

"Floyd Mayweather and his Money Team happened to bounce into the very Las Vegas night spot in which Amir Khan and his Army were celebrating the dazzling victory which has drastically revised opinions of our grown-up boy from Bolton on both sides of the Atlantic. No words were exchanged between the parties as Mayweather breezed into a private VIP area of the trendy Hakkasan club in the MGM Grand, the vast casino resort deep in the bowels of which Khan had just delivered a virtuoso performance to bewilder, bedazzle and generally box the ears off the highly respected Devon Alexander. Mayweather was first to leave and Khan was not surprised to see him hastily depart through the fire exit. VIDEO Scroll down for Amir Khan: Floyd Mayweather Jnr walked in on my celebration . Amir Khan poses in his hotel suit after beating Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . Khan showboats towards the end of the final round to put the seal on a dominant performance on Saturday . Khan lands a left hand on Alexander as he won almost every round against the former world champion . ‘Floyd has just seen that he made a big mistake putting off fighting me earlier this year,’ said Khan with a cheeky grin on his bruised features. ‘I’m a much better boxer now than I was then and I’ll be even better if we do fight next May. ‘I’m not the complete package yet. I need to make some small adjustments. Technically, it’s about angles in the ring. Then there are small things like looking at my opponent instead of the referee when we’re told to break. Small things but they can be important if you’re not protecting yourself at moments like that.’ As he spoke, the American boxing community were talking of him in the same breath as Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. He has complicated the debate as to which of this triumvirate of elite welterweights should fight each other next. He has also challenged the misconceptions of so many of his British countrymen who have taken so nastily against him. Khan, as he surveyed the famous Strip from the window of his penthouse suite, revealed that one of the reasons he moved his training base over here was to escape the poisonous atmosphere in some quarters back home. Khan wants to fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr (left) next year after proving he belongs with the world's best . Mayweather has yet to decide who he will fight when he returns to the ring on May 2 next year . ‘There have been doubters from the beginning,’ he says. ‘I don’t really know why. Perhaps it’s because I was successful so early. Maybe they don’t like that I got so much so young. But do they think it comes easy? Don’t they realise all the hard work that goes into this? I’ve been under pressure to prove myself ever since day one as a teenager when I won my medal at the Athens Olympics. ‘Yet people keep having a go at me. Is it jealousy?’ With the growth of social media some of the attacks have become highly abusive and Khan says; ‘That helped make up my mind to train in America. I couldn’t work in that environment of hate. ‘This is a tough job and I need positive energy around me, not negative.’ Khan acknowledges that some of the resentment stems from a public perception that he can be arrogant. He takes the trouble to explain: ‘It is important for my self-belief going into a fight to be confident and to show it.’ Even if he were not so preoccupied with trying to coax Mayweather into the same ring – and hopefully become the first to beat him – he would not have time to go round Britain showing his real self to all the knockers. But he wishes he could. ‘When people get to know me their view changes,’ says Khan. ‘I’ve met so many on holiday or at events. I always give time to everyone. And they always end up saying that I’m very different from the way they imagined. They say I’m humble. A nice person.’ There is a divide in Britain between those who recognise that Amir Khan and those who flood Twitter with messages before fights like the one with Alexander hoping that he gets knocked out, badly hurt even. He says: ‘I don’t know what I’ve done to be thought of and talked to like that. I’m actually more down to earth than normal people.’ As recognition of his prowess spreads, however grudgingly, he has this to say to the merchants of hate: ‘Spend a day with me and your view of me will change.’ Khan would also relish a fan with Manny Pacquiao (right) after his comprehensive win over Chris Algieri (left) Pacquiao celebrates his victory over Algieri - he too is yet to announce who he will face next . We who frequently spend time with this charming, courteous young man willingly endorse that message. To know him is to like him. Furthermore, those who cling to prejudice against him risk missing out on a thrill ride to British glory. Oscar De La Hoya, the iconic Golden Boy of the prize-ring who is Khan’s promoter, says: ‘After Mayweather and Pacquiao, Amir will become the greatest pound-for-pound fighter on the planet.’ It is no longer fantasy to imagine Khan proving it by beating one of them, particularly the one who was last seen heading for the fire escape in his home town.","Floyd Mayweather walked into the venue of Amir Khan's afterparty .

David De Gea is the Premier League’s best shot-stopper this season. Of keepers with a minimum of 10 saves, his save percentage in the penalty area is the best. De Gea: 71.74% . Pantilimon: 71.43% . Guzan: 69.81% . Foster: 65.85% . Hart: 64.71% . The 24-year-old no longer looks like a man overwhelmed by the task of following in the footsteps of United greats like Edwin van der Sar and Peter Schmeichel. ‘He’s the best keeper in the world,’ said Rooney. ‘He’s shown great form and some of his saves are incredible. ‘Edwin van der Sar had the best years of his career when he was with us in his late 30s so David has a great future ahead of him. If he keeps working hard the way he is, he will have many years at the top.’ To play such an important role in defeating Liverpool was particularly sweet for De Gea. It was in a harrowing FA Cup defeat to the Merseysiders almost three years ago that he hit his lowest point at United. De Gea cut a haunted figure as United lost at Anfield in January 2012. De Gea was brought in to replace United legend Edwin van der Sar between the posts at United . De Gea struggled in his early days as the spectre of Peter Schmeichel (right) still loomed at Old Trafford . De Gea has thrived under the influence of United’s new goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek (far left) VIDEO 6 wins in a row, my wife is happy - Van Gaal . In De Gea's four seasons at Old Trafford, it is remarkable how much he has started to catch the ball. Percentage catches to punches . 2011-12: 56.3% . 2012-13: 48.9% . 2013-14: 68.9% . 2014-15: 91.7% . He missed training for several days and there were concerns he was crumbling under the pressure. Staff feared he was not up to the physical demands of English football and pining for home. United duly opened talks with Stoke over a £15million deal for Asmir Begovic that would have seen De Gea relegated to second choice. However, they persevered with him and the boy grew into a man. De Gea bulked up significantly with the help of protein shakes and long hours in the gym. He has exuded confidence this season behind an ever-changing United defence. He can communicate better with his team-mates because he has learned the language, but also due to the influx of Spanish speakers such as Juan Mata, Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Radamel Falcao and Marcos Rojo. De Gea saves a penalty effort from then Arsenal striker Robin van Persie at Old Trafford in August 2011 . United snapped up De Gea after the Spaniard's stand out performance for Atletico Madrid in Europe . United flirted with the idea of signing Asmir Begovic (above) but decided to persevere with De Gea . He has also benefited from work with the club’s new goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, who helped develop Van der Sar at Ajax in the early 90s. Rooney said: ‘To play in goal for United at 20 is difficult, especially trying to replace Van der Sar, who was a fantastic keeper. ‘We knew it might take time with David and it did. The first six months, probably a year, it was hard but he worked hard on his game and it shows.’ De Gea is understood to be uncertain about the presence of another Spaniard, Victor Valdes, the former Barcelona No 1 who has been training at Carrington and is expected to play in a behind-closed-doors friendly later this week. If all goes well, he will be offered a deal to replace Anders Lindegaard as De Gea’s main competition. Meanwhile, United are said to be relaxed over De Gea’s contract which runs out in just 18 months’ time, and confident he will sign a new one despite growing interest from Real Madrid. The 24-year-old has matured into one of the premier goalkeepers on the world stage .","David De Gea was outstanding against Liverpool at Old Trafford .

"Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has been named Belgian Sportsman of the Year. The 22-year-old became the first footballer to win the award, which has been running since 1967, after claiming the La Liga title during his loan spell with Atletico Madrid last season. Courtois also played in goal during Belgium's progression to the quarter-finals in Brazil, the country's first World Cup appearance since 2002. The Blues keeper returned to Stamford Bridge this season and has kept five clean sheets in 14 Premier League games to leave Chelsea three points clear at the top of the table ahead of the festive fixtures.

"Arsenal legend Gilberto Silva could be the latest member of the Invincibles to head back to the Emirates Stadium to take up a coaching role. Arsene Wenger hinted last month that the club's record goalscorer Thierry Henry would be welcome back as a coach, and now it seems Gilberto has had a similar offer. In an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo Esporte, Gilberto confirmed that he has had an invitation from the club to return, and that he would one day like to go into management. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gilberto Silva score a half-volley screamer for Panathinaikos . Gilberto Silva (right) was at Arsenal for six years, where he was a perfect foil for Patrick Vieira .

'Anything is possible, it makes me happy when you have these invitations, people see you with a different profile, you can contribute. 'It makes me happy and motivated, and it makes me want to learn from others, seek knowledge and develop my own style.' However, the Brazilian World Cup winner insisted that he still wants to continue playing for the time being, despite being 38 years old, and without a club. Given Arsenal's lack of presence in central midfield, Arsene Wenger must wish his former midfield general was a few years younger.

"Islamic extremists have publicly crucified two Syrian rebels in northeastern Syria in revenge for a grenade attack on members of their group. The jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant said it had executed a total of seven prisoners who it claimed had carried out a grenade attack on one of its fighters earlier this month in the Euphrates Valley city of Raqqa. The group, which even Al Qaeda have been keen to distance themselves from, said on Twitter: 'Ten days ago, attackers on a motorbike threw a grenade at an ISIL fighter at the Naim roundabout. A Muslim civilian had his leg blown off and a child was killed. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Punishment: Two men in Raqqa, Syria, were crucified this April for allegedly killing an Isis fighter . Brutal: The images, which could not be independently verified, appear to demonstrate Isis's uncompromising brand of hardline Islamist justice . 'Our fighters immediately set up a roadblock and succeeded in capturing them. They were then able to detain other members of the cell.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights posted a photograph of the two prisoners being crucified at the roundabout. Passers-by appear to be walking past the two men apparently unfazed. One of the men is pictured with a banner wrapped round his body which reads: 'This man fought against Muslims and threw  a grenade in this place.' Abu Ibrahim Alrquaoui, who described himself as a founder of the group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, told FoxNews.com that those killed had previously fought against the Syrian government of Bashir al-Assad. He said he witnessed the executions and took photographs which are now being circulated online. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said they were not the first crucifixions by ISIL. On April 16, its fighters executed a man for theft from a Muslim in the same way. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights posted a photograph of the two prisoners being crucified at the roundabout with passers-by walking past apparently unfazed .

Syrian government control - and much of its surrounding province. The group also carried out three executions in the Raqqa provincial town of Tal Abyad, on the Turkish border, and two more in the town of Saluq, the Observatory said. Last week, ISIL claimed responsibility for a series of explosions which killed 28 people and left more than 40 injured at a political rally in Iraq on Friday. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad are seen visiting families whose relatives have died fighting for pro-government forces in a photograph posted on the Presidency's official Facebook page . The militant group Asaib Ahl Haq (League of the Righteous) was presenting its candidates for elections on April 30 at the rally in eastern Baghdad. Three bombs exploded in succession as people were leaving, reporters at the scene said. A roadside bomb went off near the main gate, followed by a suicide car bomb after a few minutes and then a final explosion. In a statement posted on the internet, ISIL said it had carried out the bombings in response to 'murder, torture and displacement' of Sunnis by Shi'ite militias which 'massacred children and women'. In February, MailOnline reported how a Syrian girl was stoned to death for opening a Facebook account after a court, under the jurisdiction of ISIL, ruled the act of being a member of the social network deserved to be punished the same way as adultery. ISIL (or ISIS) is a pro-Al Qaeda jihadist group that many feared was taking an iron grip over parts of Syria. The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria. The final letter in the acronym ISIL stems from the Arabic word 'al-Sham'. This can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the Levant. Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists. Analysts say non-Syrians constitute a majority of ISIL's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership. It took over the city of Al-Reqqa after rebels overran the city in March 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control. It also has a presence in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule in the areas that it controls. The group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. Al Qaeda refuse to deal with them. In July, a commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly shot dead by ISIL fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. ISIL also seized the northern town of Azaz from the FSA on 18 September. There has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIL was accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Former Ashes-winning captain Mike Gatting looks likely to be the best-known casualty of a remarkable ageism purge taking place at the England Cricket Board. Gatting, highly-respected managing director of cricket partnerships, is expected to be offered a low-key ambassador role after radical changes are recommended at a board meeting today. Gatting’s demise follows the recent departure of chief executive David Collier, commercial director John Perera and HR director Lesley Cook — all of whom are in their late 50s or 60. Mike Gatting is highly-respected in his ECB role but will be asked to take a lower level job to make way for a younger generation of administrators . And other members of ECB staff in that age bracket feel similarly threatened by the more youthful revolution being carried out by Yorkshire’s Colin Graves in advance of him becoming chairman of ECB and Tom Harrison arriving at Lord’s as the new chief executive. Gatting said: ‘Changes are being made, but I don’t know what they’ll be. I’m waiting to find out.’ Collier’s surprise departure last summer is understood to be connected with him finding it very difficult to work with Graves, who wants to build a new much more county-focused ECB regime around the new CEO, commercial chief Sanjay Patel and ultra-political chief operating officer Gordon Hollins, who has carried out the major staff review. Supermarket chain tycoon Graves, whose ascendancy will mean current chairman Giles Clarke concentrates on ICC business in a likely new role as ECB President, has the strong support of two powerful county chairmen in Surrey’s Richard Thompson and Somerset’s Andy Nash. Ironically, the executives leaving the ECB are younger than first-class umpires Peter Willey and George Sharp who are taking their aegism case to an employment tribunal after being retired against their wishes at the age of 65. The FA were absent from Sports Personality of the Year in Glasgow despite the fact the England manager is usually interviewed. And even after the World Cup debacle, a chat with a croaking Gary Lineker could still have been relatively upbeat after England’s 100 per cent start to their Euro 2016 campaign. However, Roy Hodgson and all the Wembley top brass were ‘unavailable’. Roy Hodgson was unavailable to go to Sports Personality of the Year, where there was no FA representation . England's dismal World Cup showing meant that the national football team were not on the SPOTY agenda . But Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan, linked with succeeding departing FA chief Alex Horne, did attend as well as Scotland boss Gordon Strachan. British golf’s high command from the R&A, European Tour and Ryder Cup had travelled to Scotland in anticipation of double-major winner Rory McIlroy being named Sports Personality of the Year. Rory McIlroy (right) was expected to win, but ended up finishing behind F1 driver Lewis Hamilton . But they were remarkably sanguine after Lewis Hamilton’s victory that exposes the total inadequacy of a public vote shoehorned into 35 minutes on the night when F1’s social media dominance over golf became so apparent. World champion Lewis Hamilton, Britain’s richest sportsman as well as BBC Sports Personality of the Year, is understood to have granted Ari Emanuel’s Hollywood entertainment agency William Morris Endeavor a trial period to represent him to see what they can do for his benefit. WME, who bought IMG earlier this year for $2.4billion, used to look after Hamilton’s girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. Hamilton's success was an indication of the dominance of F1's of social media presence over golf's . Gill’s FIFA plans begin . David Gill, who is standing as the England candidate for the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo, is starting to distance himself from the Premier League and the possible conflicts that would bring in Zurich. He is to step down from the PL’s audit and remuneration committee. Meanwhile, the PL will have to change their statutes to accommodate CEO Richard Scudamore becoming executive chairman, which is currently the favourite option. Article 42 states the chairman must be independent and FA approved, which won’t help Scudamore’s cause.

Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith scored the others, both with the aid of deflections, but it was Barkley who made the difference. QPR were toothless and Bobby Zamora’s late strike was no consolation. For Everton, this performance could not have come at a better time. But it wasn’t the smoothest of rides. There was anxiety in the stands from an early stage and QPR manager Harry Redknapp said: ‘I thought they were edgy. We had an opportunity to take advantage. Even at 3-1, you could hear the crowd. I didn’t think they were full of confidence.’ Having stumbled out of the blocks, Everton eventually found some rhythm and Barkley, deployed in a deeper role, began orchestrating their play. First to test his luck was Naismith but he lacked the power to trouble Rob Green. The Scot was then unfortunate when his goalbound effort cannoned into Romelu Lukaku after he had been picked out by Seamus Coleman. It seemed inevitable Everton would find a way through but the manner in which they did so was still at odds with what had gone before. It was magnificent. Picking up possession inside his own half, Barkley surged forward and exchanged passes with Lukaku as QPR’s defenders made the mistake of letting him get into shooting range. He needed no second invitation and from almost 25 yards, unleashed a left-foot cannon that ripped past Green.

Barkley has experienced a quiet time recently, his performances attracting some scrutiny, but this was brilliant. With the lead — and with QPR brittle — Everton were going to prove hard to peg back and so it proved. When Joey Barton tangled with Naismith on the edge of QPR’s area, referee Neil Swarbrick awarded a free-kick and Mirallas, who would later go off on a stretcher with an ankle problem, doubled Everton’s advantage, his free-kick taking a hefty deflection off Eduardo Vargas’ head. Redknapp stood shaking his head, barely able to contain his anger, while Roberto Martinez punched the air and smiled broadly. Both men knew the game had been decided there and then. Any chance that QPR, who had scored only twice on their travels before this match, would find a way back were soon snuffed out.

"An Australian mosquito has been found in Los Angeles, California, more than 13,000km from home. Los Angeles County vector control officials said in a statement on Tuesday that the mosquito that goes by the nickname 'Aussie Mozzie' has been found in Monterey Park and nearby Montebello. The discovery of the ‘Aedes notoscriptus’ mosquito in California is the first time an Australian mosquito has been discovered in the U.S. The mosquito can transmit the non-fatal Barmah Forest and Ross River viruses to humans, though neither has ever been reported in the county. It also can give heartworm to dogs. The discovery of the zebra-striped mosquito, also known as 'Aussie Mozzie' has been identified in California for the first time in the US . The insect's Australian identify was confirmed by scientists from the University of Sydney using pictures which showed its distinctive black-and-white stripes on its legs and body. Clinical lecturer and mosquito researcher at the University of Sydney, Dr Cameron Webb, told Daily Mail Australia that mosquitoes appearing in other locations around the world have become an increasing problem. 'This is one of the most widespread mosquitoes in Australia and, as well as being a nuisance-biting pest,' Dr Webb said. 'We will never know for sure how they got to the US but these types of mosquitoes are found in urban areas - not one has been found in wetlands. Dr Cameron Webb encourages people to wear insect repellent spray outside and empty out all containers filled with water in the backyard . 'Mosquitoes are often found in backyards and they prefer to lay their eggs in smaller containers of water. 'My theory is people could have moved their belongings, along with mosquito eggs found in them. 'Alternatively, in extreme cases, it could have been a group of them that have flown on a Sydney plane for instance and then flew off when they arrived there. 'But it could've been anything really - movement from a commercial kind of product like plants or industrial equipment, which carried their eggs overseas. But it's a remote chance - a remote possibility that could've happened.' The zebra-striped mosquito has been known to transmit non-fatal Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses to people in Australia, which have influenza-like symptoms but neither has been reported in the country. 'Mosquitoes  have to bite someone first, to be able to catch the virus but the chances are really slim,' he said. 'We can't guarantee that someone would get a virus because it all depends who and what they're biting - people or animals who are carrying the disease. 'They are a risk to dogs and have known to spread heart-worms in Australia but if pet owners get their pets vaccinated, they have nothing to worry about and their pets would be safe.' The insect was initially captured in June in Montebello and Monterey Park, but officials were not able to confirm it until this week. 'It's great how this situation demonstrates how we were able to work with the US authorities through a quick email and some high resolution photographs to be able to identify the specimens,' Dr Webb said. The Asian tiger (pictured) was first found in Southern California in 2011 and can carry more dangerous diseases, including the dengue fever, chikungunya, and viruses, and other diseases . Dr Webb said: 'California is battling with another species - the 'yellow fever' (pictured) which I think is a higher concern that they should be looking at' Dr Webb said he encourages people to empty out any containers that are filled with water in their backyard and use insect repellent spray at all times when  spending some time outside. He added: ‘California are battling with two more different species - the 'yellow fever' season mosquito and 'Asian tiger' mosquito, which I think is a higher concern that they should be looking at.' The  Asian tiger was first found in Southern California in 2011 and can carry more dangerous diseases, including the dengue fever, chikungunya, and viruses, and other diseases. ‘This situation has demonstrated a concern and reminder to the Australian authorities and they need to be mindful of how easy they’re being exported to other countries. ‘There have been reports of new discoveries of mosquitoes in countries like South-East Asia, Europe, and South Africa – so what’s stopping them from making their way here?' he said.","The 'Aussie Mozzie' has been identified  for the first time in the US .

'I thought Ross was a joy to watch, the way he finished his goal was exceptional. It is as good as you are going to get. 'The work he has put in to training recently has been very impressive and he deserved that goal for wanting to take responsibility. It was a lesson in how a midfielder can execute a strike with such quality.' The Everton midfielder wheels away after opening the scoring with a sensational goal on his return . Barkley leaps in the air to celebrate his opening strike while being cheered on by a young steward (right) The Toffees midfielder was eager to impress against QPR and did so with aplomb from a central midfield role . When asked if Barkley drew comparisons to former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack his answer was immediate. 'Yes, absolutely. How quickly he takes concepts on, his power and technical ability makes him special. 'He has played in the no 10 role, but in a deeper position he makes good decisions on the ball. It's good for him at his age to experiment in different roles.' Barkley added: 'We've got the three points today and that's going to give us a bit of confidence so we're going to take every game as it comes and hopefully put things right on the pitch. 'Anywhere on the pitch, I enjoy playing, but to get the three points and to get the three goals against a QPR side that played well as well, it was great. 'Wherever I am on the pitch I try to affect the game. Because Gareth (Barry) was out, I was playing deeper and I enjoyed that.'","Everton Boss Roberto Martinez praised 'exceptional' Ross Barkley show .

"Bayern Munich are keeping close tabs on Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling as they prepare for next summer's transfer window. Despite being only halfway through the current season, Pep Guardiola is already casting his mind forward to the 2015-16 campaign, readying targets for his side. Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus is known to be Bayern's first choice forward target next summer, but it is understood Sterling has been identified as one of the alternatives should a move for the Germany forward fail to materialise. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Marco Reus' top three goals for Borussia Dortmund . Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling (centre) has emerged as an alternative target for Bayern Munich . The England international was denied by David de Gea several times during a 3-0 loss at Old Trafford . The news underlines Sterling's reputation as one of the best emerging talents in European football. The development will be of interest to Liverpool, who are trying to tie the England star down to an improved deal. Sportsmail reported last week how the Anfield club are struggling to agree a contract with Sterling, having made an informal offer of a five-year deal worth up to £70,000. But a deal is yet to be agreed as the 20-year-old weighs up his future. Bayern Munich's prime target Marco Reus is expected to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . The German forward carries a £20m buy-out clause in his contract, which has been attracting Europe's elite . Sterling is understandably keen to continue playing in the Champions League. Liverpool, as it stands, look way off qualifying for next season's competition - their defeat against Manchester United on Sunday underlined their problems on the pitch. Liverpool and Sterling, who is currently on £25,000 per week, remain optimistic a deal can be reached as talks continue. But the next few weeks could prove critical in deciding the player's future.

"Three decades after it all began, Jamie Redknapp was back on AFC Bournemouth’s training pitches on Monday. The session being put on by the Championship leaders’ young manager Eddie Howe was familiar, but the setting was not. ‘I have enjoyed watching Eddie work,’ enthused Redknapp ahead of Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup visit of struggling Liverpool. ‘He’s bright and full of ideas. I don’t think the methods have changed that much over the years. The modern drills are a variation on themes of what managers have always done. VIDEO Scroll down to see which other former Red says Liverpool are under pressure . Jamie Redknapp talks with Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe after watching his first club train ahead of Liverpool's visit . Redknapp began his career at Bournemouth, but the Goldsands Stadium is different to how he remembers the place . The Liverpool legend says his former club could find the Championship leaders as tough an opponent as Manchester United . Jamie stopped for a photo by a picture of his dad during his Bournemouth days - and looked up to Harry in one shot . ‘This place — this pitch — has changed a lot, though. When I was here as a young player we didn’t have our own training pitches. This land was the council’s and we just trained on whatever bits we could, once we had cleaned the dog mess off. We would save the best patch of grass until Friday and call it Wembley. ‘I remember when Bournemouth beat Manchester United here in 1984. My dad was manager and I was in the crowd. The next day the lads were in training and in good spirits but the council warden was annoyed they hadn’t asked permission so he locked the gates so they couldn’t get out.’ Almost 31 years after that victory over then cup holders United, opportunity knocks again for Bournemouth tomorrow at their impressively remodelled Goldsands Stadium. ‘The pitch used to face the other way when I played here,’ mused Redknapp as he gazed out across the immaculate playing surface. ‘At least the away fans are under cover now. It’s just as well. It could be a long night.’ Harry Arter celebrates with Steve Cook as Bournemouth won again to go top of the Championship on Saturday . Redknapp looks over the pitch at the Goldsands stadium. 'This place — this pitch — has changed a lot,' he said . Liverpool certainly head to Dorset under a darkening cloud. Sunday’s Barclays Premier League defeat by Manchester United was the latest blow to a team that came so close to winning the title in May. With Brendan Rodgers’ team short of goals and unable to keep a clean sheet, it is difficult to make them favourites against a side that has not lost since September. ‘I don’t think Liverpool will keep a clean sheet here,’ said Redknapp. ‘I don’t think many clubs would. This lot are a good side. ‘I was chatting to Eddie and he was telling me how he likes to play attacking football on the front foot. I like the way he uses his full-backs going forward. Eddie is looking forward to this and I can see why. If Howe picks his strongest team Bournemouth have a chance to cause a real upset against a Liverpool side struggling for form . Jamie Redknapp looks out on the pitch, which has changed so much from his time at the club, ahead of Liverpool's League Cup visit . Harry Redknapp stands on the terrace at Dean Court when manager of Bournemouth back in 1992 . Harry Redknapp (manager) with his son Jamie (bottom right) pose for the team photo ahead of the 1987-88 season . Harry Redknapp started his managerial career at Bournemouth in the 1980s and son Jamie made his professional debut for the club as well . ‘If he picks his first 11 then this will be every little bit as hard as the game at Old Trafford for Liverpool. It could be harder.’ Redknapp, of course, played for both tomorrow night’s competing clubs. AFC Bournemouth was his second home from the moment his dad Harry took over as manager in 1983. He used to skip school — his mum never knew — to join in training sessions at the age of 12 before he finally made his first team debut as a 16-year-old in 1990. Just 13 league games in, he left for Liverpool after Anfield manager Kenny Dalglish pestered Redknapp senior as he tried to dance with his wife Sandra at a managers’ function. ‘I didn’t see the positives for Liverpool on Sunday that other people did,’ reflected Redknapp. ‘I never at any point thought they would win. They are devoid of all confidence. It’s sweeping through the team. ‘And now they have resorted to playing without a centre forward. That’s a bad situation. The players they have bought haven’t been good enough. Not yet, anyway. It hasn’t worked and Brendan must take responsibility for that. Jermain Defoe is another big name on the wall at Bournemouth - the striker had a loan spell there in 2000-01 . Brendan Rodgers is under pressure after Sunday's 3-0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford, and his signings have not come off . Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling look dejected during the Old Trafford defeat, which leaves Liverpool in need of a win on Wednesday . ‘Football management is so fickle. I was asking Eddie about his targets earlier and he said he looks no further than three games ahead. He’s right. ‘A few months ago Brendan was manager of the year and now look at the pressure he is under. ‘I don’t think they should change him. That would be madness. I like Brendan, I think he is good. But he has made mistakes this season and he is suffering for them . ‘It’s been humbling for him. He just needs to ride the storm but there will be no bigger test than this one here.’ On Monday, Redknapp was clearly glad to be back on familiar ground. Former club-mates such as Matty Holmes and Steve Fletcher — who has a stand named after him — are now on Howe’s staff and greeted him with warm hugs, as are a handful of players the Bournemouth boss played with in the 1998-99 team. Howe has clearly endeavoured to foster a local spirit here. Round the back of one stand, an outside wall is adorned with wonderful team photos of Bournemouth sides from years gone by. The former England international points out former team-mates in the team photos on display around the ground . Redknapp was a player at Bournemouth for just 13 games, before his father, the manager at the time, let him leave for Liverpool . Redknapp finds his own vintage and points out team-mates Luther Blissett, Tony Pulis, Shaun Teale and Gavin Peacock. Then he spots a huge portrait of his father as a player. ‘Blimey, look at that dreadful haircut,’ he smiles, patting the image fondly on the chest. Redknapp credits the club with shaping his personality as well as his life. As he walks around the pitch with Howe on the way to training, the stands are being cleaned in readiness for tomorrow. ‘We used to do that as apprentices,’ Redknapp said. ‘And we painted the stand, too. The edges look straighter now. ‘I cleaned Luther’s boots. He used to throw them back at me and ask me to do it again. He was toughening me up. Dad’s assistant Jimmy Gabriel taught me how to do an over-the-top tackle, taught me to look after myself.’ It was a trip down memory lane for Redknapp, who spent time looking at pictures of former Cherries - like George best (left) Redknapp made sure to stop off and talk to some of the club's current apprentices, and share some advice with the young players . Redknapp spent five hours catching up with old friends and memories. As well as watching first-team training, he also asked to visit two groups of apprentices in their classroom and left them with one piece of sage advice. ‘Save some money and look after your family,’ he said. Back to playing matters, there are rumours that Howe will rest players tomorrow night and if he does, Redknapp thinks Bournemouth will lose. As we spoke in a room off the players’ tunnel, however, a photo on the wall depicted Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard being tackled during last season’s FA Cup tie on the south coast. The words next to it say: ‘Anything is Possible.’ Liverpool should perhaps heed the warning.","Liverpool face Bournemouth in Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday .

"Read Charlie's Sale story on the real reasons behind Kevin Pietersen's sacking by England . Paul Downton has admitted the ECB should have handled the fallout surrounding Kevin Pietersen’s sacking better than they did – but insisted it was the right decision. Speaking for the first time since the confidentiality agreement between Pietersen and the ECB ended in October, Downton played down Pietersen’s claims of dressing-room bullying, and said his ‘only driving force is what’s best for English cricket’. Pushed to explain why the ECB had sacked Pietersen – who was released on Monday by his IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils – following the Ashes whitewash almost a year ago, England’s managing director said: ‘All one has to do is read Kevin’s book to see how disaffected he was. Paul Downton says the right decision was made regarding Kevin Pietersen but it should have been dealt with a lot better by the ECB . Kevin Pietersen heavily criticised former team-mate Matt Prior in his autobiography . ‘I don’t think you’ll ever be able to explain to some people’s satisfaction what happened. I can repeat what we said at the time, which was that people felt Kevin had become disengaged from the side, and that we needed more from our leaders. ‘I’m sure we could have handled it better. But it’s history. We can’t change it any more. My only driving force here is what’s best for English cricket. Am I content that we made the right decision? Absolutely.’ The ECB hierarchy have come under fierce criticism in some quarters for their failure to comment on some of Pietersen’s claims in his incendiary autobiography – not least the suggestion that there was a culture of bullying within the dressing-room. Downton said: ‘You can go on denying all sorts of things. The reality was that there is no formal complaint of bullying on anyone’s record during that whole period. ‘We all know it was a surprise in terms of how Kevin portrayed that environment. None of the other players recognise it. ‘I’m passionate about English cricket going forward. I cannot see any reason to be going over old ground, because it’s not relevant any more. I’m sure I made mistakes at the time, but it is what it is.’ Pietersen didn't hold back in his autobiography, with many controversial comments made throughout . Downton drew on the positives English cricket has made since the Ashes debacle earlier this year . Meanwhile, Downton stressed the positive gains English cricket had made since the Ashes car-crash, and said he would be ‘very surprised’ if Alastair Cook were not confirmed as England’s captain for the World Cup at Friday’s selection meeting. Though he doesn’t have a say on team matters, Downton revealed that Cook’s one-day leadership had been approved only after a week of ‘kicking the tyres’ by the selectors in September, but said he thought Cook remained the right man to lead England at the World Cup. ‘He’s having a terrible time at the moment,’ he said. ‘No one knows that more than him. But we are playing a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand with two new balls, where his track record is good, and he’s been captain for three and a half years. ‘The only time he really had a full-strength side, they got to the final of the Champions Trophy and frankly should have won it. Yes, he’s in miserable form, but form can change. ‘And just as we saw during the summer, when frankly AN Other was going to be the next captain for England, we felt strongly that all his experience, all his toughness would come out. ‘The fact is he’s a remarkably strong guy. His track record says he will score runs. Everybody goes through a bad period. But I’ve got to think that his form’s got to turn.’","Paul Downton says the ECB didn't deal with Kevin Pietersen's sacking in the correct manner .

"Philippine government prosecutors charged a U.S. Marine with murder Monday in the killing of a Filipino, saying the suspect acknowledged attacking the victim after he found out she was a transgender woman. Prosecutor Emilie de los Santos said there was 'probable cause' that Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, who has been detained since shortly after the October incident, killed Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey, in the motel room where the victim's body was found in Olongapo city, northwest of Manila. She had apparently been strangled and drowned in a toilet bowl. Scroll down for video . Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton is charged with killing Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey, in the motel room where the victim's body was found in Olongapo city, northwest of Manila after discovering she was transgender . 'It's murder,' de los Santos told reporters after filing the charge against the 19-year-old Pemberton before a regional court. 'It was aggravated by treachery, abuse of superior strength and cruelty.' Among the evidence submitted by de los Santos and other prosecutors were statements by Pemberton's three Marine colleagues who went bar-hopping with him on Oct. 11 in Olongapo, a former liberty town when the U.S. Navy was at the vast Subic Naval base, now a bustling commercial Freeport and recreation hub. Pemberton and some of his colleagues later picked up women at a disco bar and separately checked in at nearby motels, then returned to their ship after midnight. Witnesses saw Pemberton check in with Laude at a motel room, where he was seen leaving shortly before the discovery of the killing, prosecutors said in their statement to the court. Marine accused of 'strangling a transgender Filipina in a hotel toilet after finding out she was not born a woman' is transferred to Philippine jail for trial . Marine Lance Corporal Jairn Michael Rose, who went out with Pemberton that night, acknowledged that the suspect later confided back at their ship that he attacked the woman he was with by choking her after discovering that she was a transgender when she undressed, according to the prosecutors. 'I think I killed a he/she,' Pemberton was quoted as having told Rose. Pemberton, a skilled boxer, allegedly said he choked her from behind with his arm 'for a couple of minutes' until she stopped moving then dragged her into the bathroom, according to the prosecutors. The new details are likely to spark renewed condemnation by left-wing and transgender groups, which have labeled the attack a hate crime. The case comes after the Philippines and the United States strengthened ties with the recent signing of a defense accord that allows greater U.S. access to Philippine military camps. The case comes after the Philippines and the United States strengthened ties with the recent signing of a defense accord that allows greater U.S. access to Philippine military camps . The accord will help Washington's bid to reassert its presence in Asia, and enable Manila to deter what it calls China's aggressive moves to reinforce its claims in disputed South China Sea territories. The case reignited a debate over custody of American military personnel accused of crimes. But the looming irritant between the treaty allies over Pemberton's custody was eased after Washington agreed to move him from a U.S. warship to the Philippine military's main camp in metropolitan Manila, where he remained under American custody with an outer ring of Filipino guards. The Philippine government said in a statement issued by its foreign affairs department that it looks 'forward to the full cooperation of the U.S. government in ensuring that justice is secured for Laude.' Harry Roque, the lawyer of Laude's family, welcomed the prosecutors' ruling and angrily demanded that Pemberton be thrown into an ordinary jail.","Prosecutor Emilie de los Santos said there was 'probable cause' that Marine Pfc.

"Deadly mosquitoes have arrived in Britain, brought in on the tyres of lorries crossing the Channel. Health officials are monitoring ferry ports, petrol stations and the entrance to the Channel Tunnel amid fears that more dangerous insects may be on their way. Colonies of an invasive mosquito called the culex modestus, which is capable of spreading the infectious West Nile virus, have been found in the north Kent marshes and parts of Essex.

West Nile virus can causes serious flu-like symptoms and leads to swelling of the brain and spinal cord in the most serious cases. And with the continuing mild weather and a string of hot and wet summers, they could thrive across Southern England.

The Asian tiger mosquito – a particularly large and aggressive insect – originates from Indonesia and other parts of South-East Asia. But in recent years it has spread across the world, as its eggs are carried on the tyres of long-distance haulage vehicles. This year the insect has been spotted in Belgium, Holland and Lyons in France.","Colonies of aculex modestus, which is capable of spreading the West Nile virus, found in Kent marshes and parts of Essex .

"Wayne Rooney insists Manchester United can win the Premier League title in Louis van Gaal’s first season. The Dutchman has set himself a top-four target after inheriting a team in decline last summer, and warned it may take the rest of his three-year deal to turn United around. But after the 20-time champions recorded their sixth win in a row with Sunday’s 3-0 victory over Liverpool, Rooney claimed United can challenge Chelsea and Manchester City as they head into a busy Christmas programme. Manchester United players (left to right) Ander Herrera, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and David de Gea arrive at their second Christmas party .

England duo Michael Carrick and Ashley Young were at the do - the Neighbourhood Bar was booked booked until 2am . De Gea, who was widely praised for his superb performance against Liverpool on Sunday, arrives with Rafael, Herrera, Mata and Van Persie . De Gea, Mata and Angel di Maria got off the coaches to go to United's second Christmas party of the season . ‘We have to believe we can win the title,’ said Rooney. ‘We are eight points behind and coming into a busy period. If we can win our games and the others have one bad result then there is nothing there. We have to keep winning and hopefully get back to the top. 'We have a great team spirit. Everybody is pulling together. We all want to win, we all want to be successful. As long as we keep working we won’t be far away.’ Rooney believes it is a good sign that United are winning games without playing at their best, and warned there is enough title-winning experience in the squad to mark them out as contenders. The United players were at Wing's restaurant and the Ralph Abercomby pub as well as Neighbourhood on their second party .

Rooney excelled in a midfield role against Liverpool and believes it is a transition that will help him to extend his top-flight career. ‘It’s a different system and a new position again for me but I’ve played it before,’ he added. ‘It can help me in years to come. I feel I can drop back and it will give me an extra few years at the end of my career.’ Rooney and his fellow United's stars took the chance to have a second Christmas party of the season, heading out to a bar in central Manchester to celebrate on Monday night, meanwhile. Rooney, the club captain and the player charged with organising both parties, led the way, as the United squad visited Wing's, the Abercromby  and The Neighbourhood Bar in three separate coaches. Rooney took to the stage to sing with Ed Sheeran at the Abercromby recently. Neighbourhood was thought to be booked out for the United squad until 2am, with Van Gaal's side not in midweek action the players have the chance to let their hair down.

"Real estate mogul and 'The Apprentice' star Donald Trump isn't running for president yet, but he is sounding more and more like someone who believes there's a path to the White House opening up before him. 'I can tell you there's a very substantial chance I will (run),' Trump told MailOnline in an interview Monday before he spoke at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Washington. But 'I don't want to put a number on it,' he said, when asked whether the chance of a Trump candidacy was better than 50-50. He is, however, lining up support in key early primary states and taking pre-emptive swipes at potential rivals, both classic behaviors of the species POTUS seekus. Next month Trump will appear at three separate events in Iowa, one of the three marquee states whose Republican voters will anoint a front-runner in the 2016 presidential nomination contest. READY FOR HIS FIRESIDE CHAT: Trump's no-holds-barred style draws massive crowds, and he insists his hair is all-natural . EARLY THROWDOWN: Trump claimed conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz 'has a problem because he was born in Canada,' raising the specter of a new birther controversy . One of those speaking engagements will be a 'freedom summit' where he will jockey for stage time with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, former U.S. ambassador John Bolton and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina – all names familiar to those in the 2016 campaign-watching business. Sources tell MailOnline that Trump also has political events lined up in New Hampshire and South Carolina – the other two crucial early primary states – although they haven't yet been announced publicly. 'Everybody wants me in there,' Trump said of his nationwide support among Republican leaders. 'I helped lots of people get elected (this year). I did lots of robocalls for people. Everybody I did a robocall for won.' A GOP political operative in Iowa said Monday night that Trump is 'one of a kind, and that scares the hell out of a lot of people.' 'I don't think he's serious, but can you imagine if he were?' the campaign adviser asked. 'Holy s**t, would that be fun to watch. And he's so rich he wouldn't have to kiss anyone's *ss for donations' 'He's a loose cannon with a private jet. I can't wait.' During his public remarks Monday evening, Trump reiterated that he is 'considering' a run 'very strongly. A lot of people believe I'm having fun with it, and I enjoy the process, but the country's in serious trouble.' 'I think we need someone very good, very fast, or we'll be in a lot of trouble,' Trump said, scoffing at critics who say 'that I'm playing games.' He said he would announce a decision 'sometime after the beginning of the year. Probably sometime in March, April or May.' The billionaire insisted that he 'would rather do what I'm doing than run for president, but I love the country more.' 'Until I see someone I think is outstanding, I'd be inclined to do it.' MailOnline asked him on Monday for his estimation of six potential presidential front-runners, including three Democrats and three fellow Republicans. Former Secretary of State and U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton, he said, is 'a front-runner, but we've seen that before,' referring to her 2008 crash-and-burn at the hands of Barack Obama. Trump cautioned that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democrat, could give Hillary her 2016 Waterloo moment. 'If she runs it's going to be very tough for Hillary,' he said. 'I don't know if it's going to be that easy for her to get the nomination. I would say Elizabeth Warren is going to be competition for her.' Trump said he likes Vice President Joe Biden, but 'I don't think he's going to be a factor.' A Monmouth University poll released Monday morning indicates he's right: Biden attracted the support of just 2 per cent of Democrats. On the Republican side, he had much harsher things to say – an indication that he has a primary fight on his mind. Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, he said, will continue to be dogged by a 2011 debate misstep – the infamous 'Oops' moment – that saw him unable to come up with the names of three federal agencies he had pledged to shut down if he won the White House. 'It's going to be very hard for him – because of what happened the last time around,' Trump said. Then the knives came out. 'I'm a Republican but the last thing we need is another Bush,' he said, referring to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. 'And his position on immigration is ridiculous.' SMACKDOWN: Trump predicted that Hilary Clinton (left), the early Democratic presidential favorite, will face a serious challenge from Massachusetts en. Elizabeth Warren (right) who has staked out more liberal positions . 'LOOSE CANNON WITH A PRIVATE JET': One Iowa campaign adviser who works for GOP candidates said a Trump candidacy would be a blast to watch . 'THE LAST THING WE NEED IS ANOTHER BUSH': The 'Apprentice' star jabbed at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for his position on immigration that mirrors President Barack Obama's . Bush stands out among GOP 2016 hopefuls as the most friendly to Obama's executive decision to guarantee millions of illegal immigrants a deportation-free two years until he leaves office. And Sen. Cruz might attract his own birther controversy, Trump suggested. 'Ted Cruz has a problem because he was born in Canada. He admits he was born in Canada, and I assume that's a problem,' he told MailOnline. The Calgary-born Cruz's father began his life in Cuba and later became a U.S. citizen. His mother was born in the United States. That, say most quoted experts, is enough for Cruz to satisfy the constitutional requirement that only a 'natural born citizen' can be elected president. A Cruz spokesperson confirmed that outlook late Monday night, saying that 'Sen. Cruz is a U.S. citizen by birth, having been born to an American mother.' Trump famously courted controversy by taking credit for Obama's belated release in 2011 of his long-form birth certificate. 'I am really honored and I am really proud, that I was able to do something that nobody else could do,' he said at the time, citing his own bush-beating with public questions about the president's heritage. Trump later offered to donate $5 million to a charity of Obama's choosing if he would release his college and passport applications before October 2012. He explained this year at the National Press Club that he believes the president may have falsely claimed to have been a Kenyan national in order to ease his admission to elite universities in the U.S. Asked to think of a 'single nice thing' to say about the president during a press gaggle after his Economic Club speech, Trump shrugged. 'The one good thing you can say is that he's a good campaigner,' he said. 'But he did it fraudulently because the things he said weren't so.' NOT A FACTOR: Trump doesn't expect Vice President Joe Biden to make any noise at all in the 2016 presidential contest . Trump couldn't come up with anything nice to say about Mrs. Clinton. 'Hillary is someone I know very well,' he said, adding that Bill and Hillary Clinton 'are members of clubs that I have.' 'And it's going to be interesting with Hillary. I think Hillary is going to have some opposition. I don't know if it's going to be that easy for her to get the nomination.' Trump told a capacity audience at the Marriott Marquis hotel in D.C. that America's deteriorating economic conditions would require the next U.S. president to re-think the nation's economic policies. The real unemployment rate, he said, isn't the 5.8 per cent figure that the Bureau of Labor Statistics claims. 'It's probably 20 per cent,' he said, accounting for part-time workers and millions who have 'given up' on the labor market. He also told MailOnline that Senate Democrats' recent release of a 'partisan' report condemning the Central Intelligence Agency's controversial terrorist-torture program 'was an outrage.' 'We paid $40 million for a report that should have never been even contemplated,' he said, suddenly animated. 'And I think it's a great embarrassment to this country, to the CIA, to patriots. I think it's something that should have never even been thought of.' He also said he constantly has to push back against reports that claim he wears the world's worst toupee. 'It's legitimately my hair,' Trump insisted, drawing laughs.","Trump has kept his spotlight hot and raised smirks by speculating about a White House run, but now he's scheduling speeches in early primary states .

"A mother claims staff at a nursery refused to let her daughter eat a chicken sandwich - because it wasn't halal. Yasmin Jackson, 24, claims staff at Kingswood Daycare Nursery in Mitcham, south London, 'starved' her five-year-old daughter Amari over concerns about the meat in her packed lunch. And police are now investigating possible race and religious offences against the nursery after an online campaign surrounding the incident. Scroll down for video . Furore: Yasmin Jackson and her daughter Amari, who she claims was not allowed to eat her sandwich as the nursery has a halal meat-only policy. She is pictured with a letter from the council telling her to provide lunch . She took Amari to the first day of a summer play scheme at the nursery with a packed lunch on Monday, as instructed by Merton Council. But when she collected Amari in the afternoon, she found her child hadn't been allowed to eat the chicken salad sandwich, houmous, carrots and a chocolate bar in her lunch box. Ms Jackson, a single mother and former nursery worker, said: 'When I picked her up at the end of the day the first thing she said to me was, ""mummy I'm really hungry, can I have my lunch now?"" 'I went to speak to the manager and I said ""why wasn't my daughter allowed her lunch"" and she said ""we didn't know it was healthy"". 'And she said ""the form was wrong, you weren't meant to send a lunch as it is provided here. We gave her a small portion of spaghetti pasta and an apple"". 'And she said we didn't know if it's halal. 'I said we are a Christian family and it was a chicken sandwich. 'And she said ""we don't allow any non-halal meat in the nursery"". So I thought ""this is just ridiculous"".' Video courtesy of IFANCA . Ms Jackson, a single mother and former nursery worker, said: 'When I picked her up at the end of the day the first thing she said to me was, ""mummy I'm really hungry, can I have my lunch now?""' Ms Jackson said Amari has a history of eating difficulties which have only recently improved. Angered by the day's events, Miss Jackson posted a story on Facebook, where it was shared by friends and went viral. She says her Muslim friends are also angry about the incident. Following the incident, the nursery has suspended its website and reported racially and religiously aggravated electronic communications to the police. Afsheen Siddik, nursery manager, said: 'I deny the untrue and false allegations that have been made against myself and Kingswood Daycare Nursery. 'As a result I have informed Ofsted and the police who are currently dealing with this matter. 'We work closely with parents to provide a high standard you would expect for your child. 'We treat each child as an individual and provide them with equal opportunities and meet all ethical standards.' She would not comment on the nursery's packed lunch policy. Ms Jackson said: 'I will send Amari to another play centre if the social worker can find her one. But I 'd rather not have a further incident of my five-year-old starved. I wouldn't do it to her and I don't expect anyone else to.' Probe: Police are now investigating possible race and religious offences against Kingsway Daycare Nursery after an online campaign surrounding the incident. Kingswood Daycare Nursery provides care for children aged three months to five years and was rated as 'good' in the most recent Ofsted inspection. A police spokeswoman said: 'I can confirm that officers in Merton have received a complaint of racially and religiously aggravated communications sent to the said location which are also a matter of investigation. 'At this time officers in Merton are liaising with local partners and Ofsted.' Merton Council said it is unaware of any complaints made about the nursery. It added: 'Kingswood Day Care Nursery is run privately. The food policy is decided by the nursery.' An Ofsted spokesman said: 'We don’t comment on individual complaints. Our role is to ensure that schools are able to provide a safe and secure environment.' In Arabic the word Halal means ‘permitted’ or ‘lawful’ and defines anything that is allowed or lawful according to the Koran. It is often used to indicate food – particularly meat – that has been prepared in accordance with Muslim principles and techniques. In Britain, killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal, but the law gives special exemption to Muslim and Jewish meat producers on the grounds of religion. In the UK there are thought to be around 12 abattoirs dedicated to unstunned slaughter, while hundreds practise stunned halal slaughter.","Yasmin Jackson says her daughter Amari was 'starved' by the end of the day .

"One invasive mosquito already seen in Kent is culex modestus, which spreads the infectious West Nile virus . Public health officials are monitoring Britain’s southern borders amid concerns deadly mosquitoes are heading our way. Experts fear that the disease-carrying mosquitoes which were already spotted around Europe are crossing the Channel. One invasive mosquito already seen in Kent is culex modestus, which spreads the infectious West Nile virus. The disease causes serious flu-like symptoms and leads to swelling of the brain and spinal cord in the most serious cases. And with the continuing mild weather and global warming they could thrive across Southern England. Species such as the Asian tiger mosquito act as carriers for diseases such as potentially fatal dengue fever, which can also cause shock, bleeding and organ damage. Dr Jolyon Medlock, programme leader with Public Health England’s medical entomology team, said authorities are monitoring the situation closely. He said: ‘One of the things we are looking at is the incursion of invasive mosquitoes which act as vectors for diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya. The number of cases is fairly low in Europe at the moment but with climate change and increased globalisation there is the potential for that to change. ‘Given the continued spread of invasive mosquitoes in continental Europe, PHE continue to conduct surveillance at ports of entry and some motorway service stations. ‘We are also providing an identification service for nuisance mosquitoes.’ Dr Medlock said it was difficult to detect exactly how invasive species make it to Britain but said there was a number of potential entry routes. He said Asian tiger mosquitoes – a large and aggressive variety – breed in tyres, laying eggs which can survive dormant for up to 18 months. When the tyres are exported to Europe the eggs travel with them and hatch when conditions are right. A three-dimensional image of the West Nile Virus. The disease causes serious flu-like symptoms and leads to swelling of the brain and spinal cord in the most serious cases . It is believed the insects also end up arriving on aeroplanes and lorries stopping on the continent enroute to Britain. The Asian tiger mosquito bites during the day and is already a major problem in Italy and parts of southern Europe. It is also identified as a carrier of chikungunya, which like dengue fever can cause severe fevers of up to 40 degrees followed by joint pain that can last for years. Mosquitoes need water to reproduce and Dr Medlock said covering water sources would help minimise potential breeding sites. He said: ‘We encourage good “garden husbandry” in the summer months, by reducing the number of container habitats around the garden. This includes turning upside down buckets, emptying paddling pools that aren’t being used, unblocking drains and putting lids on water butts.’","One mosquito was recorded spreads deadly West Nile Virus .

"The New York City schoolboy who gained overnight fame after telling a reporter he had made $72million trading stocks on his lunch breaks has claimed he made it all up. Mohammed Islam, 17, who said he had made millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures and equities, has now hired a pricey crisis PR firm and battle-tested attorneys to spread the word. The Stuyvesant High School student was surrounded by his new entourage when he came clean to the New York Observer on Monday after his little fib turned into a major international news story. It comes as New York Magazine, which ran the original interview with Islam, including his estimated $72million fortune, has admitted it was 'duped' by the teenager and apologized to its readers. Scroll down for video . Not a multi-millionaire: Mohammed Islam, 17, from Queens, New York made international headlines after a New York Magazine article said he had made millions on the stock market. Now, Islam says the claims aren't true . Apology: New York Magazine today admitted it was 'duped' by the teenager and apologized to its readers . In a statement, the magazine, whose reporter Jessica Pressler initially insisted she was shown bank statements showing he is worth eight figures, said: 'As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. 'After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. 'But in an interview with the New YorkObserver last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified.' It concluded: 'We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.' Far from his original claims, Islam, president of the prestigious high school's investment club, now says he traded only using simulated money he made using an online trading program. Eight figures? The writer of the article, Jessica Pressler, has come under fire for failing to fact check, but she insisted she saw bank statements backing up rumors Islam was worth 'eight figures' The Queens teen told the Observer that not only was the $72 million totally false, but he's never made any money in the stock market at all. '[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades,' he told the Observer. A firestorm of criticism was unleashed in the wake of Islam's retraction on New York Magazine and the original article's author Jessica Pressler. Detractors say the writer failed to do appropriate fact checking for her article. The Observer's Ken Kurson writes: . 'Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.' Helaine Olen of the Pacific Standard took to Twitter, as many did Monday, to demand that Pressler come up with some answers to how she and her publication managed to pass off the seeming impossibility as fact. 'OK. Here goes ... did he show statements? I have a 15 yr old so I want to believe,' Olen tweeted. Pressler responded to the criticism through Twitter on Monday morning. 'We saw a bank statement confirming the eight figures, & I'm comfortable with what's in the piece,' she wrote. In the wake of the controversy New York Magazine added an editor's note to qualify their now contentious article - which was later edited to include the full apology. 'Our story portrays the $72 million figure as a rumor; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades,' the note said. 'However, Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures, and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures.' Going back: Islam (pictured center, in glasses) who said he had made millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures and equities, has now hired a pricey crisis PR firm and battle-tested attorneys to spread the word . Coming clean: Islam (left) came clean to the New York Observer, but did so surrounded by his new friends . So, as the Observer and everyone else wants to know: where did Pressler come up with the $72 million figure? In Islam's own words, 'The number’s a rumor.' Indeed, Pressler does not state the $72 million figure as fact in her original article. Regardless, NYmag.com has since changed the original headline so as not to reflect that number. However, the online bickering began when the  New York Post picked up the story and ran it as fact with the breathless headline, 'High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.' 'A thing that I have learned today is that @nypost still drives a remarkable amount of international news coverage,' Pressler would tweet Monday. Talking the talk: Islam (pictured giving a high school TED talk) told the Observer he's actually never made any money in the stock market at all . Fighting back: Pressler says she saw statements backing up the rumors about Islam's wealth, but he says they were only rumors and he's never even traded a stock . The house of cards has since fallen for Islam, too, of course. He was due to appear on CNBC on Monday morning to talk about his fantastical skills on the stock market. In light of his new found infamy and no doubt counseled by his new advisers, that slot was canceled. And as a teenager, Islam still has to face his disapproving parents when he goes home. 'My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me,' he said in his interview with the Observer. 'They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.'

"Researchers now say the daring 1962 Alcatraz jail break that many have said over the decades likely ended in the deaths of the escapees may have had a happy ending for the three daring escapees. New computer models that consider  the San Francisco Bay's tides, winds and other factors reveal the prisoners stood a small chance of paddling to freedom on the north side of the Golden Gate Bridge. According to the Dutch team of scientists that assembled the data, it all depends on the time inmates Clarence Anglin, John Anglin and Frank Morris set sail in their makeshift dingy made of raincoats. Scroll Down to see CG Animation . The way they look today? New computer models that consider the San Francisco Bay's tides, winds and other factors reveal John and Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris stood a small chance of paddling to freedom from Alcatraz. Here, prison mug shots of the trio are compared to images of how they might look today . Best case scenario: Computer models assembled by a Dutch team of researchers reveal the escapees had a chance to beat the odds if they launched their dingy of raincoats between 11pm and midnight and then paddled hard to the north . 'Only in the time window between (11pm) and midnight do they get close enough to the shore to have a chance to survive,' writes one of the researchers, Dr. Rolf Hut, on his blog. Otherwise, one of three disastrous things would have happened. Had they launched in the hours before, the men would have been sucked out into the frigid Pacific and died of hypothermia. Had they waited until after midnight, the tide would have shifted during their daring voyage and the current would have pushed them deeper into the San Francisco Bay. There, they either would have perished from cold before they got close enough to the East Bay to make landfall or gotten picked up by authorities when the sun rose in the morning. The Rock: For 20th century crime buffs, few capers match the intrigue and ingenuity of the ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" the 1962 prison break three inmates pulled off with stolen spoons, dummy heads and a raincoat raft. The Dutch team from Delft University of Technology used this model of the currents in San Francisco Bay on June 11, 1962 . Worst case: If the escapees left too early or failed to paddle north after leaving the island, they would have gotten sucked into the Pacific and died . We know the third possibility never happened. Out of the 36 Alcatraz inmates who tried to flee before the prison was closed in March 1963, the three are the only ones who remain unaccounted for, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, which maintains active arrest warrants on Morris and the Anglins. Assuming the men did launch sometime around 11:30 and somehow knew to first paddle their makeshift boat hard to the north--towards Angel Island, where some of their belongings and a paddle would later be found--they could have become the only prisoners to ever escape the so-called inescapable prison. 'If they hit it exactly at midnight, the beautiful thing is that we see that they would have been sucked out towards the Golden Gate Bridge,' Dr Hut told BBC News. Shocking simplicity: The men used spoons to dig holes through their cell walls . As they neared the bridge, the shifting tides would have made paddling far easier. 'In the best case, the escapees peddle northwards with a speed of almost 1 km per hour, an almost olympian effort. In that scenario, they most likely survive and make it to the north side of the Golden Gate bridge,' Hut wrote. Whether or not that happened, we're unlikely to ever know and the story's sensational mystery remains. For 20th century crime buffs, few capers match the intrigue and ingenuity of the 'Escape from Alcatraz,' which the inmates pulled off with stolen spoons, dummy heads and a raincoat raft. The escapees fashioned these dummy heads using soap, paper and real hair that they placed on their beds to fool guards . The FBI acquired most of what it learned about the great escape from a fourth inmate who planned to take part in the break out but, at the last minute, ran into technical problems. The four reportedly spent months using spoons and forks to dig holes in the crumbling masonry surrounding the air vents in their cells. The crawl spaces they fashioned eventually pierced the six-and-a-half-inch thick walls until they reached a utility corner, from which they were able to shimmy out through a roof vent. To prepare for their flights, they also produced a raft and life vests out of more than 50 cotton raincoats, with rubberized backing, that inmates were assigned. They also had created mannequin heads out of paper, paint and hair purloined from the prison barber shop. They left the heads in their beds while they worked on the raft and the night of the getaway. Replicas of the dummy heads lie in their former cells, which are popular stops with the more than a million tourists who visit Alcatraz Island every year. While what happened to the three men remains a mystery, the escape's enduring mystique isn't ambiguous at all, National Park Service spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet said. 'It's one of those yarns where everyone can attach their own reality because they can wrap themselves around whatever part they want,' Picavet said. The holes led to an unused utility area. From there, they shimmied onto the roof through a vent in the ceiling .","It all depends on the time Clarence Anglin, John Anglin and Frank Morris set sail in their makeshift dingy made of raincoats that June night .
Had they put in between 11pm and midnight--and paddled hard--a Dutch team's computer models reveal they would have made it safely to land .
Any other time and the daring trio would have wound up dead in the frigid Pacific or somewhere in the San Francisco Bay ."
"Los Angeles Kings defenseman Viatcheslav 'Slava' Voynov, who allegedly punched, kicked and choked his wife, was ordered on Monday to stand trial on a felony domestic violence charge. The 24-year-old Russian is scheduled to be arraigned on December 29 on one count of corporal injury to a spouse with great bodily injury. During a preliminary hearing before Superior Court Judge Hector M. Guzman, officer Gregory Wiist of the police force in suburban Redondo Beach said he spoke to Voynov's wife, Marta Varlamova, at a hospital in the early morning hours of October 20. Serious charged: LA Kings hockey defenseman Sasha Voynov, center, appears in Torrance Superior Court in Torrance, California flanked by an attorney, (left), and an interpreter at his preliminary trial on Monday . 'She was crying, sobbing,' Wiist said. 'I saw tears streaming down her face. She was an emotional wreck.' Wiist said Varlamova had a bleeding cut above her left eye and red marks on her neck and told him she was involved in a physical altercation with her husband. According to Wiist's testimony, Varlamova told him the couple argued at a Halloween party on the night of October 19, where Voynov punched her in the face. When they went home, the argument continued and Voynov threw her to the ground repeatedly, kicked her and choked her in an attack that continued until she was pushed into a television, suffering a cut on her head that needed eight stitches. During a preliminary hearing before Superior Court Judge Hector M. Guzman, officer Gregory Wiist of the police force in suburban Redondo Beach said he spoke to Voynov's wife, Marta Varlamova (pictured with his wife), at a hospital in the early morning hours of October 20 . Los Angeles Kings defenseman Viatcheslav 'Slava' Voynov, who allegedly punched, kicked and choked his wife (pictured with their daughter), was ordered on Monday to stand trial on a felony domestic violence charge. Voynov, who took his wife to a hospital, was later arrested there after medical staff called police. Voynov, who has denied wrong-doing, was promptly suspended by the NHL, who fined the Kings $100,000 this month for allowing him to skate with the team during a practice. Voynov, of Chelyabinsk, won two Stanley Cup championships with the Kings in 2012 and 2014. Varlamova, who wasn't present at Monday's hearing, has previously said she didn't want her husband to be charged because she doesn't believe he was trying to hurt her. 'Marta does not believe that Slava is a threat to her and doesn’t believe that he was trying to hurt her,' attorney Michael Walsh told the Daily Breeze. 'He certainly says he was not trying to hurt her. It was just an unfortunate thing that occurred.' She moved back in with him shortly after the incident. Voynov's attorney, Craig Renetzy, has said that the incident was no more than an accident. The couple were reportedly shocked when officers arrested Voynov at the hospital. 'I don’t think it occurred to them,' Walsh told reporters . He said that his client does not speak English and was not able to communicate properly with the police. 'Police asked her when she was leaving the hospital, ‘Did you want us to keep him away?’ ” Walsh said. '(She responded) ‘No, I want my husband back with me.’ It was not long before they were back together and spending time with their daughter.'","The 24-year-old Russian is scheduled to be arraigned on December 29 on one count of corporal injury to a spouse with great bodily injury .

"A lawyer representing a woman who has accused Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting when she was 15 has stated in a court filing that he has interviewed two witnesses who corroborate her story. Attorney Marc Strecker wrote in a sworn declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday that he has reviewed photographs of his client, Judy Huth, with Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in the mid-1970s, the place and time she says the abuse happened. Huth's sexual battery lawsuit against Cosby comes amid an avalanche of allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than two dozen women. Scroll down for video . She said, he said: A lawyer for Judith Huth (left) who is suing Cosby alleging Bill Cosby (right) sexually abused her when she was 15 years old says he has interviewed two witnesses who corroborate her story . Judy Huth, left, appears at a press conference with attorney Gloria Allred outside the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire Division station Friday . 'Together': Allred held up this image which she claimed to show Huth and Cosby together years ago . He has never been charged in connection with any of the accusations, and his lawyers deny many of the allegations. He reached a settlement with a Pennsylvania woman who in a 2005 lawsuit said Cosby drugged and molested her in 2004. Cosby's attorney Martin Singer is seeking to dismiss Huth's suit and has called it an extortion attempt. He says Huth, now 55 years old, tried to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago and contends that undercuts her claim of recently discovered psychological damage. Strecker's declaration does not provide details about how the witnesses corroborate Huth's story, but her lawsuit states she and a 16-year-old female friend were taken to the Playboy Mansion by Cosby sometime around 1974. The lawsuit alleges that they met him at a film shoot, and he later gave them alcohol while they played pool, before he took them to the mansion. Latest accuser: Las Vegas adult entertainer Chloe Goins, 24, has become the latest woman to accuse Cosby of sexual misconduct . Strecker's filing also includes a declaration from Dr. Anthony E. Reading, a clinical psychologist who interviewed Huth and stated there is 'a reasonable basis to believe that Ms. Huth has been subject to childhood sexual abuse.' Reading's statement does not mention Cosby. Many of the allegations against Cosby are blocked from court by statutes of limitations, but Los Angeles police are investigating Huth's claims. She appeared at a news conference December 5 with attorney Gloria Allred, who held up decades-old photographs of Huth with Cosby. Allred wrote in an email Monday that the photos were taken at the Playboy Mansion. Judy Huth is among two dozen women who have come forward in recent weeks accusing the 77-year-old married comedian of drugging and raping them over the course of five decades. Cosby has not commented on the accusations, but his wife and the mother of his five children, Camille Cosby, released a statement Monday staunchly defending her husband and proclaiming him the real victim of the scandal. ‘He is a kind man, a generous man, a funny man, and a wonderful husband, father and friend,’ Camille Cosby said in the 210-word statement released by Cosby's publicist. ‘He is the man you thought you knew.’ Mrs Cosby, who married the trailblazing comic in 1964, called her husband ‘the man you all knew through his work’ and excoriated the news media for not vetting her husband's accusers. ‘None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim,’ Camille Cosby continued. ‘But the question should be asked - who is the victim?’ The previous day, Cosby gave a brief interview with the New York Post, disparaging the media and praising his wife for giving him 'strength and love.' She's got his back: Camille Cosby (right) released a statement Monday staunchly defending her husband and proclaiming him the real victim of the scandal . The most high profile of Cosby's accusers is model Janice Dickinson, who alleges Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1982. Model Beverly Johnson alleges Cosby drugged her in the mid-1980s.

"Islamic Sharia law will be the ‘basic source’ of legislation in free Libya, its new leader has proclaimed. Mustafa Abdul-Jalil’s vision has come as a shock to some of the millions of citizens still celebrating their liberty from decades of tyranny. The chairman of the National Transitional Council declared that a future  parliament would have an ‘Islamist tint’ and any existing laws contradicting the teachings of Islam would be ‘nullified’. Unanswered questions: Libya's Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril wanted the opportunity to interrogate Gaddafi . Under the new regime, men will even be permitted to take up to four wives, he suggested. The sudden lurch by a country seen as very moderate towards Islamic extremism will alarm many in the West who supported the ousting of Colonel Gaddafi. It could also prove deeply embarrassing to David Cameron as he ordered the £1billion mission to back the rebels despite advice from all sides urging caution. Yesterday ordinary Libyans expressed their surprise at the turn of events. Benghazi: As night fell Libyans carried on the partying in Saha Kish Square . Benghazi: Libyans wave their new national flag in the eastern city after liberation was announced . Mohammed Bodima, said: ‘We have fought . and spilled blood for democracy. What is this about sharia law?’ The . father-of-two used to live in Catford, south-east London, but now . resides in Benghazi, birthplace of the revolution. Libya's former foreign minister has been traced to a luxury resort in Qatar, according to reports. Musa Kusa is believed to have been an intelligence officer at the time of the 1988 Lockerbie bomb atrocity in which 270 people were killed. He made a high-profile defection to Britain in March and was interviewed by police and Scottish prosecutors investigating the bombing. He left the country following an EU decision to lift sanctions against him, meaning he no longer faces travel restrictions or an asset freeze. Kusa was traced by the BBC's Panorama programme, which is investigating allegations that he tortured political prisoners in Libya. He declined to comment on the claims. Kusa was head of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence agency from 1994 and a senior intelligence agent when PanAm flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie. There have also been calls for Kusa to be quizzed in relation to the murder of Pc Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot during a protest outside London's Libyan Embassy in 1984. The Foreign Office said Kusa was a 'private individual' who had been interviewed voluntarily. He added: ‘If we are to have sharia, it must be voted on by the population. That would be democracy.’ Tripoli resident Abdul Azzud said: ‘I am very worried. Nobody realised this is what we would get. ‘They are going in the wrong direction . if they impose sharia. It is extremely concerning.’ After making his . surprise announcement at a liberation ceremony in Benghazi, Mr . Abdul-Jalil stepped from the podium to kneel and offer a prayer of . thanks. Later he was at pains to insist Libya would not drift towards religious extremism. ‘I want to assure the international community that we as Libyans are moderate Muslims,’ he said. And he said the proposed constitution was ‘temporary’ and would be put to a referendum. But in his earlier speech, he announced: ‘Any law that violates sharia is null and void legally,’ citing a marriage law passed by Gaddafi imposing restrictions on polygamy. The Muslim holy book, the Koran, allows men to take up to four wives. ‘The law of divorce and marriage, this law is contrary to sharia and it is stopped,’ Mr Abdul-Jalil declared. His remarks were condemned by  Adelrahman al-Shatr, a founder of the new centre-right Party of National Solidarity. ‘By abolishing the marriage law, women lose the right to keep the family home if they divorce,’ he said. ‘It is a disaster for Libyan women. ‘It is a subject that should be discussed with the political groups and the Libyan people. These declarations create pain and bitterness among women.’ A 40-year-old Libyan woman called Rim added: ‘It is shocking and insulting to state, after thousands of Libyans have paid for freedom with their lives, that the priority is to allow men to marry in secret. ‘We did not slay Goliath so that we now live under the Inquisition.’ Tripoli: A woman holds up a photo of a relative during post-liberation celebrations in Martyrs' Square .","I regret Gaddafi death says prime minister: Tyrant 'should have answered for his crimes in court'

"Gas prices are falling across the country leading to the lowest prices at the pump in five years. For drivers, shippers, airlines and other consumers of fuel, there's nothing not to like about downward trend. The national average gasoline price has fallen for 81 straight days to $2.55 a gallon, its lowest level since October of 2009, according to AAA. It's $1.15 a gallon cheaper than its high for the year, saving U.S. households $100 a month as they shop for holiday presents. Coming down: Roxana Valverde adjusts the gas price sign numbers at a Tolleson, Arizona convenience store as gas prices continue to tumble nationwide . Good deal: Motorist Jerry Reed fills up his tank at a gas station in Atlanta. The price of oil has fallen by nearly half in just six months, a surprising and steep plunge that has consumers cheering . ""Any time gas prices go down that is a good thing,"" said Randy Daniels, 30, who was shopping recently at the Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. ""An extra 20 or 30 bucks in my pocket goes far."" Diesel and jet fuel prices have also plunged, helping boost the profits and share prices of airlines and shippers. The cheapest gas in the country is currently being sold in Missouri, where the average price per gallon is $2.23. It's probably no surprise that Hawaii has the most expensive gas, at $3.69 a gallon . The plunge in gasoline prices that is showing no signs of slowing has dropped the national average price to $2.60 a gallon, its lowest level since December of 2009. It's saving a typical household $60 a month compared to last year around this time, enough for an extra holiday gift or two. Here are the 5 cheapest and 5 most expensive states for gasoline in the lower 48 states as of Friday, according to AAA. LOWEST STATE AVERAGES . Missouri - $2.32 . Oklahoma - $2.36 . Texas - $2.38 . Mississippi - $2.39 . South Carolina - $2.40 . HIGHEST STATE AVERAGES . New York - $3.02 . Connecticut - $2.96 . Vermont - $2.94 . California - $2.92 . Washington - $2.90 . The most expensive gas in the lower 48 states was in San Francisco, where it goes for $3.04 per gallon. Heating oil is the cheapest it has been in four years, reducing home heating prices just in time for winter for many in the chilly Northeast. The price per barrel for crude oil has dropped 41 percent since the end of 2013, from $98.17 to $57.49. Prices are expected to continue to drop – especially in wake of a statement from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries saying that it has no set price for oil. The price of oil has fallen by nearly half in just six months, a surprising and steep plunge that has consumers cheering, producers howling and economists wringing their hands over whether this is a good or bad thing. The price of a barrel of oil is just under $56, down from a summer high of $107, and lower than at any time since the U.S. was still in recession in the spring of 2009. The plunge in prices is being blamed on a global imbalance of supply and demand that is rippling across the world economy, for better and worse. Years of high oil prices, interrupted briefly by the recession, inspired drillers around the world to scour the earth's crust for more oil and they found it. Since 2008 oil companies in the U.S., for example, have increased production by 70 percent, or 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. To put that in perspective, that increase alone is more than the production of any OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia. As U.S. production was ramping up, turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa reduced supplies from Libya, Iran and elsewhere. More to come? Oil prices have dropped sharply around the world, easing gasoline costs for U.S. driver . A balance was struck: Increasing supplies from outside of OPEC and from Iraq's recovering oil industry helped meet rising demand around the world as other OPEC supplies waivered. But now those OPEC supplies look more certain despite continuing turmoil, and those non-OPEC supplies have swamped the market. OPEC estimated last week that the world would need 28.9 million barrels of its oil per day next year, the lowest in more than a decade. At the same time, OPEC countries plan to produce 30 million barrels of oil per day next year. That supply surplus is sending global prices lower.","Gasoline prices plunged in 2014 - and it's possible they still haven't hit bottom .

"A witness who testified before a Missouri grand jury that she saw Michael Brown charge at Ferguson officer Darren Wilson ‘like a football player, head down,’ has been claimed to be a bipolar woman with a track record of lying to the police and making racist remarks. St. Louis resident Sandra McElroy, 45, told police that she watched the August 9 shooting unfold in front of her as she stood on a nearby sidewalk smoking a cigarette. She twice appeared before the grand jury giving a version of events that supported Officer Wilson’s statement, before her testimony was eventually discounted after she admitted that it included information she had read online about the shooting. Scroll down for video . St. Louis resident Sandra McElroy, 45, testified before a Missouri grand jury that she saw Michael Brown, right, charge at Ferguson officer Darren Wilson 'like a football player, head down' Prosecutors argued that McElroy had fabricated the entire incident and was not even at the scene the day of the shooting - although she maintained she was. In grand jury materials McElroy was referred to only as ‘Witness 40’, but her real identify has been revealed by The Smoking Gun after it carried out research into her background which uncovered that she has a history of lying to the police and making racist statements on social media. According to her grand jury testimony, the divorced mother-of-five was diagnosed as bipolar at 16, but hasn’t taken medication for about 25 years. McElroy’s legal history shows that along with a variety of civil lawsuits she was arrested in 2007 on two felony bad check charges for which she received a suspended sentence. The Brown shooting wasn’t the first high-profile Missouri criminal case that McElroy had claimed involvement with. In 2007 she had approached the cops claiming to have important information after the case of a boy who had been rescued after four years in captivity – however her claims were dismissed as a ‘complete fabrication’ by the police, according to The Smoking Gun. It was four weeks after the Brown shooting that McElroy first approached the police with her claims that she had been witness to it . On social media platforms such as YouTube, the website claims McElroy was found to have a history of posting racist comments. On her YouTube page - shared with one of her daughters - she had posted a racial charged comment next to a clip about the disappearance of a white woman who had a baby with a black man. ‘See what happens when you bed down with a monkey have ape babies and party with them,’ she commented. On another clip about the sentencing of two black women for murder, she had written, 'put them monkeys in a cage.' McElroy also used social media to comment on the Brown shooting and on September 13, she had visited a pro-Wilson Facebook page and posted a graphic that included a photo of Brown lying dead in the street. ‘Michael Brown already received justice. So please, stop asking for it,’ read the text beside the image. It was just two days before that post – and some four weeks after the Brown shooting – that McElroy first approached the police with her claims that she had been witness to it. On October 22, she went to the FBI field office in St. Louis and was interviewed by an agent and two Department of Justice prosecutors. McElroy also used social media to comment on the Brown shooting and on September 13, she had visited a pro-Wilson Facebook page and posted a graphic that included a photo of Brown lying dead in the street (above) The day before her meeting, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had published a lengthy report detailing what Wilson told police investigators about the shooting. The next day McElroy provided federal investigators with an account that was very similar to Officer Wilson’s version. However she also recalled the unarmed teenager giving Wilson a ‘What are you going to do about it look,’ before he then ‘bent down in a football position…and began to charge at the officer.’ Brown, she said, ‘looked like he was on something.’ As Brown rushed Wilson, McElroy said, that the cop began firing. The ‘grunting’ teenager, McElroy recalled, was hit with a volley of shots, the last of which drove Brown ‘face first’ into the roadway. McElroy’s version of events was met with skepticism by the investigators, who reminded her that it was a crime to lie to federal agents. 'I know what I seen,' she said. 'I know you don’t believe me.' When asked what she was doing in Ferguson - about 30 miles north of her home - McElroy said she had been planning to ‘pop in’ on a former high school classmate she had not seen in 26 years but had got lost. McElroy recalled the unarmed teenager giving Wilson a 'What are you going to do about it look,' before he then 'bent down in a football position…and began to charge at the officer' Despite concerns about her version of events, state prosecutors put McElroy in front of the Ferguson grand jury and - under oath – she told her story to the 12-member panel. When McElroy returned to the Ferguson grand jury on November 3 she brought notes she claimed she had written on the same day that the shooting had taken place. But her testimony soon began to unravel when she changed her reason for being in Ferguson on the day of the shooting. Under oath, McElroy claimed that the real reason she had visited the primarily black neighborhood was because she wanted to 'strike up a conversation with an African-American.' In her note 'written' on the day Brown had died she had declared: 'Well Im gonna take my random drive to Florisant. Need to understand the Black race better so I stop calling Blacks N****** and Start calling them People.' As she testified, McElroy also admitted that her sworn account of the shooting included details she had read online about the incident. She remained adamant however that she had witnessed the events and had seen Brown ‘going after the officer like a football player’ before being shot to death. After her testimony, prosecutors suggested that McElroy had fabricated the entire incident and was not even at the scene the day of the shooting and her evidence discounted.","St. Louis resident Sandra McElroy, 45, testified before a Missouri grand jury that she saw Michael Brown charge at Ferguson officer Darren Wilson .

"Prince Albert of Monaco’s new wife Charlene Wittstock has become ‘depressed’ at her failure to provide her husband with a legitimate heir, it was claimed today. Princess Charlene is said to have struck a ‘deal’ with the principality’s playboy ruler to bear him a child after she tried to flee before their wedding last summer. But the 33-year-old South African is now unable to get pregnant, France’s Voici magazine reported. Strange union: Charlene is said to have struck a ‘deal’ with Prince Albert to bear him a child after she tried to flee before their wedding last summer . Albert already has already fathered two love-children, but neither can succeed him as they were both born out of wedlock. Voici magazine said: 'Charlene has made the subject of pregnancy a taboo topic around the Royal palace. 'She might have a smile on her face at official functions, but inside she is stressed and frustrated. 'This subject is weighing more and more heavily on her shoulders.' Rumours of a rift and a ‘pregnancy pact’ erupted even before the couple married in a lavish state wedding ten months ago. Charlene was said to have bolted for Nice airport two days before they married after hearing Albert had had a third love-child during their relationship. Monaco officials were said to have coaxed her back by brokering a deal between the Prince and his reluctant bride that she provide him with a legitimate heir. Princess Charlene and Prince Albert of Monaco arriving for the 84th Academy Awards at the Kodak Theatre, Los Angeles, in February 2012 . After that she would be free to leave of her own free will, it was reported last July. One source said at the time: 'Charlene will provide an heir, then if things don’t go well, she will receive a generous divorce settlement once she’s served a decent amount of time.' Albert, 54, has one seven-year-old son Alexandre with Togolese air hostess Nicole Coste. He has another daughter Jazmin, 20, born after a brief affair with American estate agent Tamara Rotola. Charlene last year called suggestions that she was reluctant to marry 'hilarious' on the Today show. 'Why would we go to all this effort, to have this fantastic couple of days, and have our most intimate and dearest friends come and join us, for us to be reluctant,' she said. Her husband suggested the rumours might have been triggered by jealousy from people who 'did not like the fact that we were finally together and married.' He was apparently told on the day of his . wedding that he would have to take a paternity test to determine whether . he was the father of the third illegitimate child. Tribute: The royal couple stand alongside Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway at the Princess Grace awards gala at Cipriani, held in honour of Albert's mother . Connected: The royal couple stand alongside Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway at the glamorous awards gala . Charlene, who was accused of trying . to run away three times before she married, claimed the rumours were . purely generated to sell magazines. But she spoke earlier this year about her ‘loneliness’ in Monaco, and added: 'I only have two people I consider friends here.' Before he met Charlene four years ago, Albert dated dozens of the world’s most famous and beautiful women, including Angie Everhart, Brooke Shields, and supermodel Claudia Schiffer. He also battled persistent rumours he was gay. A Monaco government spokesman insisted that once he met Charlene, Albert knew he had finally found the woman he wanted to provide an heir. The spokesman told France’s high society Point de Vue magazine last year: 'Charlene has beauty and style, and we are all praying that she will ensure the royal succession in our principality. 'Albert has never settled down in the past, but knows that the time is now right to produce the next ruler of Monaco.'","She is said to have made pregnancy pact after running away days before wedding .

"The mother of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Ohio boy fatally shot by police who believed he was carrying a gun, has said her son was never given a chance to follow officers' orders. Samaria Rice said her son was shot before he could respond to orders after the police pulled up next to him on a Cleveland playground and a rookie officer fired within two seconds. Rice said she wants the officer charged with murder and she called on authorities to make sure young officers don't 'ignore the training.' Samaria Rice has said her son Tamir, 12, was shot before he could respond to orders after the police pulled up next to him on a Cleveland playground and a rookie officer fired within two seconds last month. Rice said that when she tried to get close to her bleeding son, officers 'pushed me back, telling me to chill out or they were going to put me in the police car' Police say officers were responding to a call November 22 about someone possibly carrying a gun. Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic pellets. They say Tamir didn't respond to commands to raise his hands before Officer Timothy Loehmann fired his weapon. They also meant to stop the patrol car farther from Tamir but the vehicle slid on the grass, the Cleveland police union has said. in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Rice she found out later that Tamir was handed the fake weapon by a girl at the playground. She said police also put Tamir's 14-year-old sister in handcuffs as she rushed to help her mortally wounded brother that day. Rice's attorney, Benjamin Crump, told AP interview that the two officers could have defused the situation - by talking to the boy from a distance instead of pulling up next to him on the grass and firing. An internal Cleveland police investigation is underway and the results will be turned over to the local prosecutor, who will present them to a grand jury. The fatal encounter was caught on surveillance video. Clutching Crump's hand, the teary-eyed mother said on Monday she knew exactly where her son had gone before the shooting. Police say officers were responding to a call November 22 about someone possibly carrying a gun - but Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic pellets . Rice said she wants the officer charged with murder and she called on authorities to make sure young officers don't 'ignore the training' After she made lunch for him, he went to a recreation center across the street from their home then to the playground that is steps away from his school. His 14-year-old sister was with him, their mother said, 'and I told them to stick together and be safe.' The sister had gone to the bathroom when she heard a shot. Meanwhile, just after 3 p.m. that day, the mother heard a knock on her door. 'Two little boys came and knocked on my door and said, ""The police just shot your son twice in the stomach,'"" she recalled Monday. When she got to the scene, following her 16-year-old son, she saw him being held against the police car, with officers surrounding him while Tamir lay on the ground, she said. Tamir's sister was in the back of the cruiser, their mother said. Rice said that when she tried to get close to her bleeding son, officers 'pushed me back, telling me to chill out or they were going to put me in the police car.' Tragic: Pallbearers carry out the 12-year-old boy's casket from Gaines Funeral Home on December 3 . Rice, who is black, said she long ago had 'The Talk' with her children - as black parents call warnings to their children to comply with police or risk danger. 'My kids already know that they are supposed to cooperate with authority, period,' she said. She said her son was talented in sports and the arts and was loved in their community as someone who helped others. 'All lives matter, I don't see any color. I see boys,' she said.","Samaria Rice has said her son never stood a chance after a rookie officer fired within two seconds .

"The Supreme Court has upheld Michigan's ban on using race as a factor in college admissions in a ruling this morning. The . justices said in a 6-2 decision that Michigan voters had the right to . change their state constitution in 2006 to prohibit public colleges and . universities from taking account of race in admissions decisions. The justices said that a lower federal court was wrong to set aside the change as discriminatory. Justice . Anthony Kennedy said voters chose to eliminate racial preferences, . presumably because such a system could give rise to race-based . resentment. Ruling from the highest court: The Supreme Court knocked down a case that came from the Michigan circuit court asking for the ban on affirmative action considerations to be added back into the college admissions process . Kennedy said nothing in the Constitution or the court's prior cases gives judges the authority to undermine the election results. 'This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it,' Kennedy said. In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision tramples on the rights of minorities, even though the amendment was adopted democratically. 'But without checks, democratically approved legislation can oppress minority groups,' said Sotomayor, who read her dissent aloud in the courtroom Tuesday. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sided with Sotomayor in dissent. At 58 pages, Sotomayor's dissent was longer than the combined length of the four opinions in support of the outcome. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas agreed with Kennedy. Dissent: Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a lengthy 58-page dissent against the ruling, warning that laws that remain unchecked could lead to oppressing minorities . Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the case, presumably because she worked on it at an earlier stage while serving in the Justice Department. In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld the consideration of race among many factors in college admissions in a case from Michigan. Three years later, affirmative action opponents persuaded Michigan voters to change the state constitution to outlaw any consideration of race. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the issue was not affirmative action, but the way in which its opponents went about trying to bar it. In its 8-7 decision, the appeals court said the provision ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment because it presents an extraordinary burden to affirmative action supporters who would have to mount their own long, expensive campaign to repeal the constitutional provision. Support: Justice Anthony Kennedy, long considered the swing vote on the nine-person bench, said voters chose to eliminate racial preferences, presumably because such a system could give rise to race-based resentment . Similar voter-approved initiatives banning affirmative action in education are in place in California and Washington state. A few other states have adopted laws or issued executive orders to bar race-conscious admissions policies. Black and Latino enrollment at the University of Michigan has dropped since the ban took effect. At California's top public universities, African-Americans are a smaller share of incoming freshmen, while Latino enrollment is up slightly, but far below the state's growth in the percentage of Latino high school graduates. The case was the court's second involving affirmative action in as many years. In June, the justices ordered lower courts to take another look at the University of Texas admissions plan in a ruling that could make it harder for public colleges to justify any use of race in admissions. The case is Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 12-682.","Michigan banned the use of race in college admissions in 2006 but a recent case tried to change that ruling .

"His eyes filling with tears, Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins spoke passionately about a decision he knew would bring backlash and possibly harm his reputation. For Hawkins, there was no choice. A day after he wore a T-shirt protesting two shootings in Ohio involving police and victims carrying fake guns,  Hawkins said he was motivated out of fear that one day something tragic could happen to his 2-year-old son. Scroll Down for Video . Cleveland Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins wears a shirt calling attention to two black Ohioans killed during encounters with law enforcement before an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Cleveland . Hawkins wore the black shirt during pre-game warmups and introductions Sunday before Cleveland hosted the Cincinnati Bengals. The messages read: 'Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford' on the front and 'The Real Battle for Ohio' on the back. The 12-year-old Rice died Nov. 22 after he was shot by a rookie officer investigating a complaint about the youngster, who was carrying a fake gun. Crawford, 22, was fatally shot Aug. 5 while holding an air-pellet rifle inside a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio. 'I have a two-year-old little boy, that same two-year-old little boy everyone says was cute when I jokingly threw him out of the house earlier this year,' Hawkins said, pausing to gain his composure. 'That little boy is my entire world and the number one reason for me wearing the T-shirt was the thought of what happened to Tamir Rice happening to my little Austin scares the living hell out of me.' Hawkins spoke for six minutes Monday at his locker without taking questions. He said he wanted to address the situation after Cleveland police union president Jeff Follmer called his actions 'pathetic' 'and told cleveland.com Hawkins is 'disrespecting the police on a job that we had to do and make a split-second decision.' Hawkins' one-man protest was supported by the Browns, who said in a statement that they respected both the police and their players' rights to take on causes. 'My wearing of the T-shirt wasn't a stance against every police officer or every police department,' Hawkins said. 'My wearing of the T-shirt was a stance against wrong individuals doing the wrong thing for the wrong reason to innocent people.' The 12-year-old Rice died Nov. 22 after he was shot by a rookie officer investigating a complaint about the youngster, who was carrying a fake gun . Hawkins said he was 'scared' of the reaction to his demonstration, but the 28-year-old chose to wear the shirt 'because deep down I felt like it was the right thing to do.' 'I utterly respect and appreciate every police officer that protects and serves all of us with honesty, integrity and the right way,' he said. 'And I don't think those kind of officers should be offended by what I did. ... If I was to run away from what I felt in my soul was the right thing to do, that would make me a coward and I couldn't live with that.' Hawkins said his mother raised him to respect law enforcement and he has family and close friends who are police officers. She also taught him to stand up for his beliefs. 'My heart was broken for the parents of Tamir and John Crawford, knowing they had to live that nightmare of a reality,"" he said. 'I felt like my heart was in the right place, I'm at peace with it and those who disagree with me, this is America. That's the point. Everyone has a right to their First Amendment rights.' Browns linebacker Craig Robertson said he did not have any issue with his teammate's choice to protest before the game. 'You can't fault a person for standing up for something that he believes in,' Robertson said. 'You can't get mad at somebody if they don't believe in Christmas, so you can't get mad at somebody for wearing a T-shirt.'","Hawkins said he was motivated out of fear that one day something tragic could happen to his 2-year-old son .

"Suspected Islamic militants killed 43 students in a pre-dawn attack Tuesday on a northeast Nigerian college, survivors said. The terrorists, thought to be from Boko Haram, set a locked hostel on fire, before shooting and slitting the throats of those who tried to climb out the windows. Some were burned alive. Adamu Garba said he and other teachers who ran away through the bush estimate 40 students died in the assault that began around 2 a.m. Tuesday at the Federal Government College at Buni Yadi. Boko Haram have been responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in the north of Nigera as they increasingly target civilians (file picture) It is a co-ed school about 45 miles south of Damaturu, the capital of . Yobe state, and difficult to communicate with because extremists last . year destroyed the cell phone tower there. Garba, . who teaches at a secondary school attached to the college, said the . attackers first set ablaze the college administrative block, then moved . to the hostels, where they locked students in and started firebombing . the buildings. At one hostel, he said: 'Students were trying to . climb out of the windows and they were slaughtered like sheep by the . terrorists who slit their throats. Others who ran were gunned down.' He . said students who could not escape were burned alive . The attackers also reportedly hurled explosives into student residential buildings, sprayed gunfire into rooms and hacked a number students to death. A senior medical source at the Sani Abacha Specialist Hospital in Yobe's capital Damaturu said the gunmen only targeted male students and that female students were 'spared'. 'So far, 43 bodies have been brought (from the college) and are lying at the morgue,' said the source, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to discuss death tolls. Damaturu resident Babagoni Musa told AFP that four ambulances carrying dead bodies drove past his shop, which falls on the road from Buni Yadi. 'They had tree branches on them which is a sign used here to signify a corpse is in a vehicle,' he said. People whose relatives were studying at the college had surrounded the morgue and were desperately seeking information about those killed, forcing the military to take control of the building to restore calm, the hospital source said. Yobe is one of three northeastern states which was placed under emergency rule in May last year when the military launched a massive operation to crush the Boko Haram uprising. At least 40 students were killed in September at an agriculture training college in Yobe after Boko Haram gunmen stormed a series of dorms in the middle of the night and sprayed gunfire on sleeping students. Boko Haram are just one of several Islamist groups in Africa which are trying to seize power, including Somalia's al Shabaab (pictured) Tuesday's attack brings the toll from killings blamed on Boko Haram to more than 300 this month alone. It . is the first reported in Yobe state and the first school attack . reported this year by suspected fighters of the terrorist network of . Boko Haram - the nickname that means Western education is forbidden. President . Goodluck Jonathan told a news conference Monday night that the Boko . Haram attacks were 'quite worrisome' but that he was sure 'we will get . over it.' Thousands of Nigerians have lost family members, . houses, businesses, their belongings and livelihoods in the 4-year-old . rebellion. And it likely will anger regional officials who charge . the military is losing its war to halt the Islamic uprising in the . northeast of Africa's biggest oil producer. The military has said recent . attacks are being perpetrated by militants who have escaped a sustained . aerial bombardment and ground assaults on forest hideouts along the . border with Cameroon. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on . Monday condemned the 'unspeakable violence and acts of terror' and said . the United States is helping Nigerian authorities to develop a . comprehensive approach 'to combat the threat posed by Boko Haram while . protecting civilians and ensuring respect for human rights.'

"Michael Brown allegedly told his friend to keep running after Darren Wilson shot him for the first time. Court documents released by a prosecutor revealed the testimony by Dorian Johnson, who claimed the 18-year-old said 'Keep runnin', bro' as they fled the scene. In a police interview, heard by the Grand Jury, Johnson said that he saw blood spattered on Brown's shirt, prompting they pair to sprint away from the cop. They then knelt down between two cars to hide before Brown told his friend he should keep going. He also claims that Brown told Wilson that he was unarmed before he fired off several more shots. The St. Louis County prosecutor has released more documents related to the investigation of the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer, including a transcript of a police interview with Dorian Johnson (pictured center, at Brown's funeral), the friend who was with Brown when he was killed . The testimony reads: 'Now when I, when Mike passes me, he looked directly into my eyes and he saw where I was—where I was crouched down. He says, verbatim, 'Keep runnin', bro. He also said: 'I'm watchin' as he turns around. The officer's face-to-face with him now and he goes to tell the officer that he's unarmed or he does not have a gun. 'I couldn't hear him verbatim from where I was standing, but I know he tried to talk to the officer and he tried to get out a second sentence, but before he could fully get out the sentence, the officer then fired several more shots.' Last week a prosecutor released hundreds of pages of additional documents Saturday from the investigation into the police shooting of Michael Brown, including an interview transcript of a friend who initially asserted that he had seen Brown get shot in the back. St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said the newly released records were inadvertently excluded from the thousands of pages of other documents made public Nov. 24, when a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown. The freshly publicized documents include a transcript of an interview of Brown's friend Dorian Johnson conducted by the FBI and county police just four days after the Aug. 9 confrontation in which the white officer shot the black 18-year-old. Previously released forensic evidence showed that Brown was not shot in the back but was struck by bullets in the head, chest and arm. Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 28 (left), shot unarmed teen Michael Brown, 18, (right) dead on August 9 . Johnson's account to investigators was generally similar to his later grand jury testimony, in which he portrayed Wilson as the aggressor during a struggle that began at the officer's vehicle and led to a brief chase before Brown's fatal shooting. In both his original interview and his Sept. 10 grand jury testimony, which was previously released, Johnson said that Wilson reached out of his vehicle window toward Brown's throat or shirt. During the ensuring struggle, Johnson said he never saw Brown touch Wilson's gun. Wilson told grand jurors that Brown grabbed ahold of his weapon and twisted it toward the officer's leg. The officer eventually fired his gun from inside the vehicle. Forensic evidence showed that Brown's hand was shot at close range. Brown and Johnson then ran. In his August interview, Johnson initially was adamant that he had seen Johnson get shot in the back while running. 'It definitely struck him in his back,' Johnson said, later adding: 'It caused him to stop.' Asked by a detective how he knew Brown had been shot in the back, Johnson replied: 'If it would've missed him, or if he wouldn't have felt it, I believe he would've kept runnin.' Under further questioning, Johnson later acknowledged that he didn't see a bullet hit Brown's back, but he remained adamant that Brown's back was toward Wilson when he fired a shot. By almost all witness accounts, Brown turned at some point to face the officer. Johnson described Brown's hands as being raised, one higher than the other. Wilson told grand jurors that one of Brown's hands was clenched in a fist and the other at his waist as Brown began charging back at Wilson. As with the previously released grand jury documents, the witness transcripts released Saturday varied in their accounts of Brown's hands. One witness said Brown's 'hands kinda went up.' Another said Brown's hands were up briefly but he then ran toward Wilson. Scene: Wilson shot Brown seven or eight times, with the shooting sparking condemnation across the US over police violence, specifically against black men . Another said Brown threw up his hands and said something that sounded like, 'Don't kill me.' Among the documents released Saturday was a witness list, with all of the names of the witnesses whited out. It shows that 62 people testified before the grand jury between Aug. 20 and Nov. 21, including some who appeared multiple times. Some of the people interviewed by federal authorities did not testify before the grand jury. McCulloch apologized in a written statement for any confusion that may have occurred by failing to initially release all of the interview transcripts. He said he believes he has now released all of the grand jury evidence, except for photos of Brown's body and anything that could lead to witnesses being identified.","Dorian Johnson said Brown had more concern for his safety .

"In the days leading up to laying siege and taking hostages in Martin Place, Man Haron Monis was engaged in rants on his personal Twitter account which seemed to grow more strident as Monday approached. The account appears to be genuine, although his Tweets linked to a Facebook page which has been pulled down. On December 10, just five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe with a sawn-off shotgun, Monis raged on Twitter: 'Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of'. His anger is directed at Australia's foreign policy of sending troops off to fight overseas. The theme is similar to that of a letter addressed to Tony Abbott and posted on his website a year ago, saying the country's foreign policy meant 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'. Scroll down for video . Escalating rant: In the days and weeks leading up to his hostage taking siege in Martin Place, Man Haron Monis became more strident on his Twitter (above) and railed against Australia for sending troops to fight in foreign wars . Murdered wife: Noleen Hayson Pal was married to Man Haron Monis and bore him two children, but a bitter custody dispute over their sons preceded her murder which was allegedly plotted by Monis and his Muslim convert girlfriend . Evil countdown: Five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe armed with a shotgun, Man Haron Monis lashed out at 'racist and terrorist Australians' who supported 'Team Australia' and Tony Abbott's foreign policy . Bitter man:  'Sheikh Haron' was bitter about being convicted of sending hate mail to the families of Australian diggers and wrote a self- serving attempt at justification in a letter to the prime minister . Letter of doom: This is the letter sent by Man Haron Monis late last year to Prime Minister Tony Abbott and requesting a live debate on the issue of sending troops to fight in wars overseas . Fateful words: Writing as 'Sheikh Haron', Man Haron Monis ends his letter to Mr Abbott with the fateful words, which he typed in bold in the final sentence, 'Australia and Australians will be attacked' On the Thursday before the siege, he complained about 'death threats on his page 'based on religious hate' and then praises Australian Muslims for choosing 'Team Islam'. He railed against former prime minister Kevin Rudd for criticising him and the fact he was 'for five years on bail conditions'; following his conviction for sending vile hate letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died fighting in Afghanistan. Angry man: Man Haron Monis posted this Tweet just under three weeks before his armed siege, criticising America 'and its allies' for killing 'innocent civilians including women' in wars like Iraq and Afghanistan . A screenshot taken from Man Haron Monis's website before it was taken down. He used his website and his Facebook and Twitter pages to rant against Australia's involvement in foreign wars . In a document from his website entitled 'Who is Sheikh Haron', Monis also likens himself to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and says the 40 sexual assault charges against him - which relate to his practice as a 'spiritual healer' in Western Sydney - are false and politically motivated. In a letter written in Arabic to 'Muslim brothers and sisters' and placed on his website, he says there is no such thing as a 'moderate Muslim. and that 'I am neither an extremist nor a moderate, I am just a Muslim, a Muslim who tries to follow the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of prophet Muhammad.' Much of his anger on his Twitter page seems directed at Australia and the US for sending troops to fight in places like Iraq. 'Every day America and its allies kill the innocent civilians including women and children,' he posted just under three weeks ago and in a Tweet posted on November 29 in Arabic , he wrote 'Celebration of Christmas or to kill Muslims in Iraq? Two weeks before that he wrote, 'Will Australia be Islamic state one day? What do you think?'. A letter in Arabic to Muslims, in which Man Haron Monis states 'there is no such thing as moderate Muslim'. The page is littered with photographs and videos of alleged atrocities against Muslims accompanied by comments from Monis including on November 9, 'Do USA & its allies care about Human Rights? YOU MODERATES should be ashamed of yourself for your support'. His opposition to Australia and other western countries sending troops to fight in wars overseas is reflected in the letter sent to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and obtained by Daily Mail Australia. In the letter, which Monis makes the bogus claim of being a 'Muslim Cleric and Peace Activist', he says 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'. He writes a long-winded criticism about Australia's involvement in the Afghanistan war, and a lame self-justification of his vile letters he sent - and was convicted for sending - to the families of soldiers killed over there. 'Since the message of my letters to the Australian authorities couldn't be heard, I wrote letters to some of the families of deceased Australian soldiers and I requested them to voice against the war. 'Those families like the majority of the Australians were fed up with the wrong foreign policy.' Monis then complains that the Australian Federal Police 'tried to take revenge' and he 'was sentenced to 300 hours community service and two year good behaviour bond'. 'When I talk about ""peace"" it's not just playing with words but I am very serious and I have paid a price for that.' He then writes that like 'the majority of Australians' he wanted 'peace on the earth including Australia' and 'a secured world including Australia'. Finally, he asks whether Mr Abbott's 'team are happy to have a live debate with me and'or my team'. He says if he lost the debate he would 'support the Australian government policy for the rest of my life'. But in his final sentence, Monis writes that he expected the prime minister to change its foreign policy if the debate proved it had 'made Australia unsafe' and if it was proven 'that Australia and Australians will be attacked'.","Martin Place gunman Man Haron Monis ranted on Twitter in 'hate' posts that appeared to escalate in the days leading up to siege .

"A divided Supreme Court said on Monday that prayers that open town council meetings do not violate the Constitution - even if they routinely stress Christianity. The court said in a 5-4 decision that the content of the prayers is not significant as long as they do not denigrate non-Christians or proselytize. The ruling by the court's conservative majority was a victory for the town of Greece, N.Y., outside of Rochester. The Obama administration sided with the town. Scroll down for video . Co-plaintiffs: Linda Stephens, left, and Susan Galloway, right, who are seen in this November 2013 photo, complained in 2008 that the town council meetings opened with Christian prayers . In 1983, the court upheld an opening prayer in the Nebraska legislature and said that prayer is part of the nation's fabric, not a violation of the First Amendment. Monday's ruling was consistent with the earlier one. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority that included , said the prayers are ceremonial and in keeping with the nation's traditions. 'The inclusion of a brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise in civic recognition suggests that its purpose and effect are to acknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they represent, rather than to exclude or coerce nonbelievers,' Kennedy said. Kennedy and his four colleagues in the . majority all are Catholic. They are: Chief Justice John Roberts and . Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court's four liberal justices, said, 'I respectfully dissent from the Court's opinion because I think the Town of Greece's prayer practices violate that norm of religious equality — the breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian.' Kagan was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Of the four, three are Jewish and Sotomayor is Catholic. Kagan said the case differs significantly from the 1983 decision because 'Greece's town meetings involve participation by ordinary citizens, and the invocations given — directly to those citizens — were predominantly sectarian in content.' Five long years: Stephens, left, is an atheist and Galloway, right, is Jewish. Both women complained about town council meetings in Greece, New York, starting with opening prayers . A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Greece violated the Constitution by opening nearly every meeting over an 11-year span with prayers that stressed Christianity. From 1999 through 2007, and again from January 2009 through June 2010, every meeting was opened with a Christian-oriented invocation. In 2008, after residents Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens complained, four of 12 meetings were opened by non-Christians - including a Jewish layman, a Wiccan priestess and the chairman of the local Baha'i congregation. A town employee each month selected clerics or lay people by using a local published guide of churches. The guide did not include non-Christian denominations, however. The appeals court found that religious institutions in the town of just under 100,000 people are primarily Christian, and even Galloway and Stephens testified they knew of no non-Christian places of worship there. The two residents filed suit and a trial court ruled in the town's favor, finding that the town did not intentionally exclude non-Christians. It also said that the content of the prayer was not an issue because there was no desire to proselytize or demean other faiths. But a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that even with the high court's 1983 ruling, the practice of having one Christian prayer after another amounted to the town's endorsement of Christianity. Kennedy, however, said judges should not be involved in evaluating the content of prayer because it could lead to legislatures requiring 'chaplains to redact the religious content from their message in order to make it acceptable for the public sphere.' He added, 'Government may not mandate a civic religion that stifles any but the most generic reference to the sacred any more than it may prescribe a religious orthodoxy.' Kennedy himself was the author an opinion in 1992 that held that a Christian prayer delivered at a high school graduation did violate the Constitution. The justice said Monday there are differences between the two situations, including the age of the audience and the fact that attendees at the council meeting may step out of the room if they do not like the prayer. In her dissent, Kagan said the council meeting prayers are unlike those said to open sessions of Congress and state legislatures, where the elected officials are the intended audience. In Greece, 'the prayers there are directed squarely at the citizens,' she said. Kagan also noted what she described as the meetings' intimate setting, with 10 or so people sitting in front of the town's elected and top appointed officials. Children and teenagers are likely to be present, she said. The case is Greece v. Galloway, 12-696.","Town council meetings in Greece, New York opened nearly every meeting .

"An Olympic track worker has broken both of his legs and may have a concussion after he was struck by a bobsled. The worker was on the track when he was hit by a forerunning sled near the finish line at the Sanki Sliding Centre, just before the start of today's two-man bobsled training. 'We still do not know why he was in this zone and exactly what happened,' said Thomas Bach, the IOC president. A track worker is loaded into an ambulance after he was injured when a forerunner bobsled hit him just before the start of the men's two-man bobsled training. His identity has not been released . The two-man team from the Netherlands, piloted by Edwin van Calker, speed down the track during two-man training today . Everybody's favourite team, the Jamaicans, piloted by Winston Watts, start their second run during the men's two-man training . Winston Watts's team JAM-1 take a turn in their run as they get to grips with the ice . Mr Bach added that the worker 'maybe' has a concussion. Later, IOC spokesman Mark Adams told the Associated Press: 'I understand he is conscious and talking and has two broken legs.' Sochi organisers said the unidentified man was taken by helicopter to a hospital, but gave no other information about his injuries. Officials said the crash took place just before the finish line, which would suggest that the sled likely had not yet started to brake. 'According to standard procedure, a warning signal was given ahead of the forerunners' bob beginning its run on the track,' Sochi organisers said in a statement released more than three hours after the accident. 'The reasons for the icemaker's presence on the track after the warning signal are currently being determined.' A track worker repairs some lights that were damaged after the worker was hit by a forerunner bobsled just before the men's two-man bobsled training . Track workers pick up debris following the accident. It is unclear how the accident happened and why the worker was on the track at the time . Lights are repaired at the finish line after they were damaged during the incident . Also, officials said the luge team relay event scheduled to make its Olympic debut on Thursday will take place as scheduled. The . first bobsled training session was delayed at the start for about 35 . minutes as a work crew repaired a light fixture that was apparently . smashed in the accident. Also, the track was cleared of other debris . that had fallen into the finish area. Olympic bobsledders remained in the start area during the delay, well away from the crash location. Forerunning . sleds are used before training and competition sessions to assess track . conditions and make sure the facility is safe for racing. Also, people . in the vicinity of the track are almost always alerted that a sled is in . the track through public-address announcements, though it was unclear . why the worker struck was unaware that the session was beginning. U.S. practice: Team USA (team one is on the left and two on the right), both prepare to start their run on the track during training. The bobsled will be one of the more anticipated events . The two-man team from Latvia, LAT-2, piloted by Oskars Kibermanis, speed down the track during their own training run . It's also unclear why the worker was on the track when the sled came out the final curve and approached the finish line. The sled that struck him was the second 'forerunner' used before the training session. Loudspeakers in the finish-deck area were working during training after the crash, though there has been at least one incident when the public-address system at the facility — an absolutely critical part of the track's safety plan — failed. It went silent when the U.S. and other international luge teams visited the Sochi track for a training session in November after electricity was lost. That impacted lights, timing devices and the speaker system that allows sliders up top know when sleds at the bottom of the chute have been removed and the track is clear for the next competitor. In turn, it also tells people in the finish area that a sled is on the way. The Sochi track was designed to be safer following the death of luger Nodar Kumarishtavili in an accident hours before the opening ceremonies of the Vancouver Games four years ago. There have been no major mishaps during any of the competition so far, and athletes have been complimentary of the track's condition. 'To be honest, the ice is phenomenal,' U.S. skeleton racer Katie Uhlaender said following the first two heats of the women's competition, several hours before the mishap. 'It's better than it was in training and whoever they got working on the ice, kudos, because they are doing Olympic level work on the track. It is fast and it's fun.'","Worker was hit before start of two-man bobsled training .

"The Columbia University student who is in critical condition after jumping from an eighth-floor dorm room has been named. Brandon Marco, 19, was found naked on scaffolding on the third-floor landing of a dormitory in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, on Monday night. Mr Marco, an undergraduate at Columbia, allegedly made his way into another student's room where he removed his clothes and jumped from the window, police sources say. Jump: Brandon Marco, 19, was found naked on scaffolding on the third-floor landing of a dormitory in Morning Heights, Manhattan . Mr Marco leaped from Wien Hall at 411 West 116th Street at around 8.15pm and was rushed to Mount Sinai St Luke's Hospital where he was listed in serious condition. The FDNY confirmed early Tuesday morning that the patient was awake and breathing on his own. Police sources told the New York Daily News the student walked into a schoolmate's room on the eighth floor of the 14-story building at around 8.15pm, and was believed to be under the influence of drugs. The occupant of the room became concerned and called 911 after she reportedly witnessed the 19-year-old take off all his clothes in front of her. By the time police arrived on the scene, the Columbia student was found lying naked on a scaffold below a third-story window.

"The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday in the case of a hobby-supply store whose owners say the Affordable Care Act is forcing them to act in contradiction with their Christian faith. Hobby Lobby, a chain of 600 craft stores with more than 13,000 employees, took the Obama administration to court because it could face fines of $1.3 million per day – almost $475 million per year – if it fails to offer its workers a health insurance plan that includes a list of 18 contraceptives that the federal government deems 'essential.' Four of those contraceptive methods, Hobby Lobby's founding CEO David Green believes, can end a human life because they prevent the implantation of a fertilized human egg into a woman's uterine lining. They include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the so-called 'morning after' pill. But the federal government contended Tuesday that those products aren't forms of abortion at all. Scroll down for video . Demonstrators rallied in front of the Supreme Court in Washington as justices heard oral arguments in a case that pits religious freedom against the Obama administration's enforcement of the Affordable Care Act . Supporters of the Obamacare law include feminist groups that argue carving out an exception for companies whose officers don't support certain forms of birth control would be an attack on women's rights . The Green Family, leaders of the Oklahoma-based Hobby Lobby chain, say their Christian faith prohibits them from paying for certain forms of contraception . Obama administration Solicitor General Don Verrilli told Justice Anthony Kennedy, a likely swing-vote between conservatives and liberals . on the court, that he disagreed with a slippery-slope argument which . suggested Obamacare could force companies to pay for abortions. Verrilli said that argument was irrelevant because federal law doesn't see 'emergency contraception' as equivalent to an abortion, and it doesn't matter whether the Green family disagrees. 'People . are saying that we are taking rights away from somebody, and there's no . way we are taking anybody's rights away,' Green said in a YouTube video . produced last month to drum up public support for his case. 'It's our rights that are being infringed upon to require us to do something that is against our conscience.' If Green were to opt out of Obamacare and send his employees to government exchanges for their coverage, Hobby Lobby's penalties would be about $26 million per year. That option is a viable one, two Supreme Court justices suggested during oral arguments on Tuesday. Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan grilled Paul Clement, the company's lawyer, saying that since the Affordable Care Act provides the option to pay a tax instead of complying, the First Amendment's religious protections aren't at issue. Clement, a U.S. solicitor general in the George W. Bush White House, said the company wants to provide its employees with health insurance, but also wants to avoid offering a narrow range of contraception options. Justice Kagan has emerged as the chief critic of Hobby Lobby's position. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, she complained that giving the company an exception to the Obamacare law would signal to other companies that their own peculiar religious objections were fair game. 'Everything would be piecemeal,' Kagan said. 'Nothing would be uniform.' And, she said, a victory for Hobby Lobby would make 'religious objectors come out of the woodwork.' Clement argued that the Obama administration has already carved out exceptions for religious organizations like churches, and hospitals run by religious denominations. Extending it to devout Christians who express their faith through their businesses, he said, is a logical step. The Hobby Lobby craft-store chain is at the center of a Supreme Court battle over President Barack Obama's health care law . Most of the Supreme Court justices seemed cool to the Obama administration's arguments on Tuesday, according to published eyewitness reports -- including Justice Anthony Kennedy, a likely swing-vote . Two female justices questioned on Tuesday whether a private employer can control which contraceptives his female employees can access, but Hobby Lobby's attorney said no one as prohibited from buying birth control on their own -- and suggested that the government could allay its own fears by paying for it . 'We believe that the principles that are taught scripturally are what we should operate our lives by, and it actually flows over into the business,' Hobby Lobby president Steve Green said in the same video that featured his brother David. 'This is an issue of life. We cannot be a part of taking life.' The question of whether a commercial . corporation has the same religious-expression rights as a church or a . religious-affiliated group is a thorny one. 'The . First Amendment protects the rights of an individual to freely practice . his or her religion,' said Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons on . Tuesday, 'but I take issue with the notion that for-profit corporations . are capable of religious belief.' U.S. Sen. Patty Murray is among the liberal lawmakers who see the Hobby Lobby case as an assault on women's access to contraceptives, although conservatives point out that women who work for objecting companies can still buy the products cheaply on their own . Most of the justices on Tuesday appeared skeptical of that position, according to eyewitness reports in major media. Political tensions run throughout the Hobby Lobby case, which has also been joined by a Pennsylvania company, Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. 'The president has given [Obamacare] exemptions for political reasons,' argues Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady, 'but is choosing to lay job-killing fines on those that believe in protecting the sanctity of life. In America, being a job creator should not mean you can no longer live and work according to your beliefs. This is not equal treatment under the law.' The Greens are a particularly religious family, even by the standards of their native Oklahoma. Steve Green is the driving force behind a national Museum of the Bible, a $50 million project slated to open in Washington, D.C. in early 2017/ . The project's stated purpose is 'to bring to life the living word of God, to tell its compelling story of preservation, and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the bible.' But the Greens' beliefs, say dissenters, aren't necessarily shared by their employees. 'Here the 13,000 employees of the Hobby Lobby corporate enterprise aren't and should not be expected to share the religious beliefs of the Greens,'  former Clinton administration Solicitor General Walter Dellinger told NPR. 'What you really have is one family attempting to utilize their economic leverage to impose their religious beliefs on others.' Hobby Lobby founder David Green (L) and his wife Barbara (C) are feeling positive about a legal fight that has become a major focus in the ongoing fight over the Affordable Care Act . Margot Riphagen of New Orleans, La., wore a birth control pills costume as she protested in front of the Supreme Court (The Hobby Lobby lawsuit involves the company's objection to IUDs and abortion-causing drugs, but not contraceptive pills.) Clement countered with outrage that 'The federal government for the first time has decided that they are going to force one person to pay for another person's not just ... hip replacement, but something as religiously sensitive as contraception and abortifacients.' And, he pointed out, the Greens are not 'taking action to prevent their employees from getting these devices if they want to do it with their own money and on their own time.' Asked by Justice Samuel Alito during oral arguments whether there would be other contraceptive choices available to Hobby Lobby employees if the company should prevail on the short list that it objects to, Clement replied, 'There are ample [options].' Former Bush administration solicitor general Paul Clement argued on Hobby Lobby's behalf that since the Obama administration has given religious institutions like hospitals a way out of the Obamacare law's contraception mandate, it must follow suit for private-sector conscientious objectors . The Greens have a recent federal law on their side: the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which passed by landslide votes in both houses of Congress. The law says that the federal government must show a compelling reason – on constitutional grounds – before it overrides a citizen's religious liberty, even with a law that applies broadly to everyone. And even if the government establishes a constitutionally critical reason to disregard some Americans' rights to practice their religion, it must do so in the least restrictive way possible. Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch argued in a brief to the Supreme Court that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is a 'super-statute,' intended to apply to the whole of American society including both nonprofit religious groups and for-profit companies. Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander joined in the brief. He said Tuesday that 'Obamacare is a thumb in the eye to our Constitution’s protections of religious freedom. The United States ought to be the last country on earth where people of faith are forced by their government to defy their religious beliefs.' 'I am glad these cases are now before the Supreme Court and am hopeful the court will find this administration has reached too far.' But Democrats are pushing back, framing the Affordable Care Act as too important to erode, even on First Amendment grounds – and accusing Hobby Lobby of practicing illegal discrimination against women. 'There are those out there who would like the American public to believe that this conversation is anything but an attack on women’s health care,' Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said in a prepared statement. 'To them, it's a debate about ""freedom,"" except of course the freedom for women to access care.' Pro-life activists supporting Hobby Lobby prayed outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday -- they fear that private employers will be forced to buy insurance for their employees that includes coverage for so-called 'abortifacient' drugs . 'My hope,' she said, 'is that the Court realizes that women working for private companies should be afforded the same access to medical care, regardless of who signs their paycheck. We can’t allow for-profit, secular, corporations or their shareholders to deny female employees' access to comprehensive women’s health care, under the guise of a ""religious exemption.""' Access isn't the issue, countered Hadley Heath, the health policy director of the right-leaning Independent Women's Forum. 'These cases . do not represent a conflict between religious employers and female employees,' Health said Tuesday. 'Women have been and will continue to be free to seek out and purchase the . contraceptives of their choice.' Outside the Supreme Court, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke to a small group Hobby Lobby supporters, organized by tea party groups, who ventured out into a late March snowfall. 'The first freedom in the First Amendment,' said Cruz, 'is religious liberty.'","The Obama administration insists that a private company can't have protected religious views that it forces on its workers .

"Helped by his friends and grimacing with every step, new photographs taken on Sunday reveal the slow and painful progress Tracy Morgan is making as he recovers from June's devastating car crash. Wearing a pained expression on his face, the 30 Rock star gingerly made his way to the barbers near his home in Cresskill, New Jersey. Dressed for the cold in a leather jacket, blue jeans and Nike sneakers, the comedian's friends watched as he took slow and deliberate steps, never seeming to take their eyes off him. Scroll down for video . Still struggling: Actor and comedian Tracy Morgan has the support of his family and friends as he struggles to walk with the aid of a walker on his way to a barbershop in Cresskill, New Jersey, Sunday . Rare appearance: Morgan's Sunday outing marked the fourth time he has been seen in public since the highway collision in June . Morgan's Sunday outing marked the fourth time he has been seen in public since the highway collision in June that took the life of his friend and fellow comic James McNair and injured three others. The 46-year-old former star of 30 Rock suffered a traumatic brain injury and numerous fractures when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer slammed into the back of his limo van on New Jersey Turnpike. Earlier this month, Morgan told reporters outside a post office in New Jersey that he was 'fighting every day' on his way to recovery. Over the weekend, Morgan won the latest round in his effort to sue Wal-Mart when a federal judge refused to delay legal action in the case . The ruling came on a motion by Kevin Roper, the driver of the Wal-Mart truck. Roper, of Georgia, isn't named as a defendant but is facing criminal charges. He wanted the suit delayed until his criminal case was resolved. Brave: In this picture taken Sunday, the once-ebullient comedian wears a pained expressions on his face . His old self: This photo provided by Paramount Pictures shows Tracy Morgan as Fred in Chris Rock's new film, Top Five, which was shot before the crash . Wal-Mart has previously denied claims that it was trying to stall the suit brought by the former Saturday Night Live, who was returning from a performance in Delaware when the accident occurred. Morgan's attorney, Benedict Morelli, has said Morgan is fighting to recover from a traumatic brain injury suffered in the crash and is uncertain if he will be 'the Tracy Morgan he once was.' Morgan currently can be seen on the big screen in Chris Rock's new comedy Top Five, which was filmed before the June accident. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board said Roper was driving 65mph in the 60 seconds before he slammed into the van. The speed limit on that stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike is 55mph and was lowered to 45mph that night because of construction. Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown. 'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last month. 'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.' The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted back in October being pushed in a wheelchair. Recovering: Tracy Morgan was seen in public for just the third time since being involved in a fatal car crash this past June . Heartbreaking: The usually gregarious Morgan was quiet and appeared weak as he slowly moved with his walker . Earlier this month, Morgan and his attorneys accused Wal-Mart of stalling in a federal lawsuit that have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash. Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.' The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' Legal victory: On Friday, a federal judge refused to delay Morgan's lawsuit against Wal-Mart. The ruling came on a motion by truck driver Kevin Roper (pictured in court in June) Tragedy: A look at the vehicle Morgan was travelling in following the crash . Charged: The driver of the tractor-trailer that hit Morgan has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto . Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident, . He came out against Wal-Mart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seat belt. 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time.

"When Luke Cameron decided to do a good deed every day for a year, he could never have anticipated how much it would change his life. The 26-year-old from Cheltenham made the decision after a close family friend died from cancer in 2013. He started writing a Good Deed blog and logged every kind gesture he made on the site, which has now amassed thousands of followers. Scroll down for video . Luke Cameron (left) started his daily good deed challenge last January in memory of family friend Maura (right), who passed away in October 2013 . The kind actions range from taking out the rubbish for his elderly neighbour, to baking lemon drizzle cakes and sending them round to his friends and family. He has also bought countless meals for strangers at places like McDonald's and even paid for a person's petrol just because they were stood next to him in the queue at the station tills. In total, Luke estimates that he has spent £3,000 in the last 12 months on good deeds, despite the fact that he was only earning the wage of a part-time shop worker. He said: 'In a world of taking selfies with your ""besties"" and Instagramming pictures of your new handbag and Rolex watch, we forget to think about anyone else but ourselves. 'Our generation has forgotten to care about others, because we are too self-obsessed  to even care what others are going through.' In total, Luke estimates that he has spent £3,000 in the last 12 months on good deeds, including buying meals for strangers that he meets in restaurants . But while many people have been inspired by Luke's blog, he has also been on the receiving end of  sceptical responses. Luke said: 'The majority of people love it. I have my haters, but that's a given really. I try not to dwell too much on other people's opinions. 'Most people to begin with didn't understand why I was doing what I was doing and became very reserved about me helping them. 'Scepticism was rife among my monetary good deeds and some people questioned my motives and others thought I wanted something in return.' Luke decided to do a year of good deeds after a good family friend passed away in October 2013. He said: 'Maura was like a mother to me. She was hands-down the most incredible and inspirational woman I will ever meet. 'When a neighbour needed food, she gave her last potato. When a friend needed money, she gave her last pound. 'She gave her whole life selflessly helping others around her and at her funeral over 4,000 people queued for 3 hours to get in and pay their respects.' Luke now keeps a sweet bucket on his desk, for people to grab a quick snack. He also spent an evening putting kind messages on colleagues' desks . Luke used his love of baking in a good deed - he made lemon drizzle cakes and set them to friends and family. He also bought a bunch of flowers for a friend who had received some bad luck . Last December, Luke decided that January 1 would be the day that he kick-started 365 daily good deeds. He began with some small gestures - on New Year's Day he said 'Happy New Year' to a woman serving his coffee in a Tesco cafe. On the second day, he bought food and drink for a couple of homeless people in his local town centre. A few days later, he handed over some spare change to a lady who didn't have enough coins at the parking meter. Since starting his challenge, Luke also entered a competition run by Utility Aid to win the job of National Philanthropy Manager, a.k.a The Nicest Job In Britain. His Good Deed challenge convinced the organisers that he was the right man for the job and so, for the whole of 2015, Luke will be paid to travel the UK and assist 45 different charities. Since starting his challenge, Luke also entered a competition run by Utility Aid to win the job of National Philanthropy Manager, aka The Nicest Job In Britain . Luke doing one of his good deeds - he realised a customer in his shop had left their mobility scooter in the rain, so brought it inside and wiped it down . He has also decided to extend his challenge for another year and claims the experiment has completely changed his life. He said: 'I think I have healed myself by helping others. 'It really changes your perspective on life when you help people. You become so much more grateful for what you have. 'I did this purely to help people as a social experiment. I wanted to see how helping others for a year can really help yourself. 'I've gone from working part time in a shop to now the national philanthropy manager where I am making my life's work about helping others and I've raised thousands for charity.' Luke also created Cards For Kindness - a pack of cards with good deeds that include: 'Tell your mum you love her,' and 'Tell a stranger they look beautiful.' The cards cost £5 for a deck and 25 per cent of each sale goes to the British Heart Foundation. Good Deed 345: . One of my colleagues is on crutches after snapping his Achilles Heel. So today I grabbed his lunch for him and took it to his desk so he didn't have to hobble around getting it. Good Deed 341: . I baked a load of mini lemon drizzle cakes today and sent them around to friends and family. Good deed 258: . A small but helpful deed today. Carried down my elderly neighbour's trash. Bin day tomorrow. Good Deed 256: . I was with a colleague today, explaining about doing good deeds. She was a little skeptical about the whole thing, so while she was away from her desk, I left the money for her lunch. Maybe I can change her opinion of random kindness. Good Deed 244: . Today I helped somebody in need. I stopped my car on the way home as there were a couple with a map. I gave them directions to the centre of town. They were very grateful . Good deed 242: . While walking the dog, I noticed a load of litter over the field at 7am - clearly the morning after the night before. It was a few glass bottles and shredded cans. So I carefully picked them up and disposed of them. Good Deed 221: . I got up at 5.30am to help a friend move house today. I hired a van yesterday and drove around two hours to Exeter to load up and remove everything from a 3 bedroom house.","Luke Cameron started his daily good deed challenge last January .

"It is said to be bottomless, but experts have managed to map Earth’s deepest cave. Intrepid explorers have charted every known twist and turn of the terrifying Krubera cave that measures 7,208ft (2,197metres) deep. And with every expedition the chasm seems to become deeper as divers plunge to new depths never visited by humans to extend the cave’s reach into the Earth. Mapped: Intrepid explorers have charted every twist and turn of the terrifying Krubera cave that measures 7,208ft (2,197metres) deep. The final segment was revealed by a brave diver and camps are marked on the map where explorers have rested . The Krubera cave is the deepest cave on Earth and is located in the Arabika Massif of the Gagrinsky Range in Abkhazia. It is the only cave on Earth deeper than 6,561ft (2,000metres). The cave is called Voronya in Russia, which means crow's cave. The name was used as slang by Kiev cavers during the 1980s because of the number of crows nesting in the entrance pit. The Arabika Massif is one of the largest high-mountain limestone karst massifs (the main mass of an exposed structure) in the Western Caucasus, which is an area of southern Russia. It is composed of Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic limestones that dip continuously southwest to the Black Sea and plunge below the modern sea level. The Krubera cave is located in the Arabika Massif on the edge of the Black Sea in Abkhazia, which is a disputed territory that borders Georgia. It is a kaist, which means it is formed from the dissolution of soluble rock - in this case, limestone. It extends for 8,346miles (13,432km) and since 1956 when French explorers first descended below 3,281ft (1km) cavers have dreamed of exploring deeper. The cave is currently thought to be around the same height as six-and-a-half Eiffel Towers stacked on top of one another. A map marks when explorers discovered different routes and where they camped as well as its remarkable depth. According to Ukrainian caver Alexander Klimchouk, the ‘trail’ is formed of a chain of pits, cascades and pitches, some of which are over 300ft (100 metres) deep and connected by very narrow passages. One 300ft (100 metre) long passage is charmingly named ‘Way to the Dream’ although for people who suffer from claustrophobia, such a narrow channel might seem more of a nightmare. The cave extends for 8,346miles (13,432km) and since 1956 when French explorers first descended below 3,281ft (1km) cavers have dreamed of exploring deeper (pictured) The Krubera cave is located in the Arabika Massif on the edge of the Black Sea in Abkhazia, which is a disputed territory that some argue belongs to Georgia . The cave, which is named after Russian geologist Alexander Krubera, is the only chasm on Earth that's known to be deeper than 6,561ft (2,000m) The cave, which is named after the . Russian geologist Alexander Krubera, is the only chasm on Earth that is . known to be deeper than 6,561ft (2,000 metres). In 2007, a Ukrainian diver called Gennadiv Samokhin extended the map of the abyss by diving in ‘the terminal sump’. He increased the cave's known depth by 150ft (46metres) in 2007 and 170ft (52 metres) in 2012, Gizmodo reported. His fearless endeavour earned him world records on both occasions. Mr Klimchouk explained in an article for National Geographic that cavers use dye traces to record where they have been and to prove the potential depth of Krubera cave. In 2005 he organised a series of expeditions and his team of 56 carried some five tonnes of equipment into the chasm. Much like scaling a mountain, the team had to cover certain distances so they could set up camp at depth of 2,300, 3,986, 4,630, and 5,380ft (700, 1,215, 1,410, and 1,640metres). The explorers were able to cook meals, sleep in tents and huddle together for warmth before venturing down the limestone rock faces for up to 20 hours at a time, sometimes though extremely cold water.","The Krubera cave is located in the Arabika Massif on the edge of the Black Sea in Abkhazia, which is a disputed territory bordering Georgia .

"Stephen Colbert dedicated the entire first segment of his show on Monday to address the controversy over a satirical tweet taken out of context. Last Wednesday, the comedian made a joke during his show about how Dan Snyder, the head of the Washington Redskins' football team, has set up a charity in an effort to help diffuse the ongoing tensions over the team's widely-criticized name. In that vein, the Comedy Central host likened Snyder's move to Colbert's hypothetical decision to create the 'Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever'. Explaining himself: In addition to an apocalyptic opening 'nightmare' sequence and a brief foray into news, Colbert directly addressed the #CancelColbert issue on Monday's show . Offensive: The official Twitter account for The Colbert Report posted this yesterday . During Monday's show, Colbert explained that the firestorm started after one of the show's Twitter accounts posted a tweet about the joke without referencing the larger context or providing a link to the entire bit. 'Who would have thought a means of communication limited to 140 characters would ever cause misunderstanding,' he said. The @ColbertReport tweet in question prompted people to launch a 'CancelColbert' hashtag calling for the show to be dropped. 'The Cancel Colbert people think that even in context, I am racist. I just want to say I am not a racist. I don't even see race, not even my own. People tell me I'm white and I believe them because I just spent six minutes explaining how I am not a racist- and that is about the whitest thing you could do,' he said on Monday. Facing the tweets: Colbert admitted that the tweet, which was posted by someone at his network, did not provide any context for the satire . Apology: The account was forced to post an apology and a disclaimer to say the tweet had nothing to do with Stephen Colbert . I share your rage: Stephen Colbert's official Twitter account distanced itself from the offending tweet . Colbert pointed to the tweet- as opposed to the four reruns of the show and a Facebook post on the show's official page- as the source of the outrage which he argued was a result of the lack of context. He joked that the @ColbertReport tweet was the point when 'the twit hit the fan'. Supporters- and Colbert himself- derided the controversy for missing the point of his original criticism: that the Redskins owner's charity 'which some have called an obvious attempt to win over Native Americans because it only uses the word Redskins once'. Colbert went on to point out that Twitter seems to be fine with (Snyder's charity) because I haven't seen s*** about that'. The hashtag was reportedly started by a 'Twitter hashtag activist- or ""hashtivist""' who identifies herself as Suey Park. Though she has been criticized online since the launch of #CancelColbert, the host urged his supporters not to berate her. He did not mention her by name, but alluded to a woman 'who has been viciously attacked on Twitter and if anyone's doing that for me, I want you to stop right now. She's just speaking her mind, and that's what Twitter's for, as well as ruining the ending of every show I haven't seen yet'. Biz Stone, one of the founders of Twitter helped him 'kill' the @ColbertReport handle before directing followers to turn to his personal account, @StephenAtHome for any future tweets. The @ColbertReport handle has since been discontinued.

"'I would like a medium Vodka dry Martini – with a slice of lemon peel. Shaken and not stirred please' Since Sean Connery first uttered the immortal words in 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, they have been synonymous with the world's suavest spy. So when Daniel Craig was last seen sprawled on a bed, guzzling Heineken in 2012's Skyfall, as part of a rumoured £30million advertising deal, Bond purists were outraged. Bond - a lager lout? Now, to the delight of fans everywhere, filmmakers Sony Pictures have signed a lucrative multi-million pound deal with Belvedere Vodka for new film, Spectre, to put Martini – shaken, not stirred – back on 007's menu. Sony Pictures have signed multi-million pound deal with Belvedere Vodka to put Vodka Martini – shaken, not stirred –  back on 007's menu . The finer details of the deal are yet to be confirmed, but are said to include a hefty amount of product placement and a world-wide advertising campaign . The finer details of the deal are yet to be confirmed, but are said to include a hefty amount of product placement and a world-wide advertising campaign. Bond is no stranger to lucrative marketing deals. In 2012 Sony, Coca-Cola, Bollinger, jewellery giant Swarovski, watch manufacturer Omega and fashion designer Tom Ford struck similar agreements. This year, companies to have already signed up to feature in the film include Aston Martin, Bollinger, Heineken, Jaguar Land Rover, Omega, Sony Electronics, and Sony Mobile. And Bond creator Ian Fleming was said to be a fan of filling his stories with brand names - and first released the perfect recipe for the Vodka Martini in novel  Dr No, published in 1958. In it he orders a drink to exact orders: 'I would like a medium Vodka dry Martini – with a slice of lemon peel. Shaken and not stirred please. I would prefer Russian or Polish vodka.' When Daniel Craig was seen sprawled on a bed, guzzling Heineken in 2012's Skyfall, as part of a rumoured £30million advertising deal, Bond purists were outraged. Daniel Craig even agreed to appear in a Heineken advert to promote the brand as part of the lucrative deal . Belvedere will release two custom made, limited edition bottles to celebrate Bond's vodka martini. It has replaced the iconic Belvedere Palace with the famous MI6 headquarters on the bottles . Michael G. Wilson, the co-producer of the Bond films, has previously defended the deals. ‘What normally happens is the firms agree to provide the products free of charge along with the necessary technical support,’ he said. ‘If you look at the original Bond books by Ian Fleming, you realise that he mentions specific products in them. The character knew he could find himself dead at any time and he wanted to enjoy the good things in life. ‘We try to make sure that we only include products that are in keeping with that idea.’ And Bond’s commercial tie-ins aren’t confined to the on-screen action. In 2012, Eon, Skyfall’s production company, teamed with Procter & Gamble to launch a 007 fragrance for men. OPI, the cosmetics giant, has a range of nail varnishes including The Spy Who Loved Me, while Hornby has based Scalextric sets on cars from Skyfall and Goldfinger. Even tourism agency Visit Britain signed up, with Daniel Craig’s 007 selling the idea of a UK holiday, using the slogan ‘Live Like Bond’. It was Sean Connery who first uttered the immortal lines: 'I would like a medium Vodka dry Martini – with a slice of lemon peel. Shaken and not stirred please' Thunderball (1965),  sees Sean Connery as James Bond and Claudine Auger as Domino Vitali knocking back the famous cocktail . Diamonds Are Forever (1971), starring Sean Connery even saw Bond enjoying one of the cocktails in the bath . Die Another Day, featuring Pierce Brosnan as the super spy, showed Bond enjoying a Vodka Martini, ordered to the most particular standards. But according to research, Bond is actually a greater lover of whiskey . For now though, the return to 'classic Bond' appears to have pleased even the most hardcore of fans. Ajay Chowdhury, president of the James Bond International Fan Club, told the Telegraph: 'In the novels, Bond drinks everything – beer, whisky – but the drink most associated with him is vodka martini, shaken not stirred. Everything else is gravy.' Andrew Lycett, biographer of Ian Fleming, added: 'I think Bond aficionados like the sense of a classy drink, and somehow vodka has come through the field over the last 50 years.' He may be best known for his love of Vodka Martini, ordered to the most particular standards. But according to research, Bond is actually a greater lover of whiskey. He sinks 317 drinks in Fleming’s 14 books, Vanity Fair reports. He racks up 101 of whiskeys, including 37 orders of straight bourbon. He also quaffs sake, champagne, wine, and of course the Vesper. Invented by the superspy, the Vesper includes 3 measures of gin, 1 measure of vodka, ½ measure of Kina Lillet, and a thin lemon slice. He orders it just once, in Casino Royale. Filming of Spectre began last week after the film was announced on December 4 and revealed to include stars Monica Bellucci (Lucia Sciarra), Christoph Waltz (Oberhauser), and Léa Seydoux (Madeleine Swann). It comes after a draft script for Spectre was stolen from the film studio by a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace. Producers confirmed the  cyber attack on the computers of Sony Pictures Entertainment last month and additional writers have had to be drafted in to help make changes to the ending.. The leak revealed that Spectre has a budget of over $300 million, which is $50 million more than the predecessor Skyfall. The internal documents reveal additional writers, including Jez Butterworth, have been drafted in to help Skyfall veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade with major changes to the plot of the new film.  It was also revealed that the 24th film will be shot in locations including Pinewood Studios, London, Rome, Mexico City, Morocco and the Alps.","Sony Pictures have signed multi-million pound deal with Belvedere Vodka .

"The Miss World 2014 contest saw 120 international contestants each deemed to be not only the most beautiful in their home countries, but the best example of what it means to be a modern woman, descend on London last weekend. While they looked perfectly polished and relaxed as they took to the runway to dazzle the judges at the grand finale on Sunday, the rest of the week was an altogether different affair. As these behind-the-scenes photos reveal, the contestants endured gruelling fitness tests, intense talent rounds and gorged on plenty of burgers and chips. Scroll down for video . Behind the scenes: Adrian Fisk, the official photographer of the Miss World Competition, has shared his backstage snaps after following the beautiful women around for the few days that they were in London. Here, the finalists enjoy an evening at Planet Hollywood . Adrian Fisk, the official photographer of the Miss World Competition, this year held in London, explains that he wanted to show the day-to-day lives of the girls who competing for the prestigious title. His photo series documents the women arriving in London from all around the globe, waiting nervously behind the scenes and even celebrating contestants' birthdays. Speaking about his work, he said: 'Being the official photographer for Miss World has not only been an honour but also truly inspiring. I think like many people my perception of Miss World was girls parading around in bikinis wanting world peace. 'The truth, it turns out, is far from that. Each one of these woman are determined, passionate, motivated, bright and an inspiration to young woman and youth around the world. Take each one of their 'Beauty with a purpose' charity projects and you can see their intelligence and determination in trying to create change for a better world. 'Over these past four weeks I have seen them dance with extraordinary agility, perform fitness tests and sports competitions that left me exhausted just watching them, watch them debate against some of the sharpest young minds in the country at the Oxford Union hall on the concept of Miss World in the 21st century and finally keep a steady nerve as they prepared to enter a competition watched live by just short of a billion people. I have nothing but respect for each and every one of them.' The coveted crown was taken home by Miss South Africa, Rolene Strauss.

"With the prospect of an Arctic blast hitting the country next week, it’s likely that some of us will be feeling the cold in our hands and feet. But in my case, my fingers will feel more than just a little chilly. It’s likely that, despite wearing gloves, my ring, middle and index finger will go white and numb, while burning with pain as they lose all circulation. Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms for Raynaud’s can be triggered by air-conditioning or taking food out of the freezer (file picture) I’m not alone in suffering this way. It’s estimated that ten million people have Raynaud’s, a disproportionate reaction of the circulatory system to even the slightest drop in temperature. When this happens, the blood vessels in the fingers and sometimes the toes can contract, cutting off their blood supply. The most common form of Raynaud’s — the one that I suffer with — is known as primary Raynaud’s phenomenon. There is no obvious cause, though it could be genetic — although no one else has been affected in my family. About eight out of ten sufferers are women, with most having their first attack before the age of 40. In my case, it started in my early 20s, more than 20 years ago. In some cases, an underlying health condition such as rheumatoid arthritis can cause the blood vessels to overreact — a condition known as secondary Raynaud’s. It can also be caused by medication such as the contraceptive pill or beta-blockers. In severe cases this can cause ulcers on the skin. ‘Typically, Raynaud’s causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb as the blood vessels go into spasm in response to cold temperatures,’ says Eddie Chaloner, a consultant vascular surgeon at Lewisham Hospital in South-East London. This stops blood flow to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn icy white. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour. As blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. The burning is caused by lactic acid — a chemical we also produce after prolonged exercise, such as running — building up in the fingers when blood flow is reduced due to low levels of oxygen, and then being released as blood returns to the area. About eight out of ten sufferers of Raynaud’s are women (file picture) Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by air-conditioning or taking food out of the freezer. ‘Being a smoker also increases risk as nicotine makes blood vessels contract,’ adds Mr Chaloner . Just putting my hand under a cold tap or daring to step outside with bare hands on a cool summer’s day is enough to trigger my symptoms. Within moments my fingers will be a bloodless white and numb. Only this morning, a few minutes after stepping out of a (hot) shower, I’d lost all feeling in the top of my middle finger on my right hand because the bathroom was cold in contrast to the hot water. In winter, I get it several times a week, and a couple of times a month in the summer months —– unless there’s a heatwave. And I can tell if it’s time to turn on our central heating because as soon as I experience any kind of chill, the tips of both my middle and ring fingers lose all colour. If I don’t move quickly, either to cup my hands around a hot drink, or wrap them in a scarf, the familiar deadening feeling spreads to the rest of my index finger, too. Strangely, it doesn’t always affect my feet —– it’s far more common to affect the hands, though some people suffer with both. But to be careful, I always wear thick, woolly tights in the winter as well as thick, sheepskin gloves. Not only is it uncomfortable, it’s also extremely inconvenient. For me, little every day manoeuvres such as writing become murderously difficult as it’s impossible to negotiate a pen when your fingers are painfully numb. It also makes doing up buttons, punching numbers on a telephone keypad or even using a tin opener difficult. There is no cure — all that modern medicine can do is offer drugs such as nifedipine, more commonly given for high blood pressure and angina, which works by relaxing blood vessels to alleviate the symptoms. You use these drugs at the point of need — when you are having an attack — but they don’t address the underlying cause, and stop working when you don’t use them. ‘And some patients can find the side-effects difficult, including bad headaches,’ says Dr Karl Gaffney, consultant rheumatologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. This is because the drugs relax vessels throughout the body – not just the hands and feet — and this increases blood flow to the brain, thus triggering headaches. As I’m prone to headaches, I’ve avoided resorting to medication to help my Raynaud’s, but what are the alternatives? To find out, I asked surgeon Mr Chaloner to assess the latest offerings and rate them on the credibility of science, while I tried them out for myself. HERBAL PILLS . Padma Circosan, £29.95 for 120 capsules, healthy2u.co.uk . Padma Circosan is a herbal medicine, used for circulatory disorders including Raynaud’s. Ingredients include costus root, Iceland moss and neem fruit, which believed to boost circulation naturally . A herbal medicine, used for circulatory disorders including Raynaud’s. Ingredients include costus root, Iceland moss and neem fruit, which believed to boost circulation naturally. Take two capsules three times a day. EXPERT VIEW: ‘There’s some evidence that Padma has effects on the chemicals thought to play a part in vascular disease. But there are no direct trials I can find that demonstrate a specific effect in Raynaud’s.’ RATING: 2/5 . MY VIEW: I can’t say there was any real change when I was out in cold weather. However, my hands felt a little warmer in the house than they normally do. MENTHOL PLASTERS . Patch-It Circulation, 20 patches for £29.99, Holland & Barrett . Plaster-style reflexology patches that you stick on the soles of the feet. They contain menthol which, it’s claimed, helps stimulate key reflexology points on the feet to help healthy circulation. EXPERT VIEW: ‘The menthol in the patch may have a minor beneficial and temporary effect. It seems to affect the fine capillaries creating a minor change in blood flow, so creating a feeling of warmth.’ 2/5 . MY VIEW: It’s suggested you wear these for three consecutive nights, but that just left me with a gluey mess on my feet in the morning. Made absolutely no difference. SOCKS MADE OF SILVER . Carnation Footcare Silversock, £9.54, silversock.co.uk . Socks made with silver fibre, which, claim manufacturers, improve circulation . EXPERT VIEW: ‘There’s no evidence to support a pharmacological effect of silver as a way of improving circulation. However, there is good clinical evidence that warm clothing does have a beneficial effect on Raynaud’s symptoms, so just on the basis that it is a thick sock, it should be of benefit.’ 3/5 . MY VIEW: My feet stayed warm when I was outside, but no more so than when I have worn a decent pair of socks. HAND WARMERS . Hothands Hand Warmers — Twin Pack, £1, Halfords . Hothands Hand Warmers: Self-heating little bags that contain ingredients such as iron powder, salt and charcoal, which, due to a chemical reaction, warm up when exposed to the air . Self-heating little bags that contain ingredients such as iron powder, salt and charcoal, which, due to a chemical reaction, warm up when exposed to the air. EXPERT VIEW: ‘Useful and cheap. I used these when I went mountain climbing.’ 4/5 . MY VIEW: These are very effective once they have warmed up — which takes about ten minutes. They stayed warm inside my gloves for three or four hours. GINKGO POWDER . Hawthorn Ginkgo & Bilberry Powder by Terranova, £18.50 for 30g, nutricentre.com . A blend of hawthorn, ginkgo and bilberry, taken as a quarter teaspoon of powder mixed with water at meal times, once or twice a day. It is claimed that the ingredients naturally maintain healthy circulation. EXPERT VIEW: ‘There is some evidence ginkgo has an effect on certain chemicals thought to be important in blood vessels. However, ginkgo has been tested in several trials in Raynaud’s disease and been found to be no better than a placebo.’ 1/5 . MY VIEW: This smells and tastes horrible. But I did notice that my hands felt a little warmer when I was taking them — but not outside when it was really cold. HEATED MITTENS . Springyard battery heated mittens, £21.45, primrose.co.uk . Mittens with a pouch on the back of the wrist area that contains a battery-operated heating device. EXPERT VIEW: ‘These work on the principle of keeping the hands warm. However, they may be a little heavy to wear.’ 4/5 . MY VIEW: The device took 20 minutes to heat up — so when I was outside, my hands were already starting to feel cold, though not yet going numb as the wadding in the mittens is quite effective. TINGLY FOOT BALM . Gehwol Warming Balm, £7.50, beautynaturals.com . Contains algae, paprika, ginger, essential oils of rosemary and lavender as well as camphor, which it’s claimed naturally stimulate the circulation . EXPERT VIEW: ‘It may make your feet feel better briefly as ingredients such as camphor may cause a slight change to the capillaries in the skin. But no evidence offered that it has any significant effect on Raynaud’s.’ 0/5 . MY VIEW: This produced a pleasant warming feeling when rubbed into the skin. And (even though it’s for feet) I tried it on my hands and they both felt warm for a while. Not an ideal solution as the cream is a little gloopy and it didn’t ultimately stop my hands from going cold when I went outside, though there was less of a reaction indoors.","It’s estimated that ten million people have Raynaud’s - a disproportionate reaction of the circulatory system .

"An Iranian judge sentenced a Christian man to have his lips burnt with a cigarette for eating during the day in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The barbaric punishment was carried out in public in a square in the city of Kermanshah. Five other Muslim men were also flogged in public with 70 lashes for not fasting during Ramadan, the city's deputy governor Ali Ashraf Karami said. A spokesperson from The National Council of Resistance of Iran, a political coalition which opposes the government, denounced the treatment as 'savage' and called on western countries to take action. Tens of thousands of Iranian Muslim women attend the Eid al-Fitr prayer ceremony in Tehran, Iran. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the fasting month Ramadan. A Christian man was sentenced to have his lips burnt after refusing to fast during the religious festival . They said: 'The silence of the world community, especially of western countries, vis-à-vis these medieval punishments under the excuse of having nuclear talks with Iran has intensified the brutal and systematic violation of human rights in Iran. 'This will ultimately embolden the Iranian regime to continue its nuclear projects more than before.' But earlier this year the UN blasted Iran for the persecution of Christians in a damning report laid bare to the world in March. The detailed report found that Iran has continued to imprison Christians for their faith and designated house churches and evangelical Christians as 'threats to national security.' At least 49 Christians were among 307 religious minorities being held in Iranian jails as of January 2014, noted the UN, which also criticised the regime for its hostility to Jews, Baha’is, Zoroastrians and Dervish Muslims. In its annual report on people imprisoned for their faith around the world, the Brussels-based organization Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF) named Iran as one of five countries with the largest number of 'freedom of religion or belief prisoners.' There are an estimated 250,000 Christians in Iran's 76 million strong population. They all face torture, imprisonment or the death sentence under Sharia law for not observing Islamic religious festivals and dress codes. Thousands of persecuted Christians have fled the country, which saw Hossein Soodmand hanged in 2008 for following the faith.","Christian ate during the day within the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .

"David Letterman expressed his delight today that he would be passing The Late Show crown to Stephen Colbert - but didn't miss the opportunity for a quip at his successor's expense. Colbert was announced on Thursday as Letterman's replacement when the 66-year-old leaves in 2015 after 33 years in the job to spend more time with his family. Letterman said today: 'Stephen has always been a real friend to me. I’m very excited for him, and I’m flattered that CBS chose him. I also happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses.' Scroll down for video . Stephen Colbert is set to replace David Letterman on The Late Show when he steps down next year (pictured in 2011) Colbert currently hosts his own popular, political satire show The Colbert Report on Comedy Central . Colbert has been signed for a . five-year contract with CBS for his new gig although his official start . date is yet to be confirmed. The . 49-year-old has hosted The Colbert Report on Comedy Central since 2005 . where he eviscerates a large cast of political and media targets in his . alter-ego of a hyperbolic, conservative pundit. However Colbert told ABC that he will be ditching The Colbert Report caricature in his new mainstream role. He said: 'I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it.' Following the announcement, Colbert said: 'Simply being a guest on David Letterman's show has been a highlight of my career. I never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Dave's lead.' The 49-year-old then quipped: 'I'm thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth.' Colbert poses with his Emmys last year in LA. CBS have signed him up for a five-year contract to host The Late Show . Friends of the funnyman were quick to send congratulations. As the youngest of 11 siblings in a . family of intellectuals, Stephen Colbert's ability to make himself heard . appears to have been ingrained from birth. He . was raised Catholic in Charleston, South Carolina, by his doctor-Yale . professor father James and homemaker mother Lorna. Colbert has said in . past interviews that although he was raised in a devout family, his . intellectual parents taught him to be questioning of the Church, a theme . which continues to run through his comic routines. In . 1974, when he was ten, Stephen's father and two of his . brothers Peter and Paul were killed in a plane crash in North Carolina. The . tragedy and the family's subsequent move to an urban area of . Charleston, led to him becoming an introverted teenager with few . friends who relied on the worlds of science-fiction and fantasy. Colbert . credits his love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons for . sparking an early interest in acting. By . his own admission a slacker in the academic department, he swayed over . whether he would attend college. He had a brief stint in a Rolling . Stones cover band and saw his dreams of becoming a marine biologist . shattered after surgery left him deaf in his right ear. He studied philosophy at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia then transferred to Northwestern as a theater major. After college, he wound up in an improvised comedy troupe in Chicago where he understudied Steve Carrell and met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The . trio were offered the chance to do an HBO series which earned positive . reviews. The opportunity led to brief writing stints for SNL, MTV and . GMA, before he was hired on a trial basis for the Daily Show in 1997. Colbert . satirized a news correspondent with little more than a basic grip of . the subject he was discussing. His writing on the Daily Show earned him . three Emmys. In 2005, his . news satire spin-off The Colbert Report launched on Comedy Central. It . started with high-ratings and has held its place as one of the network's . most-watched shows. On April 10, it was announced that Colbert would be filling the shoes of David Letterman on The Late Show. He lives in Montclair, New Jersey with his wife Evelyn and three children Madeleine, Peter and John. Jimmy . Fallon tweeted: 'I'd like to welcome the great @StephenAtHome to . network late night and also congratulate him on his new name: Jimmy . Colbert.' Daily Show host Jon Stewart was dropping heavy hints last night at an event in New York, telling Vulture he thought Colbert would be 'amazing'. Stewart . said: 'He is a uniquely talented individual. He’s wonderful in Colbert . Report, but he’s got gears he hasn’t even shown people yet. He would be . remarkable.' Speaking at the Cinema Society screening of Nicolas Cage's new movie, Joe, Stewart added: 'He’s done an amazing job with just that very narrow cast of character, but he’s got a lot more he can show.' As he sipped a beer at Manhattan's The Handy Liquor Bar (and Chalk Point Kitchen), Stewart revealed: 'He’s got some skill sets that are really applicable, interviewing-wise, but also he’s a really, really good actor and also an excellent improvisational comedian. He’s also got great writing skills. He’s got a lot of the different capacities. Being able to expand upon [those] would be exciting.' Colbert's contract at Comedy Central runs through to the end of 2014 however CBS and Comedy Central are both owned by Viacom. CBS said that 'specific creative elements' - like producers, writers, . and filming location - are still to be confirmed as is the exact date of . the hand-off. MailOnline last week named Colbert as a frontrunner for the job in a line-up which included Chelsea Handler, Conan O'Brien and Neil Patrick Harris. In a statement President and CEO of CBS Corporation Leslie Moonves said: 'Stephen Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television. 'David . Letterman's legacy and accomplishments are an incredible source of . pride for all of us here, and today's announcement speaks to our . commitment of upholding what he established for CBS in late night.' Comedy Central, who are losing one of their brightest stars, also released a statement today wishing Colbert well. 'Comedy Central is proud that the incredibly talented Stephen Colbert has been part of our family for nearly two decades. 'We look forward to the next eight months of the ground-breaking ‘Colbert Report’ and wish Stephen the very best.' David Letterman announced last Thursday that he will be retiring  to spend more time with his family in 2015 after 33 years of being a late night host. The 66-year-old’s show is the longest-running scripted show and he has the longest track record of any talk show host in the history of late night television. And the host made a touching on-air announcement of his retirement last Thursday. In his final moments, he recounted the 22 years he spent working for CBS hosting the 'Late Show with David Letterman' and the 11 years he hosted NBC's Late Night. He also guest hosted on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the late 70s. Colbert's wildly popular Comedy Central show The Colbert Report sees him parody right-wing news hosts and politicians . Close friends: Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert at the Emmys in September 2012. Speaking at the Cinema Society premiere of Joe, just hours before Colbert's new gig was announced, Jon enthused: 'He¿s wonderful in Colbert Report, but he¿s got gears he hasn¿t even shown people yet. He would be remarkable' Jimmy Kimmel: 'Congratulations to @StephenAtHome A finer or funnier man I do not know.' Jimmy Fallon: 'I'd like to welcome the great @StephenAtHome to network late night and also congratulate him on his new name: Jimmy Colbert,' he tweeted following Thursday's announcement.

"His twins are yet to leave hospital but Prince Albert of Monaco is taking fatherhood in his stride if this morning's visit to a nursery is any indication. The royal, 56, was at the nursery to play Father Christmas to an excited group of children and was all smiles as he handed out prettily wrapped gifts. But there was no sign of his wife, Princess Charlene, 36, who remains in hospital with their baby twins Jacques and Gabriella. Getting some practice in: Prince Albert was all smiles as he visited a Monaco nursery this morning . Albert, who was with his wife when she gave birth by caesarean section last Wednesday, was then driven to the headquarters of the Monaco Red Cross, where he handed out food parcels. The new babies, the first for the couple, have displaced Albert's sister Princess Caroline in the Monégasque line of succession, with Jacques now heir to the principality. While Charlene recovers, Albert has been busy preparing for the babies' public unveiling on the 7th January, which will see the twins presented to the citizens of Monaco from the balcony of the Palais Princier. On Friday, he held court at the birth certificate ceremony, which was witnessed by 20 grandees, among them Albert's youngest sister Princess Stephanie. Taking to fatherhood: Prince Albert reached down to give one little boy a tender pat on the cheek . It's Father Christmas! Albert played the role of the North Pole's most famous resident and handed out gifts . Delighted: Both Albert and the lucky infants appeared to enjoy the present giving . Unhappy: The little girl, who wore Monaco's national colours, wasn't pleased to be parted from her present . And the Monégasque royals aren't the only ones delighted by the birth of the twin babies. Princess Charlene's South African family have also spoken of their happiness at the birth. Speaking to South African news channel ENCA, Charlene's father Mike Wittstock said the family is thrilled and had received the news of the birth from Prince Albert himself. 'He called us and told us himself that things are good,' said the delighted grandfather. 'He gave us all the details, the babies’ names and all that, and said Charlene was doing very well.' Mr Wittstock, who has previously insisted that his new royal grandchildren would be treated the same as the others, is also planning a trip to the principality to meet the twins. 'We will now wait for things to settle down and then I will send my wife [Lynette] over first,' he said. 'That kind of thing is more of a woman’s job. Then I’ll go and join them a bit later.' Festive: Albert and other guests were treated to an adorable Christmas dance by the children . And here's one for you! Albert is offered a gift by one little well-wisher . And another! An adorable little boy tries to hand new father Prince Albert his ball . All smiles: Prince Albert, still clearly elated at the birth, was all smiles during the visit . Cute: The royal ended the visit with a group photo before heading to hospital to visit his wife . Since the birth on Wednesday, congratulatory messages have been flooding in from around the world, with King Mohammed VI of Morocco among those to send a note. In his, the Moroccan royal spoke of his joy at the birth, before adding: 'I am glad to hear the happy news which, I am sure, filled the princely family and Monaco's people with joy.' News of the birth, which was greeted by a 42-cannon salute, brought hundreds of people on to the streets of Monaco, while buildings, among them the Palais Princier, have been festooned with the red and white national flags. The twin babies are the first children to be born to Princess Charlene and her husband, although Albert does have an illegitimate daughter and son from previous relationships. Nice to meet you: Prince Albert hands a gift bag of food to an elderly lady - he also stopped for a chat . Here you go: The Prince visits Red Cross HQ every year to hand out Christmas food supplies to the needy . Royal duties: Albert has been completing his royal duties alone, with Charlene still in hospital . Enjoying his morning: Albert rounded off his visit with a group photo with workers and recipients . The eldest, daughter Jazmin, 22, was born following a fling with former waitress Tamara Rotolo. He denied being her father for years before DNA tests proved otherwise when she was a teenager. Albert also has a younger son, Alexandre Coste, 11, is the result of an affair with Nicole Coste, a Togolese former Air France hostess. Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of them have any claim to royal titles or to be considered as heirs to Albert because they were born outside of marriage. They do however have legal rights to a share of his huge personal fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine to exceed $1 billion (800 million euros). Going home: Princess Charlene, who has been recovering from the birth, is expected to leave hospital soon . Legitimate: The babies are the heirs to Albert's throne and replace his sister Caroline . On her way: The royal and her babies have been inside the Princess Grace Hospital since Wednesday . Celebration: The Palais Princier was illuminated in red and white to mark the arrival of the baby twins .","Prince Albert visited a nursery in Monaco to hand out gifts to children .

"The average Briton believes they will only consume 3,000 calories on Christmas Day. But in reality, most of us will eat and drink our way through 7,000 calories in just one sitting and then spend most of January trying to burn it off. According to new research, most people have no idea that they will triple their recommended daily calorie allowance (2,000 for women and 2,500 for men) on the most indulgent day of the year. The average Brit believes they only consume 3,000 calories on Christmas Day, but really they eat 7,000. A roast potato is 200 calories, Christmas pudding is 330 and pigs in blankets are 97 apiece . In a new survey, more than a third of people said they would only consume 3,000 calories, with just two per cent correctly estimating 7,000 - 29 per cent thought they would eat less than 3,000 calories. Roast potatoes, at 200 calories each, were named the favourite part of the festive dinner, followed by turkey at 303 calories for three slices, then sausages wrapped in bacon at 97 calories each. Champagne, at 133 calories a glass, was the top tipple to accompany the Christmas meal, which contains 1,450 calories, followed by Mulled wine at 119 per glass, then Baileys at 180. Then there's the extra chocolate, mince pies, nuts, crisps and biscuits that leave most of us feeling as rotund as Santa himself by the time we go to bed. It would take more than 10 hours of running, cycling at more than 20mph for seven hours, climbing stairs for eight hours and skipping for 12 hours to burn off the 7,000 calories consumed on Christmas Day . It would take more than 10 hours of running, cycling at more than 20mph for seven hours, climbing stairs for eight hours and skipping for 12 hours to burn off the 7,000 calories consumed on Christmas Day. The survey into the nation's eating, drinking and exercise habits was carried out for Prestige Boot Camp. Head Trainer Iain Reitze said: 'It does show how little people are aware of the calorie content of the food they eat. 'We over-eat at the best of times but Christmas Day is off the scale. People seem to resign themselves to putting weight on over the holidays and worry about their weight in the New Year. 'I'd say if you don't want to gain weight, then maybe fill up on vegetables, drink water in between alcoholic drinks, go for a walk before and after your dinner and try not to have too many treats. 'Enjoy Christmas, of course, but many people go from being healthy to completely binging on food and drink and it leaves them feeling sluggish and bad about themselves.' Losing weight was the top New Year's Resolution with 28 per cent of people saying it was their aim for 2015 . Harriet Frew, an eating disorder specialist, agrees and says she speaks to many people, women in particular, whose self-esteem takes a nose-dive after the holidays. She said: 'People feel they have permission to have a blowout because it's Christmas. A lot of this is done in a dissociated state and the pounds pile on without us even noticing. 'In our Western culture, weight gain is inextricably linked to failure and getting it wrong. 'People feel self-loathing and self-criticism following their Christmas binge and wake up in the New Year berating themselves and planning the next diet. 'Then they often go to the other extreme with strict diets, new regimes and unrealistic goads that are ultimately unsustainable.' Champagne (175ml) - 133 . Red wine (175ml) - 126 . White wine (175ml) - 133 . Baileys (50ml) - 180 . Brandy (50ml) - 150 . Whisky (50ml) - 122 . Mulled wine (175ml) - 119 . Lager (pint) - 170 . Bitter (pint) - 180 . Port (100ml) - 160 .

Not surprisingly, losing weight was the top New Year's Resolution with 28 per cent of people saying it was their aim for 2015, followed by drinking less alcohol (19 per cent), getting fit (17 per cent) and eating healthily (15 per cent). Out of the group, more than one in five – 22 per cent - said they did no exercise at all, but nearly the same percentage, 19 per cent, said they trained more than five times each week. Iain added:'Most people said that their stomach was the body part they would most like to change, with more than half saying they were unhappy with theirs, followed by legs at 24, arms at 14 per cent and bottom at one per cent. 'The stomach is the problem area for a lot of the women I see and they usually admit they like to drink wine. 'Not only is this high in calories, but it's strong too, so means they are likely to reach for unhealthy foods while they are drinking and afterwards. 'Christmas is the worst time ever for this but I think that if people are conscious about what they eat, they can get through the holidays without doing too much damage to their waistline. 'I think it's really positive to see a lot of people are already doing exercise, or certainly plan to in the New Year and hope to cut back on unhealthy food and alcohol. 'So many people try new diets or regimes in January, and I think it's important to make sure you find a plan you can stick too, rather than do a drastic or faddy one and set yourself up for a fall. 'My message would be to try to eat clean and exercise when you can each day all year round, then you can enjoy Christmas without piling on the pounds.'","Average Brit believes they only consume 3,000 calories on Christmas Day .

"British business today throws its weight behind an in-out referendum on Europe and warns ‘the status quo is not an option’. A survey of nearly 4,000 company bosses in the UK shows more than three-quarters back giving the public a say on membership of the European Union. It also reveals that British business is becoming more Eurosceptic with growing support for quitting the EU altogether or withdrawing and securing new trade agreements. However, the majority - or 61.4 per cent of those asked in the British Chambers of Commerce poll - wants Britain to remain in the EU with powers transferred from Brussels to Westminster. Many captains of British industry want a public vote on whethere the UK should leave Europe . ‘The status quo is not an option,’ says BCC director general John Longworth in the report. ‘Ministers must pursue reform and renegotiation as a priority. ‘These results show that British businesses remain determined to see a recalibrated relationship between the UK and the rest of the European Union, with more powers exercised from Westminster rather than Brussels.’ David Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership of the EU and hold an in-out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win the 2015 general election. It would be the first vote on the UK’s relationship with Europe since 1975 but it is vehemently opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The BCC report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the EU would be bad for business. The prospect of a referendum has also sparked outrage among Europhiles who claim that Britain would be isolated economically and politically if it left the EU. But 800 business leaders have now signed up to Business for Britain, a campaign group in favour of renegotiating the terms of UK membership of the EU. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the group, said: ‘It is fantastic to see further evidence that business people in Britain want to have their say on the EU. ‘It would be wrong of anyone to characterise British business as being content with the current relationship with Brussels, which is why it is so important that the process of renegotiating a fundamental change in Britain’s membership begins today.’ The BCC report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the EU would be bad for business. But this is down from 60 per cent three months ago while the proportion who believes quitting the EU would be good for business has risen from 18 per cent to 19.5 per cent. Over one-third of companies, or 35.6 per cent, favour withdrawal followed by new trade agreements to ensure exports are not hit. This is up from 33 per cent three months ago while opposition to such a move has fallen from 42 per cent to 36.7 per cent. But the majority - or more than six in 10 company bosses - want Britain to remain in the EU with powers transferred back from Brussels to Westminster. And although 43 per cent of business back the Prime Minister’s plan to hold a referendum in 2017 after negotiations have run their course, 34 per cent want a vote far sooner. ‘Businesses reject both the Europhile dream of further integration and the Europhobe dream of a complete exit from the EU provided a satisfactory renegotiation is achieved,’ says Mr Longworth. But he warns that the split over when the referendum should take place ‘shows that there is an impatience amongst a significant number of companies for greater clarity on the UK’s position’.","Business leaders say they want a referendum on EU membership .

"If you thought you had teenage internet speak cracked by getting to grips with acronyms such as 'LOL' (for 'laugh out loud') and 'LMK' (for 'let me know'), think again. Do you know the meaning of 'IWSN' or 'GNOC'? Considering these are acronyms for 'I want sex now' and 'get naked on camera' used by youngsters, it's probably a good idea that parents do. These shorthands are just some of the 28 online abbreviations that feature in a new report by CNN about teenagers' secret online language. Scroll down for video . The report reveals teenagers are using a shorthand language online - including IWSN (I want sex now) The list, collated by Kelly Wallace with the help of Internet safety expert Katie Greer, also contains slang such as '420' for 'marijuana', 'POS' for 'parent over shoulder' and the phrase every parent dreads their teenager reading '(L)MIRL'  for 'let's meet in real life'. Greer's research has found the majority of teens think their parents are trying to keep tabs on them online, so these acronyms are used to hide certain parts of their conversations. 'Acronyms used for this purpose could potentially raise some red flags for parents,' she warns. Renowned parenting expert and author of Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting, Noël Janis-Norton, believes it's useful to have a good understanding of your child's online language but warns, 'Teens will always stay one step ahead'. 'If a teen wants to hide something from their parents, they usually manage to,' Janis-Norton tells the MailOnline. 'Often teenagers have a Facebook page that their parents know about and then  another one for  their real friends. So the most important thing is to keep lines of communication open and to create opportunities for them to absorb your values.' The best way to protect teenagers from online dangers is to keep up a conversation about their online lives . Not understanding the boundaries and repercussions of appropriate online behaviour can lead to problems in the real world. Explicit pictures or video footage can be used by peers to bully, threaten and blackmail or can end up in the hands of sexual predators. As Claire Lilley, head of child safety online at the NSPCC explains: 'Offenders with a sexual interest in children can be extremely manipulative and devious, lying about who they are and creating fake profiles on the social networks young people use. 1. IWSN - I want sex now . 2. GNOC - Get naked on camera . 3. NIFOC - Naked in front of computer . 4. PIR - Parent in room . 5 CU46 - See you for sex . 6. 53X - Sex . 7. 9 - Parent watching . 8. 99 - Parent gone . 9. 1174 - Party meeting place . 10. THOT - That hoe over there . 11. CID - Acid (the drug) 12. Broken - Hungover from alcohol . 13. 420 - Marijuana . 14. POS - Parent over shoulder . 15. SUGARPIC - Suggestive or erotic photo . 16. KOTL - Kiss on the lips . 17. (L)MIRL - Let's meet in real life . 18. PRON - Porn . 19. TDTM - Talk dirty to me . 20. 8 - Oral sex . 21. CD9 - Parents around/Code 9 . 22. IPN - I'm posting naked . 23. LH6 - Let's have sex . 24. WTTP - Want to trade pictures? 25. DOC - Drug of choice . 26. TWD - Texting while driving . 27. GYPO - Get your pants off . 28. KPC- Keeping parents clueless . 'Some offenders are interested in meeting and sexually abusing children offline and may use the online exchanges to try to groom a child into a meeting. 'For others getting a child to perform sexually over webcam is their only objective, but this can be equally devastating for victims.' Janis-Norton agrees that the dangers are very real: 'Studies have shown that even if you put children who think they're very media savvy in front of a computer, they can be lured into chat rooms with people posing as a teenagers within a few clicks.' If parents do become aware that their teenager is in trouble online, Janis-Norton advises talking seriously while taking care not to appear shocked. 'Shock has the flavour of disapproval,' she says. 'So will discourage teenagers from sharing anything they're doing. 'As parents we need to be coming with an understanding attitude - that it is easy for teenagers to be sucked in online. 'Start a conversation by saying ""I'm worried"" rather than using words such as ""angry"" or ""disgusted"". 'If parents can be sensitive to what their teenager is feeling, it will be easier for the teenager to share what their own feelings, which is often that they are in over their heads.' But if the conversation seems like a lecture, Janis-Norton warns teens are likely to tune-out. 'They'll think, ""They're such fuddy-duddies. They don't understand."" And just decide to do whatever they want instead. 'Lecturing, threatening and nagging are ineffective ways of getting kids to pay attention,' she adds. 'Take the conversation slowly – it's not just a one-off and will need to be revisited frequently.' Jonathan Baggaley, Head of Education at the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, agrees that the best way to protect teenagers from the dangers online is to keep up a conversation about their online lives. 'For today's young people there is no line between the online and offline world,' he says. 'They use the internet to socialise and grow and, just as you guide and support them offline, you should be there for them online too. 'Talk to them about what they're doing, if they know you understand they are more likely to approach you if they need support. 'Be inquisitive and interested in the new gadgets and sites that your child is using. It's important that as they learn more, so do you.' 'If a teen wants to hide something from their parents, they usually manage to,' warns parenting expert Noël Janis-Norton . He also advises setting boundaries  online, just as you would in the real world. 'Think about what they might see, what they share, who they talk to and how long they spend online. It is important to continue to discuss boundaries so that they evolve as your child's use of technology does,' he explains. 'Know which devices connects to the internet and how. Also, find out how they are accessing the internet - is it your connection or a neighbour's Wifi? This will affect whether your safety settings are being applied. 'Parental controls are not the answer to your child's online safety, but they are a good start and are not as difficult to install as you might think. 'Service providers are working hard to make them simple, effective and user friendly,' he adds. So what are the important key messages to get across to your teen? 'Emphasise that not everyone is who they say they are and make sure they understand that they should never meet up with anyone they only know online without taking a trusted adult with them,' says Baggaley. 'They also need to know what to do if something goes wrong. 'It is important to for them to know when and how to report any problem,' he says. That could be to a trusted adult or an official body. For more advice or if someone has acted inappropriately online towards your child, contact the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (www.ceop.police.uk) or for more information go to the NSPCC website.","New report by CNN lists teenagers' secret online language .

"Carol E. Levy (right) has moved her new husband Joel Goron (left) into the prestigious New York addresses she shares with her ex-husband . A New York real estate broker is  seeking a buyer for her luxurious multi-million dollar home, which she currently shares with her husband, newborn baby - and her ex. Carol E. Levy - known as 'The Billion Dollar Broker' - was forced to continue sharing the duplex at the Beresford on Central Park West with her ex-husband Chris Lipman after the couple divorced in 2012. A judge ruled that Chris should receive spousal support, after he was let go from his wife's successful firm Carol E. Levy Real Estate when the couple split. But this didn't stop the wealthy broker from moving on with her life, as Carol has since moved her new husband Joel Goron into the prestigious addresses, the New York Post reported. 'I have not allowed Chris' presence and the fact that he's not moved on with his life to stand in the way of moving full steam ahead with my life,' she told the newspaper. 'He is like a squatter here, and I am the ultimate doer. He is an unwanted guest, and once the apartment sells, it's all over.' Chris currently lives rent-free on the 17th floor in the guest bedroom of the six-bedroom palatial apartment, surrounded by a media room and the kitchen. Carol lives upstairs in the 18th-floor master suite with Joel, who she married in August, their new baby, and her  and Chris' two teenage daughters. 'I do not allow her ex's presence to affect our incredible happiness in any way whatsoever,' Joel said. 'He's merely a speed bump in the road.' For his part, Chris says he chooses to remain living  in the unorthodox living situation - despite the frosty atmosphere - as it allows him to see his two daughters and eases financial pressures as he builds a separate business. He also told the New York Post that his presence is also motivating Carol to sell the apartment, of which he will receive 45 per cent of the profits. Carol E.

The legal ruling placed the burden of the mortgage and maintenance on Carol until the 5,000-square-foot marital home is sold. The impressive property - which features city views, sweeping terraces, a grand staircase herringbone floors and two wood-burning fireplaces - came onto the market for $24 million and has already been reduced to $18 million to speed up the sale. Carol describes the palatial apartment as 'a wonderful mix of classic pre-war with modern amenities', with a 'magical garden oasis' featuring panoramic views. Divorce attorney Todd Spodek explained to the New York Post that many couples are left with no other option than to co-habit after a litigated divorce due to the current scarcity of real estate options in New York City.

"White people will be a minority in the U.S. by 2044 while the rest of the population will be a mixture of different ethnicities, according to a new survey. The next 30 years will see an ageing white population reduced from 75 per cent of U.S. citizens today to 49.7 per cent in 2044, the first year minorities will outnumber whites. In the same time period the Hispanic population will soar from 16 per cent today to 25 per cent, while the Asian population will nearly double from 4 per cent to 7.9 per cent. The year 2044 will mark the first time that ethnic minorities will outnumber white Americans, with the Hispanic population growing from 17 per cent now to 25 per cent, while the Asian population will nearly double . While whites will still be the single largest ethnic group in America by 2044, when all the minorities are added together, it will form a 'majority minority' population. That trend will continue into 2060 when white people will make up around 44 per cent of Americans, according to research by Brookings Institution. As younger generations opt for having fewer children, and delay parenthood into later life, deaths will begin to outnumber births in the white population by 2025, when numbers will start to decline. By 2060 white people will still make up the majority of the senior population, with 55 per cent of over 65s being white, but among the young that drops to 48 per cent, with 64 per cent being minorities. By 2060 white Americans will make up the majority of seniors, but among the young that drops to 48 per cent, with 64 per cent coming from minorities . During the next 50 years the number of Hispanic and Asian people will more than double, while the mixed race population will expand by more than three times, despite still making up the smallest single group. According to William Frey,  a researcher for Brookings, the new projections show a greater than expected increase in the Asian population, thanks in part to higher immigration, while the gain is slightly lower than expected for Hispanics, as the birth rate begins to decline. The black population will see only a modest increase between now and 2044, rising from 12.3 per cent according to the 2010 census, to 12.7 per cent according to this research. Guy Garcia, a spokesman for researchers Ethnifacts, told the Latin Post: 'Thirty percent all grandparents in America have a grandchild of a different race or ethnicity, and the diversity in this country is growing in so many ways, we are just starting to get a grasp on those changes. 'Gay parents, when they adopt, there is a high rate of multicultural adoptions. We have all these new variation and permutations of the American family. 'It’s going to continue to happen, and the highest growth is coming from people of color, but they are mixing and merging and having children with people of every race, and it is going to continue to be that way.'","Deaths to outnumber births in whites by 2025 leading to population drop .

"Now I know I ought to retain my grown-up poise and sophistication at all times, but IT'S CHRISTMAS! I get thoroughly over-excited as the festive season gets into full swing. I mean, all those pressies, parties and stolen kisses under the mistletoe - what's not to love? Christmas is also the perfect opportunity to go to town with glistening party make-up - my idea of heaven! Scroll down for video... Binky says that Christmas provides the perfect opportunity to go to town with glitzy party make-up . So this week I've created a sparkly Christmas party look with glitzy gold eyes and a festive red lip. It's a stunning party face, which is why just about every celebrity out there regularly works this look. And, hey, if it's good enough for Hollywood, it's definitely good enough for Chelsea! The Base . For this look you want a fresh, dewy base as the overall finish is glamorous and glistening. I used Clarins True Radiance Foundation, which you can apply with a brush or with your fingers. I love the healthy, radiant finish it gives the skin. I also applied a bit of BareMinerals Correcting Concealer under my eyes for a little extra coverage. It's easy to get a little tired during party season, which can lead to the odd blemish. This concealer gives full coverage without ever looking thick or caked. Now set everything in place with a dusting of translucent powder - I used DiorSkin Matte and Luminous Hydrating Loose Powder, which is super-lightweight and has tiny just a hint of shimmer to create a really glowing complexion. The Eyes . Start by taking BareMinerals Ready Eyeshadow Palette in The Soundtrack and sweeping the champagne shade all over your lids to act as a base colour. Now it’s time to get glitzy so blend BareMinerals High Shine Eye Colour in Glisten all over your eyelids. This is a really stunning sparkly gold shade - just perfect for party eyes - and it's richly pigmented, so a little goes a long way. However, you really want to pack on the colour for this nighttime look, so apply several shimmering layers. Sparkly eyeshadow and glitters can be messy to use, so I dab a little bit of the product onto the back of my hand then sweep it on with a fluffy brush. Binky suggests using a cream bronzer for a fresh-faced finish . A fine black eye liner goes beautifully with glitzy eye make-up like this and really makes the colour pop. I lined my upper lash line with the DHC Liquid Eyeliner, gently stretching my eyelid and applying the pen as close to my lash line as possible. The finish you're after is a neat, slim line rather than a thick 60s flick - keep it elegant. No party look is complete without lashings of mascara - I used Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara on my top and bottom lashes, wiggling the brush all the way up from the root to spearhead lashes and avoid clumping. Finally, fill in your brows with Clarins' Brow Palette. If you’re going for a bold lip, groomed brows are a must. The Cheeks . To go with the dewy base, I recommend a cream bronzer to achieve a fresh-faced finish. I used Body Bling Bronzing Cream, which gives a gorgeous shimmering sunkissed finish and is easy to apply – just dab it under your cheekbones and blend in your fingers. Next I added a touch of Body Bling Highlighting Cream along the tops of my cheekbones, giving them a glistening sheen which looks absolutely gorgeous after dark. Binky recommends using a lightweight powder to provide shimmer without make-up looking too caked on . The Lips . Now for the fabulous festive pout! Red lips are a party classic and always make me feel super sexy. I used Too Faced Melted Liquified Lipstick in Ruby, a deep crimson shade. For long-lasting lippy, apply a coat straight from the tube then blot with tissue before applying a second layer. You can get the products I used to create my festive party look on Escentual.com. Now where's that mistletoe? I'm ready for some Christmas kissing... Mwah, mwah! On another very exciting note, this week it was revealed that the hugely-hyped French Pharmacy favourite, La Roche-Posay Serozinc, is launching in the UK for the first time ever – exclusive to Escentual.com! The Serozinc spray-on toner is superb for improving oily and blemish-prone skin, and has received rave reviews from dermatologists, beauty journalists and bloggers worldwide. It’s released on January 1, but you can pre-order it on Escentual here from now! I’m going to be doing a full review of this skincare staple very soon, so keep your eyes peeled.

"A fraternity at the University of Pennsylvania has been accused of racism after including a black blow-up sex-doll in their annual Christmas card. The picture meant to send holiday greetings from the Phi Delta Theta fraternity sparked outrage when recipients spotted the black doll among the overwhelmingly white group of young men. The Phi Delta Theta fraternity has now been forced to apologise for the Christmas card, saying that there was 'no justification for this act of poor judgement'. Accused: The Phi Delta Theta fraternity at University of Pennsylvania have apologised for including a black blow-up sex doll in their annual Christmas card . The picture was posted on the Phi Delta Theta's Facebook and shows 29 young University of Pennsylvania students posing in what appears to be a lounge room. Among the young smiling men with their arms on each other's shoulders is a plastic blow-up sex doll. According to fraternity brothers, the doll was a 'Beyoncé sex toy' that had been bought as a 'gag gift' for Secret Santa, and had been included in the photograph with no intention of causing offense. Shortly after the picture was posted on Facebook, several organisations on and off campus, including the university’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, accused the fraternity of racism. The picture has now been removed from the fraternity's page and all activities have been suspended while Phi Delta Theta's parent organisation investigates the incident. Apology: The fraternity said the doll had been included as a joke with no intention of causing offense . Bow down: The fraternity claim the plastic toy was a 'Beyoncé sex doll', but that the doll 'bore no resemblance to the artist beyond skin color adding to its offensive nature' Several organisations on University of Pennsylvania's campus, including the university’s chapter of the NAACP, accused the fraternity of racism . The fraternity has issued an apology, admitting that Beyoncé sex toy was 'distasteful' and that 'once removed from the packaging, it bore no semblance to the artist beyond skin color adding to its offensive nature,' The Daily Pennsylvanian reports. Phi Delta Theta added that 'the absence of racial motivation is no justification for this act of poor judgement and the decision not to include a sex toy in a holiday picture should have been an easy one.' 'We are deeply concerned by this image,' Phi Delta Theta International Fraternity VP Sean Wagner told The Daily Pennsylvanian. 'Phi Delta Theta is a values-based organization and the lack of judgment associated with this image indicates a disconnect from those same values.' This is the latest racist controversy surrounding sororities and fraternities at American universities. Last week, a sorority girl at the University of Maryland posed for a photograph with a racist birthday cake made of alcohol bottles that reads, 's*** a n**** d***' on her 21st birthday. The photo from Delta Gamma Sorority was posted online to Instagram along with an offensive hashtag comment that featured the 'n-word.' Delta Gamma posted a grovelling apology on their Facebook page, saying the sorority 'is a dynamic organization committed to diversity and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religious affiliation, color, creed, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status or physical disability.'","Fraternity Christmas card included black blow-up doll 'as a joke'

"While the festive season is the time for giving, with donations of food, toys and money flowing in to charities, one widower's gift has topped them all. One Massachusetts woman donated her diamond engagement ring and wedding band, along with a note valuing them at $1,850, saying she hoped the money would pay for children's toys. And now a buyer has snapped the pair up for $21,000, adding that she wants to return the jewellery to its rightful owner. A widow donated her diamond engagement ring to the Salvation Army along with note valuing the pair at $1,850 and explaining that the gift was in memory of her generous late husband . The heartwarming story began on Monday last week as volunteers at the Salvation Army in Massachusetts emptied their red donation kettles. Inside one, workers found the two rings in a zip-lock bag, along with a note explaining that the donor's late husband enjoyed giving at Christmas time, and she was donating them in his memory. The note read: 'I've dropped my wedding ring in your Red Kettle knowing that the money from its sale will buy toys for needy children. 'To honor his memory, I donate this ring. I'm hoping there's someone out there who made lots of money this year and will buy the ring for ten times its worth. 'After all, there's no price on love or the sentimental value of this ring. But money will help the kids. May everyone have a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!' And on Friday the Salvation Army received an offer of $21,000 from another widow, who did not want to be identified. The benefactor, a former bell-ringer with the charity, said: 'I want to be involved in this because it's about the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of giving. The rings have now been bought for $21,000 by another widower, who did not want to be named, who said her aim is to return the jewellery to its rightful owner . 'My wish is that the rings can be returned to this woman who gave them up in memory of her husband for the sake of children at Christmas.' However this may prove a difficult ambition to fulfill, as nobody - including the Salvation Army - knows who the mystery donor was. Her offer was the largest of nine received by the charity in just a week, all of which were for more than the rings' valuation price. Major David B. Davis, head of the Massachusetts Salvation Army, said: 'We're so moved and incredibly grateful to the generous individual who made such a loving and kind donation. 'This heartwarming gift boosts all of our staff, bell-ringers, and volunteers who are working tirelessly during the Red Kettle Campaign to encourage donations that help those in need.' The Salvation Army has set a statewide Red Kettle campaign goal of $3.36 million this year to support individuals and families throughout the Commonwealth. The Red Kettle tradition began in 1891 when Salvation Army Captain Joseph McFee wanted to help feed needy citizens in San Francisco. McFee remembered the ferry landings in Liverpool England, where people would sit with small kettles that travelers would toss spare change into to help the less fortunate. Placing his own kettle on Market Street in Oakland California, McFee was able to help needy individuals on Christmas.","Volunteers found jewellery in donation kettle along with valuation note .

"The wife of the Sydney terror siege gunman posted a series of hate-filled videos in which she described herself as a terrorist and expressed happiness at the 9/11 and 2002 Bali terror attacks and the Holocaust. Amirah Droudis, 35, appeared in public Tuesday just hours after her partner Man Haron Monis was shot dead by police to end a 17-hour siege in which he held a score of hostages at a central Sydney cafe. Two of the captives also died. Droudis reported to Campsie Police Station in southwestern Sydney, as required under conditions of her bail for the alleged murder of Monis' ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed multiple times and set alight in April 2013. Monis was also charged in connection to the murder. Scroll down for video . Amirah Droudis reported to a police station in southwestern Sydney on Tuesday, just hours after the siege involving her husband Man Haron Monis ended with two hostages and the gunman dead . Droudis, who attended the police with an unidentified child, is free on bail on charges of murdering Monis' ex-wife in 2013. Monis was charged with being an accessory in the killing . Four years before the killing, a woman believed to be Droudis posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis' web site. 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab. In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Al Qaeda-linked Bali bombings as 'acts of God.' 'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.' In another online video, the appeared to condone rape, saying 'It is not fair if we condemn the rapist without condemning the one who has encouraged the rape.' Droudis' brother John Aspros confirmed to Daily Mail Australia today that she and Monis were married. Daily Mail Australia understands Droudis, from a Greek family in Belmore, in south-western Sydney, changed her name from Anastasia to Amirah after meeting Monis. The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. However, at around the same time Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan. The relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted in that case and sentenced to community service. In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involved seven women he allegedly lured by posing as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case. Monis' first wife was found stabbed 18 times and with her body set alight in the stairwell of her apartment building in April 2013. Droudis was charged with her murder and Monis  was charged with accessory before and after the fact. Both told a court they denied the allegations. Monis was initially remanded in custody, but in December 2013 he applied for bail and was released. In April this year, Monis was charged with sexual assault and again was granted bail. At a court appearance in October in the sexual assault case, 40 more charges were laid against Monis, and again he was released on bail. In May this year, the New South Wales state government introduced changes to bail laws that removed long-standings provisions that meant bail was denied in cases involving serious cries such as murder and manslaughter. 'I am a terrorist': A woman believed to Amirah Droudis posted a series of videos in 2009 in which she described herself as a terrorist and said acts of terrorism including the 9/11 attacks and the Bali bombings, as well as the Holocaust, were acts of God . The videos included links to the web site of Man Haron Monis, a self-described sheik, and included text identifying the speaker as 'Sister Amirah' Under the new laws, judges were required to assess whether a suspect posed an 'unacceptable risk' of reoffending. Monis and Droudis were granted bail under the new laws by Magistrate Joan Baptie, on conditions including that they report regularly to police, surrender their passports and stay away from prosecution witnesses, the Herald reported. Monis was ordered to pay a $10,000 surety, and Droudis $100,000. Noleen Hayson Pal, siege gunman Man Haron Monis' first wife, was found stabbed to death and her body burned in April 2013. Droudis was charged with murder and Monis with being an assessory in Pal's killing, and both were released on bail . That Monis was free on bail and able to get a firearm, storm the Lindt cafe in central Sydney and take 17 people hostage in Monday's dramatic siege has triggered outrage. New South Wales Attorney General Brad Hazzard conceded on Tuesday that Monis fell through the cracks of the legal system and said the government had already moved to toughen the bail laws. 'We are asking state agencies and federal agencies to look very closely at how this offender slipped through the cracks,' Mr Hazzard told reporters. 'How did this offender not come to the attention of state and federal agencies for more urgent action.' Droudis attended Campsie Police Station in Sydney's southwest dressed in a knitted hat and dark sunglasses, and ignored media requests to answer questions . He said changes to bail laws due to come into effect at the end of January would have made it 'very unlikely' Monis would have been released. Family members of Ms Pal were today outraged by Monis' freedom. Pal's so-called 'god brother' reportedly posted a series of raging comments about the matter to Facebook. 'Thats systems tree f***ed up but I'm still happy he.died... F***n lucky tey got u before we did now. rest in hell f***n asshole.' A police spokesman refused to comment on Droudis's visit to the police station. She refused to speak to Daily Mail Australia, slamming the door of her vehicle shut without responding to questions. A Change.org petition started after the siege ended demanding the bail laws be tightened drew thousands of supporters within a few hours. Police on Tuesday raided the Droudis family home in Belmore and carted away paper bags and containers of what is believed could be evidence related to Monis activities leading up the siege. Police would only say the Critical Incident Unit was executing a search warrant. Police raid the home in Belmore, in Western Sydney, where Man Haron Monis was thought to be living .

'No . longer is comedy going to be a covert assault on traditional American . values, conservatism. Now it's just wide out in the open,' Limbaugh . said. 'What this hire means is a redefinition of what is funny, and a redefinition of what is comedy. 'There's no unity in this hire. They hired a partisan, so-called comedian, to run a comedy show.' This is far from the first time that Colbert has sparked ire from conservative critics. Switching seats: Colbert said that he will not be playing the satirical version of himself that he plays on his Comedy Central show when he takes over David Letterman's post . The South Carolina native was hired to do the roast at the White House Correspondent's dinner in 2006 while President Bush was in office, and because he went in character, it turned into a seething parody of the administration. Shortly after CBS made the announcement, Colbert clarified that the will not be carrying the satirical character over to this late night gig. 'I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it,' Colbert said Thursday. Stephen on Stephen: Colbert, in character, commented on the news about Letterman's retirement but did not break character, so he did not acknowledge that he would be the one to replace him . By contrast, he also addressed the news on his show, as his character. 'I am going to miss this old man,' Colbert said while pointing to a picture of Letterman. 'Late Night debuted my first year in college. I learned more from watching Dave than I did from going to my classes, especially the ones that I did not go to because I had stayed up until 1:30 watching Dave. 'I do not envy whoever they try to put in that chair- those are some huge shoes to fill, and some really big pants,' he said, making a reference to Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants.","The Republican radio host slammed the choice of Stephen Colbert as David Letterman's replacement as 'partisan'

"Court documents show that the dead gunman behind the siege of a Sydney cafe was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. Man Haron Monis painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege. The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. Scroll down for video . Man Haron Monis outside court after he was charged with sending poison pen letters to the families of Australian soliders . Sheikh Man Haron Monis, 50, killed two hostages and was shot dead during a siege in central Sydney . Monis, whose name is recorded in the documents as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year. Further documents allege that he threatened to shoot Noleen Hayson Pal at Minchinbrook McDonalds in western Sydney almost two years before she was murdered. According to an interview conducted at St Marys Police Station on July 27, 2011, Monis threatened Ms Pal after they split up. Ms Pal, who told police she was afraid of Monis, had met him at the McDonald's a week earlier. Monis is pictured here  outside the Downing Centre Court, Sydney, on February 10, 2010 .

Droudis attended Campsie Police Station in Sydney's southwest on Tuesday dressed in dark sunglasses . Monis also told constables Mina Matta and Matthew Gillett that he was a former 'security officer in Australia' and that he had previously held a firearm licence and and gone target shooting. Monis former lawyer Manny Conditsis, told the Daily Mail Australia: ‘I thought before anyone contacted me that it might have been him only because of his extreme ideologue views and knowing he had been out on bail out for a long time and facing a long prison sentence. ‘Putting all of that together it occurred to me that he might have been it might have been the straw that tipped the camel's back - the combination of all those things together. With a nothing to lose attitude.’ His mental state appeared to be fragile enough to have been discussed by Australian and Iranian officials, with talks taking place several times before the siege in Sydney according to Iran's foreign ministry. Meanwhile, Iran's Fars news agency reported that Australia had denied an attempt to extradite Monis to Iran, where he had been indicted for fraud. The 50-year-old committed sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between 2001 and this year, court documents say . Noleen Hayson Pal, siege gunman Man Haron Monis' defacto wife was found stabbed to death and her body burned in April 2013. Droudis was charged with murder and Monis with being an assessory in the killing of Pal (pictured), and both were released on bail . A woman believed to Amirah Droudis posted a series of videos in 2009. The videos included links to the web site of  Monis, and included text identifying the speaker as 'Sister Amirah' Australian security agencies didn't appear to be watching him closely at the time of the siege, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott saying after the tragedy that Monis wasn't believed to be on the national security watchlist. Ms Pal, who became Monis's de facto wife around nine years before she was murdered, died in a brutal killing on the afternoon of Sunday, April 21 when she was set upon, stabbed 18 times, doused with accelerant and then set alight. It was not until seven months later, in October 2013, that police arrested and charged Monis' s girlfriend, Amirah Droudis with murder and charged Monis with accessory to murder before and after the fact. Police opposed bail, and he was taken into custody where he complained that he was 'tortured' and had 'excrement' thrown on him. Last December he was released on bail by Magistrate William Pierce, who made the decision after he had been held in custody for up to six weeks on charges of being an accessory before and after the fact of his ex-wife's murder. In April this year he was charged with sexual assault and granted bail. A $1000 surety was paid by an elderly relative of Ms Droudis, believed to be her mother. A further 40 sexual assault charges were laid against Monis on October 10, but he was still allowed out on bail.

Monis' bail conditions included not going within 500 metres of an airport, not approaching witnesses or victims, reporting every day to Campsie Police Station and surrendering his passport. In 2011, charges against Monis of stalking or intimidating his wife Ms Pal were dropped. Asked about the threat to shoot Ms Pal he said 'I didn't threaten her' However, Monis was a domineering partner who forced Ms Pal to wear a hijab, restricted her contact with anyone outside her immediate family and beat her, according to The Daily Telegraph. Monis took around 17 people hostage in a Sydney cafe on Monday, resulting in a prolonged stand-off with police and the tragic death of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson.","The gunman behind the Sydney cafe siege was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, according to court documents .

"Samuel Taylor, pictured, was confronted by a Police officer who drew his firearm after he was stopped for speeding to get home to his pregnant wife . A man was held at gunpoint by a police officer after he was caught speeding on his way home to see his heavily pregnant wife, who was going into labor. Samuel Taylor of Cleveland Heights in Ohio was approaching his home when he was spotted travelling at 38mph in a 25mph zone. Police officer William Robinson gave chase as Mr Taylor turned into his street and pulled over. Mr Taylor told Cleveland.com: 'I was literally about six or seven houses from my home. I froze. I did not know what to do or where to stop. I was afraid. Please let me go inside. You can follow me; just holster your weapon.' According to Mr Taylor, Officer Robinson was far too aggressive during the traffic stop and should not have pulled his gun. Taylor – who admits that he was speeding – said he believes the officer was too aggressive by pulling out his gun. Cleveland Heights City Manager Tanisha Briley defended Officer Taylor: She said: 'We're aware of the incident and complaint by the driver and the matter is currently under review. 'Upon initial review we are comfortable that the officer followed CHPD protocol appropriately and he conducted himself in a professional manner.' However, Mr Taylor said he is considering taking a civil suit against the Cleveland Heights Police Department. He said that while he had been speeding and should have pulled in earlier. Mr Taylor's wife Katie was taken to hospital where she is being treated for complications related to her pregnancy. Several US police forces are currently under pressure after officers killed a number of men including Michael Brown in St Louis and Eric Garner from Staten Island. The US State Department has already heavily criticised Cleveland Police in a report which claims that its officers are too quick to draw their firearms.

"The tragic death of one of the world's best loved comedians and actors saw Robin Williams become the top trending search term on Google in 2014. Williams topped Google's list of 2014's fastest-rising search requests both in the U.S. and around the world. Robin Williams, who died in August aged 63, was followed by global events such as the World Cup in July, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the rise of violent islamist group ISIS in the middle east. Scroll down for video . Still number one: Following the death of Robin Williams, his name became the top search trend on Google, both global and in the U.S. The list of top trending Google search terms is dominated by tragedies, with millions also looking for information on the two Malaysia Airlines tragedies, the armed conflict in Ukraine and the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. On a positive note, the second 'top trending' term in the U.S. and globally was the World Cup, which took place in July, addictive app-game Flappy Bird came in as number five, and Disney's 2013 hit film Frozen still reigns supreme this year on number nine. 'The passing of beloved comedian and actor Robin Williams shook the world, bringing many people online to search for more information and to remember, and putting Williams in the #1 spot on our global trends charts,' Google's vice president of search, Amit Singhal said in a blog post. 1. Robin Williams . 2. World Cup . 3. Ebola . 4. Malaysia Airlines . 5. Flappy Bird . 6. ALS Ice Bucket Challenge . 7. ISIS . 8. Ferguson . 9. Frozen . 10. Ukraine . 'There was even an uptick in searches related to depression tests and mental health in the days following his death.' 'It was a year in which we were struck by the death of a beloved comedian, and watched news unfold about a horrific plane crash and a terrifying disease,' Singhal said. 'We were captivated by sporting events, and had our fun with birds, a bucket of ice and a frozen princess.' Williams, Ebola, the World Cup and the Ice Bucket also ranked among the most-discussed subjects this year on Facebook, which released its list last week. Google released its list Tuesday. Williams' death drove many people to reminisce about his career highlights. Not quite number one: Germany holds the trophy high after winning the World Cup, which came second in U.S. and global top trending Google search terms . Horror: The most recent outbreak of Ebola saw Google searches about the illness go through the roof . For good: Two men take part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee this year, a topic which trended both on Google and Facebook . In the first few days after Robin Williams'  suicide, there was a six-fold increase in the number of Google searches for 'carpe diem' - a Latin phrase for 'seize the day' that Williams popularized in the film 'Dead Poets Society.' Reports about Williams' long-running battle with depression caused searches for that term to triple. There was also a flurry of searches about his movies (the top five were: 'Mrs. Doubtfire,' ''Dead Poets Society,' ''Good Will Hunting,' ''Jumanji' and 'Patch Adams.') Google's worldwide list of the year's hottest search requests mirrored the activity in the U.S. with a few exceptions. Wurst didn't make the Top 10 list in the U.S., nor did the Winter Olympics. Google's review follows annual roundups compiled during the previous two weeks by its main search rivals. Although Google's list usually comes last each year, its rankings typically provide more telling insights into what people were thinking because the company's technology processes about two out of every three search requests made on the Internet. Together for Ferguson: The fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson put the small Missouri town on the world map, and on Google . Can't let it go: Disney's 2013 film Frozen is as popular as ever, and has been googled frequently this year . Yahoo's search lists indicated that its websites tend to attract entertainment-minded people. 1. Robin Williams . 2. World Cup . 3. Ebola . 4. Malaysia Airlines . 5. ALS Ice Bucket Challenge . 6. Flappy Bird . 7. Conchita Wurst . 8. ISIS . 9. Frozen . 10. Sochi Olympics . While Ebola topped Yahoo's rankings for 2014, celebrities or entertainers occupied six of the other slots. They were singer Ariana Grande (No. 3), actress Jennifer Lawrence (No. 4), actress Kaley Cuoco (No. 5), reality TV star Kim Kardashian (No. 6), singer Miley Cyrus (No. 8) and actress Jennifer Aniston (No. 10). Yahoo's list was rounded out by: the video game 'Minecraft,' whose popularity prompted Microsoft to buy it for $2.5 billion earlier this year; 'Frozen' and Apple's latest gadget, the iPhone 6. Instead of doing a wide-ranging compilation of top searches, Microsoft's Bing separated its lists into disparate categories, such as athletes (NBA star LeBron James soared the highest), celebrities (Kardashian reigned), vacation destinations (Costa Rica) and musicians (Beyonce).","Top trending U.S. Google searches for 2014 revealed .

"If stereotypes  are to be believed, girls like their role models soft and gentle while boys value strength and determination. But these conventions are being challenged by new research as the girls of today prove that they aren't quite as predictable as we might assume them to be. A recent poll shows that strong, smart and gutsy characters are the role models of choice for today's 8-14-year-old girls. When asked to pick who they would most like to be  from a list of well-known characters, feisty Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games and Harry Potter's clever Hermione Granger topped the list (25 per cent and 22 per cent). Scroll down for video . When 8-14-year-old girls were asked to pick who they would most like to be from a list of well-known characters, Katniss Everdeen from Hunger Games topped the list with 25 per cent . Harry Potter's Hermione Granger, played by Emma Watson, was the second most popular role model, which illustrates that today's girls value intellect and determination . At 10 per cent and nine per cent, Matilda and Tinkerbell were less than half as popular in third and fourth place. The survey of 1,070 girls aged 8-14 was published today by The Pineapple Lounge, the UK's fastest growing children's research and consulting firm. Founder of The Pineapple Lounge, Emma Worrollo says: 'These results clearly show that today's young girls are inspired by strong, sassy and courageous women.' 'Superheroes are no longer just for boys – girls too are turning to fantasy characters who accomplish amazing and daring physical and mental feats as their role models.' When asked which celebrities they admire, 40 per cent chose gold-medal-winning Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis . The Duchess of Cambridge, known for her beauty but also her charity work (seen right meeting a sick young girl in Canada), came second in a list of celebrities that girls want to emulate . Today's 8-14-year-old girls prefer the fierce determination and survivalist instincts of characters like Katniss and Hermione Granger. 'This Christmas, parents may find themselves going beyond the traditional 'girly' requests for presents and searching instead for dynamic gifts like Goldie Blox, Nerf Rebelle, Kindle, Xbox Kinect and Zoella's first novel, Girl Online, that make their young daughters feel smart, empowered and help them build skills for life,' adds Worrollo. Girls were also asked which celebrities they would most want to emulate. Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis topped the bill at 40 per cent followed by Kate Middleton at 32 per cent. At 10 per cent and nine per cent, Matilda (left) and Tinkerbell (right) were less than half as popular in third and fourth place as winners Katniss and Hermione . More predictably, pop-stars Ariana Grande and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini were in third and fourth place at 23 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. Reflecting on what the results say about what matters to girls today, Worrollo concluded: 'While Katniss is noted for her physical strength and independence, Hermione's asset is her intellect – and it's hugely encouraging to see today's young girls aspiring to these qualities. 'One trait common to both fantasy characters is a strong sense of loyalty and duty, an attribute which is also associated with both Ennis and Middleton. 'This common theme suggests that today's little girls expect their role models to have both style and substance by the bucket load.'","Of girls 8-14, 25% chose Katniss and 22%, Hermione as top role model .

"Bill Clinton has waded into the controversy over the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York, saying that the unarmed black man 'didn't deserve to die'. The former President said that there is a 'divide that exists between the people and the police' which needs addressing. Tapping into the racial tensions around Garner's death, he added that people have 'preconceptions wired into us and we have got to get beyond them.' Scroll down for video . Bill Clinton has spoken for the first time over Eric Garner's death, saying the father 'didn't deserve to die' for illegally selling cigarettes, adding that people 'have got to get beyond' their preconceptions . Speaking to news site Fusion, Clinton said: '[Garner] was obviously not well, he was overweight and vulnerable therefore had heart and lung problems. 'He was doing something he should not have been doing. That was illegal. He was selling untaxed cigarettes on the street in small volumes, trying to make a little extra money. 'But he didn't deserve to die because of that.' Garner was filmed being put into a chokehold by police in New York while saying 'I can't breathe' before suffering a cardiac arrest . Eric Garner died while being arrested in Staten Island in July. Mobile phone footage of the arrest shows officer Daniel Pantaleo apparently putting Garner in a chokehold while Garner says 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.' Garner then went into cardiac arrest and was taken to Richmond University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Garner's death, and the recent decision by a Grand Jury not to indict officer Pantaleo, have sparked months of protests across the globe. The issue has sharply divided America, with police forces springing to the defence of their own, while celebrity figures such as Oprah Winfrey have described the events as a 'wake up call'. Sports stars such as LeBron James and Kobe Bryant also courted controversy when they warmed up wearing sweater which read 'I can't breathe' in support of Garner. Clinton's support for Garner, the first time he has spoken publicly about the death, follows similar remarks from wife Hillary, widely believed to be lining herself up for a 2016 Presidential nomination. At the start of this month she said she was glad the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the death of Garner, and praised the federal probe into the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson. Speaking at the Massachusetts Conference for Women, she said: 'Our hearts are breaking, and we are asking ourselves: ""Aren't these our sons, aren't these our brothers?""

'Despite all the progress that we have made together, African-Americans, particularly African-American men, are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with a crime, and serve longer prison terms.

"Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages - scattering the creatures and inciting panic . Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies. Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages, which explode on impact - scattering the scorpions and causing panic among the innocent local population. Although scorpion bombs sound like something out of a modern horror movie, the tactic is actually thousands of years old and was first used by Iraqis fighting against the Roman Empire. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, told The Mirror that ISIS had improvised devices to launch the poisonous creatures in 2ft bombs. He said: 'Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around. 'Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.' Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he was advising security forces, said that the bombs are not causing casualties but had a profound 'psychological impact'. The bizarre biological weapon was used as far back as 198 AD, when Iraqis stuffed live scorpions into ceramic pots and hurled them at Roman armies marching on the fortress city of Hatra. The Parthian city was held under siege for 20 days by Emperor Septimius Severus before the Roman military were driven out by the 'live grenades'. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies . Adrienne Mayor, a historian of ancient science and classical folklorist, researched the weapon in detail for her 2004 book Greek Fire, Poison Arrows & Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World. The live grenades were first used by Iraqis in the besieged city of Hatra in 198-199AD. Soldiers would pack ceramic pots full of live scorpions which they would then hurl at the Romans led by Emperor Septimius Severus. It is thought that they would first spit on the scorpions to slow them down so they could be handled - although it was still an incredibly risking tactic. The biological weapon has been credited with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city. She describes how soldiers would spit on the end of the scorpion to calm the creatures before they were packed into pots, which were flung at the besieging Romans. 'It was the brute effectiveness of Hatra's defensive biological and chemical weapons that overcame Roman morale, manpower and siege machines,' she writes. 'The terror effect would be quite impressive.' Last week, the U.S. confirmed it had launched a further 20 airstrikes against ISIS targets, including raids near Sinjar, Qaim, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as inside Kobane. ISIS militants have been attacking the Iraqi town of Kobane since mid-September, when the terror group assaulted its southern suburbs in an attempt to seize control of the strategic border city. The terror group quickly encircled the city, raping and murdering its inhabitants, but Kurdish YPG fighters supported by U.S. airstrikes have since pushed ISIS back out of central Kobane.

"Arrested: Lindsey Blansett has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of her son Caleb . A mother stabbed her 10-year-old son in the chest and beat him to death with a rock while he was in bed because she thought he 'would be better off in heaven', police have said. Officers were called to Lindsey Nicole Blansett's home in Wellington, Kansas around 11.45pm on Sunday and when they arrived, her son Caleb was dead. She was taken into custody. Police believe the 33-year-old mother attacked her son because she thought his life would be full of suffering, the Wellington Daily News reported. She 'decided the boy would be better off in heaven than to face the world’s problems', according to a criminal complaint in Sumner County. So after her son went to bed, she grabbed a knife and a rock and attacked him with both, killing him. An autopsy to determine his exact cause of death is underway. Caleb's nine-year-old sister was also in the home at the time he was killed but she was unharmed and is now with other relatives. Blansett has been booked into the Sumner County Jail and has been charged with first-degree murder. Authorities say she unlawfully, intentionally and with premeditation killed her son. She remains in jail on $500,000 bond and has an appearance scheduled in Sumner County District Court on Thursday, KAKE reported. Scene: Her son was in bed on Sunday night when she allegedly stabbed him in the chest and beat him with a rock. Police say she thought his life would be full of suffering and wanted to save him . If convicted of first-degree murder, she faces life in prison. Wellington Police Chief Tracy Heath said he was not aware of drugs being involved in the incident, and said are no other suspects. Grief counselors and crisis professionals are on hand at Lincoln Elementary School, where the 10-year-old was in the fourth grade. Neighbors expressed their shock, saying they never saw any signs of abuse in the home. 'Me and her talked, she was a nice lady,' neighbor Shae Hutton told KWCH. 'She didn't seem like she was capable of killing her own son.' Friend Kayle Black, whose children played with Blansett's, added: 'He is only ten-years old, he was just a kid. As parents we are suppose to be their protectors.'","Lindsey Blansett 'stabbed her son Caleb in the chest and beat him with a rock after he went to bed at their Kansas home on Sunday night'
