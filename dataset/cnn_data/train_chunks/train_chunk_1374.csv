"Extreme gene manipulation has been used to modify bacteria that die if they get out of human control. Instead of using traditional genetic engineering - which moves a gene from one organism to another - scientists have rewritten the language of genetics. The breakthrough is a potential step toward better management of genetically engineered organisms, including crops. Extreme gene manipulation tools have been used to modify bacteria that die if they get out of human control . Genetically altered microbes are used now in industry to produce fuels, medicines and other chemicals. The new technique might also reduce the risk of using them outdoors, such as for cleaning up toxic spills. Scientists from Harvard and Yale introduced the new approach in two papers released this week by the journal Nature. They modified the DNA of the bacterium e. coli so that it can't survive without particular amino acids - the building blocks of proteins. Instead of using traditional genetic engineering, which moves a gene from one organism to another, scientists have rewritten the language of genetics. The breakthrough is a potential step toward better management of genetically engineered organisms — perhaps including crops . Those amino acids are not found in nature, only in the lab. So if such a modified organism gets away from where humans supply the stuff, it will die. Both teams built on a technique reported in October 2013, when scientists successfully recoded the genome by making  widespread changes to the DNA of bacteria. That left the organisms’ ability to work intact but made them more resistant to viruses. In the study, they began with such a recoded bacteria and decided to give it a weakness. They made it dependent on a synthetic amino acid, not found in nature, that would have to be provided by researchers. If scientists stop supplying a particular unnatural amino acid synthesised in the laboratory, the bacteria died. The group grew a total of 1 trillion E. coli cells from various experiments, and after two weeks none had escaped. During a press conference, Ferren Isaacs of Yale and George Church of Harvard said they believed it would be possible, although challenging, to extend their technique to genetically modified crops. That could ease concerns about their spreading outside their designated fields. And experts not connected with the work said they were impressed. The papers 'point the way towards putting (genetically modified organisms) on a very tight leash, one that is meant to be unbreakable,' Richard Lenski of Michigan State University, said in an email. Karmella Haynes, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and synthetic biology at Arizona State University, called the bacteria work 'a significant advance.' She said it would be difficult to make it work with the more complex genetic machinery of crop plants. Rina Singh, senior director for policy of the Biotechnology Industry Organisation, said the work is 'extremely useful...This is some really good stuff.' While scientists have previously used 'suicide genes' to control microbes, the new approach might be easier, she said.","The breakthrough was achieved by Harvard and Yale universities .

"Hope Solo has been suspended from the U.S. women's national soccer team for 30 days after an incident at training camp. Solo won't participate in matches next month in Europe. U.S. Soccer did not specify the reason for the suspension, which was announced last night. Solo's suspension comes just days after her husband, former NFL star Jerramy Stevens, 36, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Scroll down for video . Hope Solo has been suspended from the U.S. women's national team for 30 days. Solo pictured in a Washington state court in November with husband Jerramy Stevens . The reason for the suspension, announced on Wednesday night, was not specified but comes after an incident at training camp . Solo, 33, was in the car when former Seattle Seahawks tight end Stevens was pulled over in Manhattan Beach, California, at about 1.30am on Monday for driving without headlights. TMZ reported that Solo was nearly arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop. The goalkeeper was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June. Coach Jill Ellis said in a statement: 'During our current national team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,' 'We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.' The goalkeeper has been dismissed from training camp in Southern California, where the team is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June . Hope Solo was in the car when her husband Jerramy Stevens, pictured together in 2013, was arrested for drunk driving . Solo, who has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. team, was released from camp. In a statement, she told the Associated Press: 'I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me. 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.' Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California . Domestic violence charges against Solo were dismissed after she was arrested for assaulting her nephew and her sister during an allegedly drunken brawl. The charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington last June. Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case, and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial. Her last appearance with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. Last September, in an exhibition victory over Mexico, Solo logged her 72nd shutout, passing Briana Scurry (1994-2008) on national team's career list. The suspension comes at a critical time for the U.S. team. Following the exhibition matches in February, the team will play in the Algarve Cup in March. The team will open World Cup play on June 8 against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba. An expanded field of 24 teams will compete in the World Cup, which will be played in six Canadian cities. The United States is in Group D, which also includes Sweden and Nigeria. The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title but first since 1991. Solo will be eligible for reinstatement after the suspension, pending review and approval by U.S. Soccer and Ellis, U.S. Soccer said.","Reason was not revealed but follows incident at a training camp .

"Boris Johnson has bowed to pressure from America and paid a US tax bill which he previously rejected as 'absolutely outrageous'. The American-born London Mayor had been furious that he was being chased by the US taxman for an unpaid bill worth thousands of dollars. But after being urged by the US ambassador to pay his dues, Mr Johnson has now settled his bill. After being urged by the US ambassador to pay his dues, the London Mayor has now settled the demand from the IRS for profits made on the sale of a house. Mr Johnson was born in New York and has an American passport as well as a British one. The law means that American citizens must pay income tax to US authorities if they earn more than £62,000. The can also be taxed on capital gains on selling a main house made anywhere in the world. Rejecting the demands, Mr Johnson recently said: 'I think it's outrageous! No is the answer. Why should I?' The demand came from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in relation to the profit he made on the sale of a home in north London. Last month Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador in London, defended the rules, insisting any US citizen had to pay the tax that is due. He added: 'Look, I mean we have our rules and we expect people to play by them. 'And if you get the benefits of being an American citizen you pay your fair share in taxes.' Now it has emerged that Mr Johnson has settled the bill, said to be much less than the £100,000 rumoured last year. A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: 'The Mayor won't be saying anything more on the subject. The matter has been dealt with.' Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador in London, defended the rules, insisting any US citizen had to pay the tax that is due . Mr Johnson has previously said he would like to renounce his US citizenship. The IRS rules state: 'If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad. 'Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.' Mr Johnson used the row to demand the US Embassy in London to pay the congestion charge. Latest figures suggest Mr Barzun's embassy owes more than £8million for driving officials and dignitaries around London. But Mr Barzun has made clear he will continue to refuse to pay up, citing rules which allow embassies to avoid paying tax which would affect business operating in host countries.","Boris Johnson was born in New York so faced a tax bill in America .

"Australia could face some of its hottest temperatures in more than 17 years in the next few days as a number of remote areas brace themselves for the mercury to hit 50 degrees. Two West Australian towns broke their records for the hottest January day on Wednesday, with Bulga Downs recording a temperature of 48 degrees and Carnarvon 47.9 degrees, but Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson Neil Bennett said the worst was yet to come. 'Chances are that some areas in Pilbara will see temperatures of around 49 and possibly hitting 50,' Mr Bennett told Daily Mail Australia. An ongoing heatwave in West Australia could see temperatures reach 50 degrees in some remote areas . There has only been three occasions when Australia saw days of 50 degrees or hotter, the most recent being in WA in 1998 and the other two occasions dating back to January and February in 1960 at Oodnadatta Airport in South Australia . 'It only needs just a slight change of wind speed for a short period around 2pm and then you won't get the temperatures you thought and they will be a degree or half a degree out,' Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson Neil Bennett said . 'A lot of temperature records could be broken on Friday; that's the day when the peak of the heat could occur and there's a possibility these places could hit 50 degrees.' Mr Bennet explained that the extreme, dangerous temperatures were being caused by a huge un-moving hot air mass located above the state. 'There's a large pool of hot air sitting over the Pilbara region moving ever so slowly. It's just going around and around in an anticlockwise direction instead of heading north, east, south or west,' he said. 'We do get these occurring occasionally, but this time what we're seeing is temperatures getting to record levels in some areas. Marble Bar is one of them and Newman is another that could be at risk.' 'Perth has also now had 55 consecutive days of no rainfall, that's not a record (the longest is 83 days), but it is a long dry spell.' The Bureau of Meteorology warns that the towns of Marble Bar (pictured) and Newman in West Australia, could face 50 degree temperatures on Friday . Pictured in front of an outdoor thermometer with his staff on Thursday, owner of the Iron Clad Hotel at Marble Bar, Thomas Fox (right) ,said the locals were entirely unconcerned about the potentially record-breaking prediction . Marble Bar was forecast to reach 48 degrees on Thursday, but if temperatures soar higher as the week progresses, the town could beat the state's all time temperature record of 50.5 degrees that was recorded in Mardie on February 1998. There has only been three occasions when Australia saw days of 50 degrees or hotter, the most recent being the aforementioned date in WA, and the other two dating back to January and February in 1960 at Oodnadatta Airport in South Australia. 'So if we're predicting 50 degrees or more for certain areas, that's a pretty significant deal,' Mr Bennett said. Owner of the Iron Clad Hotel at Marble Bar, Thomas Fox, told Daily Mail Australia that the locals were entirely unconcerned about the ongoing heat. 'It's pretty normal, it always gets hot out here,' Mr Fox told Daily Mail Australia when asked if he was worried about the possibility of a 50 degree day. 'When it goes from 47 degrees down to 45 down here, it feels like the sea breeze is coming in!' Mr Fox said . Marble Bar, which has a population of under 200 according to the 2006 Census, is known as 'Australia's hottest town' 'The world just kicks along, you just don't plan to dig holes. 'There's a lot of difference between 45 and 47 [degrees] – anything above 46 and you can see that things become a lot more critical. 'At 45 you can walk around. If you have to go for a long walk you can with a water bottle, but if it hits 47 you think 's***' and just pack up. 'When it goes from 47 down to 45 down here, it feels like the sea breeze is coming in!' A spokesman from Marble Bar's Nursing Post repeated the sentiment, telling Daily Mail Australia: 'I don't get any extra work because of that'. 'They [the locals] are used to 45 [degrees], so 48 or 49 is not that different. It's just something new to talk about but it's no big deal.' The heat wave in WA is being caused by a slow-moving, large pool of hot air sitting over the Pilbara region . Mr Bennett said that while high temperatures were anticipated to continue in the region for the next few days, they could still just miss the 50 degree mark. 'It only needs just a slight change of wind speed for a short period around 2pm when we get maximum temperatures and then you won't get the temperatures you thought and they will be a degree or half a degree out,' he said. 'But we do expect it to remain in the high 40s.' 'We are expecting this hot air mass will move into central parts of the Northern Territory over the next two to three days and it could move its way into western Queensland at the end of the week, but there's no guarantees they would see these sorts of temperatures.'","The Bureau of Meteorology warns that the remote West Australian towns of Marble Bar and Newman could face 50 degree temperatures on Friday .

"A prominent Pennsylvania family's luxurious suburban lifestyle has been financed by more than $20 million in fraudulent insurance claims amid a series of mansion fires and repeated reports of jewelry theft, authorities said on Thursday. An investigation began after a 2013 fire at the stately home Claire Risoldi - a prominent Republican donor and fund-raiser- shared with relatives in Doylestown, an hour's drive north of Philadelphia. It was the third blaze in five years at the property, which she dubbed Clairemont, authorities said. Fraud: Claire Risoldi has been charged with conspiracy, witness intimidation and forgery, with authorities claiming she filed fraudulent insurance claims to fund her luxurious lifestyle . Blaze: The Risoldi family mansion in Buckingham, Pennsylvania, has caught fire three times in five years . Scene: Seen here is the most recent fire at the Pennsylvania property, which is known as Clairemont . Probe: Officials said the investigation began in October 2013 after a fire at a home in New Hope, Bucks County . Risoldi had falsely accused volunteer firefighters of stealing 55 pieces of jewelry worth more than $10 million while battling the flames, according to a grand jury presentment. The family's jewelry collection had included two items valued at $106,000 only four months earlier, officials said. Charge: Thomas J. French, 64, the husband of Claire Risoldi and a retired deputy sheriff, was also involved . Authorities said the ensuing probe uncovered a decades-long pattern of questionable insurance claims by Risoldi. She still possessed jewelry she reported stolen in 1993, according to investigators. She had reported another jewelry theft from a different home in 1984 and a house fire in 1977. As a result of the investigation, authorities seized about $7 million in family assets, including $3 million in bank accounts, $1.2 million in jewelry, six Ferraris and two Rolls-Royces. The state attorney general's office charged Risoldi, 67, with counts including conspiracy, attempted theft by deception, witness intimidation and forgery. Six other people, including her husband, two children and daughter-in-law, also face charges. Also charged was Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, 43, both of Buckingham; Claire Risoldi's husband, Thomas J. French, 64, also of Buckingham; private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, of Wayne, and fabric vendor Richard Holston, 51, of Medford Lakes, N.J. Risoldi, who is free after posting bail, isn't living at the Doylestown home and couldn't be located for comment Thursday. Family ties: Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, a public relations and marketing specialist, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, have been charged with multiple offenses, including theft by deception . Involved: Carla Risoldi, a former Bucks County prosecutor and now a private attorney, and private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, were also charged on multiple counts . Her daughter's lawyer had no comment. Officials haven't determined the causes of the Doylestown fires, but they said large amounts of highly flammable material had been placed near the origin of each blaze. Video from the home's security system in 2013 showed Risoldi leaving a minute before smoke was visible outside the house, authorities said. An insurance company has paid out more than $20 million for the three fires but is fighting the most recent jewelry claim. Physical evidence 'proved that the jewelry could not have possibly been stolen in the manner described by the Risoldis,' the grand jury presentment said. Scene: Buckingham Fire Marshal Jim Kettler examining the window of a room where a fire broke out on the second floor of the Risoldi's Buckingham home in June 2009 . Destruction: This October 2013 photo shows firefighters from several area companies fighting a house fire in the home of 67-year-old Claire Risoldi and her family . 'This family and their co-conspirators stole millions to fund a lifestyle of extravagance and excess,' Attorney General Kathleen Kane told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 'Insurance fraud drives up the cost for everyone, including seniors and middle-class families. 'Even worse, the scheme was facilitated through threats, intimidation and falsely accusing first responders of serious crimes.' The newspaper also reported that Risoldi has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the county's Republican Party, state lawmakers and a county judge. She also has organized political fund-raisers for local candidates, that were held at her New Hope mansion.","Claire Risoldi, 67, and six of her family members have been charged in an extensive insurance fraud scheme .

"Two burglars who broke into a house and sat and watched the owner's TV while eating his crisps have been arrested after the owner spotted them on a remote surveillance camera. Security-conscious Chung Chang, 32, was at work when he decided to check his surveillance gear from the office. To his disbelief, he watched as the two men made themselves comfortable as they wandered around his living room in Linyi, in eastern China's Shandong province. Scroll down for video . The two thieves sit and watch television as they're unknowingly broadcast by a live surveillance camera . One of the burglars turns on the television. They were later filmed eating the homeowner's crisps . Wearing gloves to prevent leaving fingerprints, the pair gaze at a painting during the raid . He said: 'I don't know what made me check the remote surveillance camera, perhaps it was a sixth-sense. But when I saw these two men in my flat I was very confused. 'At first I thought they might be friends of my son, but when I called him he said he wasn't at home. 'My wife was away on a business trip so I knew they weren't her friends. 'Then I saw them putting on white gloves and looking though my things and I realised they were burglars. And they had the cheek to watch my TV and eat my crisps too.' Mr Chung then called the police who went straight to the block of flats and knocked on the door. A police spokesman said: 'When officers arrived the men inside were clearly very surprised. 'We heard lots of swearing coming from the other side of the door and then it went quiet. 'The two men were found hiding under the owner's bed after police and club-wielding security guards went inside. 'At first they said the flat was theirs, but when we asked them why they had been under the bed they realised the game was up and confessed.' The men, who had shared a cell in jail and had only just been released, now face up to five years back in prison.

"Devastating words spoken by the five-year-old boy whose parents were allegedly stabbed to death by his mother's ex husband reveals that the youngster has no comprehension that he will never see his parents again. 'Mummy and Daddy are dead and there's blood everywhere,' the child told his neighbours, Nepia and Megan Kino, according to The Courier Mail. 'I'm going to take them to hospital to fix their cuts so they can get better.

The 39-year-old woman and 43-year-old man were found dead inside this suburban Gold Coast home. Police say the house will remain a crime scene for at least a week . The little boy was found wandering the family home on Skylark Street just after 5.30pm on Wednesday by his aunt who located the two bodies. He may have been inside the house for an entire day before the gruesome discovery. Police believe the victims, Renee Carter, 39, and her partner Corey Croft, 43, were stabbed to death in the home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. Ms Carter's ex-husband, Christopher Robert Carter, 36, has been charged with murdering the pair. He is a member of the Australian Defence Force and has served on at least one tour of Afghanistan. Carter initially worked as an instructor at the army barracks on the Gold Coast before taking up a stint at the barracks in Townsville. He briefly appeared at Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday but didn't speak or show any emotion. Carter and the mother of the five-year-old boy have been divorced for seven years.

The 36-year-old is a member of the Australian Defence Force and has served on at least one tour of Afghanistan . Regional crime co-ordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson said a knife was used in the double murder of Ms Carter and Mr Croft and that the woman's sister found the pair when she visited the house after being unable to make contact. Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies. Detective searched another premises for possible bloodied clothing and a public toilet block near the accused's home. They have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward. Following the gruesome discovery, the boy was consoled by a detective outside his home  dressed in a blue forensic suit believed to be used when someone may have evidence on their body, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Supt. Hutchinson said the boy was not involved in the fatal incident and was unharmed. He is being cared for by relatives after speaking with police. 'You would understand that a five-year-old child being inside the house under those circumstances would have to be very traumatic,' Supt Hutchinson said. 'You've just got to hope at the end of the day that he's young enough to minimise the impact on him.'

"Sydney Siege survivors have revealed intimate details about the horror they experienced in the Lindt Cafe. They have opened up about the cruel mind games played by their captor, Man Horan Monis, and their belief that he had a bomb - a 'threat which stopped them from doing anything'. John O’Brien and Marcia Mikhael are two of a number of victims who have spoken about the deadly siege which played out in front of the world in an interview with Channel Seven. Ms Mikhael, has opened up about the devastating moment ‘that she gave up hope’ while being kept hostage by Man Haron Monis at the Lindt Café in Martin Place - certain that all 17 captives would be shot dead. Monis, a self-made sheik, made terrifying, calculated threats which made Ms Mikhael certain that she would not leave the building alive. Scroll down for videos . Marcia Mikael (pictured) has bravely opened up about the moment she 'gave up home' and begged with her captor, Man Monis, to hear . John O'Brien, the oldest hostage at 82, was also one of the first to escape. He says took a risk because 'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out' ‘He told us, “For every person that escapes, I will shoot two”. That was when I lost hope,’ Mikhael recounted tearfully. ‘That’s when I asked him if I could call my kids and if I could speak to them.’ ‘I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.’ Ms Mikhael is a 43-year-old mother of three from Glenwood in Sydney’s northwest. She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead. ‘I told them that I loved them very much and I needed them to remember that,’ Mikhael said. ‘My eldest son kept telling me ‘Mum, stop it, everything’s going to be okay’ and I kept telling him ‘I know, I know but just remember that I love you, I love you so much’ and then I had to hang up.' She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead . Selina Win Pe was among the hostages forced to stand up against the Lindt Chocolate Cafe windows and hold up a flag by the gunman during the 17-hour ordeal . Mr O’Brien, 82, has also describes how it felt when on that fateful Monday when the staff and customers at the Lindt Cafe realised that a regular morning at a coffee shop had become a horrifying hostage situation. ‘All hell broke loose once he locked the front door,’ Mr O’Brien told Seven News. ‘He said “I’ll kill you all one by one”. Mr O’Brien was one of a group of three people who managed to escape at 3.37pm when the former tennis player noticed a green button which opened the doors, allowing them to flee. The eldest hostage knew that if the plan didn’t work he would surely be killed by the gunman. ‘I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out so…’ Mr O’Brien’s voice falters as he tries to explain his horrific conundrum. 'You have 15 minutes'. They are the chilling final words from crazed gunman Man Haron Monis to his hostages, said Selina Win Pe . 'I said please don’t shoot me, please don’t shoot me. I only have my mum, please don’t shoot me,' she said, unable to hold back tears . Several of the hostages were forced to record video messages, including Selina Win Pe, who has told her story to Liz Hayes for the upcoming 60 Minutes siege special . Hostage Selina Win Pe has revealed the horrifying moment crazed gunman Man Haron Monis told her she had just 15 minutes to live. Monis turned to Ms Win Pe during the height of the siege in the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place, where he took 18 people hostage on December 15, and forced her to beg for her life. 'I said please don’t shoot me, please don’t shoot me,' she told 60 Minutes in an upcoming special to air on Channel Nine. 'I only have my mum, please don’t shoot me. He looked me straight in the eyes and said ""you have 15 minutes""'. 60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'. The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.' 'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.' Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. Gunman Man Monis told hostages they had '15 minutes' to live as the Sydney siege reached its tragic climax inside the Lindt Cafe last December .

Ceremonies for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson came more than a week after the deadly siege . 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.' It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who was 19 weeks pregnant when she was caught up in the stand-off, could also be featured in the 60 Minutes special. She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell. Siege victim Marcia Mikhael, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, is believed to have secured a deal of between $350,000 and $400,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. The Nine Network confirmed that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting on the Sydney siege special, due to air in the next couple of weeks. 'Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story'. Selina Win Pe revealed to her that hostages were told they had '15 minutes' to live . In extended interviews with 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes, the hostages are asked 'at what point did you think you could die?'. 'When he fired the first shot,' Fiona Ma answered . One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000 . The shootout. The 60 Minutes special will also focus on those last moments when police stormed the building and gunman Man Monis was killed . The final moments. Selina Win Pe has told Liz Hayes that gunman Man Monis warned they all had just '15 minutes' to live . It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th. However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understands. The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all. One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000. Marcia Mikhael is carried to safety by paramedics after suffering leg wounds in the Sydney siege shootout. It's rumoured she could be paid up to $400,000 to tell her story . Harriette Denny was among the last group of hostages to successfully escape the clutches of Man Monis from inside the Lindt cafe. She will be featured on the 60 Minutes special . Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29. However, confusing the matter for Seven, is the screening of the Men's Final at the Australian Tennis Open on that Sunday. Some media experts suggest that the Seven special could be screened immediately before the big match to counter any move by Nine. Heavily armed Tactical Operation Unit police take aim outside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place during the siege last December . The injured are rushed out of the Lindt cafe after the siege conclusion . The push to have hostages tell their stories has met with mixed reaction, former NSW state coroner John Abernethy suggesting a legal intervention could stop the interviews being aired. Former Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett was even more strident, suggesitng Sydney cafe siege hostages selling their stories to the media is 'just plain grubby'. 'Two innocent hostages lost their lives. I do not think it is morally right that the media pay, and any of those who were saved should profit from the attack. Just plain grubby,' Mr Kennett tweeted. Cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were killed when the 17-hour siege ended in a shoot-out in the early hours of December 16.","Survivors of the Sydney siege reveal how they begged not to be killed .

"Social workers seized a man aged 91 from his house and imprisoned him in a care home against his will for 17 months, a judge said yesterday. Staging an early morning raid, they took the former civil servant away from his home of 50 years in his dressing gown. They claimed they were taking him to a hotel – and threatened to call police when he refused. Judge Paul Mort ruled that Essex County Council acted illegally when he removed the pensioner from his home and moved him into a care home for dementia sufferers in May 2013, charging him £25,000 in fees . He was then locked up in a care home, subjected to ‘continuous supervision and control’, and forbidden from seeing his friends or attend services at his church, the court heard. But for a friend’s protests, he could have been imprisoned for life, District Judge Paul Mort said, condemning Essex County Council and its social workers, who repeatedly refused to accept independent expert reports that found he was fit to live at home. They ignored the elderly man’s consistent pleas to go back to his house and his cat, Fluffy. Not until the day of the final court hearing in the case did they change their minds. Judge Mort said the treatment of the former RAF gunner was ‘inexcusable’ and ‘disturbing’. He found the man was unlawfully detained and awarded him £150,000, together with free care at home for the rest of his life. The case is one of hundreds now going through the secretive Court of Protection to challenge imprisonment of vulnerable people by councils using the controversial Mental Capacity Act. The man was not identified, and nor were the social workers, despite senior judges saying that the courts should name social workers just as they name police officers or medical experts. In his ruling, Judge Mort said the man lived in his home for 50 years, first with his parents and his sister, and since their deaths alone with his cat. He went to church every Sunday and had a group of friends, who described him as generous towards those in need and charities. After he developed dementia and health problems, his friends told the council he could be vulnerable. A social worker visited, but her report said nothing about his mental state or his wishes. Judge Mort ruled that the council should pay the man £60,000, waive the fees and cover his legal costs . Instead, she and a colleague returned at 8.30am the next day. The man ‘was wearing his dressing gown and was without trousers or pyjama bottoms’. The court heard that the social worker insisted he go with her to a ‘hotel’ – really the care home. When he refused, she told him she would call police. He was ‘very reluctant to leave’ and ‘very distressed’. The social workers had no legal authority for this, the judge said, adding: ‘He was detained against his wishes for 17 months.’ Social workers next applied for legal control of the man’s finances, at a time when his care fees were £1,500 a month. A friend complained, and was told to take her case to the Court of Protection. As a result, the man was finally allowed home last November. The judge said: ‘I fail to understand why [this] was considered to be a reasonable and proportionate solution to the problem. ‘It is hard to imagine a more depressing and inexcusable state of affairs. Had it not been for the alarm raised by his friend, he may have been condemned to remain there for the remainder of his days.’ He said the social workers were ‘unprepared to countenance any view contrary to their own’. ‘They maintained their resolute opposition to his returning to his home until the last possible moment . . . the conduct of Essex County Council has been reprehensible. The very sad and disturbing consequences for him cannot be ignored,’ he added.","Pensioner, 91, locked up in a care home by Essex County Council .

"A chef has created what could be the world's biggest pasty, measuring 70cm in diameter and shaped to look like the earth. The colossal creation, which took more than eight hours to make, is the brainchild of Tony Trenerry. The head chef at the Eden Project slaved over the snack to mark the beginning of the World Pasty Championships. A pasty on his shoulders: Eden Project Cornwall's head chef Tony Trenerry with his giant creation . The giant pasty, which has no filling in it, had to be cooked in the biggest oven at the Eden Project in Cornwall. It was inspired by the Greek Titan Atlas who appears in numerous sculptures bearing a globe on his shoulders and will now go on display at the popular tourist destination. To be called a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be a ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'. It must contain sliced or diced potato, swede and onion, and the vegetable content must be at least 25 per cent of the whole pasty. Diced or minced beef must account for at least 12.5 per cent. Seasoning is also required 'primarily salt and pepper' Mr Trenerry, 44, said that his creation was the toughest - and heaviest - baking challenge he has undertaken in his 25-year career. 'I was inspired by the amazing collection of competitive pasties at last year's World Pasty Championships and wanted to do my bit to inspire entrants to this year's competition,' he said. 'Word about the competition is spreading and, as well as local bakers, we have had interest from around the world, including enquiries from the US and Canada.' Registration for the World Pasty Championships, also known as the Olympics of the Oggy, is now open. Entrants from last years' World Pasty Championships Richard Shaw from Hampshire and his son Harrison. Last years' championships attracted more than 150 entries . Pasty lovers from around the world are invited to put their finest creations up on 28 February to be crowned Best Pasty in the World. The competition sees amateur and professional bakers from far and near compete by baking traditional Cornish pasties or variations on the classic beef, onion, potato and turnip recipe. Competition categories are split between those who would like to make a traditional Cornish pasty, which abides by strict guidelines and is made in Cornwall, and those who want to make any other type of savoury pasty. Makes two pasties . Pastry ingredients: 225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting, pinch of salt; 50g lard, chilled and diced; 50g hard margarine, chilled and cut into cubes . Filling ingredients: One potato, peeled and thinly sliced; 50g swede, peeled and thinly sliced; 115g beef skirt or chuck steak, finely diced; quarter small onion, thinly sliced; salt and ground white pepper; beaten egg or milk to glaze. Method: To make the pastry, mix together the flour and salt and rub in the fats. Gradually stir in two to three tablespoons cold water and bring everything together with your hands to form a smooth, pliable dough. Divide the dough into two balls. Preheat the oven to fan 180C/400F/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. On a floured work surface, roll out one ball of dough and trim to form a circle about 20cm/8in across. Slightly off-centre of the circle, place a layer of potato, then a layer of swede. Add half the beef, then half the onion, then a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper. Finally, add another thin layer of potato, to stop the meat from drying out. Carefully fold the pastry over and crimp the edges together (using a little beaten egg to seal, if wished). Place on the lined baking sheet. Repeat to make the second pasty. Glaze with a little milk or beaten egg and make a small hole in the top. Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.","Head chef at the Eden Project, Cornwall, took eight hours to make pasty .

"Long before Mitt Romney announced he was mulling a third presidential run, his handlers scheduled a sit-down meeting in Utah for Thursday with Jeb Bush – and the get-together is still on the calendar. Romney and Bush are now both engaged in the business of figuring out whether to campaign for the White House, a process that involves currying favor with elected officials and buttering up donors. In some cases, they're hitting up the same people just hours apart. An ABC News producer caught up with Bush at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., apparently about to board a flight for Salt Lake City, Utah. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell confirmed that the meeting is scheduled to take place today. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . AWKWARD: Jeb Bush (left) was an occasional and lukewarm supporter of Mitt Romney (right) during his 2012 presidential campaign, and the two likely 2016 rivals have a meeting on their calendars for this week that no one thought to cancel . NO PRIVATE JET: An ABC News producer was on-hand to see former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush board a flight from Washington, D.C. to Salt Lake City, Utah on Thursday . The New York Times reports that the two former governors – Romney of Massachusetts and Bush of Florida – could find themselves launching dueling presidential operations that will ultimately serve to split the GOP and dilute their individual power. Two prominent Republican Party members spoke to the paper on Wednesday night. Romney shocked some observers two weeks ago by encouraging a small group of donors during a New York City meeting to tell their friends that he was considering a return to the campaign trail. Bush had already announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee in mid-December, and launched a political action committee this month. He proposed meeting with Romney in order to make a public show of respect – the kind of photo-op gesture that would signal his embrace of continuity among the Republican Party's moderate center. But now the two men will likely compete for the hearts, minds and wallets of that constituency. GOP insiders fear that a bruising and protracted battle between the two men could leave whichever of them survives compromised and bloodied headed into a November 2016 confrontation with Hillary Clinton or another moneyed Democrat. Or worse, according to one financier who says he has pledged to support Bush, 'the two could take each other down and open the door wide enough for a more divisive candidate to overtake them both.' SHE AWAITS: Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton has a cakewalk path to the Democratic nomination in front of her, unlike the swuabbling Republican contenders . ALL SMILES (in 2012!): Bush rode on Romney's campaigns plane for appearances in Florida a week before the last presidential election . That's a reference to the party's conservative wing, populated by prospective candidates like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and the pugnacious New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Meanwhile the Times notes that Bush wasn't particularly helpful to ROmney during his unsuccessful 2012 White House run. Some observers see the two politicians as subtly different flavors of the same dish, and worry that the party faithful won't have sufficient attention span to support two stock characters cast from such similar molds. Some Romney loyalists, the Times reports, have asked their friends and business associates to pull back from committing their support to Bush, for now, in case Romney takes the plunge. Romney insisted this week in California that he hasn't given himself a deadline for deciding whether to enter the race.","The two Republican former governors had a sit-down on their calendars scheduled for Thursday, and no one thought to cancel it .

"A German court have ruled in favour of mens' right to urinate while standing - a subject of heated debate across the country . A German court today ruled men do have the right to urinate standing up - but they must expect it can cause the occasional row with female housemates. The finding was made after a landlord claimed their tenant ruined their marble floor by sprinkling it with urine. Attempting to retain part of the tenant's €3,000 (£2,300) deposit, the landlord argued their bathroom floor was eaten away by uric acid. Although the judge knocked back the tenant's claim, he noted men who stand to urinate can expect the occasional row with their housemates. The debate about whether men should stand or sit is no laughing matter in Germany. Some toilets in the country have red traffic-style signs forbidding the standing position. There is also a derogatory term for men who sit and pee - 'Sitzpinkler' - which implies that it is not masculine behaviour. Judge Stefan Hank in the city of Duesseldorf said men who insist on standing 'must expect occasional rows with housemates, especially women'. But he added that they cannot be held to account for collateral damage. 'Despite growing domestication of men in this matter, urinating while standing up is still widespread,' he said. While accepting that the marble floor had eaten away by uric acid the tenant had sprinkled on the ground, he said the owner should have told the tenant the floor was vulnerable, The Times of India reported. 'Someone who still practises this previously dominant custom is regularly confronted with significant disputes, particularly with female cohabitants. 'However normally he must not reckon with damage to the marble floor of a bathroom or guest toilet.'","German court rules in favour of mens' right to urinate while standing up .

"A car enthusiast has spent five years turning a £100 Ford Granada into an exact replica of a £1million supercar - using scrap parts bought on eBay. Nick Truman, 53, bought an old Jaguar engine for £89 with the intention of transforming it into an elaborate coffee table - similar to the one on BBC Top Gear. But when he realised it was too big he decided to create a replica of the 200mph Pagani Zonda supercar. Scroll down for video . Nick Truman, pictured,  spent £15,000 building his own version of the £1million Pagani Zonda supercar . Having never seen the car in real life, he started out using a child's toy to work out the details . After buying the ‘donor’ car for just £100, the IT specialist then sourced wheels, tyres, gearboxes, windscreens and all the other cheap parts on eBay. However, he had a problem - he had never actually seen a Zonda in real life, so instead he bought a toy model of the Italian supercar before downloading photographs from the internet. He then spent thousands of man hours manipulating the parts in a bid to clone the thoroughbred racer. During the project he sliced the top off his index finger in the turbo with the digit then shooting out of the exhaust pipe. He also had it shipped to Bahrain - where he worked for a while - and had it registered to be driven legally. But the Jaguar engine died in Bahrain when customs left the engine running for hours in blistering heat to drain the petrol as he left the country. So he bought a second-hand Audi V8 engine, which blew up, before buying another V8 which is currently in the car. The real Pagani Zonda, pictured, is one of the world's most advanced supercars able to hit more than 200mph . Mr Truman tried his best to replicate the interior of the Pagani Zonda as well as the exterior . He took his car to Bahrain where he was allowed to drive it on the roads, although it is not legal in the UK . With twin-turbos, Nick believes the car now boasts in excess of 500bhp - although he’s yet to put his car to the test. The married father-of-three, from Iver, Buckinghamshire, said: 'All I wanted to do was make a coffee table, but I ended up building a car. 'It was a fun project to do with my children although my wife wasn’t overly impressed. 'In the first year the project became obsessive. I would do audio calls with the angle grinder in one and the phone in the other. 'A lot of blood and sweat went into it, literally. On one day I lost the tip of my index finger in the turbo and it came out of the exhaust. 'My wife likes the colour and I think she is proud of what has been achieved. 'People who drive past and always slam their brakes on and look at it. If you have never seen a Zonda before, you might not know it wasn’t one at first look. 'The body isn’t perfect but it makes people smile and my children love it.' Spot the difference: One of these cars is worth ��1million and the other was built in a shed with spare parts . He bought most of the parts from eBay, including the current engine which set him back just £240 . The various donor parts came from a range of other cars including a Lexus and even a Porssce . The car is built on  the chassis of a 1990 Ford Granada and originally had a Jaguar V12 engine . After using the 1990 Ford Granada Scorpio as a base, Nick scoured eBay for parts which include a £5 gearbox, wheels off a Lexus and tyres from a Porsche. The fibreglass for the body cost £50 while the current engine was £240. The most expensive parts are the lights, which cost £95 each. However the costs have added up and Mr Truman thinks he has spent around £15,000 on the car. He added: 'I would never do it again and in hindsight I probably wouldn’t have started. 'I have gone through four engines, two gearboxes, three windscreens. 'It has come to about £15,000. When I imported it into Bahrain I had to pay £5,000 in import tax but I got that back when I left. 'The car is road legal in Bahrain and it was great fun driving around. The acceleration was vicious. 'The hardest thing was probably hooking up the electric windows, air conditioning and central locking. I have really enjoyed it.' While it is not road legal in the UK, the car sits on Nick’s driveway next to his classic Ferrari 308 GT4 Dino. He eventually hopes to take it to a drag strip or the Top Gear airfield to see how quick it is.","Car mad Nick Truman has spent £15,000 turning a Granada into a supercar .

"You might think the U.S. is the most obese nation in the world - but if you do, you are wrong. Soaring rates of obesity in the Pacific Islands, nations in the South Pacific Ocean east of Australia and Fiji, have shot to the top of the worldwide obesity scale. Previously it has been theorised that Pacific Islanders are genetically predisposed to obesity. But experts now say the introduction of Western diets to the islands are to blame for the problem. American Samoa, found south of Samoa, tops the chart, with 75 per cent of the population reported as obese. Graphic shows an epidemic of obesity across most of the U.S., Europe, Australia and the Middle East. The scale shows the percentage of each country's populations that is defined as obese, with a Body Mass Index of over 30. The Pacific Islands, east of Australia, are the countries with the largest percentage of their population reported as obese. In American Samoa, three quarters of the population is dangerously fat . Most of Africa and south Asia are shown in turquoise, with low levels of obesity, while most of the U.S., Europe, Australia, the Middle East are shown in orange, indicating high levels of obesity . Nauru and the Cook Islands, also found in the South Pacific Ocean, come in second and third places with 71 per cent and 63 per cent of the population obese. The islands were colonised by Australian, American, New Zealand, British or French nations after the Second World War, and the diets and social changes introduced blamed for soaring obesity rates. These colonising nations sought to ‘civilise’ the islanders and introduce ‘proper’ food habits, research has shown. They encouraged dependency on imported food, meaning the local fishing and farming industries on the islands died out. Traditional foods of the islands such as fresh fish, meat and local fruits and vegetables have been replaced by rice, sugar, flour, canned meats, canned fruits and vegetables, soft drinks and beer. Oxford University researchers said these newly introduced foods are ‘energy-dense, nutrient poor’ products which have led to rising levels of obesity. These Western foods also became a sign of social status among the islanders, research published in the Journal of Public Health Nutrition found. Islanders were taught to fry their fish, rather than eat it raw as they had done before. These social changes happened very quickly because of the islands being small and populated by close knit communities. The Pacific Islands and Kuwait are top of the global obesity scale. American Samoa tops the chart, with 75 per cent of the population reported as obese. Nauru and the Cook Islands, also found in the South Pacific Ocean, come in second and third places with 71 per cent and 63 per cent of the population obese . One theory is that the Pacific Islanders are genetically pre-disposed to become obese. However, Oxford University researchers say food preparation and cooking habits brought in by Western nations are to blame. The islands' farming and fishing industries were destroyed and they began to rely on foreign imports of foods like rice and sugar, they said . In the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, 33 per cent of the population is obese, with the UK and Australia not far behind with 27 per cent of the population dangerously fat. Nutritionists warn obesity-related diseases like heart disease and diabetes are now the world's biggest killers . The colonising nations also introduced mining, making land that had previously been used for food gathering infertile. Pollution from colonial shipping also degraded reefs, which were formerly a rich food source. Professor Stanley Ulijaszek, of the University of Oxford, said: ‘Previous attempts to explain the disproportionately high rates of obesity in these and other island nations have tended to focus on the geographical isolation of islands and the risk of food shortages. 'Theories have suggested that islanders are genetically predisposed to putting on weight, but we believe this does not explain why obesity has emerged so rapidly on these islands. 'Interventions that tap into the naturally occurring social networks on the islands provide a new, and we believe more effective, way of tackling obesity.’ Bangladesh and Ethiopia came joint last on the list, with 1 per cent of people in these countries carrying too much weight. Nepal, came second to bottom, with just over 1 per cent of the population reported to be obese. In fact, the map reveals extremely low obesity rates over most of Africa and south Asia. The UK has almost 27 per cent obesity whereas France, Italy and Sweden fared considerably better with a less than 10 per cent rate of obesity . In the U.S. a third of the population is obese. Nutritionist Katrina Mather says highly processed, sugar-rich convenience foods and drinks are to blame for high obesity, and the chronic disease it causes. She says the levels of sugar consumed in Western nations like the U.S. and Canada is 'frankly alarming'. She said: 'Sugar is addictive, leading to food craving and overeating - combined with the fact that highly processed foods are devoid of nutrients and as a result don't satisfy hunger' Experts have said there are high levels of malnutrition in these areas of the world, with some people struggling the calories needed to reach their full physical potential. Greg Barrow, of the World Food Programme Office, explains: ‘From west Africa, central Africa, to the horn of Africa to Asia, we see high levels of under nutrition.' ‘In Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nepal in particular, large sectors of the population struggle to have access to the calories they need. 'They also struggle to access the vitamins and minerals they need to reach their full physical and intellectual potential. ‘It’s been recognised in studies, that the largest number of people malnourished live in south Asia, and this graph is drawing on that. ‘They have rapidly growing population and the food demands  are high. ‘The largest proportion of populations malnourished occurs in sub Saharan Africa. ‘These are parts of the world where there are high levels of poverty. People are unable to buy the most nutritious food for their families. ‘In Ethiopia you have an economy based on subsistence farming - farmers making enough food to feed themselves and their families. There is a range of obesity rates across central America. Panama (pictured in orange) has an obesity rate of 25 per cent. Comparably, in Honduras (pictured in green),  18 per cent of the population is obese . There is a range of obesity rates across central America. Panama (pictured in orange) has an obesity rate of 25 per cent. Comparably, in Honduras (pictured in green),  18 per cent of the population is obese . Obesity rates across South America also vary. In Argentina (pictured in orange), 30 per cent of the population is obese, which is almost as high as rates in the U.S. and Saudia Arabia. Brazil (pictured in green) has an obesity rate of 19 per cent . 'Climate change can make it difficult for farmers to feed their family and make a living from their produce at market. ‘But many of these countries have made great strides compared to where we were 20 years ago.' The map, created using data from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, shows the global obesity crisis is still a growing issue, as every continent faces a weight issue. The results show the rising epidemic of fatness across the globe, with high levels of obesity across most of Europe, the Middle East and North America. In the UK, more than 25 per cent of the population is reported as obese, whereas France, Italy and Sweden fared considerably better, with an obesity rate of less than 10 per cent. In the U.S., 33 per cent of people are obese, while 27 per cent of Australians carry too much weight. A person is considered obese if they have a Body Mass Index (BMI) is over 30, and severely obese if they have a BMI of over 40. Nutritionist Katrina Mather said: 'Preventable chronic diseases, often linked to obesity, are now the world's biggest killers. There are low levels of obesity throughout most of Africa. Ethiopia (pictured in the east, in turquoise) was the country with the lowest level of obesity, at just over one per cent. Experts said there are high levels of poverty in Africa. People are unable to access the calories they need to fulfil their physical and intellectual potential, Greg Burrows, of the World Food Programme, said . 'And if you look at the countries where obesity and chronic disease have their strongest hold and try to understand what has been done differently in recent history - the common denominator is a massive shift in what these nations eat and drink. 'My research points the finger at highly processed, sugar-rich convenience foods and drinks lying behind all forms of chronic disease and obesity. 'In non-Western cultures, where traditional diets predominantly consist of unprocessed foods and are low in sugar, it takes only one generation of people eating a more typical Western diet, high in sugar and refined flour, to become predisposed to obesity and develop diabetes. This is true around the world from Inuit to isolated African communities. 'Considering the time and effort it would take to yield just one teaspoon of sugar from chewing on a sugar cane, highlights that the 'normal Western' consumption of sugar in the form of sweets, convenience foods and soft drinks, is frankly alarming. 'Sugar is addictive, leading to food craving and overeating - combined with the fact that highly processed foods are devoid of nutrients and as a result don't satisfy hunger. 'So, a vicious circle then develops, leading to a society that is over-fed but under-nourished. Unfortunately no additional amount of the same food will make up for the missing essential nutrients. 'And overeating leads to obesity whilst stressing the body, which in turn can lead to the onset of chronic disease.' Similary, south Asia shows low levels of obesity, compared with high levels in the Middle East and Australia and New Zealand. In India, less than two per cent of the populaiton is obese, whereas more than 33 per cent of the population in Egypt has a BMI of over 30. South Asian countries have rising populations and high demands for food, experts say, but much of the population still struggles to access enough calories .

"An enraged father has made an emotional YouTube video calling out two high schoolers after they made racial slurs about his adopted African American daughter. Brad Knudson, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, struggled to contain his tears as he recalled how his eighth-grade daughter, whom he and his wife adopted 11 years ago, was targeted by bullies. And in a shocking twist, when Mr Knudson confronted the father of the bullies, the man responded by calling the concerned dad a 'n***** lover' in messages left on his phone. The father, Deron Puro, 49, has now been fired from his job. Heartbroken: Brad Knudson recorded a six-minute video recalling how his African American daughter was called a 'n*****' by classmates - and when he confronted their father, the man repeated the slur . In shock: He showed the video of the twin boys calling his daughter a 'sl**' and a 'n*****' on Snapchat . In the six-minute video posted to YouTube on Monday, Knudson recalled the incident. 'We have a very beautiful African American daughter that we were very fortunate enough to adopt 11 years ago,' he said. 'We've dealt with a little bit of racism, you know, stares, things like that when she calls us mom or dad, but she didn't notice so we just blew it off because it was directed towards us.' But on New Year's Eve, his daughter and one of her friends were hanging out at his home and sending Snapchat messages to friends. A set of twins from her school, who Knudson says do not like his daughter, then started sending her racist, bullying messages on the app, he said. Loved: He said he would never want his daughter to 'end up committing suicide because of morons' After Snapchat messages play, they disappear, but when the twins sent their fourth abusive message to the girl, her friend went and told her parents who filmed it on their phone. Mr Knudson played it to the camera. It shows the twins making faces at the camera and calling the girl a 'sl**', a 'n*****' and a 'fat a** b****'. The horrified parents found out who the twins were and contacted their parents and even went to their home, but received no answer, he said. 'I love my daughter and I don't want her to end up committing suicide because of freaking morons,' Knudson said. 'I can't have this hanging over us and my daughter thinking the worst.' So he contacted police, who went to the school and spoke with the children and their parents. Mr Knudson then contacted Puro - but received a less than sympathetic response. 'He didn't understand what was wrong with the video,' he recalled. 'He told me I was crazy, that that's what he did when he was a kid. Him and his family make jokes at the house using this word all the time so what was the big deal?' Puro then left voicemail messages on Mr Knudson's phone, which Knudson played to camera. 'I guess you're a n***** lover,' he said on one. 'That's a correct statement because i am an n***** lover because I have a beautiful African American daughter who I love more than life itself and would do anything for her,' Knudson responded. Fired: Deron Puro, pictured with his sons, said he stood by his racist comments and did not care if Mr Knudson shared his messages online. Since Mr Knudson shared his name in the video, he has been fired from his job . Puro then sent another: 'Hey Brad, you're a f**, grow up... you're a loser.' When Knudson told Puro he was going to share the messages on social media, Puro said he stood by his remarks - and that he didn't even care if he gave out his name. But Puro was probably not expecting the response from viewers of the video, which has been watched more than 300,000 on YouTube. On Wednesday, it emerged that Puro's employer, financial firm Roy E. Abbott Futures, Inc., where he worked as an independent contractor, let him go, Fox9 reported. 'Deron Puro is no longer associated with Roy E. Abbott Futures, Inc. as of today January 21st,' they wrote in a statement on their website. Prior Lake-Savage Area Schools said they are still investigating if this was a situation that was isolated to the one day and incident, or if the bullying has been ongoing. Scene: The two boys, who attended Prior Lake High School, pictured, now face a punishment, officials said . It is also looking into punishment for the boys but no final decisions have been made. 'First and foremost, we do not tolerate racism, harassment or bullying of any kind,' Kristi Mussman, director of communications for the district, said in a statement. 'We are conducting our own investigation to get a better understanding of the events that led up to this video. We have reached out to Mr. Knudson directly to offer support for his daughter. 'We strive to maintain safe and respectful schools for all of our students and will continue to work to ensure a safe learning environment for all of our students.'","Brad Knudson uploaded a video to YouTube on Sunday recalling how his daughter received cruel messages from two boys on New Year's Eve .

"A skin-care specialist to the Hollywood stars has been acquitted of charges she plotted to murder a rival beautician she wrongly blamed for stalking her. Dawn Melody DaLuise, 56, was cleared in Los Angeles County Superior Court after about an hour of deliberations by jurors in the bizarre case that included allegations that a former NFL lineman was hired to knock off the competitor. Prosecutors alleged DaLuise, who has counted Jennifer Aniston, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Christian Slater among clients at her Santa Monica salon, became so obsessed with a competitor that she tried hiring a hit man to kill him. Dawn DaLuise (pictured left) was cleared on Thursday of charges she plotted to murder a rival beautician, Gabriel Suarez (right) who she wrongly believed was stalking her . Well-connected: DaLuise is pictured with actor Gary Busey in Beverly Hills in November 2010 . DaLuise was released immediately after the not guilty verdict on charges of solicitation of murder and solicitation of assault. 'Obviously, we're ecstatic about getting not guilty on both counts,' defense lawyer Jamon Hicks said. 'We're just hoping to help her rebuild her reputation, rebuild her business and rebuild her life.' Defense lawyers said DaLuise was venting when she told friends she hated esthetician Gabriel Suarez and had found someone to take him out. She was reportedly furious when Suarez moved into the same building as her salon, Skin Refinery, in Santa Monica. Authorities said there was no evidence anyone acted on a plot to kill Suarez. DaLuise wrongly believed Suarez was behind a campaign that included posting lewd flyers of her face photo-edited on pornography, emails and Craigslist ads with her home address seeking men to act out a 'rape fantasy'. In a bizarre twist, police later connected the postings to a friend of DaLuise. Authorities arrested her friend, Edward Feinstein, on suspicion of stalking and said he had goaded her into the murder-for-hire plot. Feinstein has not been charged in the case. Ricardo Santiago, a spokesman for the district attorney, said that investigation continues. Prosecutors said DaLuise became obsessed with Suarez, who had recently opened his business on the same West Hollywood block as her Skin Refinery, which counted Alicia Silverstone, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christina Ricci among its clientele. At some point, DaLuise confided in Chris Geile, who played three games for the Detroit Lions in 1987, about her suspicions that Suarez was behind the stalking. Geile testified that he was only a shoulder to cry on for DaLuise and was never asked to kill anyone. She sent text messages to friends saying Geile was going to 'take Gabriel out'. DaLuise reportedly moved to California to become a model in the 1980s. She lost her business after being jailed in March on charges of solicitation of murder and solicitation of assault likely to produce great bodily injury, Hicks said. Her personal website is also now defunct. Getting back to work will be her second priority after reuniting with her two daughters once she's released from custody. Hicks said DaLuise grabbed his leg as the first verdict was read. Fearing the jury would convict her on the second, lesser count, he cautioned her to wait before celebrating. 'When you heard the second 'not guilty,' you could hear her gasp and say, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,' he said. Mr Suarez's Smooth Cheeks Salon (pictured) opened on the same Santa Monica block as DaLuise's store allegedly enraging her, jurors heard during the trial .","Jurors reached the verdict on Thursday in Los Angeles in the case against former model Dawn DaLuise .

"Letty Amelia Bradford has been charged with criminal damage after allegedly keying another parent's car in apparent revenge for having been overtaken in the school parking lot . A mother allegedly caused $600 worth of damage to another parent's car  in an apparent road-rage attack on the school run. Letty Amelia Bradford has been accused of using a key to scratch the SUV apparently in revenge for having been overtaken in the school parking lot. She was  identified on surveillance footage at the school in Alpharetta, Georgia. After her arrest, she apologised to the family whose car was damaged, saying she 'having a bad day'. She told Channel 2: 'It was a stressful time, right before the holidays, and with having to take time off work and she basically pushed my buttons. 'I did something that I've never done before and I never will do something like that again.' The incident happened on December 16 when parents arrived at Hillside Elementary school for a Christmas show. But it took several weeks for police to identify Bradford on CCTV footage. A woman, who has not been named, told police that she was trying to park, but found Bradford was not moving in front of her. In order to get past her, she said she drove around and went into a parking space. When she returned, she found the front passenger door of her Kia Sorrento had been scratched. She was charged with criminal damage to property and disrupting public school. Bradford was released from the Fulton County jail after posting $5,000 bond, booking records showed, and has vowed to pay for the damage. She has a court date in a few weeks.","Letty Amelia Bradford 'caused $600 worth of damage to mother's SUV'

"A one-time builder has gone from fitting kitchens to fitting hair extensions in her very own beauty salon. Michelle Pindar, from Hull, lived the first 52 years of her life as Michael who married a woman and started his own kitchen fitting business. But she has decided to present herself a as woman full-time to match up with her feminine persona. Michelle decided she was ready to sell up and look for a new project and that's when she bought the salon . She lived the first 52 years of her life as Michael (left) before becoming Michelle (right) four years ago . After realising that she was born in the wrong body, the beautician, 56, started dressing as a woman and has just recovered from having complete gender reassignment surgery. Michelle said: 'I loved being a kitchen fitter and I was great at my job but I felt more comfortable working in beauty once I became a woman. 'I couldn't carry on fitting kitchens in the week and being a woman at the weekends. 'Now it's my favourite thing to do to help other women look their best - I'm all about the nails, the hair and the make-up.' She started dressing as a woman at weekends from age 38, but at 52 started living as Michelle full time . She new things weren't right from an early age (left), and at around eight years old realised she felt more comfortable as a girl than a boy, but pursued the manly lifestyle expected of her (right) Michelle realised at eight years old that she felt more comfortable as a girl than a boy. Despite knowing something was wrong, she pursued the manly lifestyle expected of her by getting a job in a shipyard, marrying a childhood friend aged 23, and later opening her own kitchen fitting business. But 15 years into their marriage, Michelle, aged 38, decided to take the plunge and started dressing as a woman at weekends. While she pursued her construction business Monday to Friday, Michelle switched to dresses and heels for Saturday nights out on the town. Four years ago she started presenting as a woman full time and, to match up with her more feminine persona, she gave up kitchen fitting after 22 years of running the business. Instead she bought the Body Beautiful beauty salon where she now works waxing, applying semi-permanent make-up and perfecting women's brows, lashes and hair. But Michelle hasn't lost her entrepreneurial spirit in the switch and invented a pillow she claims prevents some of the ageing to skin that occurs overnight. Michelle says she loves going out more since she's been living as a woman fully, especially after her sugery . She couldn't imagine being without the Body Beautiful salon and loves helping people look their best . And she wants to encourage more women into project management and construction having seen the business from both a male and a female perspective. Michelle said: 'I was just eight when I realised that I'd been born in the wrong body. 'I just had this feeling but I didn't act on it because I hadn't even heard the word transgender or transsexual. 'I did everything I could to be as manly as possible. 'I ended up working in a shipyard and then I took the skills I'd learned there and started my own kitchen fitting company. 'I married a friend I'd known since school just because it was what was expected of me but we never had children. 'It took me a long time but I eventually realised that what I needed to do and I told my wife I needed to start dressing in girls' clothes. 'She handled it well. We couldn't stay together after that but we are still friends. 'The whole time I wanted to be a girl. 'Since I've been living fully as a woman, and especially since I had my surgery, I've loved going out more and more. 'I'm getting to have the youth as a woman I never had before. Now she's seen it from both sides she says she can appreciate that people don't take women working in the construction industry seriously at all - and she'd love to get back into it one day . 'I loved being a kitchen fitter - I was at the top of my game, and the big home improvement stores recommended me to fit all the kitchens they sold. 'But it didn't fit with me when I became a woman. 'I decided I was ready to sell up and look for a new project and that's when I bought the salon. 'I can't imagine being without the salon now. I love being able to help people look their best. 'Now I've seen it from both sides I can appreciate that people don't take women working in the construction industry seriously at all and I'd love to get back into it one day.

"An army veteran suffering from PTSD and a lung condition is suing Asda after he was wrongly accused of being a shoplifter in the middle of a store. Derek Greenhalgh was browsing in a busy Blackpool branch of the discount chain when a manager approached and told him he was barred for stealing, adding 'I know your face'. When the 66-year-old protested, the manager called two members of staff over and asked them whether they recognised him, as other shoppers looked on. When the staff said they weren't sure Mr Greenhalgh was the shoplifter in question, the manager backed off, but the British Army veteran said the incident has left him feeling 'humiliated'. Scroll down for video . Derek Greenhalgh, 66, said he was approached in this Blackpool branch of Asda on New Year's eve and accused of being a shoplifter by a manager who told him 'I know your face' He contacted the Veteran's Association who sent a stinging letter to Asda chief executive Andy Clarke branding his treatment a 'disgrace', and he is now in contact with a solicitor. Mr Greenhalgh, a father-of-one, said: 'I was completely humiliated and left feeling worthless after what happened in that store. 'It was just indescribable and it knocked me for six. It was distressing and embarrassing. I can understand if mistakes are made but the staff could have asked for a quiet word in the back. 'There was no need to brand me a criminal in the middle of the store in front of all those customers. It’s not a question of me being an army veteran - no customer should be subjected to this.' Mr Greenhalgh was left suffering from PTSD after serving in Yemen during a bloody uprising against British colonial rule in 1966. Mr Greenhalgh visits in the Asda store regularly, as a lung condition stops him from carrying heavy shopping, but has vowed never to return . Soldiers stationed in an area then known as Aden were subjected to 500 guerrilla attacks in 1965, and in 1966 the situation deteriorated even further after it was announced forces would withdraw. Mr Greenhalgh was approached by the manager on New Year's Eve as he made a trip to the Asda store on Welbeck Avenue, in Blackpool, to buy bread, milk and cat food. Mr Greenhalgh said he regularly visits the store as he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a narrowing of the airways that causes shortness of breath, meaning he cannot carry a large amount of shopping. He said: 'I go to the little Asda because I have to do my shopping in bits and bobs. All the staff know me and I always have a laugh with the ones on the till. 'It was 10:45am and the store was very busy. I was stood near the freezer cabinet and I had my basket when the assistant manager said to me ""you’re barred"". 'I said ""what for"" and he said he didn’t know. I asked who had barred me and he said he didn’t know. He said that he knew faces and I said ""well you have the wrong face"". 'I said ""you can’t tell me who, where and when"" and I asked for some of his frontline staff to identify me. Then the security guard said ""have you ever been done for shoplifting"". I said ""no"". 'Then two other staff came over and one said ""I’m not certain"" and the other said ""I’m not certain but I don’t think it is him"". 'I remember people stopping and staring at me. The manager said ‘if I’m wrong I will apologise’ but I told him that I was taking it further. 'I paid for my shopping and went home and rang customer services. I was shaking and fuming. I couldn’t get it out of my head and my mood was very low after. I was extremely upset and offended. Mr Greenhalgh suffers from PTSD after serving in the British Army in Yemen in the 1960s (pictured, Mr Greenhalgh on deployment, sitting in the driver's seat) At the time of Mr Greenhalgh's deployment the British forces were being targetted by guerrilla fighters demanding an end to colonial rule (Mr Greenhalgh pictured middle row, second from left) 'I have depression with traumatic stress disorder and it does get you down to the point where you can’t be bothered to go out and get dressed but I had been on the up. 'I had been thinking positively and I was feeling more positive than I had done for quite a long time, but this completely devastated me. 'This assistant manager was adamant ""because he goes off faces"" that I was the right person but as soon as he couldn’t get a positive identity he started to back off. 'He had mistaken me for shoplifter and it was the way it was handled in front of everyone. People were staring. I was shellshocked. 'When he first said it I honestly thought it was a joke but he was deadly serious. I think that treatment was disgusting. 'It was very traumatising, embarrassing and very distressing, I didn’t need this. why couldn’t they take me into the back and done it in private. Mr Greenhalgh (pictured third left during Army training in 1965) said he was on a positive streak before the manager approached him, but the incident left him 'devastated' 'I think that they should look at their protocol. I was extremely upset and offended. 'Immediately after it happened I would not go shopping and obviously I don’t go into Asda any more because I’ll be worried the staff are thinking ‘oh looks it’s him’. 'I’ve been a loyal customer at Asda for 15 years and spend between £150 and £200 a week there but they won’t be getting a penny out of me now. 'Asda has been disgusting. Customer services say they understand my embarrassment - but they don’t have a clue. I’m now seeing a solicitor.' Mr Greenhalgh (pictured in 1985) forgives the mistake, but said he should have been taken off the shop floor before being accused . Mr Greenhalgh served as a private in the First Battalion the Loyal North Lancaster Regiment for four years after joining in 1965 aged 17, and served in Aden in 1966, North Africa in 1967 and Malta. He later served in the 4th Battalion Queen’s Lancashire Regiment and in the Territorial Army. Tony Hayes, chief executive of the Veterans’ Association UK said: 'Derek suffers from PTSD and this doesn’t help - it makes things 10 times worse. What makes you or I angry, he can become anxious and frightened. It’s an absolute disgrace. 'He was in bits. We have all been through the mill and understand the problem. Derek has virtually gone back to where he was in the first place. 'It has totally devastated him and humiliated him. He has almost become paranoid about it and going out. When he goes out he is embarrassed because he thinks people are thinking he is a shoplifter. It is totally unfair. 'The assistant manager should be sacked because what he has done is totally wrong.' In an email to Mr Greenhalgh a staff member from the Asda ‘Service Team’ said: 'I hope the same mistake will never occur in the future. I appreciate your feedback as it helps us to work on drawbacks and put things right.” In a statement an Asda spokesman said: 'We have the greatest respect for our armed service personnel and are privileged to count many ex-service men and women as Asda colleagues. 'We are very sorry for any distress this has caused and have been in touch with Mr Greenhalgh to apologise for this case of mistaken identity. We have also contacted the Veterans’ Association UK to explain what happened.'","Derek Greenhalgh was shopping in Asda, Blackpool, on New Year's Eve .

The weather service said Thursday it was still too early to determine the exact track of the storm, but some areas could expect up to 7 inches or more of snow. The storm should arrive in the Philadelphia region Friday night and dump 'several inches' of snow before turning to rain sometime Saturday, the weather service said. On Thursday, a winter storm has swept through parts of Texas, dropping up to a foot of snow in the Panhandle and prompting El Paso to close government offices early. Temperatures also plummeted in Mexico, with snow in the city of Ciudad Juarez, prompting authorities to send out a weather warning for a 'Cold Front 30,' which is expected to cause below-zero temperatures in the area .

"Argentine President Cristina Kirchner today claimed a prosecutor who died just as he was due to accuse her covering up of a Jewish bombing was murdered to implicate her. Kirchner argued that Alberto Nisman did not commit suicide, but was instead killed in an 'operation' against her government. Mr Nisman, the lead prosecutor in the case, was found dead under suspicious circumstance with a gunshot to his head at his home on Sunday. The next day he was to go before a congressional hearing to accuse Kirchner of shielding Iranian officials implicated in the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre which left dozens dead. Investigators have said Nisman appeared to have committed suicide, but have not ruled out homicide or an 'induced suicide.' In a stunning post on her Facebook page, Kirchner contended that Nisman was killed to immerse her government in scandal after he had been 'used' to publicly accuse her of involvement in the cover-up. Scroll down for video . Argentine President Cristina Kirchner (left) has claimed that prosecutor Alberto Nisman (right) who died a day before he was due to accuse her of covering up a Jewish bombing in 1994 was murdered to 'implicate' her . Police carry the body of prosecutor Alberto Nisman outside his house in Buenos Aires, Argentina, early on Monday. He was found dead with a gunshot to the head at his home on Sunday . 'I'm convinced that it was not suicide,' Kirchner said. 'Prosecutor Nisman's charges were never in themselves the true operation against the government. 'They collapsed early on. Nisman did not know it and probably never knew it. 'The true operation against the government was the prosecutor's death after accusing the president, her foreign minister, and the secretary-general of (her political faction) of covering up for the Iranians accused in the AMIA attack,' she said. Kirchner offered no evidence to support her theory and did not say who she thought was behind Nisman's death. Before his death, Nisman had filed a 280-page complaint charging that Kirchner had issued an 'express directive' to shield a group of Iranian suspects in the bombing. Nisman contended that the government had agreed to swap grain for oil with Tehran in exchange for withdrawing 'red notices' to Interpol seeking the arrests of the former and current Iranian officials accused in the case. People gather outside the headquarters of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) during a demonstration to demand justice over the death of Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman in Buenos Aires . Firefighters and rescue workers search through the rubble of the Buenos Aires Jewish Community centre in this July 18, 1994 picture after a car bomb rocked the building, killing 84 people and injuring 300 others. Mr Nisman believes there has been a cover-up over finding the culprits . The attack on the Buenos Aires headquarters of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association, or AMIA, was the deadliest terror strike in Argentina's history. Eighty-four people were killed and more than 300 injured when a van loaded with explosives was detonated in front of the building. Since 2006, Argentine courts have demanded the extradition of eight Iranians, including former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former defense minister Ahmad Vahidi and Iran's former cultural attache in Buenos Aires, Mohsen Rabbani, over the bombing. But in 2013, Kirchner signed a memorandum of understanding with Tehran agreeing to set up a 'truth commission' to investigate the bombing and allowing Argentine prosecutors to question the suspects in Iran. The rapprochement was vehemently opposed at the time by Jewish community leaders, who charged it was 'unconstitutional.'","Alberto Nisman found dead at his home with a gunshot wound to his head .

"Up to half of California's big trees have disappeared in the past 90 years, according to a new study, which claims that decreases in water brought about by climate change may be to blame. Scientists from the University of California and others compared forest surveys from the 1920s and 30s with recent U.S Forest Service data and found that there had been a huge decrease in the density of large trees in the state. California is famous for its giant redwoods, pine and oak trees but smaller trees are becoming increasingly common in the state. Up to half of California's big trees have disappeared in the past 90 years, according to a new study. Pictured is the state's 'Avenue of the Giants' 'Older, larger trees are declining because of disease, drought, logging and other factors, but what stands out is that this decline is statewide,' said study leader Patrick McIntyre. 'Forests are becoming dominated by smaller, more densely packed trees, and oaks are becoming more dominant as pines decline.' The authors, which include scientists from UC Davis and the U.S. Geological Survey, found that the density of large trees declined in all regions of California, with declines of up to 50 per cent in the Sierra Nevada highlands, the south and central coast ranges and northern California. They believe that water deficit, which is linked to climate change, may be a factor in the demise of the state's imposing trees. California is famous for its giant redwoods - such as General Grant, the third largest recorded tree by volume in the world - pine and oak trees, but smaller trees are becoming increasingly common . A picture taken in 1940 of a redwood tree in California that's had a road cut through it . 'Based on our data, water stress helps to explain the decline of large trees,' McIntyre said. 'Areas experiencing declines in large-tree density also experienced increased water stress since the 1930s.' Co-author David Ackerly, a professor of integrative biology, said that stressed forests and the loss of large trees could exacerbate the global carbon situation, especially since many are hoping that forests will soak up more and more fossil fuel emissions. 'There's no question that if you are losing large trees, you are losing the standing carbon in the forest,' he said. 'Loss of these big trees and the impact of drought stress become a big concern going forward in terms of its impact on the carbon cycle; they can turn a carbon sink into a source of carbon released to the atmosphere.' The results, the authors say, may help forecast future forest responses to climate change, and in particular suggest that increased temperatures and changing water availability may lead to large-scale changes in forest composition throughout western North America. Redwood trees, which are native to California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, are the world's largest by volume reaching heights of 274.9 feet (84.2 metres) and a ground level girth of 109 feet (33 metres). The oldest known Giant Sequoia based on its ring count is 3,500 years old. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. At an exhibtion in San Diego, a trunk slice of a huge Sequoia tree was exhibited, measuring 4 meters in diameter. It stems from a tree  1,510 years old .","Scientists from University of California reveal huge decline in big trees .

"Christina Annesley (pictured) has died while backpacking through Thailand, the Foreign Office confirmed . The devastated mother of a British backpacker who died while travelling in Thailand has paid tribute to her 'beautiful' daughter. Christina Annesley, 23, from Orpington in south London, was part-way through a four-month trip across south-east Asia when she died on Wednesday. She was found dead on the island of Koh Tao- the same location where British backpackers David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found murdered last September. Christina's mother Margaret  gave her cause of death as 'natural causes' today. Posting on her daughter's Facebook page, she wrote: 'We have lost our beautiful daughter Chrissie in Thailand of natural causes. 'We are totally devastated. We love you so much darling, rest in peace. We will bring you home soon xxxxxxxxxx Mum and Dad.' Boyfriend Olly wrote: 'I'll never stop missing you darling. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me most. You were my inspiration. I love you.' Her tweets, sent on Monday, reveal she was on the island of Koh Tao in Thailand. Christina flew out on her trip, which was scheduled to last around four months, on January 7. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'We can confirm the death of a British National in Thailand on 21 January 2014. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Just days before her death, prolific tweeter Christina was telling her 3,500 followers about her trip to Thailand, and also posted about needing antibiotics for a chest infection. On Monday she tweeted: 'Great, just as I finally make friends I have to shell out £60 for antibiotics and now can't afford to go out with them. F*** everything.' Christina, of Orpington, south London, was holidaying in the South East Asian country as part of a four-month tour of the region when she died  on Wednesday . Christina also used Ask.fm and on her page, where she had posted almost 2000 answers to posed questions, she wrote that she was suffering from a chest infection. On January 11, she wrote 'I have a chest infection and a hangover which is quite an unpleasant combination.' Christina, who tweeted under the name 'Gap Yah Christinah' posted a series of messages on January 16 about her travels. She wrote: 'Already sick of hostels. There's no place space to wander around naked getting ready, the showers smell like crap and everyone here is weird. 'I know I'll get over it and I'm incredibly privileged and blah blah blah, but if you can't moan here where else can you. 'Anyway I'm off to the beach and sulk and look at beautiful scenery and mong out on valium.' Five days later on January she posted a series of tweets about her trip. She wrote: 'I need to bloody cheer the f***ing f*** up and realise how privileged I am to be here and go to the beach and be happy. Any other tips?

On the London Liberty League Facebook page, pal Victoria Monro wrote: 'There aren't words to do her justice or to tell you how inspiring she was to young people trying to help further a libertarian, or freedom-based, future. She was lively and likeable, friendly and supportive. 'Christina was a wonderful friend to Liberty League, attending our conferences, and being such a positive, welcoming and entertaining character. 'She was principled, and true to her convictions - a rare trait. 'But more importantly than all of this, she was a strong, kind woman, with so much potential. She brightened up the room with her wit and charm. 'And if you follow her on Twitter, you know she wasn't just like that in person. 'It's a sad day to lose such a great person, a committed activist, and good friend. Rest in peace, Chrissie.'

After reuniting, Miss Meadows and Mr Vines have become best friends once again - and she has even shaved her head in support of him. Mr Vines has battled two brain tumours, one affecting his eye sight - as well as spinal cancer which left him unable to walk. But thanks to rounds of chemotherapy and numerous operations, the pair are looking forward to the future following his cancer free results.

Miss Meadows said: 'Me and Neil first met each other at play group and even though we grew apart after school, I was devastated when I heard he had been diagnosed with a brain tumour. 'I first got in touch with Neil over Facebook and I arranged to catch up with him at his house. 'From there we exchanged numbers and arranged cinema and coffee outings, it was nice being able to go out, spend time together and build a strong bond between the both of us. 'He was a healthy personal trainer, working out in Crete living life to the full so it was a sudden huge shock for him, his family and everyone who knew him.

'I speak to him on a daily basis and I always try to pop round to his house to see him when I can. 'Neil has just beaten his second tumour that was close to the front of his brain, he is currently free of the tumour and we are all so happy for him as he deserved this recent news.' Mr Vines was first diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour that had spread to his spine in 2012 after suffering severe headaches and neck pains. He was working abroad at the time but once returned to the UK he underwent tests that led to his diagnosis. Miss Meadows added: 'After operations, intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy Neil was then left unable to walk, however once his treatment had finished he was overly determined to get back on his feet. A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiply in an abnormal way. There are  brain tumours known as 'benign' tumours, which are not cancerous and tend to stay in one place. However, Mr Vines had another type of brain tumour which was cancerous. Cancerous brain tumours  are generally fast-growing and can spread to other areas of the brain and spinal cord, such as in Mr Vine’s case. There are about 5,000 new cases of cancerous brain tumours in the UK each year. People with this type of cancer usually have surgery to have as much of the tumour removed as possible. This may be followed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of both. However, malignant tumours will often return. Steroids are also often prescribed for brain tumours to reduce swelling in the brain. The brain tumour takes up space inside the skull and can increase the pressure inside the head. This can cause headaches, sickness and seizures. Steroids are powerful anti inflammatory drugs which can stop the swelling. However, one of the side affects of steroids is weight gain and water retention, which is why Mr Vines’ appearance changed. Sources: NHS Choices and Cancer Research UK . Mr Vines pictured raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust  after his first brain tumour . Joanna and Neil after his first brain tumour diagnosis. He said: 'Neil is my inspiration and he has changed my whole outlook on life' She said: 'His one eyelid is stitched together and his whole body has swelled up due to the steroid treatment. He has suffered all sorts of side affects. He isn't scared anymore, he is always fighting back whatever life throws at him and has never asked ""why me?""' 'Just when we all thought his battle was finally over, a routine scan revealed that he had a second tumour near the front of his brain. 'Neil needed further treatment and was put on a high dose of steroids to reduce the swelling on his brain. 'Myself and Neil's supportive family and friends felt helpless as we watched him go through his traumatic battle but everyone has been fantastic in being there every step of the way' After her head shave she said: 'My hair means a lot to me but after everything Neil has been through it was something I was adamant I wanted to do' 'His one eyelid is stitched together and his whole body has swelled up due to the steroid treatment. He has suffered all sorts of side affects. 'He isn't scared anymore, he is always fighting back whatever life throws at him and has never asked 'why me?' 'Neil is my inspiration and he has changed my whole outlook on life.' She decided to shave her hair off to help raise funds for the charity that has helped Neil throughout his ordeal, The Teenage Cancer Trust. She added: 'My hair means a lot to me but after everything Neil has been through it was something I was adamant I wanted to do. 'I thought about doing a charity walk but I needed to do something that would really catch people's attention. 'Neil had no choice about losing his hair so I thought I would shave mine too and prove a point that it doesn't matter what you look like it's the person you are inside that matters' 'So far I have raised just over £1,250 in total for the trust but I want to keep going, Neil is so proud of the funds I have achieved so far. ' The pair are looking forward to 2015 and seeing his health continue to improve - and Mr Vines hopes to get back to walking and running as soon as possible. She added: 'Neil is having help to regain his strength and balance to walk again at the moment and we have decided to do a 5k run together, I have every faith in him that he can do it. 'I just pray and hope for a miracle that this is the end of Neil's cancer journey, I'll always be at Neil's side, we are best friends now. 'He gives me just as much support as I give back. I really do love him, words can't describe what an amazing young man he is and I'm so glad to have him in my life.' Mr Vines has written a book documenting his journey called Powerful Beyond Measure.

"A range of dinosaur t-shirts aimed only at boys has landed both Marks and Spencer and the Natural History Museum at the centre of a sexism row. The store has been accused of 'gender stereotyping' and sending a 'perplexing message' to girls with the clothing line, produced in partnership with the London Museum. 'It is a real shame that children are being told implicitly what is for them and what is not,' said Ruth Lopardo, co-founder of Let Clothes Be Clothes. Marks and Spencer has found itself at the centre of a sexism row over its range of dinosaur clothing, produced in partnership with the Natural History Museum, aimed only at boys . 'All kids like dinosaurs. I am sure we can all remember the excitement of going to the Natural History Museum and seeing those great big skeletons and I don't think that is gender dependent. 'If Marks and Spencer is doing a range with the Natural History Museum, I cannot understand why they are limiting their market by half. 'It is perplexing message to send to girls at a time when the government are worried about the lack of women going into science and technology professions.' The campaign group has called for the range, which includes pyjamas, t-shirts and underwear,  to be extended to include items for girls. Campaigners say the range is sending a 'perplexing message' to girls . It is currently priced between  £8 and £18 and aimed at boys four to 14 years. They claim a Marks and Spencer customer service representative told them: 'As a Science enthusiast myself, I'm also a little unhappy to see that the range only caters for boys. Please be aware therefore that I have passed your comments onto our Kidswear Team.' Harriet Vickers who is a Second Year General Engineering degree student at Durham University and also on the WISE Young Women's Board said: 'I think the key point to pick out from this debate is choice. 'Providing children the opportunity to choose clothing that appeals to them because they are genuinely interested in the subject matter it depicts and not because they feel they feel inclined to choose it as it in the 'Girls' or 'Boys' section of a store. 'I don't feel it's a case of girls' clothing aiming to be similar to a boys range, but providing range which maximises option for both girls and boys. And parents are key to ensuring children feel confident to wear what they want especially when it comes to things that are seen as breaking stereo-types.' A spokesman for Marks and Spencer said that their design team was working with the National History Museum to expand the range to include products for girls. An M&S spokesperson said: 'This is a brand new partnership and, as with any new range, we have listened carefully to feedback from our customers on how they would like to see it evolve. 'Our design team is currently working with the Natural History Museum on expanding the range to include products for girls.'

"New documents lay bare Britain’s collusion with Libya in the systemic rendition, torture and harassment of Colonel Gaddafi’s enemies, the Daily Mail can reveal. Court papers detail the extent to which the UK ‘illegally’ used information extracted from prisoners abused in Libyan jails to try to deport enemies of the dictator who had been given political asylum here. Spies for MI5 and MI6 worked closely with the regime to target 12 exiled dissidents. Shameful new evidence of Britain’s collusion with Libya in the systemic rendition, torture and harassment of Colonel Gaddafi’s enemies is here laid bare by the Mail . In one instance, it is claimed, an intelligence agent quizzed a British citizen captured by the Saudi authorities over his links to a Libyan terror group – and turned a blind eye to his desperate pleas that he was being tortured. The court papers raise fresh questions about the extent to which the Blair Government was complicit in the abuse of terror suspects and the scale to which UK involvement has been covered up. They also appear to highlight flagrant breaches of laws supposed to protect political refugees, their families and friends. The crackdown began after Tony Blair cosied up to Gaddafi as part of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’ in March 2004, believing the ruthless dictator would help in the fight against Al Qaeda. After the Government lost a legal bid yesterday to throw out the victims’ damages case, the Mail can reveal: . British intelligence agents were allegedly complicit in a secret policy of ‘torture by proxy’ by providing questions for Libyan interrogators to ask detainees. Documents detailing the collusion between Britain, the US and Libya were found in the bombed-out Tripoli residence of the British ambassador and in the office of the head of Libyan intelligence after the Gaddafi regime crumbled in September 2011. The abuse took place in Libya's Tajoura and Abu Salim prisons, the latter, in Tripoli, is pictured above . The front gate at the Tajoura Al Ahdath Prison; four of the 12 dissidents taking court action, claim they Britain was 'complicit in their arrest, detention and torture' in Libya and Saudi Arabia . Ministers tried to deport Libyan dissidents back into Gaddafi’s clutches despite knowing they faced a ‘real risk’ of being imprisoned and abused, court papers claim . The 12 dissidents – at least nine of whom were British citizens or residents – are suing MI5, MI6, the Attorney General, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary for false imprisonment, assault, misfeasance in public office and negligence. Five claim they were unlawfully detained pending deportation.When that was blocked by judges because they faced torture in Libya, they were wrongly placed under control orders. Four say Britain was ‘complicit in their arrest, detention and torture’ in Libya and Saudi Arabia. One alleges MI5 gave direct help to Libyan agents working in the UK by threatening him with detention if he did not turn informer. Two, who were linked to a Muslim charity, claim they were wrongly put on a UN list of Al Qaeda sympathisers and had their assets frozen for years. In most cases, it is claimed, the UK took action against the men based on information obtained under torture from two prisoners handed to Libya via the CIA’s unlawful ‘extraordinary rendition’ programme. Abdelhakim Belhadj and Sami Al Saadi were part of an anti-Gaddafi group. Britain has already paid Mr Saadi £2.2million compensation after he took legal action over the Secret Intelligence Service’s role in his abduction, imprisonment and mistreatment by Libya. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK. The legal battle raises the prospect of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 spy, being called to court to give evidence. A Government spokesman said last night it ‘noted’ the High Court judgment but declined to comment further. Mr Blair believed Gaddafi, who renounced weapons of mass destruction, would provide invaluable help in the fight against Al Qaeda. MI6 requested ‘detailed information… however trivial’ from Islamic detainees in Libya, including about LIFG members in the UK; Blair is pictured above embracing Gaddafi in May 2007 .","British intelligence agents provided 1,600 questions to ask detainees .

"Barbara Kirby, of Leesburg, (pictured) is accused of having sex with two minors . A 36-year-old Florida woman charged with having sex with a minor allegedly told the boy 'age is just a number'. Barbara Kirby, of Leesburg, also threatened to kill the minor, who is aged between 12 and 15, if he told anyone of their encounter, according to an affidavit. The boy told police Kirby had given him an intoxicating drink in her home before they had sex. He said that after having the drink on December 11, he felt dizzy and passed out. When he woke up, Kirby undressed and had sex with him, the New York Daily News reports. She  allegedly then warned the victim, 'if you tell anyone about what we did, I will kill you.' He went to police two days later. An officer said that the boy admitted in interview he had been scared by Kirby's threats which is why he had not immediately gone to police or told anyone of the incident. An affidavit said a second boy told a similar story in December about having sex with Kirby after being given the intoxicating drink. Kirby was arrested Tuesday after officers noticed her car during an unrelated call. She was charged with lewd battery  on a victim older than 12 but younger than 16 and tampering with a victim and is being held at Lake County Jail on $25,000 bail.

"David Cameron today confronted SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon over her promise to have her Scottish MPs vote on the future of the English NHS. The Prime Minister used a meeting in Edinburgh with the Scottish First Minister to make clear his anger at the idea that English laws should be decided by nationalists from north of the border. In his first speech in Scotland since the independence referendum, Mr Cameron promised to make Holyrood one of the 'most powerful devolved parliaments in the world'. David Cameron today met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to discus further devolution to Scotland . Mr Cameron's visit is designed to honour a 'vow' made in the final days of the independence campaign to hand more powers to Scots if they decided to stay in the Union. But it has been overshadowed by Ms Sturgeon's shock plan to end its long-standing policy of not voting on devolved issues such as health and education. A new Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found 52 per cent of Scots are planning to vote SNP in May. That would give the Nationalists an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out. It would shatter Labour's hopes of an overall majority, and would leave Ed Miliband reliant on SNP votes to pass laws - including those which only affect England. Paving the way for a power-sharing deal with Labour, Ms Sturgeon insisted any vote on the English NHS had knock-on effects in Scotland because the Edinburgh government’s budget is linked to Westminster spending. She said it was necessary to protect the Scottish NHS from the knock on effects of cuts and privatisation in England. The SNP leader told the BBC: ‘We would be prepared to vote on matters of English health because that has a direct impact on Scotland's budget. ‘So if there was a vote in the House of Commons to repeal the privatisation of the health service as has been seen in England to restore the National Health Service we would vote for that because that would help to protect Scotland's budget. ‘If there are decisions taken to further privatise the NHS in England, and I don't think anybody thinks the Tories are progressively privatising the health service in order to increase the public funding of the health service, so decisions are taken, that reduce over time the public funding of the health service in England then that has a direct knock on effect to Scotland's budget.’ The Prime Minister visited new building work at Edinburgh Airport before setting out details of his pledge for more powers for the Scottish Parliament . Tory defence minister Anna Soubry branded the remarks 'complete twaddle' and warned Ms Sturgeon was putting the Union at risk again. 'She doesn't even understand what's happened and this nonsense - and it is a nonsense - that the Conservatives are on some wide-scale privatisation of the NHS. She puts our Union at risk again and plays with dangerous stuff.' Mr Cameron sought to repaid the damage caused by the referendum campaign when he reveals the draft clauses that will underpin the devoltion of new powers to Scotland. The Tory leader stressed that these new powers are 'guaranteed', regardless of who wins May's general election . Mr Cameron promised the Scottish Parliament will be able to 'combine the freedom to decide what happens in Scotland's schools, hospitals, surgeries and police stations and the responsibility of determining how around 60 per cent of public money in Scotland is spent'. He declared: 'The Scottish Parliament will have more control of its tax and spending - making it one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world. 'For the first time - the majority of the money the Scottish Parliament spends will be raised right here in Scotland. 'This includes a substantial new package of welfare powers - worth £2.5 billion - to tackle long term unemployment, disability and poverty. 'We've already moved to allow the Scottish Parliament to extend its franchise so 16 and 17 year olds could vote at the 2016 Holyrood elections and here we are stating in law the permanence of the Scottish Parliament - so there can never be any question: Holyrood is here to stay.' With Scots having voted to stay part of the UK in last September's independence vote, Mr Cameron claimed that decision 'wasn't just about the future of devolution' adding that people north of the border value 'the safety and security of being part of something bigger, our family of nations'. Mr Cameron said in the referendum campaign 'the leaders of the other main political parties and I promised extensive new powers for the Scottish Parliament - a vow - with a clear process and timetable'. He added: 'We said a command paper would be ready by the end of October - and it was. 'We said we'd get cross-party agreement by St. Andrew's Day - and we did. 'We said draft legislation would be published by Burns Night - and here we are, three days before the celebrations start, with those clauses before us.' But the SNP claims the new powers do not go far enough. Scottish Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who was on the Commission along with representatives from Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, said: 'The proposals which Mr Cameron publishes today must live up to the word and spirit of the Smith Commission. Scotland should not - and will not - accept anything less. 'While the Smith Commission recommendations did not go as far as we wanted, and do not live up to the 'vow' made before the independence referendum, we welcome them, and they must now be delivered in full.' The latest IpsosMORI opinion poll suggests the SNP could will an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out . Mr Swinney said there is still 'a long way to go before these proposals are put into law'. He added: 'What we have today is the start of the process to develop a Westminster Bill which has widespread support for introduction shortly after this year's general election. 'We will be working closely with stakeholders to ensure these proposals are right for Scotland and that they reflect the views of ordinary people. The Scottish Government is focused on securing economic growth, tackling inequality and protecting our public services, and the new powers being delivered must help deliver those goals. 'We will carefully examine today's paper, because anything which backtracks, waters down or falls short of what Lord Smith recommended would be unacceptable - and ultimately it is the people of Scotland who will determine if these proposals go far enough.' Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said after the referendum campaign 'as promised the UK has today delivered unprecedented new powers for Scotland, which make it one of the most powerful devolved administrations in the OECD'. The Liberal Democrat said: 'The next steps are clear: the Scottish Government and Parliament will soon have these powers, and it needs to ensure that it implements them in a way that works for Scotland, including by looking at further devolution within the country, as recommended by Lord Smith. 'Devolution doesn't just mean the flow of powers from one Parliament to another. Devolution is about empowering our regions and our communities across Scotland and the UK.'","Prime Minister to use speech in Edinburgh to set out powers for Scotland .

"It is a common problem, someone delivering a package realises the recipient isn't home and is forced to take alternative action. But CCTV footage outside one home in Brighton appears to show this delivery man taking a somewhat unorthodox approach to the situation. After knocking on the door to no avail, he signs for the package himself, before leaving it hidden in the customer's garage. Breaking the rules: A delivery man is spotted on CCTV camera signing for a package on behalf of a family when they are away . The date stamp on the video shows the delivery taking place on December 4 last year. Despite leaving the package behind, the courier, working for Parcelforce, failed to inform the homeowner Ewan Cassidy, 49, where his parcel was. Consequently, Ewan says he 'spent days chasing the delivery' with the delivery company, part of the Royal Mail Group, because he had no clue it was waiting for him at home all along. 'When we called, we were told it has been delivered and we signed for it, making out we were trying to pull a fast one. Is that his signature move? After forging their name, he opens up their garage and drops off the parcel . However, once the company got back to him confirming the date and time of the drop off, Ewan was able to check their CCTV and discover just what had happened to his order - which contained a control desk for a lighting company. 'You can't just go into somebody's property,' Ewan adds, 'It's illegal as is forging someone's signature. 'The garage doors were locked but he somehow managed to wiggle it open which has highlighted a weakness that I have since tended to.' After complaining to customer service about the delivery man's actions, he was reassured that the action was a 'serious issue' and soon learned that the courier was sacked. Parcelforce has told MailOnline: 'We always seek to provide the highest levels of service for our customers and are disappointed that our employee did not follow the correct procedures on this occasion. 'We fully investigated the matter and took appropriate disciplinary action. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused to the customer.' A good deed? Whether he thought he was being helpful by dropping off the parcel or merely was being too lazy to take it back to his van, the courier did not get a good response from the residents . 'We spent days chasing the delivery!' Since he left no note, the family were unaware that their parcel had arrived .","Parcelforce delivery man can be seen waiting for door to be answered .

"An Ohio inmate given psychological medication meant for another man with the same name over a two-week period began feeling suicidal and was hospitalized for two days afterward, his sister said. An investigation was underway into how the mix-up happened in November at the Lucas County jail in Toledo. 'It was a mistake, and it certainly shouldn't have occurred,' said county Sheriff John Tharp, who confirmed the mix-up but said he could not release many details. An Ohio inmate from Lucas County Jail (pictured) was hospitalized after being given the wrong medication - meant for another man with the same name . The jail's nursing staff gave the inmate six or seven of the wrong medications three times a day instead of just his usual dose of extra-strength aspirin for headaches, said Natasha Butler, the man's sister. 'He went on ahead and took them because he felt like, I guess, they were his medications,' she told The Blade newspaper in Toledo. 'He probably thought it was the Tylenol or something. He took it and accepted it.' The extra medications were to treat psychological disorders, but the other inmate with the same name already had been released from the jail, she said. Her brother, who has been in jail since October after being charged in several vehicle break-ins, started feeling suicidal after taking the medicine in November. Last week he was hospitalized for two days because of the improper medications even though they had been stopped, Butler said. She said her brother is better now. Inmates at the jail wear wristbands with identifying information, including their birth-date and booking number.

"A backyard cabin owned by a lottery millionaire is set to be destroyed in a council crackdown on 'beds in sheds' landlords - despite him insisting it is used for parties. George Traykov, a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team, who has scooped more than £1.1million in EuroMillions wins, was investigated by Hounslow council for allegedly renting out unauthorised dwellings. Council officers raided the £290,000 property in Feltham, south west London, last week and have now obtained a demolition order. They say the building, which has a kitchen and central heating, was among a number of beds in sheds being rented out for up to £200-a-week. Mr Traykov, who has lived in the UK for about 20 years, denies he acted illegally and said the house was used merely for 'storage and parties'. Scroll down for video . Hounslow council investigated this £290,000 property in Feltham and have now obtained a demolition order . Mr Traykov denies he acted illegally and said the house was used merely for 'storage and parties' Mr Traykov, who has scooped more than £1m from lottery wins, lives with his fiancee Emilia Vazheva, 20 . Mr Traykov was also ordered to stop using a shed as a residential dwelling at a separate property by Harrow council earlier this year. He was investigation by council staff after the cabin - which had a kitchen, toilet and bedroom - was discovered. It was detected after officials used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures. Speaking to the London Evening Standard at the £350,000 home in Ilford where he lives with his 20-year-old fiancée Emilia Vazheva, Mr Traykov, 47, said of last week's raid: 'My relatives are living in the house while it is being renovated. They are not paying rent. 'The outbuilding has been there since I bought it. This is not a living area where people live and sleep. I had parties there, I had gatherings there, it is a playroom. I use it for storage. 'The council assumes something and they raid the property. No one has come to me to ask me.' The former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team beat odds of one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize in 2013 to add to the £1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in 2011 . Neighbours said they had made repeated complaints about Eastern European immigrants living in the shed and the most recent occupants were a couple with a young child. Steve Curran, Leader of Hounslow council, told the Evening Standard: 'We will be remorseless in our war on rogue landlords who are exploiting some of the most vulnerable people in London.' Last week's operation is one of a series of crackdowns. Last month Hounslow council officers discovered up to 40 illegally converted beds in sheds, housing over 70 tenants — including four suspected illegal immigrants.","Cabin owned by lottery millionaire George Traykov set to be destroyed .

"A thug who bit a Tesco worker's hand and fought with staff after jumping the queue during 'Black Friday' sales has been jailed for four months. Michael Anthony Dowd, 28, pleaded guilty after threatening to smash a female assistant's face in and then turning to punch a male member of staff. He was wrestled to the ground, but continued to kick out and then bit the hand of one of the staff members who kept him restrained until police arrived at the store in Salford, Greater Manchester. The 22-year-old had previous convictions for violence in 2012 and 2013 and was described as 'not quite right' by Tesco staff who restrained him at the sore in Fairhills, Irlam. Michael Anthony Dowd, 28, pleaded guilty after threatening to smash a female assistant's face in and then turning to punch a male member of staff . Dowd repeatedly claimed he had no recollection of what he had done and the Manchester Magistrates Court heard he had been intoxicated during the incident on November 28 last year. He pleaded guilty to assault and using threatening or abusive words and behaviour at an earlier hearing. Defence attorney Abigail Henry told the court her client had been drunk at the time of the incident and had since referred himself for help for his alcohol abuse. But District Judge Mark Hadfield told Dowd he had no option but to jail him because he had broken the terms of two previous suspended sentences for violence in the last three years. He was wrestled to the ground, but continued to kick out at the store in Salford, Greater Manchester . Stores across Britain were left looking like battlefields as shoppers fought to get the best bargains, pictured two women fighting over a discount TV . Sentencing Dowd to 16 weeks in prison, he told him: 'You were spoken to because a member of staff thought you were trying to queue jump. 'You responded in a manner wholly unacceptable. When a member of staff tried to intervene he was punched for his trouble. 'You have previous convictions for violent offences with suspended sentences in 2012 and 2013 and you breached both these offences.' Stores across Britain were left looking like battlefields as shoppers fought to get the best bargains on Black Friday - the busiest shopping day of the year. One Tesco branch in Manchester had to be closed just 36 minutes after opening due to fighting. Two other customers were arrested for public order offences by officers in Manchester, who dealt with some of the worst scenes of violence on the biggest day of discount shopping in the year. There were also reports of staff being left in tears in Cardiff, while another female staff member was apparently given a black eye following a melee in Stretford.

"These dramatic pictures show the aftermath of a brazen robbery where thieves used a JCB digger to rip a cash machine from a Co-op supermarket. The thieves left a trail of destruction after the ATM was forced from the wall of the Co-op store in Haxby, York, at around 2.25am this morning. They then made their escape in a pick-up truck - leaving the JCB in front of the demolished shop. Thieves smashed through this Co-op store in Haxby, York using a JCB digger, which was left at the scene . After they had ripped the ATM from the wall, the thieves left in a truck, leaving the JCB in front of the store . The Co-op in Haxby, York, was targeted at 2.25am today and follows a string of similar attacks elsewhere . Police are making inquiries to identify the people - believed to be a group of three to four men - and are urging any witnesses to come forward. Amanda Nicholson, who lives opposite the shop, said she and her husband were woken just before 2.30am and called police. She said: 'I saw a tractor or a fork-lift type vehicle going backwards and forwards into the building, and then the wall fell in. 'The cash machine fell on to the floor, and they picked it up and plonked it on the back of a truck. 'The roof fell down and nearly hit one of the raiders, but he jumped out of the way just in time.' They are currently reviewing the CCTV footage, a spokesman for the force said. Detective Inspector Andrea Kell from York CID said: 'The investigation is at a very early stage and we are trying to gather as much information as possible to help with our inquiries. 'I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area in the early hours of Thursday morning to get in touch with the police or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.' Jenny Bell, from Haxby Town Council, said: 'A JCB drove into the front of the Co-op store. It's still there and whoever did it has taken away the cash machine. 'The cash machine is now missing. How they took it away I do not know.' The Co-op in Haxby, York, as it usually looks - it was attacked to the left side of the store with a JCB digger . At around the same time, thieves targeted a cash machine at the Co-op in Ibstock, Leicestershire - the latest in a spate of similar attacks in the county. There have also been a spate of similar robberies elsewhere in the country. In November thieves used a digger to smash through the brick wall of Warner's Budgens in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, before fleeing the scene with the ATM. In the same month, thieves pulled away bricks leaving a gaping hole in the side of a Co-op supermarket in Sapcote, Leicestershire, which took just 20 seconds. Similar to the robbery in York, the digger was left at the scene. Thieves also ploughed a stolen JCB digger in to a Marks & Spencer store before stealing the cash machine at Malvern Retail Park in Worcestershire. On each occasion, the thieves carried out the attack in the early hours of the morning.","Thieves used a JCB digger to steal the cash machine in Haxby, York .

"A woman who endured ten years of torment by bullies for being too fat has now gone on to showcase her curves as a plus size beauty queen. Serena Francois, 23, from Bedford, Bedfordshire, was teased for a decade by her classmates who dubbed her 'afrogirl'. The attacks took their toll on Serena leaving her with very low self-esteem and a fear of using public transport after the campaign of terror. Serena Francois endured a decade of verbal and physical abuse while at school (left) in Bedford but has since defied her bullies and will compete in the Ms Curvaceous UK awards later this month (right) As well as mental bullying Serena was also the victim of several physical attacks throughout her time at the Catholic junior school she attended in Bedford . The model was scarred for life when a girl dug her fingernails into the her arm and the incident left her traumatised. The abuse continued in high school when she was branded 'fat' and one serious attack almost lost her eye sight. Serena was pushed over by one of her tormentors, smashing her eye socket against a table and leaving doctors fearing for her vision. Serena found a new lease of life when she discovered plus size modelling . And the abuse was so upsetting for the teenager that she feared attending school and her grades plummeted, forcing her mother to fork out for private tuition. Serena says that the attacks were not only traumatising for herself but were also having an adverse effect on her family members. 'It was really quite upsetting. I was so scared of school. 'My mum and nan were suffering anxiety attacks and I couldn't go out. I was so traumatised I couldn't even get on a bus.' The bully victim couldn't even rely on respite when she left school as her first boyfriend verbally abused her. Serena, pictured left and right when she was younger, became terrified of going to school as she was dubbed 'afrogirl' and teased about her weight . In one terrifying attack Serena, pictured during her school years, was almost blinded after she was pushed to the ground and hit her eye socked against a table leaving doctors fearing for her sight . Despite the constant put-downs Serena always dreamed of a modelling career and, although she finished in the top 10 of the Miss Bedford contest in 2013, she struggled to break into the world of modelling. 'I had done some local work but I was starting to wonder if this wasn't for me.' It wasn't until Serena found a particular niche that she really found her talent in the modelling industry. 'My mum suggested that I Googled 'plus-size models' and there it was, the answer I was looking for. 'I applied for Miss Curvaceous at the end of last year and then faced the nerve-wracking wait because the organisers just released the pictures of the girls who were through to the final over Christmas. The beauty queen has now overcome her fears of education and returned to Bedford college to finish her A-levels and she now has qualified as a holistic beauty therapist . 'It was such an amazing feeling to be chosen.' The size 14 beauty queen will now take part in the Ms Curvaceous UK modelling competition at Canary Wharf, London, on January 31. As well as her modelling success Serena has now transformed her life and conquered her fear of education to return to Bedford College to finish A-levels and volunteer part-time helping children with autism. She has also gone on to study at university and qualify as a holistic beauty therapist - but insists that winning the Ms Curvaceous 2015 competition would be her biggest achievement yet. 'I really want to win now. I have the fire and the power to win it all after all I have been through. 'And I don't want to be just a model either. I want to be a role model for all the outsiders and other kids who've had to put up with this.'","Serena Francois, 23, suffered years of verbal and physical abuse .

"The PM knows that Nando’s — the fast food chain that’s spreading across the country like wildfire — crosses class, political and ethnic divisions . Forget the NHS, tax cuts or TV debates. The way to win British people’s hearts at the next election is through their stomachs. When David Cameron told a hip youth radio station this week he’d like to take world leaders to lunch at Nando’s — rather than a Harvester or a Gordon Ramsay restaurant — he knew what he was talking about. Not only has he visited a Bristol outlet of Nando’s — the fast food chicken chain that’s spreading across the country like wildfire — but he also knows that the restaurant crosses class, political and ethnic divisions. Whoever gets the Nando’s vote at the election will sweep the nation. There are 333 Nando’s outlets in Britain; 1,000 in all, in 35 countries. Main markets are Britain, Australia and South Africa. But Nando’s is big in America, too. When President Obama spoke at the University of Cape Town in 2013, he said of the South African chain: ‘In America, we see the reach of your culture — we’ve got a Nando’s a couple of blocks from the White House.’ What is the special ingredient that explains the chain’s extraordinary success? The literal answer is its peri-peri sauce. Peri-peri — Swahili for ‘pepper- pepper’ — originally comes from Mozambique, where the sauce was adopted by Portuguese colonials. The ingredients are a secret combination of hot chilli pepper, lemon, garlic, herbs and spices. The restaurant’s chickens — fresh, never frozen — are trimmed of fat, marinated overnight, and regularly basted with the peri-peri sauce while being flame-grilled. It isn’t just the peri-peri sauce, though. When it opened in Britain in 1992, Nando’s hit the sweet spot of High Street dining through a combination of luck and hard-headed analysis of how to make money in the unpredictable restaurant trade. First — price. Nando’s is a little more expensive than McDonald’s or KFC, but healthier, and far cheaper than any fancy restaurant. Four boneless, flame-grilled chicken thighs plus rice and salad — yours for £10.25. On top of that, you get much more of a restaurant feel than the usual fast-food chains. A waiter shows you to your table; you order at the counter; the waiter brings you your food, with china plates and proper knives and forks. Service is extremely quick — crucial in our I-want-it-now culture; handy, too, for harassed parents with demanding children. ‘Fast-casual dining’ is the buzzword of the modern restaurant business, and Nando’s has nailed the trend. There is variety on the menu: you can choose how spicy you want your chicken, from plain to extra-hot. And there are other dishes: veggie burgers, steak rolls, mushroom and halloumi dishes and different salads. But on the whole, the only big choices customers make are the size and type of the chicken portion — quarters, halves, wholes, butterfly breasts, thighs, legs, wings, chicken livers and chicken burgers — and what sauce they want. The Prime Minister posed for a selfie with Nandos diner Becky Smith after visiting the restaurant in Bristol . The Prime Minister tucked into half a chicken, chips, coleslaw - washed down with a glass of red wine - in a Nandos in Bristol  last year. He said this week he'd like to take world leaders for a dinner at the chicken chain . The chicken isn’t quite fully free-range, but it is ‘Red Tractor’ standard, which means it is British and approved by independent inspectors. Some outlets are franchised; others directly owned by the company. So it’s largely chicken, chicken and more chicken. And that leads to low overheads, a simple supply line and very little food thrown away. It’s a formula that has conquered the nation: from the PM to Prince Harry, who’s been seen in the Nando’s in Fulham — London’s epicentre of the Sloane world. The formula is also popular with young, black customers. The Muslim market, too, is catered for: halal chicken is available in 50 British outlets. The Nando’s marketing campaign is shrewd. The Armed Forces, NHS workers, policemen and firemen get a 20 per cent discount. And the latest wheeze is the mythical Nando’s High Five Card, aka the Black Card, which entitles its exclusive owners, and four of their friends, to Nando’s meals for life. Lewis Hamilton, Andy Murray and David Beckham are alleged to have a Black Card. Rapper Tinchy Stryder and Olympic boxer Nicola Adams confess to having one. Boxer David Haye and singer Ed Sheeran have apparently been photographed with one. And Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party Chairman, says he yearns for one. But in a brilliant bit of marketing, Nando’s refuses to admit the cards actually exist. So, hey presto, like Willy Wonka’s Golden Ticket in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, the Black Card enters the realm of dream, fantasy and magic. Not everyone in Nando’s higher echelons has cottoned on to the beauty of the myth. In 2013, UK marketing director Keri Perkins said: ‘No gifts are given on the condition of anyone plugging us. It’s just thank yous.’ But the co-founder of Nando’s goes along with the mystery of the Black Card. ‘It’s a rumour, I believe,’ Robert Brozin, 55, from Johannesburg, said this week. ‘I haven’t got one. It’s about time they gave me one. If it does exist, I’d like one.’ Nando’s keeps snowballing and plans to increase the number of British restaurants every year by 30 outlets, with the same number across the rest of the world . Brozin cooked up the whole Nando’s idea in 1987 when a friend, Fernando Duarte, took him to Chickenland, a cafe in a Johannesburg suburb. So knocked out was Brozin by the delicious chicken that he and Duarte borrowed £25,000 from family and friends to buy the cafe. They renamed it Nando’s, after Fernando. Despite having no restaurant experience — Brozin had failed his accountancy exams and was selling electrical goods — he had unwittingly struck gold. The founders quickly opened a second branch in Johannesburg. The chain retains strong South African links. Nando Duarte is in charge of the Johannesburg factory that produces all the company’s peri-peri sauce. And there is so much South African art in Nando’s restaurants worldwide that the chain claims to be the number one buyer of contemporary art from that country. When Brozin and Duarte opened a third branch in South Africa, the Enthoven family put £57,000 into the business. It was a shrewd investment: today, Brozin and the Enthovens are the principal shareholders in the multi-million-pound empire. For its first 15 years, Nando’s was touch and go: it often ran out of cash, and Brozin had to go cap in hand to his bank manager to exceed his overdraft. Between 1997 and 2003, the company was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but the share price never prospered. Since Nando’s has gone back into private hands, it has boomed. Brozin remains chief executive, but devotes most of his time to philanthropy, while his empire goes on growing. The outspoken tycoon still keeps an eye on the business and ensures the company sticks to what he calls the ‘don’t f*** withs’ of the business, which include Nando’s distinctive cockerel logo and the ‘people-centric business’. Nando’s made a £58.2 million profit in Britain in 2013 and is expanding. It’s making so much money that, some have claimed, it is legally sheltering millions in complicated offshore accounts to cut its British tax bill. The chain has denied this, saying it paid more than £12 million in corporation tax in 2013. Still, Nando’s keeps snowballing. It plans to increase the number of British restaurants every year by 30 outlets, with the same number across the rest of the world. Any politician who bottles that ever-growing peri-peri magic has got the keys to Downing Street for life.","Cameron told radio station he would like to take world leaders to Nando's .

"The euro has hit a twelve-year low against the dollar but American shoppers aren't going to see any benefit from the dip. According to economists there is simply too much demand in the U.S. for high-end European goods that companies will not be busting out discounts. Instead a reverse shift has been occurring. For example, Chanel's classic handbag, which was priced at $2,250 in 2007, cost $4,900 last year, according to Robert Burke and Associates, a luxury consulting firm. And Louis Vuitton's iconic monogram canvas handbag, which sold for $620 in 2007, climbed to $970 last year. Taste for luxury: According to economists there is simply too much demand in the U.S. for high-end European goods that companies will not be busting out discounts . The problem for Americans: They don't buy enough European goods, except for high-end products. Clothing might come from Bangladesh or Costa Rica, furniture from China and cars - even foreign brands like Honda - are mostly made at home. European brands tend to cater to higher income families who want to buy a bit of prestige. Take German cars. Brands like Audi, BMW and Mercedes are luxury products with strong demand. So there's no incentive to cut prices, says Karl Brauer, senior industry analyst for Kelley Blue Book. Audi sales rose 15 percent last year, while BMW sales were up 6.5 percent and Mercedes rose nearly 10 percent. Each company is likely to pocket the extra money from converting dollars to euros, no matter whether the cars are made overseas or in the U.S., Brauer says. Volkswagen, however, might use the weak Euro to reduce prices and boost struggling sales, Brauer says. VW's U.S. sales fell 3 percent last year even though overall U.S. auto sales across all brands grew 6 per cent. It's the same issue with, fine wines, Gucci handbags and those designer stiletto shoes. Bill Earle, president of the National Association of Beverage Importers, which represents 20 to 25 beer, wine and spirits importers, says the price of fancy wines  that are on the shelves now were already set three or four years ago when contracts were signed by U.S. importers. But he says if the disparity continues between the U.S. dollar and the euro, 'you might see a softening of prices.' At most, shoppers will see a two or three per cent price dip, says Faith Hope Consolo, who leads retail leasing and marketing at Prudential Douglas Elliman and specializes in the luxury market. 'Anecdotally, U.S. prices haven't gone down on European-made apparel and alcohol, though such declines would take some time to filter through the system,' Consolo says. 'We probably won't see the effects for several months.' That's because the production cycle for European brands takes about a year, so those so-called status products were already produced. Bitter taste: Bill Earle, president of the National Association of Beverage Importers,  says the price of wines that are on the shelves now were already set four years ago when contracts were signed by U.S. importers . No incentive to cut prices: Audi sales rose 15 percent last year, while BMW sales were up 6.5 percent and Mercedes rose nearly 10 percent . Moreover, Nate Herman, vice president of international trade for the American Apparel & Footwear Association, noted a shift in manufacturing away from Europe and more toward Asia - like China and Vietnam - as factories in that region have improved the quality of making complicated goods. 'We haven't seen any discernible decline,' he says. The one bright spot for Americans: vacations to Europe are now much cheaper. Thanks to the currency shift, travelers will pay less for hotel rooms, museum admissions and meals out. 'It's basically a 20 per cent-off sale on the whole eurozone for Americans,' says Adam Goldstein, CEO and co-founder of airfare search site Hipmunk. 'We're already seeing a significant increase in search activity for flights from the U.S. to Europe, which is a leading indicator of travel.' There are 19 countries that use the euro. So those considering deals should look at Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. 'This is the best time to travel to Europe in years,' says Anne Banas, executive editor of SmarterTravel. 'Americans can now indulge in a fancy pastry and chocolat chaud without the budget-busting guilt.' The catch: it will still cost a lot of money to get to Europe during peak summer months. Demand for travel is so strong that most airlines don't have to cut prices to sell seats. Back in April, the European currency was trading at 1.38 dollars to the euro. That means that one dollar bought you about 72 euro cents. Now the exchange rate is hovering around 1.14 dollars to the euro, so one dollar buys you 87 euro cents. Not since August 2003 has the euro traded this low against the dollar.","According to economists there is simply too much demand in the U.S. for high-end European goods that companies will not issue discounts .
Instead a reverse shift has been occurring .
For example, Chanel's classic handbag, which was priced at $2,250 in 2007, cost $4,900 last year, according to luxury goods experts ."
"Authorities in Northern California are investigating an altercation between a police officer and a man in a wheelchair that was captured on video and circulated online. A San Francisco police officer is seen in the video apparently trying to push the man, DeVaughn 'Bo' Frierson, and his wheelchair off the curb of a sidewalk. The wheelchair almost tips over, but it remained upright and a seat belt kept Frierson in his chair. The officer can be heard complaining that the wheelchair ran over his foot. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: DeVaughn Frierson can be seen heading toward the police officers despite off-camera voices warning him to stay away. Frierson has said he went over because his cousin was being beaten by police .

Confrontation: A San Francisco police officer is seen in the video apparently trying to push DeVaughn Frierson and his wheelchair off the curb of a sidewalk . The wheelchair almost tips over, but it remained upright and a seat belt kept DeVaughn Frierson in his chair . Upset: Wheelchair-bound DeVaughn Frierson has said he wants the officers stripped of their badges . The incident occurred Sunday afternoon while police were responding to a disturbance. Four men were issued citations. A police spokesman declined to identify the officer involved and says the department is investigating the incident. 'I'm waiting for the police officers - for them to get removed from the force,' Frierson told CBS San Francisco. The news outlet reported that Frierson has claimed his relatives were playing around, and he went toward the police after a cousin was put in handcuffs. 'I was going over there to be a witness because my cousin was getting beat up by the police,' Frierson told the affiliate station. 'When I went over there they stopped that and focused on me.' CBS Francisco pointed out that two  videos of the incident have emerged - one was posted by 'Sqaully Dee' on Facebook, and a second video appeared on YouTube filmed by Edwardo Delacruz. In Delacruz's video, the officer can be heard saying 'You f****** ran my foot over.' 'You don't run my foot over,' the officer says. 'F*** your foot,' Frierson says. 'You don't do a handicapped person like that.' Shoved? The incident occurred Sunday afternoon while police were responding to a disturbance. Four men were issued citations . Cameraman: Edwardo Delacruz (in khaki pants) is seen with the officers and DeVaughn Frierson, who he's said is his cousin . Delacruz told The Free Thought Project, 'The guy in the wheelchair and the guy sitting on the ground are my cousins. The police are community police, they know everyone in the neighborhood.' The website, which is critical of alleged cases of police brutality and excessive force, reported that 'The men were joking around as Frierson did wheelies and tricks in his chair and the man on the ground playfully called the police over to come arrest the man for messing around.' 'Basically the cops harassed them because they were joking around,' Delacruz told The Free Thought Project. 'The thing about it is the cops were telling them to go in the house and his house is 5 doors up. He has to roll past them to get in the house and they know all this because they are the community police. Their office is right there too, so they know where everyone lives because they see them everyday.' 'If you look at the video, [the officer] doesn't jump or react in a way that a person [would] who just had their foot ran over,' Delacruz also said. 'He said that when he realized he was being filmed. He tried to flip him because he didn’t like my cousin confronting him about slamming my other cousin on his head.He didn't like the truth being told to him, so he tried to flip him out of the chair. That's what the conversation he and the cop were having prior to the cop grabbing his chair.' SFPD spokesman Officer Grace Gatpandan told CBS San Francisco police allegedly saw a verbal dispute between a group of individuals. Gatpandan told the news outlet that three people received possession of open containers of alcohol citations, while one person received an obstructing an officer citation.","Authorities  are investigating an altercation between a police officer and a man in a wheelchair that was captured on video and circulated online .

"Leaked documents from the NSA recently revealed a covert USB stick that could be used to target secure, offline networks. But the device costs a staggering $20,000 (£13,200). Now, a team of hackers has created its own version of the surveillance kit using a cheap circuit board and other parts that total just $20 (£13). Scroll down for video . The Turnipschool device was demonstrated at the SchmooCon hacking convention. It features a radio-frequency implant inside a USB stick (stock image pictured), alongside a circuit board, transceiver and a cover. It can be connected to a network and potentially used to attack the PC. The parts total around $20 (£13) Called Turnipschool, the project was demonstrated at the SchmooCon hacking convention in Washington at the weekend. Last year, German computer scientists proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans. Using built-in microphones and speakers in laptops, the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft (19 metres) away from each other. They came up with a hack using sound to steal data from protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘hacker’ machine. The researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a Lenovo T400 computer to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another. The NSA hardware it is based on was dubbed Cottonmouth-I. It lets hackers launch a man in the middle-style attack by plugging into a keyboard or mouse, for example, and installing malware on computers. The device was designed to also be able to control the malware, even on so-called ‘airgapped’ computers. An air-gap or air wall is a network security measure. The gaps were designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the internet or a local area network. Turnipschool was set up deliberately to see if a hobbyist could create something similar to Cottonmouth-1, in terms of size and functions. It is part of a wider project called the NSA Playset that attempts to recreate NSA surveillance tools. The project was presented at the convention by wireless security researcher Michael Ossman, with collaborators Dominic Spill and Jared Boone. The tool features a processor with a built-in radio on a circuit board that fits inside a moulded USB plug. The Turnipschool project was inspired by a covert stick called Cottonmouth-I that appeared in recently leaked NSA documents (pictured) and cost $20,000 (£13,200) each. It is part of a wider project called the NSA Playset that attempts to recreate NSA surveillance tools . An air-gap or air wall is a network security measure. It was designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the internet or a local area network. Researchers from Israel recently designed computer software that logs keystrokes. This software transmits strokes via FM radio signals generated by the PC's graphics card. The data is picked up by a nearby mobile, equipped to pick up radio signals. This can be done without being detected by the user, but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place. Since FM radio signals travel over long distances, the receiver could be placed in another building. The circuit board is custom printed and costs $1.50 (99p) to make. The microcontroller is made by Texas Instruments, with a radio-frequency transceiver that costs around $4 (£2.65). Other parts include a 3D-printed injection mould and plastic cover. At the moment, Turnipschool has the potential to connect and ‘sniff’ the network, and the next step is to make it attack the computer its connected to. ‘USB implants were among the most talked about gadgets in the NSA catalogue after it leaked last year,’ said the researchers. ‘Concealed in cables and connectors, these devices appear to be designed primarily to provide covert communication channels to malware operating on a host computer. ‘Secondarily it seems that they could be used to implement USB attacks or to monitor connected USB devices. ‘[We] demonstrate tools we've built for the same capabilities.’","NSA uses a covert surveillance device in a USB stick called Cottonmouth-I .

"The so-called Plaxo co-founder who is charged with murdering his wife's new husband had never worked a day at the groundbreaking social network, founding executives reveal. Minh Nguyen, 38, has spent years claiming he and Napster billionaire Sean Parker jointly founded Plaxo, which was later sold to Comcast for an estimated $170 million. As a supposed high flyer in the tech world, his arrest over the fatal shooting of his ex-wife's new husband on January 15 made national headlines. But it has now emerged that Nguyen never set foot in the Plaxo building, was not present for any of the seminal discussions, and repeatedly edited the company's Wikipedia page listing himself as a co-founder - even though marketing directors kept correcting his changes. His only connection to Plaxo, former executives told DailyMail.com, was that he went to school in Virginia with Sean Parker, who went to become the first president of Facebook. Lies? Minh Nguyen (left) who is charged with murdering Corey Mattison (right), new husband of his ex-wife Denise (also pictured right), claimed to be a co-founder of Plaxo - which former executives say is false . He also attended one of Parker's 'brainstorming' sessions before Plaxo was created, but was not present at any of the brainstorming sessions which led to Plaxo's inception. In fact, a former friend of Nguyen told DailyMail.com, the self-professed co-founder  left the tech business altogether to become a hairdresser during Plaxo's early years. John McCrea, former marketing director of Plaxo from 2006 to 2009, told DailyMail.com he never saw Nguyen. 'Minh was a person that caused a fair bit of puzzlement for the company,' McCrea said. 'He was publicly making the claim of being a co-founder. We were aware of this through Wikipedia, which is a wonderful resource but comes with its own issues. 'As the new head of marketing, soon after I joined I was curious to know who this person was. 'Socially, people told me no one knew why he made the claim. He wasn't there when Sean, Todd [Masonis] and Cameron [Ring] came up with the idea and developed the idea. He wasn't there when the company was finally formed. He never even set foot in the building. Turned a blind eye? Napster billionaire Sean Parker has not commented on the controversy as former executives of Plaxo reveal Nguyen, Parker's school friend, pretended to be a co-founder of the network . Plaxo: (left to right) engineer Joseph Smarr, marketing executive Scott Epstein, marketing director John McCrea, and co-founders Cameron Ring and Todd Masonis. McCrea and Masonis told DailyMail.com Nguyen never worked at Plaxo . 'According to his LinkedIn, Minh worked at Plaxo for ten months between 2001 and 2002, before the BETA version of Plaxo launched. There are no records of this and no one ever saw him there.' McCrea said the company fought a constant battle, spanning years, trying to maintain the accuracy of their Wikipedia page. 'We went about correcting the false claim by editing it. But time and time again, a user by the name of Minh21 would go back in and change it inaccurately to say he was a co-founder. 'That happened many times over multiple years. It became almost a joke. 'Eventually, after Plaxo was sold and many of us went on to our own start-ups or new firms, the importance of altering the Wikipedia page to accurately reflect history was not a priority. 'We almost forgot all about it until this tragic story came out.' Speaking to DailyMail.com Todd Masonis, a founder of Plaxo who was with the company through its sale to Comcast, said that 'in my nine years working on Plaxo, [Nguyen] wasn't involved in any capacity beyond some initial discussions with Sean [Parker, another Plaxo founder] before the company was incorporated'. Masonis, who is no longer with Plaxo, said Nguyen 'never met or worked with any of our employees, investors, or partners. I only met him socially two or three times. 'Unfortunately, he appears to have overstated his connection to the company. This is a really tragic situation and our hearts go out to his family.' Although, he says, Nguyen may have discussed the idea with Parker, he did not develop the business model, meet the customers, meet the investors, work in the office, or work on its sale to Comcast. Sean Parker, who left Plaxo in 2005, has so far declined to comment on the matter. Sources inside the company recall Parker brazenly handed shares to numerous people - including Nguyen - which created problems for the company and he later left. A former friend, who spoke to DailyMail.com under the condition of anonymity, said Nguyen felt his ideas tabled in a brainstorming session were key elements of what Plaxo came to be. Corey Mattison (left) was allegedly killed by the ex-husband of his new wife Denise (center back). She said his final act of love was to protect her children by leading the gunman away from them at their Virginia home . The source said Nguyen claimed he fashioned design boards and paper prototypes. When Parker got serious about the idea, he enlisted the partnership of Todd Masonis and Cameron Ring - two Stanford co-founders - to work with and left Minh behind. 'Over the years, while the Stanford co-founders were always annoyed by it and they all played the game of editing Wikipedia, it never seemed like Sean had a problem with Minh calling himself a co-founder - probably because he thought it was dumb and didn't care about it,' the source said. Also, the edit history of Plaxo's Wikipedia page shows that as far back as 2006 a person identifying himself as Nguyen would edit the page to list himself as a founder any time he would be deleted. Denise Mattison told ABC that when her ex broke into her Virginia home last Thursday with a gun, her husband Corey lured him out of the back door and away from their children. Minh Nguyen has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting dead his ex-wife's new husband . Mrs Mattison said that her daughter, Madison, 14, and a younger sibling were able to escape and hide out in the bathroom to call the police. Mrs Mattison, who married her late husband three months ago, told the network: 'He was my knight in shining armor... he literally laid his life down to save me.' The couple lived together with their five children - Mrs Mattison's three children from her marriage to Nguyen and Mr Mattison's two children from a previous relationship. Nguyen was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday. He was arraigned on Tuesday and was held without bond. He is due back to court for a January 28 bond hearing. He allegedly shot dead Corey Mattison, a former minor league pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, after breaking into the newlyweds' townhouse in Ashburn, Virginia. Two of Nguyen's three children with his ex-wife were present at the time of the shooting at 9.30pm last Thursday, police said. Denise walked in with her third child during the attack, according to a reported from the Londoun County Sheriff's Office. Nobody else was injured in the attack. Nguyen was arrested without incident after being captured by his mother, who held him down and called the police, NBC reported. Officers found the mother and son struggling over his gun. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond. Mattison, who had two elementary-school-aged children of his own, was a project manager at a glass construction company based in Washington, D.C., WPBF reported. His colleagues told the station Mattison spent a lot of time with his children as well as Nguyen's. 'Corey and his wife would go to a baseball game with the kids, and [Nguyen] would blow up,' his colleague Rick Knutson said. 'He would try to prevent them from taking the kids anywhere. The guy seemed to be a little unstable.' Nguyen, 38, allegedly broke into his ex-wife's home in Ashburn, Virginia, at 9.30pm and shot dead her husband . Court records from Nguyen's 2011 divorce do not indicate that he reaped any kind of lasting financial fortune from his association with the company. The documents said Nguyen was unemployed at the time and had been making less than $50,000 a year in the years leading up to the divorce decree. Papers show that he was ordered to pay only $750 a month in child support for the couple's three children. Nguyen, graduated from George Mason University with a degree in Multimedia Design in 1997, and was based in Washington, D.C. Having started out as an interface programmer at AOL, Nguyen's post-Plaxo career saw him take up advising roles at numerous apps and websites. In 2012, he became the founding CEO of App Press, which provided tools for designers to build, manage and deploy apps. He was then an advisor to for at least three tech firms and the chairman of the now-defunct Syllabuster, a mobile platform for students and teachers.","Minh Nguyen, 38, sparked national headlines as Plaxo co-founder charged with murdering his ex-wife's husband last Thursday .

"Ten Israeli tourists have been robbed, beaten and burned in a four hour-long anti-Semitic attack at a hostel in southern Argentina. The attackers shouted 'f******* jews' at the group and accused them of 'trying to take over Patagonia' as they pelted them with stones and fired a shotgun round at a cabin during the ordeal. Police called to the incident 45 minutes after the attack began had to withdraw because they were unable to control the situation - one was hospitalized with a broken jaw and two lost teeth. Scroll down for video . The Onda Azul hostel (pictured) has closed for the remainder of the holiday season following the attack . The Israeli tourists, holidaying in Lake Puelo (pictured) in Patagonia, were subjected to a four hour ordeal that left 10 of them injured . The group of tourists were staying at the Onda Azul hostel near Puelo Lake, a backpacker's accommodation popular with Israelis, when three neighbours arrived brandishing sticks and bottles and hurling anti-Semitic abuse at the visitors. The owner of the hostel, 38-year-old Yoav Pollac, said: 'They came in throwing stones, smashing windows,' The Guardian reported. 'They chased after three cars in which some of our guests tried to escape and wrecked them. 'They injured me, my brother and my father, who is almost 70 years old.' Dario Gonzalez, the Lake Puelo commissioner, said the incident forced the closure of the hostel but the attackers had no political affiliation, according to the International Business Times. The region of Patagonia made headlines last year during the filming of an episode of the BBC show Top Gear. Locals chased presenter Jeremy Clarkson, his colleagues and the show's crew out of the country after he drove a vehicle through the region with a number plate many believed was a reference to the Falklands War.","The group of Israeli tourists were subjected to attack in southern Argentina .

"While most cheese fans will delight in a strong cheddar, the durability of this cheese takes things to a whole new level. A chef from Mexico has carried out a shocking experiment which reveals how a slice of processed cheese fails to melt when held over a naked flame. In a bid to make a statement about processed foods, Jose Raul Reyes filmed himself holding the supermarket cheese directly over the heat. But instead of melting as some might expect, the cheese merely blackens - just like plastic would. Jose Raul Reyes uploaded a video to Facebook showing how a piece of sliced cheese failed to melt when held directly over a naked flame (left and right) The video went viral within hours of being published online and has attracted hundreds of comments from shocked viewers. One wrote: 'Why doesn't the health Ministry ban something like this which clearly isn't cheese?' And another wrote: 'if anybody wants to know why cancer is on the increase, look no further.' Mr Reyes said he decided to carry out the experiment after a friend told him that the slices were not real cheese. He said: 'I tried it out after hearing from a friend of mine that these cheese slices are not real cheese and don't melt, and he showed me what happened when you put them over a gas flame to prove it. 'I felt like I was being ripped off so I videoed it and stuck it on YouTube, and was surprised about the reaction.' Mr Reyes said the video shows that the cheese, sold by discount chain Aurrera, is more akin to plastic and believes it is enough to deter people from eating processed cheese for life. Instead, the cheese slice merely blackens, leading the chef to liken the product to plastic . He added he had wanted to post the footage to warn people about what they were buying. The row over processed cheese started last year in the U.S with a similar video involving Kraft sliced cheese. It prompted the company to release their own YouTube video explaining why it does not melt at high temperatures. The slices used in the bizarre experiment were from the Aurrera discount chain in Mexico . At the time, Kraft said it was well known that their cheese only melted at low temperatures and stressed that the cheese was perfectly healthy to eat and contained only real cheese and natural product additives. The only other addition, they said, was the use of emulsifiers to bind the proteins and fat which they said was also common in chocolate and many other foods. The emulsifiers, they said, meant that at high temperatures the cheese did not melt and it would need lower temperatures and a longer period of time if people wanted to see their Kraft cheese slices melting .","Video shows chef Jose Raul Reyes holding a piece of cheese over a hob .

"Cari Thomson has been cleared of wrongdoing after she lent her prescription inhaler to a seventh-grade student suffering an asthma attack . A middle school principal has been cleared of wrongdoing after a student's parents complained that she gave their son her inhaler, even though it may have saved the boy's life. Police investigated  Cari Thomson after she lent her prescription inhaler to a seventh-grade student suffering an asthma attack. The boy's parents complained after they found out the Woodland Middle School Principal had given their son - a severe asthmatic - her inhaler - without contacting them. But Woodland Police Chief Phillip Crochet said this week that while she may have acted illegally, her actions were considered common sense to help the student and may have saved the boy's life. City of Woodland Prosecuting Attorney Fred Johnson decided against pursuing criminal charges, Chief Crochet added. According to the police report, Ms Thomson told her superintendent that her actions had been illegal. But Superintendent Michael Green had told her that 'it was a good thing she violated policy' because her action may have saved the student's life. The student's father Jason Birrer told police he believed she was trying to help, but was worried Thomson's inhaler may have been too strong. A police report said that former middle school english teacher Holly Royle had witnessed the incident at the school in Washington in December. But she waited almost a month before writing a witness statement, dated January 2, and gave it to another teacher - Cheryl Nesbitt - who brought it to the Birrer family to sign before bringing it to police. Mr Birrer said Ms Nesbitt, a former middle school physical education teacher, was the first to inform him of the incident. 'It was just the fact that she gave him the inhaler without even contacting us (that bothered me),' he said, according to The Daily News. 'I thought (my son) had his inhaler that day, and afterwards he told me he forgot it.' Ms Nesbitt then reported the incident to police on January 5, two weeks after she and Ms Royle were fired from their positions. They claimed they were terminated after bringing concerns about the principal's lack of leadership and breaches of professional conduct to her and Superintendent Green. The boy's parents complained after they found out the principal at Woodland Middle School, pictured, had given their son, a severe asthmatic, her inhaler without contacting them . At the time the Birrers were asked to sign the witness statement, Ms Nesbitt bought the family pizza - which some have criticized as being akin to a bribe. But Mr Birrer rejected this, adding: 'She gave me some very good information, and I believe Cheryl Nesbitt did the right thing,' And Ms Nesbitt insists she would have reported the incident to police without the family's signature and had brought the pizza to thank the family for their time. 'There was no coaxing,' she said. 'I didn't need (the parents') approval. I was there just to tell them what happened.' Ms Royle said she reported the incident in January after she was advised to do so by a teacher's union representative. School officials told police they attempted to contact the student's parents 'multiple' times before Thomson gave the student her asthma inhaler. The school nurse had been unavailable at the time. But Mr Birrer says his wife was at home at the time of the asthma attack. He added staff did not tell him later that day that his son had been given another person's inhaler. A petition calling for the removal of Principal Thomson, which has attracted almost 500 signatures, accuses her of misconduct. Started by Parents of Woodland Students, the petition claims she has committed 'unprofessional acts' which include swearing during the school day, discussing her purchase of pornography, sharing her personal sexual activities with staff and pulling students from class to do her personal chores.","Cari Thomson was investigated after loaning her prescription inhaler .

"A seaside town with 40,000 residents has become the charity shop capital of Britain where bus-loads of people visit just to hunt for bargains in 24 stores crammed into three of its main streets. Tourists heading for a cheap shopping spree in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, are even handed maps highlighting the locations of charity outlets - some of which have more than one store. But while charity shops in the town are thriving, and multiplying, independent businesses say they are going bust because of crippling rents - with three closing in the past week alone. In the UK charities get business rate relief, which means they automatically escape paying 80 per cent, with the possibility of the remaining 20 per cent also being waived at the local council's discretion. Packed streets: Bexhill-on-Sea has become the charity shop capital of Britain with an extraordinary 24 stores concentrated in three main streets . Closing sale: Bestsellers owner Mike Lynott is admitting defeat in Bexhill-on-Sea after running his business for almost eight years - and is planning to run a charity shop himself . In total there are nine charity shops in Western Road, eight in Devonshire Road, five in St Leonards Road and two more in adjacent streets. Yet in the same streets the closing down boards have gone up outside the book store Bestsellers with owner Mike Lynott admitting defeat after running his business for almost eight years. Mauds vintage clothes and The Card Shop have also decided to shut down. Mr Lynott says he is going to take a job managing a charity shop in the town instead admitting: 'I haven't been able to beat them so I'm joining them. I have no choice.' He said: 'I just can't carry on beyond the end of January and most independent owners are in the same precarious state. 'When I set my business up there were around ten charity shops in the town. I knew I wouldn't become a millionaire but I wanted to provide a service and make a modest living. 'Now every other shop seems to be a charity shop and there are 24 charity shops in three streets, with at least four more coming soon and it is driving the rest of us under. ' I have nothing against these charities, they do a great job. But it is nothing like a level playing field and the rest of us just can't get by anymore. It's heartbreaking but I have no alternative but to throw in the towel.' Western Road: This busy street in the centre of Bexhill has an astonishing nine charity shops. Cancer Research, Oxfam and Autism Sussex share the street with RSPCA, Age UK, Rummage Community Shop, St Michael’s Hospice, the Sara Lee Trust and Scope . Mr Lynott says he needs to make £70-a-day to cover his £12,000-a-year rates bill. But now he is lucky if he makes £30 from the trickle of customers who scour the charity shops instead for cut price deals on donated books. He says coach parties regularly arrive packed with foraging shoppers from neighbouring towns because Bexhill now has the reputation as the UK mecca for charity shops offering bargain clothes, ornaments, homeware and rare books at every turn. They have even specially printed maps to find the charity shop of their choice. Mr Lynott said: 'What will I do? I will take the only job in town at the moment - working as a manager in charity shop. 'I haven't been able to beat them so I'm joining them. I have no choice.' A few doors away from Bestsellers the closing down boards have also gone up at Mauds ladies and gents vintage clothes shop, a fixture for decades in the town. The current owner is giving up after six years of increasing competition from charities. Devonshire Road: This thoroughfare has eight well-used charity shops in the south coast town. British Heart Foundation, the Alzeimer’s and Dementia charity shop and Save the Children share the street with Cancer Research UK. YMCA , two St Michael’s Hospice shops and a MIND shop . In the next street a long established gift card shop has also become a January victim of the burgeoning number of charity shops. It will soon be converted to yet another charity outlet. There has been at least a 30 per cent increase in the number of charity shops on the high street. The explosion since the economic crash in 2008 is leading to fears of the creation of ‘charity clone towns’ across Britain, with conventional retailers being forced out. There are believed to be at least 10,000 charity shops and they pay a fraction of the £7 billion annual business rates of traditional retailers, giving them a considerable financial advantage over other stores. That has driven the proliferation of charity shops. But it has also contributed to a rise in business rate relief given to charities, up 73 per cent to £1.3 billion over five years. They are also attractive to landlords, who avoid paying the business rate, while the charity can claim relief on it. Hilary Randall, chairman of the voluntary Bexhill Town Team that works for both traders and shoppers, said: 'I certainly don't think we want any more charity shops here. 'Other businesses are not getting the Government's 80 per cent rate relief the charities do so charity shops can afford higher rents and be in better locations because they get this present from the Government. 'And if you are part of a big charity, effectively a national chain, they are cash rich in comparison to the independent traders they compete against.' are helping by attracting more shoppers. Linda Hodgson of the Sara Lee Trust, who have two shops in Bexhill, explained: 'I don't think we have an unfair advantage. 'The charity shops do bring more people into the town and we can all work alongside each other. 'And we rely on our shops to help us provide the care and support to patients with cancer and other life threatening illnesses. Without our shops it would be very difficult.' But now traders and civic leaders in the Sussex resort of Bexhill have demanded an end to the explosion of charity stores they say is having a disastrous effect on long established businesses. They claim they can no longer cope with the growing competition that has seen 24 charity shops open in a cramped town centre of just three main streets - with yet more expected to open up in the coming months. St Leonards Road: This street has the fewest number of charity shops in Bexhill - five - with another two in neighbouring streets. Age UK and Barby Keel Animal Sanctuary are neighbours of Voluntary Association for the Blind, Charity Cards (not pictured) and the Alzheimers Society . But Warren Alexander, chief executive at the Charity Retail Association, who steps down this month, has regularly defended his members. He said previously: ‘Charity shops do not compete unfairly with commercial firms. All charity shops pay standard market rates for rents and utilities just like other commercial ventures. ‘Many of the charities benefiting from the funds raised through shops are local hospices or other organisations whose beneficiaries are in the local community.’","Tourists are handed maps detailing where Bexhill's charity shops are .

"Record numbers watched television through iPlayer last year – driven by a surge in viewers using tablets and smartphones, figures show. The BBC’s online service was used 2.6 billion times to watch shows in 2014, up from 2.1 billion the previous year. The figures are sure to reignite the debate over whether the TV licence fee remains ‘fit for purpose’. Scroll down for video . The BBC’s online service was used 2.6 billion times to watch shows in 2014, up from 2.1 billion in 2013 . BBC iPlayer can be accessed through computers, tablets and smartphones and it has become increasingly important to the nation’s viewing habits. Last year also saw a 51 per cent increase in broadcasts enjoyed on tablets, to 801 million. There was a sharp rise in the number accessing iPlayer through their mobile phones, up 32 per cent year on year, with 662 million items of television or radio content consumed through them. While a viewer still needs to pay the £145.50 for a television licence in order to watch live television through iPlayer, they do not need one if they are only using the catch-up facility. Pugh: 'I like watching the iPad but I do miss the widescreen' BBC figures reveal that only 2 per cent of adults consume catch-up content alone. However, the use of iPlayer has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2011, 1.94 billion pieces of BBC television and radio content were watched through iPlayer, a number that more than doubled to nearly 4.2 billion last year. Sherlock tops the list of the most popular shows on iPlayer, with all three of the episodes from its latest series making it into the top ten most viewed through the service. A staggering 4.2 million people watched the first episode of Sherlock through BBC iPlayer, either live or later on catch-up. This compares with 6.84 million who watched it broadcast live on BBC1 on New Year’s Day 2014. The top 20 programmes on iPlayer were watched a combined total of more than 56 million times and 17 of them had online audiences at least half the size of those they drew for their live television broadcasts. BBC3’s Murdered By My Boyfriend, which was watched more than 3 million times online, saw its iPlayer viewing figures far outstrip those it had on television. Philip Davies, a Conservative member of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘All of this modern technology, including iPlayer, means that even supporters of the licence fee surely have to question whether it is a sustainable and appropriate model for the future.’ He said the Government and the BBC have to factor in iPlayer viewing figures when discussing renewal of the Corporation’s charter. A BBC spokesman said: ‘It’s only down to the licence fee that iPlayer or any of these programmes exist and less than 2 per cent of households watch only catch up TV.’ Around 3.81 million people watched an episode of Top Gear (pictured) on iPlayer rather than on their TVs .","BBC's online catch up TV service was used 2.6 billion times last year .

"Yaasmeen Castanada, the California mom who suffered a toxic allergic reaction to a friend's medication that caused her to essentially burn from the inside out, has finally been allowed to go home after 52 days in intensive care. The 19-year-old, who took the leftover prescriptions on Thanksgiving because she wasn't feeling well and was hospitalized hours later needing a ventilator to breath, was reunited with her family in Fresno, including her five-month-old daughter, on Wednesday, after checking out of the University of California Irvine's burn unit. 'She needs to be home with her family, her baby,' Castanada's mother, Laura Corona, told ABC News. 'I know she'll recover. She's really strong. She has a lot of will to live.' Scroll down for video . Home time: Yaasmeen Castanada, 19, left the University of California Irvine's burn unit on Wednesday . Long recovery: Castanada had been in intensive care for months recovering from her rare condition . Freak reaction: Yaasmeen took some medication from a friend believing it would make her better, completely unaware it would be toxic to her body . Reunion: The mom was allowed to return to her Fresno home and her baby daughter . Castanada  suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Her body broke out in massive blisters as if she had been burned from head to toe. 'Her face changed within four days,' her mother told ABC. 'I would wipe her face and all the skin was just falling off.' More than 90 percent of Castanada's body is still affected. She recently had a tube put in her trachea to her breath because her throat was closing. Reaching out: Her family has set up a gofundme page to help pay for her medical bills and give updates on her status . Yaasmeen Castanada, 19, a mom who 'burned from the inside out' following an allergic reaction to her friend's medication has finally been reunited with her baby after spending a month apart as she battled to survive . Yaasmeen suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome after taking antibiotics on Thanksgiving Day because she was feeling sick . Patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome aren't technically burned. The condition compromises their skin barrier function, inflammation and blistering to occur on the outer layer of skin as well as the lips, eyes and genitals. Patients therefore need to be treated as burns victims. And as with burns victims, there is a serious risk of the wounds becoming infected. Castanada suffered a blood infection, a urine infection and an infection in her throat, according to ABC. Blisters: She will need physical, occupational, optical, dermatology, nutrition and burn therapy . Traumatic: She suffered burning in her throat, eyes and mouth.

'Heartbreaking, just unreal,' her mother told ABC. 'Just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally burn in front of you.' Yaasmeen took the medication believing it would make her better, completely unaware it would be toxic to her body. She initially suffered burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. Her eyes then became bloodshot and her lips were tearing off. 'It can be considered a burn from the inside out because of mucosal involvement,' said dermatologist Dr. Lawrence Matt. 'First of all, don't share medication, don't give someone else your medication, don't offer medication,' she said. ' Another thing also, go get yourself checked out and your kids checked out (for allergies), because you don't know what you're allergic to.'

"New research from a rental bookings website has found that empowered holidaymakers are now demanding hundreds of millions in holiday property upgrades. With masseurs, chefs and nannies now expected, the rise of 'selfish-catering' is a trend seen among those booking getaways this year. While property upgrades to make them as chic as possible are the norm, some travellers are looking for extravagant extras such as a private library or private music concert. Holiday rental booking portal, uGuest, finds a rise in the 'selfish-catering' trend among users . Potential renters now looking for many high-end upgrades in their holiday rental properties . Of the 3,000 respondents polled by uGuest, 60 per cent of UK holidaymakers are now more likely to consider staying in an independent property than they were five years ago. When looking for the perfect rental, holiday bookers can spend up to 120 hours searching for the dream accommodation. But these savvy and service-obsessed guests now expect everything from iPads to state of the art coffee machines to hot tubs to be included as standard. They're willing to pay for these little luxuries though - as much as £530 per person - for their ideal holiday rental villa or apartment. Among the most requested extras are premium TV channels, use of iPad or tablet and sports equipment . 1. Premium TV channels . 2. Use of iPad or tablet computer . 3. Sports equipment . 4. Coffee machine . 5. Home entertainment (eg. DVD players) 6. WiFi access . 7. Games consoles and games . 8. Use of bikes . 9. Childcare facilities . 10. Cleaning services . And with the increasing demand for superior service, property owners are stepping up to the plate. In fact, in 2015, hosts are expected to invest an average of £3,000 in their holiday properties over the year. Forty per cent of those surveyed also said that their properties were booked to capacity until January 2016. Adventurer and travel writer Charley Boorman has seen this shift in behaviour emerging over the past two years. 'It's amazing to see what people want these days, and the lengths people will go to find the perfect property,' he said. On the rise! 60% of those surveyed are more likely to rent a privately-owned property now than 5 years ago . With the increased demands, hosts are paying attention and spending thousands on little extras . Holidays to Spain and the Balearic Islands remains popular choices, but Japan, Poland and Russia are also expected to become hot property contenders for 2015. Olivia Skeen, uGuest spokesperson, said: 'Property owners are now being forced to up the ante in offering quality accommodation - with all the extras - at competitive rates. 'Getting a holiday property fully kitted out, especially with the modern-day essentials such as superfast broadband, iPads, an HDTV and table tennis, can really pay off for property owners looking to increase their bookings.'","Rental bookings website, uGuest, finds rise of 'selfish-catering' trend .

"Together in 2001: If Prince Andrew (left) sets foot in the US, attorneys acting for Virginia Roberts (right) could attempt to hand him deposition papers . Prince Andrew is now unable to visit the United States without running the risk of being ambushed with a subpoena, a lawyer warned yesterday. If he sets foot there, attorneys acting for Virginia Roberts could attempt to hand him deposition papers, he said. These would oblige him to give evidence on oath – or face the threat of jail. The legal team representing Miss Roberts has already tried to ambush several people they wish to question with legal papers, including Andrew’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell. If they succeeded in passing deposition papers to Andrew, in theory he would be obliged to attend court. The unwelcome prospect is enough to make royal courtiers think carefully before planning any visits to the US, where Andrew has been many times both in an official capacity and on holiday. It is also unknown if he is covered by legal immunity – either as a royal or because he was a Whitehall-backed business envoy – because this has never been tested in international law. Yesterday leading New York lawyer Dan Bright said Miss Roberts’s attorneys could try to serve papers on Andrew at an airport when he arrived – which could create an embarrassing scene, not least because of his royal protection officers – or could wait until he was at a place, such as a restaurant, where it would be awkward for him to ‘run away’. Risk: The unwelcome prospect is enough to make royal courtiers think carefully before planning any visits to the US, where Andrew (yesterday in Davos) has been many times both in an official capacity and on holiday . Lawyers, or their representatives, have even pretended to be butlers at charity galas to hand papers to a target, he added. If the prince was handed deposition papers and then refused to attend, he could be held in contempt of court. ‘If he doesn’t show up, lawyers can ask a judge to start a contempt hearing so that if he came back into the country, he could be arrested and put in jail,’ Mr Bright said. ‘It could be problematic for him if he wants to return to America.’ Previous trip to the US: Prince Andrew speaks during a visit to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in October 2003 . Andrew plays golf on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts on another previous visit to the US in August 1999 . Andrew’s lawyers would probably try to quash a subpoena, but there was no guarantee of success. He said: ‘If the judge really believes that he has vital evidence, then he might not throw it out. 'In that case, Andrew’s lawyers will probably come to an arrangement under which he will give a deposition but at a time of their choosing. They will also probably ask that it not be made public or leaked.’ Another option to get Andrew to give evidence would be via a British judge. However, such things are hard to enforce, he said. Harvard law professor: Alan Dershowitz (pictured) A Harvard law professor accused along with Prince Andrew of abusing Virginia Roberts said yesterday that she had ‘made the whole thing up’ and accused her lawyers of putting ‘real’ rape victims ‘in a terrible position’ with her claims. On US television, Alan Dershowitz denied ever seeing anything improper or even being around under-age women in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein. Miss Roberts alleges Mr Dershowitz came into a room to ‘chat’ with Epstein while she performed a sex act on him. But the professor said: ‘I’ve never seen her and I’ve never met her. She is categorically lying.’ Later on ITV News, he said that, by Miss Roberts’ own account, she was not underage when she met Andrew. He added: ‘She claims she got paid for it. She’s admitting that she’s been a prostitute.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Deposition papers would oblige him to give evidence - or face jail threat .

"Rosie O'Donnell today hit out at rumors her View co-host Rosie Perez had been fired - confirming she would return to the set on February 3. The outspoken 52-year-old told viewers: 'Rosie Perez is coming back, she's rehearsing for the new Larry David play and begins previews on February 3, and that day, she will be back here. 'Don't always believe what you read in the press, folks.' Rosie and Rosie: Rosie O'Donnell today denied rumors her co-star Rosie Perez had been fired - as ratings for The View dip . She's back! Rosie O'Donnell today said Rosie Perez would be back on The View on February 3 - the same day previews start for her Broadway play . Somber: Rosie Perez was stone-faced as she left her Brooklyn, New York home on Friday, January 16, after Variety revealed she was leaving The View. However, ABC executives have been quick to deny the rumor . Rehearsals: Rosie Perez has been on hiatus from The View while she works on her new play, Fish in the Dark, starring Larry David . Rosie said she would be going to watch her felllow Rosie in the play, Fish in the Dark, starring the Curb Your Enthusiasm actor and creator. She spoke out amid days of confusion and rumor after it was reported that Rosie Perez, 50, had been fired from the ABC daytime show. The actress is currently on hiatus while she rehearses for her play, but insiders said she had never adjusted to either the show's format of discussing hard and soft news - and had trouble reading a teleprompter. A source on the set of the ABC show also told The New York Daily News: 'She’s constantly correcting herself because she’s constantly screwing something up. She’s not the sharpest tool in the shed.' Those remarks drew the ire of a group who call themsevves #YoSoyRosie. The group have put out a letter defending Rosie against the criticism that has been heaped upon her. The letter, which was obtained by TMZ, said that 'questioning a woman's intelligence is an old stereotype that is sexist and in this case also racist'. The letter added that 'when you disparage the only Latina on The View, you disparage all Latinas'. Among the group members are New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and NY Secretary of State Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez and best selling author Esmeralda Santiago. All smiles: The View co-stars, from left, Whoopi Goldberg, Nicole Wallace, Rosie Perez and Rosie O'Donnell . Rosie was added to the line-up at the last minute by the show’s new executive producer Bill Wolff as Rosie O'Donnell made her highly-publicized comeback - and also joined politico Nicole Wallace. However, last week,Variety reported Rosie would not be returning to The View as the producers wanted to find a younger host to replace her. ABC has now dismissed the rumors, as a spokesman said: 'We look forward to welcoming the multi-talented Rosie Perez back to her seat as co-host on the panel on Feb. 3 after completing rehearsals. Debate: Rosie Perez joins her View co-stars and singer Jessie J. ABC denied she had been sacked, releasing a statement last night that said: 'We look forward to welcoming the multi-talented Rosie Perez back to her seat' 'She brings her rich life experience and passion to the table, something we've sorely missed while she's been away.' Last week, Variety also reported The View's CBS rival had edged ahead in total viewers for the first time.

"The ex-husband of a woman accused of murdering their daughter while under the spell of her lesbian lover choked back tears as he told a court how his wife had become 'possessed'. Afsar Ali said he enjoyed a happy marriage with Polly Chowdhury before their next door neighbour Kiki Muddar spun a fake cancer story to engineer her way into their home - and evict him from the marital bed. Chowdhury, 35, and Muddar, 43, are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of murdering Mr Ali's daughter Ayesha, at the family house in Chadwell Heath, Essex, in August 2013. Afsar Ali pictured at the Old Bailey today, where a court heard he was left 'devastated' after being evicted from his martial bed by his wife's lesbian lover . Polly Chowdhury (pictured) is on trial at the Old Bailey accused of manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child after her daughter was found dead in August 2013 . The Old Bailey has heard how Muddar formed a deep hatred for the child as she controlled and seduced Chowdhury by making up alter egos 'Jimmy' and 'Skyman' who only existed on Facebook and text. Giving evidence for the prosecution, Mr Ali described how he uprooted his family and moved house to get away from his neighbour Muddar after she befriended his wife. He told jurors: 'She would often disagree and she would say 'let's ask Kiki's opinion', what she thinks about certain things, which it really in a way made me a bit angry and upset because it was my family. I wanted to get away from Kiki. I wanted my family to be away from her.' They left the neighbourhood but Muddar came to stay in the autumn of 2012, sleeping in his bed with his wife - a situation which eventually led him to leave the family home within months. On her arrival, he said: 'I questioned as to what Kiki was doing at the property. 'I was told Kiki was on high doses of medication and the cancer was getting worse and she needed Polly's help, that she needed our family's help to support her. 'I was kicked out of my room because Kiki apparently wanted to sleep in the bedroom in bed. 'At first she said to me it would be easier. Kiki said it would be convenient for me to get up in the morning to get to work.' Asked by prosecutor Richard Whittam QC how he felt about it, Mr Ali said: 'I was devastated. I was really, really upset. 'One of the reasons I moved was to get away from this horrible lady and yet she is back in my property. I was angry, upset. I felt I was let down by Polly. I just did not know what to do. 'I made it very clear to her that I wanted Kiki out but I agreed with Polly she could stay for a few days because I did not want Polly to be upset. 'She would have this barrier. Polly is the type to support people. She's good - a good heart - and she wanted to support her but she wasn't listening to me. She did not acknowledge what I wanted.' Polly Chowdhury, 35 (illustrated left) is accused of murdering her own daughter together with Kiki Muddar (right) after Muddar allegedly assumed a set of alter egos which turned the mother against the young girl . Cross examining, Chowdhury's lawyer Ali Bajwa QC asked: 'Something change when Kiki came into your life?' Mr Ali's voice cracked as he replied: 'Everything changed. Everything.' Referring to his witness statement, Mr Bajwa said: 'You say this - ""it was like she was possessed"". Is that true?' The witness agreed. The court heard how the couple met when Mr Ali was serving a jail sentence at Feltham Young Offenders Institute  and Chowdhury was working in administration for a firm of solicitors. They had both experienced unhappy arranged marriages and he helped her run away to a new life with him. They had an Islamic marriage in 2001 but after Muddar moved in, he moved out on December 13, 2012 - Ayesha's birthday. Then on August 29, 2013, Ayesha was found dead in her bedroom after suffering more than 50 injuries to her head, body and limbs, including carpet burns and a bite mark on her shoulder, jurors were told. On guard: Police at the scene of Chowdhury's flat in August 2013, where Muddar had been living with her . That morning, Muddar had dialled 999 and reported Chowdhury had tried to kill herself at the family home in Chadwell Heath, Essex, and that Ayesha was dead. Muddar, of Ilford, Essex, and Chowdhury, of Chadwell Heath, Romford, Essex, deny murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child between March 1 and August 29 2013. Later, the court heard about Muddar's carefully constructed cast of 'cyber' characters who communicated with Chowdhury via Facebook and some 40,000 text messages - all from the same number. Around 15 different alter egos linked to Muddar's mobile phone were used to prop up her lies about having lung cancer and facilitated her sexual relationship with Chowdhury, the court heard. They included Muddar's fictional boyfriend 'Dave'. He was based on a real person she met through working at St John Ambulance who, in her fantasy world, died in the London riots and then began texting Chowdhury from beyond the grave, the court heard. The real Dave O'Meara gave evidence in court to confirm he was alive, had never been in a relationship with Muddar, nor was he hit with a brick during the riots. A central character in Muddar's made-up acquaintance was Jimmy Chowdhury, who began a 'sexting' relationship with Chowdhury in 2012. He asked her about her 'lesbian fantasy' and she sent him a picture of her breasts. Muddar attached to 'Jimmy' a host of fictitious family members and friends and even a rival girlfriend, 'Priya', to make Chowdhury jealous, the court heard. She also created an influential Muslim spirit called 'Skyman' who, in August 2012, texted Chowdhury that she should stop having sex with her husband. He went on to help Muddar become intimate with Chowdhury. Instructions on how to ease her medical problems developed into rubbing her breasts and hugging her at night, Mr Whittam said. Muddar's friend, Joanne Sharrard, initially believed her stories about cancer and being pregnant by her dead boyfriend 'Dave' but later suspected she was 'living in a fantasy land', according to a statement read to the court. She described her as a 'heterosexual tomboy' who she thought 'just needed as much attention and support as possible'. Chowdhury's older sister, Julie Ahmed, gave evidence that Chowdhury had changed in the months leading up to Ayesha's death. After her marriage with Mr Ali broke down, she became thin and withdrawn, she said in a written statement. She described Chowdhury's tragic daughter as being 'very intelligent for her age', 'a little madam but in a nice way', a 'bossy boots' and a 'chatterbox' who always had something to say. But when she spoke to the little girl over the phone shortly before her death, she too had become 'withdrawn', Mrs Ahmed said. The trial continues. The pair are on trial at the Old Bailey (pictured), where Mr Ali told the court he was left 'devastated' after being kicked out of his marital bed .

"A Hollywood special effects artist has created stunningly realistic sculptures of iconic figures, including Abraham Lincoln and artist Salvador Dali. Kazuhiro Tsuji, 45, from Kyoto City, Japan, worked for five months crafting the look-alike busts out of silicon, polyester, bronze and chrome plating. And if they weren't life enough, the sculptures are made using real hair. Mr Tsuji says that he chose to recreate Lincoln, who was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth in 1865, after seeing make-up artist legend Dick Smith's version when he started out in the industry at the age of 17. Scroll down for video . Kazuhiro Tsuji,  from Kyoto City, Japan, spent months crafting the busts of Abraham Lincoln and Andy Warhol . The 45-year-old was inspired by Dick Smith's version of Lincoln when he started out in the industry aged 17 . He said: 'I choose my subject based on what is going on in my life at the moment. 'Lincoln was a great human being and a hero to many people. I respect him very much. 'And I simply love his face too. I did Lincoln make up on my own face several times to improve my skill. 'As I work on that make up, I learned about Lincoln a lot. I wanted to create his portrait for long time.' Mr Tsuji decided to imitate Andy Warhol, who died aged 58 in 1967, because he saw parallels between the artist's life and his own. And it's the same reason he chose to make a bust of Surrealist painter Salvador Dali. He said: 'When I was watching a documentary on Warhol, the transition of my career from commercial artist to fine art artist struck me as similar to his. 'Both Lincoln and Warhol as well as Smith and Dali all broke through tormented life, childhood, insecurity or family issue, then they became the greatest. 'I am expressing their soul from inside of the sculpture while I create it layer by layer to the surface.' Mr Tsuji chose Andy Warhol, who died in 1967, because he saw parallels between the artist's life and his own . He said: 'When I was watching a documentary on Warhol, the transition of my career from commercial artist to fine art artist struck me as similar to his' He also found similarities between himself and Surrealist painter Salvador Dali, who died in 1989 . 'Both Lincoln and Warhol as well as Smith and Dali all broke through tormented life, childhood, insecurity or family issue, then they became the greatest' Mr Tsuji has worked on blockbuster Hollywood films for 25 years, making prosthetics. These include aliens in sci-fi classic Men in Black and its sequel and also worked on the 2012 Total Recall remake with Colin Farrell. He has mastered aging and worked with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in time-hopping thriller Looper - and he helped Brad Pitt travel through time in the Curious Case of Benjamin Button back in 2008. After becoming frustrated with working in Hollywood, he turned his attention to fine art sculpture in 2008. The self-taught make-up whiz made a bust of mentor Mr Smith, who was known as the 'Godfather of Make-up' in 2002, to honour his work in pioneering prosthetics. Mr Smith, an Oscar-winning artist, worked on films including The Exorcist, The Godfather and made a youthful Dustin Hoffman look like a 121-year-old man in Little Big Man.

"Dumped on a roadside, they were caked in mud and with fur so matted they could not see. These two dogs were among nine – eight poodle-crossbreed puppies and their mother – abandoned in locations around Winchester, Hampshire, and struggling to stand under the weight of their own coats.

Matt Southcott, 50, a construction worker from Upham, was one of the horrified residents who raised the alarm after seeing what looked like a bundle of rags at the side of the road as he drove to work. He found two animals stuck in brambles, and said: ‘I couldn’t tell if they were sheep or dogs. You couldn’t see their faces. They looked so badly matted and injured. I have never seen an animal in that state.’ The puppies, aged around one, have been given the names Fay, Mavis, Martha, Justin, Wills, Kate, Maria and Dave by rescuers. Their mother, thought to be aged eight, has been called Sian. Vet Martha Edwards said Sian had to be sedated while her fur was cut off, adding: ‘She had stones trapped between her paw pads which had obviously been there for some time. It is disgusting. I have never seen a dog in this condition before.’ An animal welfare expert said yesterday it was likely the nine dogs had been kept in ‘unlivable’ conditions for their whole lives before being ditched ‘with no concern for their welfare’. The harrowing pictures show the dogs lying on the floor on top of each other, looking like a bundle of rags. Their thick hair is covered in mud and matted so much they were unable to stand properly so were slumped on the ground . The mother, eight-years-old, has been named Sian and the others have been named: Mavis, Martha, Fay, Justin, Wills, Kate, Maria and Dave. The dogs are being looked after at a Hampshire Kennels. Pictured is RSPCA Inspector Jan Edwards holding Fay . All of the poodles, which are worth up to £500 each, had to be shaved by vets, who found that each animal weighed a staggering 12 kilograms - almost half of what their whole body weight should be. Each dog took around three hours to shave . Animal Welfare officer at Winchester City Council, May Carrington, looks after Sian, the mother of the rest of the puppies . The council has seized legal control of the animals while a new home for them is found and they are nursed back to health . The matted and filthy hair which was shaved from the dogs was enough to fill three large sacks, the RSPCA said . Dave Griffiths, Winchester City Council’s senior animal welfare officer, added: ‘They were terrified. The standard poodle of this size weighs about 25kg (4st) and when we clipped their coat the fur weighed 12kg (2st).’ An investigation is now under way and police, the RSPCA and council chiefs are appealing for help to find those responsible. A council spokesman said: ‘The dogs were abandoned on Tuesday evening. We are keen to hear from anyone who heard or saw anything. All the dogs belong to the same litter and we believe there was just one owner.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘We would ask anyone with any information about these dogs to call our inspectorate line on 0300 123 8018.’","Nine pets, which found across Winchester yesterday, were unable to see or stand they were in such a poor state .

"For eating walnuts may improve performance on cognitive function tests, including those for memory, concentration and information processing speed (file photo) Just a handful of walnuts a day could be a way to improve your memory, a new report showed. Eating walnuts may improve performance on cognitive function tests, including those for memory, concentration and information processing speed. The study led by Dr. Lenore Arab at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, found that cognitive function was consistently greater in adult participants that consumed walnuts - regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. This cross-sectional study is the first large representative analysis of walnut intake and cognitive function. It is also the only study to include all available cognitive data across multiple National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES draws from a large sampling of the U.S. population, typically ages one to 90 years old. In this study, participants included adults ages 20-59 as well as 60 and over. Dr. Arab and co-researcher Dr. Alfonso Ang found that study participants with higher walnut consumption performed significantly better on a series of six cognitive tests. Dr. Arab said: 'It is exciting to see the strength of the evidence from this analysis across the U.S. population supporting the previous results of animal studies that have shown the neuroprotective benefit from eating walnuts; and it's a realistic amount - less than a handful per day (13 grams).' As the baby boomer population grows older, conditions affecting memory such as Alzheimer's and dementia will become a greater concern (file photo) The study adds to a growing body of research surrounding walnuts' positive effect on reducing cognitive impairment and overall brain health, which includes the possible beneficial effects of slowing or preventing the progression of Alzheimer's disease in mouse models. As the baby boomer population grows older, conditions affecting memory such as Alzheimer's and dementia will become a greater concern. According to a 2012 World Health Organization article, the estimated number of new cases of dementia each year worldwide is nearly 7.7 million, and the number of people living with dementia worldwide is estimated at 35.6 million. This number is predicted to double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050. There are numerous possible active ingredients in walnuts that may be contributing factors in protecting cognitive functions. This includes the high antioxidant content of walnuts (3.7 mmol/ounce); the combination of numerous vitamins and minerals; as well as the fact that they are the only nut that contain a significant source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (2.5 grams per ounce), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid with heart and brain-health benefits. 'It isn't every day that research results in such simple advice - eating a handful of walnuts daily as a snack, or as part of a meal, can help improve your cognitive health,' said Dr. Arab.","Walnuts improve concentration and information processing, according to scientists .

"Looking slim and tanned, daytime TV presenter Jeremy Kyle and his former-model wife made a rare red carpet appearance at the NTAs last night. Jeremy, 49, posed with a protective arm around Carla, 40, who was radiant in a halter necked, backless silver and black sequined tunic dress, which, thanks to sheer panels, also showed off her long toned legs. After 13 years together, during which time Jeremy battled testicular cancer, the couple - who have three children -  looked stronger than ever. Scroll down for video . Jeremy looked trim and tanned on the red carpet at last night's NTAs with Carla, his wife of 12 years . Carla wowed in a silver sequined halterneck gown while Jeremy kept a protective arm around her waist . The couple met in 1999 when Carla after splitting with the total stranger she married for a radio competition . Yet the unusual circumstances behind their  marriage sound like an episode from Jeremy's self-titled show. In 1999, Carla Germaine - then a 23-year-old model - entered a competition run by the BRMB radio station in Birmingham where Jeremy was working, to marry a total stranger. Called Two Strangers And A Wedding, she was selected to tie the knot with Greg Cordell, a groom chosen by the station, but three months later the marriage was over and she began dating Jeremy. Jeremy later told The Scotsman newspaper: 'I have always said I completely and utterly disagreed with the competition and I was one of only two DJs who would have nothing to do with it. 'I met her three months later and she was like a rabbit in the headlights. She would tell you in her Brummie lingo that it was Monday, it was January, she had been dumped and was hung over, and her mate said, ""Why don't we go for it?""' They wed in 2002, have been happily married ever since and have three children Alice, 12, Ava, nine, and Henry, six, together. Jeremy's marriage to Carla, pictured in 2007,  is a contrast from the turbulent romances on his chat show . Tonight, an episode of The Kyle Files airs on ITV tonight in which Jeremy, while filming a documentary about Spanish party resort Magaluf, is attacked with pepper spray . Proudly family-orientated,  Jeremy told the Independent that his wife and family were 'the point' of his life, saying: 'My life in six words ... Carla, Hatty, Alice, Ava, Henry Kyle.' When Jeremy was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2012, Carla was by his side, supporting him through the operation and subsequent chemotherapy. Kyle spoke openly about the value of her unwavering support, crediting his wife  with helping him through the treatment. He told The Sun at the time: 'It's been a horrific time - a very sobering experience - but now I just feel lucky to be alive. 'I feel lucky that I'm here for family and can see my kids grow up. Despite the unusual circumstances of their meeting, Jeremy and Carla have been married for 13 years . 'To be honest, I thought, ""That's it, I'm dead"". The phone call I made to Carla was one of the most difficult of my life.' Carla is Jeremy's second wife. His first marriage to Kirsty Rowley ended in 1990 after a year together and the pair have a 24-year-old daughter Harriet. Tonight, an episode of The Kyle Files airs on ITV tonight in which Jeremy, while filming a documentary about Spanish party resort Magaluf, is attacked with pepper spray. In the show, Jeremy is walking down a busy street when his eyes start to sting and his throat burns. A Romananian doorman, Leon, 40, later admitted he had sprayed the presenter because he felt the programme was showing Magaluf in a bad light.","Jeremy, 49, looked slim and tanned with wife Carla, 40, at NTAs last night .

"Prince Andrew last night spoke out personally for the first time over allegations he slept with a woman who claims she was a teenage ‘sex slave’. In an unprecedented move, the strained-looking royal used a televised speech to repeat Buckingham Palace’s ‘emphatic’ denials that he had ever had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with his accuser, Virginia Roberts. His reference to the scandal, which contained 46 words and lasted only 37 seconds during his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was brief and limited. Scroll down for video . In Davos: Prince Andrew spoke for the first time to deny the sex accusations, at the World Economic Forum . The Duke of York spoke yesterday evening to 'reiterate and reaffirm' Buckingham Palace statements . Putting on his glasses: Andrew arrived at the World Economic Forum event with business leaders to host his first official public engagement since he was accused of having sex with an underage girl . But the very fact that the Queen’s son, a man who is fifth in line to the throne, even felt he had no choice but to speak out was remarkable. Reading from carefully scripted notes, the prince said: ‘Firstly I think I must, and want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks. ‘And I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.’ He added: ‘My focus is on my work and this evening’s reception allows me to tell you about just a couple of the initiatives that I have founded and am passionate about.’ Prince Andrew arrives at the Belvedere Hotel in Davos ahead of his keynote note speech last night . In the car: The Duke was accompanied in his vehicle in Switzerland by Amanda Thirsk, his private secretary . Arrival: Prince Andrew at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday. The very fact that the Queen’s son, a man who is fifth in line to the throne, even felt he had no choice but to speak out was remarkable . Denial: Prince Andrew (pictured with Virginia Roberts in 2001) fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with her . Weeks of damaging claims about his alleged relationship with Miss Roberts were sparked at the beginning of the month when her lawyers lodged papers with a US court as part of a legal battle against the prince’s friend, billionaire banker Jeffrey Epstein, who served a prison sentence for sex crimes involving under-age girls. In the papers, she claimed that Epstein had not only repeatedly abused her from the age of 15 but had also ‘procured’ her for several of his ‘powerful’ friends, including Andrew. Miss Roberts alleges she and the royal had sex when she was aged around 17, still a minor under US law in some states. Buckingham Palace has issued two strong denials on Andrew’s behalf, which state that not only is there is no foundation in the allegations but that he never had any sexual contact or relationship with his accuser. Then on Wednesday papers were filed in a Florida court revealing that Miss Roberts’s lawyers have written to Andrew asking him to testify on oath about the nature of their relationship. Miss Roberts’s lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his ‘voluntary cooperation in answering question about his sexual interactions’ with her . Sources at last night’s Davos party said you ‘could have heard a pin drop’ as the prince started to speak, with some describing it as an ‘awkward quiet’. Denials: Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials on the Prince’s behalf - but he is expected to address the sex allegations for the first time in a speech to business leaders tonight . Courtiers said it had not been an ‘easy or comfortable’ decision for the prince to speak publicly about such a personal issue. But after long conversations with senior aides and legal advisers, he concluded that the continuing allegations were so damaging he had no choice but to confront them. The packed reception at the five-star Belvedere Hotel was held amid tight security. It is a big annual draw at Davos, and this year attracted the likes of disgraced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, BT boss Gavin Patterson, BP’s Bob Dudley, Mark Bolland of Marks & Spencer and former trade secretary Lord Mandelson. Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, accompanied by his wife Cherie, was also there, however he was said to have left before the prince took to his feet. Many of the prince’s supporters greeted him warmly. John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said Prince Andrew was right to turn up to Davos and host the reception. ‘He has always been a big advocate of British business,’ he said. Another male friend was seen to put his hand supportively on his shoulder for a few moments, prompting a smiling Andrew to shake him by the hand. The prince, dressed in a smart suit but with trainers on due to the slippery conditions outside, left in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover 15 minutes after the event ended at 8pm local time. Andrew was driven back to the nearby ski resort of Klosters, where he is staying in a luxury chalet owned by William Lawton, a senior executive for HSBC’s Private Bank in Singapore. Sources said the prince is paying for the cost of the trip himself. Pages from a detailed document filed in Florida by Virginia Roberts included this photo to show how young she was at the time of the allegations . Virginia Roberts included four photos of herself in the new court filing to illustrate her connection to the places in New Mexico mentioned in the court documents . It is not known whether Prince Andrew is covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law. However, the prince may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy. Diplomatic immunity protects foreign diplomats from legal action in the country where they work. Extradition lawyer Karen Todner said the prince could be formally asked to give evidence ‘only in criminal proceedings’. If he refused to co-operate, he could in theory be banned from entering America. The letter offered to interview the prince, pictured on a skiing holiday on January 4 after the initial allegations were revealed, under oath. But her lawyers said the letter had been 'refused by the recipient' In new documents, Miss Roberts (left) also launched a stinging attack on the Duke's (right) denials of her allegations. She claims they had sex when she was 17 . Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (right). The two are pictured together in Central Park, in New York . Smiling coyly for the camera in a simple white blouse, this is Virginia Roberts around the time she has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her. The photograph was taken by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the man she says turned her into a ‘sex slave’ and procured her for the Queen’s son. Photos: Virginia pictured aged 17 (left), in a picture taken by Epstein, and aged 15 (right). These pictures are two of five photos included in Miss Roberts's new legal submission . The snapshot is one of five photos included in Miss Roberts’s new legal submission to show how young she looked. ‘I was approximately 17 at the time,’ she said. She adds: ‘I visited and travelled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of 2002. ‘I had sex with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex with.’ She said she included the photos to ‘illustrate my connection to these places’.

"It's enough to make your hair stand on end. An Indian teenager has told how he can withstand 11,000 volts passing through his body - and only discovered his bizarre talent by accident when he was repairing his mother’s heater. Human electricity insulator Deepak Jangra can apparently resist the same amount of voltage required to power 500 houses and even sit with his hands inside a tub of water along with naked live wires. The 16-year-old claims: ‘I have a gift from God. I feel very privileged. I have the power to do things no-one else can and I don’t intend on wasting it. ‘I used to be scared of electricity but now I am confident. I have tested myself over and over again and I will never get hurt. I can touch a live wire with my tongue and I know nothing will happen to me.’ Scroll down for video . Electrifying: Deepak can touch live wires with his tongue - and feel nothing. He said: 'I used to be scared of electricity but now I am confident. I have tested myself over and over again and I will never get hurt' What a shocker: The teenager can resist the same amount of voltage required to power 500 houses and even sit with his hands inside a tub of water along with naked live wires . Bright spark: Deepak believes his ability is a gift and added: ‘I have a gift from God. I feel very privileged. I have the power to do things no-one else can and I don’t intend on wasting it' Deepak, who is a student, first discovered that he can resist such high levels of electricity three years ago when he was fixing his mother’s portable heater. He revealed: ‘My mother kept complaining that our heater was broken so I thought I’d take a look and try and fix it myself because we couldn’t afford to take it anywhere and pay someone to fix it. ‘I accidentally touched the live wire with my screwdriver but nothing happened - I didn’t get a shock. But at the time I assumed we must have had a power failure in our village.’ Two weeks later, Deepak got a movie stuck inside his DVD player and decided to take the machine apart to attempt to retrieve the disc. ‘I hit the live wires again but again nothing happened,’ he said. ‘This time I knew something amazing had just happened. I touched it again and again, and then went outside to check the power supply was ok. ‘That was the day I realised there was something unusual about me.’ Wonder boy: Locals frequently asked Deepak to repair equipment or electric line faults in their village, where he has become something of a celebrity . Proud family: Deepak (standing, centre) poses with brother Sushil (left), mum Khajani (right) and younger brother Sunil (sitting) Electric shocks above 2,700 volts can be fatal to human beings - with shocks above 11,000 volts considered 'usually fatal'. More than 2.5million people in the UK suffer a mains voltage electric shock per year, according to statistics from Electrical Safety First. The most recent statistics from the Health and Safety Executive show that 200 people suffered serious or major injury from contact with electricity or electrical discharge in the workplace in the last year in the UK. There were also two deaths. Electric shocks can stop the heart from beating properly, prevent breathing and cause painful muscle spasms. The voltage causes current to flow that blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles. In 1890, murderer William Kemmler was the first man to be executed in the United States by electric chair. A voltage of approximately 1,000 volts was applied for two minutes in order to kill him. Since that moment, Deepak has been experimenting with various  devices of different voltages - and he has been continually amazed by what he can withstand. He has tried light bulbs, TV wires, an electric woodcutter and an electrical water pump but each time, he would simply stop the devices working but not suffer any injuries. If anyone else were to attempt the same, it is highly likely they would be killed instantly. He added: ‘I experimented with different levels of voltages and my body was still unaffected. 'I could cope with 110 volts, 240 volts, 440 volts and my curiosity kept on growing. I wanted to know more and more. How much I could actually cope with?’ To find out, Deepak decided to test his limits by climbing an electric pole in a nearby field to touch the 11,000 voltage high-tension wire that powers his village. Soon, a crowd had gathered beneath him and started screaming in fear as they thought he was trying to commit suicide. Deepak said: ‘I was hanging from the pole touching the wires and I think people thought I was crazy. 'My mother came running over and started begging me to come down. She thought I was killing myself. 'But once people saw me touch the wires and walk away unscathed, everyone started cheering. I surprised everyone.’ Human conductor: Deepak can withstand an incredible 11,000 volts - which could kill another human being . A voltage as low as 50 volts applied between two parts of the human body can cause a current to flow that  blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles, causing a shock. But the true measure of shock's intensity lies in the amount of current - measured in amperes - that is forced though the body, and not the voltage. Deepak - who is now known as Wonder Boy in his remote village near Sonipat, in Haryana, northern India - is frequently asked by local families to repair equipment or electric line faults. But he refuses to charge for his services, as he does not believe in profiting from financially from his gift and added: ‘I’m out most days doing some kind of repair work now. ‘I work with my bare hands without any pliers or other equipment. But I don’t charge anything, I don’t make any money.’ And Deepak, who dreams of becoming a manager in the government’s electricity department, also revealed he has never hurt himself doing his stunts except burning the tips of his fingers if he holds a live wire long enough. Deepak's worried schoolteacher urged him to see a doctor, but their tests returned nothing of note. He added: ‘Doctors did some blood test and did an overall check up but they found nothing wrong with me. ‘Instead they started taking pictures of me on their camera, like I was some famous Bollywood actor or something. It was quite funny.' Wired up: Deepak with his mother Khajani. She said: 'Can you believe my boy doesn’t get electric shocks? I have two other sons but they are as normal as any other human. Only Deepak has this special power' But experts have warned against copying Deepak's behaviour, and Emma Apter from Electrical Safety First said: 'This is a life-threatening activity and one which we strongly advise against. 'Electricity has the potential to kill or seriously injure anyone unfortunate enough to come in to contact with it, so it is baffling that someone would voluntarily put themselves at such risk. 'In the UK alone, we estimate that 350,000 people are seriously injured by electricity each year and at Electrical Safety First we are regrettably only too familiar with the devastating impact that electrical accidents can have. 'This is a disaster waiting to happen and we would urge anyone attempting it to think twice about the potentially horrific consequences of such an action”. While Deepak - who had an insulated upbringing - relishes his incredible talent, his widowed mother, Khajani Devi, 35, who has two other sons Sushil, 18, and 12-year-old Sunil, finds it difficult to understand his amazing abilities. Khajani, who earns 2,500 Rupees (£25) a month as a dinner lady at the local school, said: ‘Can you believe my boy doesn’t get electric shocks? I have two other sons but they are as normal as any other human. Only Deepak has this special power. 'I feel it is the blessing of his late father. His father passed away in October 2011 and in April 2012 he found he had this talent.’ High voltage: Ambitious student Deepak now dreams of becoming a manager in the government’s electricity department . Gaurav Singh, 25, an electrical engineer from Delhi, said: ‘The power of 11,000 volts is fatal. 'Even if a man is standing five meters away he can get pulled by the high-tension wire and burn to death. If a person touches 11,000 volts, he wouldn’t get a shock - he would die instantly. ‘A high voltage power line is used to supply electricity to villages and towns. If it can supply electricity to 1,000 kilometres, you can imagine how powerful it is.’","Deepak Jangra discovered his 'talent' when fixing mother's heater .

"With this distinctive 'Braveheart' tattoo emblazoned across his face, you can bet it won't be long before police in Columbus, Ohio, are taking this suspected crook's freedom. Christopher Peters, 21, has been singled out by local prosecutors as an example of the city's problem with habitual shoplifters, who are costing retailers more than ever before. Dubbed the 'Braveheart Bandit' because of the blue tattoo slashing his face from his forehead to his right cheek, Peters was caught stealing eight times in 2014. And he has three outstanding warrants out for his arrest, Central Ohio's 10TV reports. You can take my freedom, but you'll never take my silly tattoo: 'Braveheart Bandit' Christopher Peters, 21, has been singled out by prosecutors in Columbus, Ohio, as an example of the city's problem with shoplifters . Assistant Columbus Attorney Bill Hedrick told the broadcaster: 'I would call a professional shoplifter who chooses to get a blue triangle tattooed across his face stupid rather than brave, but we believe he was going for the William Wallace Braveheart look.' Peters stole at least $322-worth of goods from Home Depot in March, and in April a $380 vacuum cleaner from Anderson's and a $849 Dyson vacuum cleaner from Target. That month he also stole £220-worth of clothes from Old Navy. Peters was convicted but has apparently not been deterred; prosecutors say he's stealing again and they are on the hunt for him. They don't think he will be able to hide for long . 'Mr Peters should be easy to identify so we are hoping the public can help us track him down,' Mr Hedrick said. Braveheart: Mel Gibson starred in the 1995 film about the Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace . Four out of five cases of theft last year involved repeat offenders like Peters, the Columbus city attorney's office said. And while the number of theft charges was down slightly on the year before, the average value of each theft was up 7 per cent, from $128 to $137. Thieves are often targeting high value items like Dyson vacuum cleaners, baby formula, Tide, Red Bull and meat, which can be resold for cash to other stores or online. Prosecutors are urging judges to increase thieves' sentences or give them longer periods on probation, but as long as crooks steal less than $1,000-worth of goods it's still a misdemeanour. Peters is also a registered sex offender and wanted for failing to re-verify his address.","Christopher Peters, 21, has three outstanding warrants for his arrest .

"Four bears have been found dead in New Hampshire after overdosing on chocolate, authorities say. The state's Fish and Game Department is now considering banning hunters from using the confection as bait. A post-mortem confirmed the bruins - two a female adults and two cubs - died of heart failure caused by theobromine poisoning. Theobromine is an alkaloid found in chocolate that can prove toxic to some animals. There are higher levels of the ingredient in dark and baker’s chocolate compared to milk. Toxic treats: Four bears have been found dead in New Hampshire after overdosing on chocolate, authorities say - the confectionery contains theobromine, which can prove toxic (stock image) Wildlife biologists are unsure exactly how much chocolate is fatal for bears, but some predict that is similar to toxicity levels for wolves. The Department of Natural Resources and Environment in Michigan previously estimated that it would take 9lbs of milk, 2.5lbs of semi-sweet, or 1.25lbs of baker’s chocolate to kill a 20lb wolf. In the New Hampshire case, the bears were found dead within 50 feet of where a hunter had put down 90lbs of chocolate and doughnuts as bait last September. Andrew Timmins, the state Fish and Game Department's bear project leader, told a commission meeting Wednesday that the best way to stop this from happening again is to remove chocolate from the woods, . The possibility that bears could die from eating chocolate caught the department's attention in 2011, after the death of a black bear cub in Michigan was linked to theobromine. Timmins said the amount of theobromine varies by type of chocolate used, but all can be toxic depending on how much an animal eats. 'We view bear baiting as an important management tool,' he told The Concord Monitor. Source of the problem: In the New Hampshire case, the bears were found dead within 50 feet of where a hunter had put down 90lbs of chocolate and doughnuts as bait last September (stock image) 'It's not something we want to go get rid of, but perhaps some modifications need to be made to determine bear baiting practices to eliminate the chances of chocolate poisoning our wildlife.' Dave Nickerson, who attended the meeting, was skeptical of the cause of the death. He said chocolate has been used at many sites, and has been used in many states. He asked if the lab had tested for antifreeze. 'This is the first time we've had four dead bears at one site,' Nickerson said. 'It highly suggests that poisoning could have occurred.' The deaths from chocolate appear to have been unintentional. The male hunter, who was not identified, told officials he has trapped for 15 years and used the same chocolate at other sites this past season.","The state's Fish and Game Department is now considering banning hunters from using the confection as a bait .

"A mother has told of her ten-year-old daughter’s devastation that her school was branded ‘intolerant’ after she gave the wrong answer when asked ‘what is a lesbian’. Ariella Wilkinson came home crying after Ofsted inspectors interrogated her about homosexuality during a visit to Grindon Hall Christian School. The free school, in Sunderland, has now been put in special measures after an official report found that discrimination ‘persisted’ at the school because of ‘homophobic language’. Ariella Wilkinson, 10, came home in tears after being questioned by Ofsted inspectors. Her mother Lena said the questioning was 'completely inappropriate' Parents say inspectors ‘aggressively’ questioned just a few young children about lesbian relationships to form the basis of their judgement. They deny their children are intolerant and are compiling a petition against Ofsted’s decision, which has the potential to close down the well-performing faith school. Ariella’s mother Lena, 46, said: ‘The questioning was completely inappropriate. They asked her what lesbians were, and whether she felt trapped in someone else’s body. ‘She said she didn’t want to talk about it, because she was embarrassed. She didn’t know why they were asking and she wasn’t prepared for it. ‘She’s been crying a lot over it. She thinks the bad Ofsted report is her fault. ‘The silly thing is, Ariella knows about same sex relationships because one of our best family friends is gay. ‘There’s no way she’s homophobic – she just didn’t realise they would be asking that kind of thing. They put her on the spot.’ After speaking to Ariella and several other students, the inspectors rated the school ‘inadequate’ on pupil safety. Open: Grindon Hall, which teaches pupils aged four to 18, has a Christian ethos but no faith-based selection criteria, resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions . They wrote: ‘Use of derogatory language relating to race or sexual orientation persists because the curriculum does not teach pupils about equality, diversity and the need to be tolerant and respectful towards those who are different to themselves. ‘Pupils’ response to inspectors’ questions showed immaturity and a lack of awareness in discussing these matters.’ But Mrs Wilkinson, a pathology registrar who lives in Sunderland, said this verdict was ‘grossly unfair’ and did not reflect the ethos of the school. She added: ‘We don’t think it’s fair to be asking children these questions. ‘They’re highly personal and they’re also irrelevant. Ofsted should be assessing the school on the quality of the education. This is beyond its remit.’ The schoolgirl said she felt to blame for the school's branding as 'intolerant' Ariella, who dreams of becoming a dentist, moved to the school three years ago from a local state school, where she was being bullied. Her mother says she has flourished at the school and gone from being a mediocre pupil to being one of the best in her year. Her younger siblings, Joel, 10, Samuel, 7, and Hannah, 5, have also thrived– with Samuel now three years ahead of his peer group in reading. Mrs Wilkinson, who is a British-born Indian, and her husband Andrew, 42, a nurse, said their children were upset by Ofsted’s findings. She added: ‘It’s true that it’s a Christian school, but the ethos is not discriminatory. My children know all about other faiths. ‘A lot of the other schools around here are dire, but this school is truly wonderful. It would be devastating if it closed down.’ Grindon Hall Christian School was placed in special measures earlier this week after officials identified serious weaknesses in teaching and behaviour from their visit in November. Principal Chris Gray strongly disputed the negative findings and said he will challenge the hostile inspection. He said: ‘We have happy, high achieving pupils, and we are oversubscribed - we always have a lot more applications than we have places. ‘Yet Ofsted’s approach to us was negative at every stage, as if the data collected had to fit a predetermined outcome.’ A Department for Education spokesperson said of Grindon Hall: ‘This school has been troubled for some time and Ofsted have been monitoring it carefully. This report shows that problems persist and there are continued concerns about leadership, the quality of learning and safeguarding.’","Ariella Wilkinson came home crying over Oftsed inspectors' questions .

"A Japanese journalist who openly admits to being a 'friend' of ISIS commanders has said he will do 'everything' in his power to negotiate the release of two men held hostage by the Islamist militants. Kosuke Shamil Tsuneoka, who claims to have developed deep contacts within ISIS, appeared on Japanese television to say he is willing to step in and negotiate on the hostages behalf. However, he says the authorities refuse to speak to him as he may be prosecuted under Japanese terrorist laws after being stopped from travelling to Syria last year. Police are said to allege he was planning to escort one young would-be jihadist to the country - a charge he denies. The journalist, who converted to Islam, has faced criticism after he was pictured holding a gun in front of the ISIS flag - a picture which he described as nothing more than an 'amusing souvenir'. Friend or foe? Pictures of Tsuneoka like this one, in front of an ISIS flag, have raised eyebrows in his home country. But he claims he could help free the two Japanese hostages being threatened with execution . A video of journalist Kenji Goto and military contractor Haruna Yukawa, kneeling in orange jumpsuits next to a hooded man, was released earlier this week, demanding $200m from Japan in return for their release. If the demands were not met, then they would be the next victims of executioner 'Jihadi John', the video claimed. Tsuneoka offered the Japanese government help dealing with ISIS on a post on his Google Plus page on Wednesday and again at a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday. 'Despite being detained illegally by Tokyo police and suffering a house search, I am willing to cooperate with the foreign office and even the police for the purpose of rescuing Japanese hostages,' he said. But Tsuneoka, who converted to Islam about 15 years ago and is one of the only journalists who have been allowed in to report from inside the caliphate, has warned he will only be able to negotiate if the Japanese authorities give him 'space'. 'We cannot make an attempt to make a contact with them right now as it contains risks to our contacts, now that Japanese police have traced down information of the contacts of Islamic State and are now bugging them,' the foreign correspondent wrote on his blog. ISIS has said they will release journalist Kenji Goto and military contractor Haruna Yukawa - who have been seen in this video - in return for $200million - the amount Japan has pledged to help fight ISIS . Tsuneoka claims his links to ISIS led to him being invited to Syria last September by the militants to act as an interpreter and translator for the 'trial' of Yukawa last October. Trials of hostages are common practice within the Islamic State, according to Tsuneoka. 'An invitation came to me from ISIS commander Omar Ghabah, one of the high up militants, ' the source revealed. 'I was making plans to be there to do what he could for Yukawa who was a hostage of ISIS and was to be tried under Islamic law.' But he was unable to travel to Syria after the Japanese authorities seized his passport, after they accused him of helping one young man's attempt to reach the country, where the student allegedly planned on becoming a fighter. But Tsuneoka said that, contrary to what the police believe, he was detained  just as he was about to leave Japan for Syria to help Yukawa. He claims to have known the approximate whereabouts of Yukawa at that time - and claims a botched rescue attempt by the US last year means the hostages have since been moved. 'Last September, ISIS contacted me and asked me to meet Mr Yukawa. They said, they will arrange a meeting in Rakka - so I guessed Mr Yukawa was somewhere nearby,' he said. But the foreign correspondent has already raised eyebrows in his home country when pictures of him posing with a Kalashnikov in front of an ISIS flag emerged. The 45-year-old has also been photographed with militant 'Sheikh Omar the Syrian', raising his index finger - a gesture which has become a sign of ISIS' cause. He revealed in a piece  piece written for France24: 'Sheikh Omar the Syrian, from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,...accepted me and treated me as a friend.' Tsuneoka - who says he cannot see the moral problem with befriending jihadists - went on to claim the pictures were just 'amusing souvenirs'. Symbol: Tsuneoka has also be photographed with alleged ISIS militant 'Sheikh Omar the Syrian' with his index finger raised - a gesture which has become a symbol of militant's cause . 'As for those photos with me holding a gun under the Al Qaeda banner, let me assure you that I don't know how to use firearms and that these pictures have no political intent. They are amusing souvenirs, nothing more,' he wrote. He is now calling on the Japanese government to appoint him and leading Japanese Muslim professor Hassan Nakata to negotiate a settlement over the two Japanese hostages. The two claim to have built trust by using the Muslim network and offering humanitarian aid. 'Myself and Mr Nakata are eligible for such negotiations because until last October, we had been communicating each with a direct subordinate (executive) under the delegate in charge of kidnapping Mr Yukawa. At that time, they told us that, they will not request ransom or either display execution of hostage,' he said - although he did not say why ISIS commanders changed their minds about the ransom. Tsuneoka - who was kept captive for five months in Afghanistan in 2010 - was also highly critical of the way in which Japan handles hostage negotiations. 'I know enough about this type of ransom demand,' he told TBS. 'I was also kidnapped before in Afghanistan. 'Despite a flood of type of blackmails from my embassy asking randomly for my release, the Japanese Embassy corresponded with my captors in an extremely cold manner. But, in the end, I was released thanks to my own efforts.’ Tsuneoka - who says he was dubbed Mr Genki the Cheerful One by his captors - say he was released when it became clear no ransom would be forthcoming from the Japanese. However, other reports say he was released after tricking his captors into allowing him to send a message on Twitter, which he was using under the guise of teaching them about the social network. The Japanese foreign ministry says the kidnappers have made no official contact with the Japanese government so far and declined to comment on Mr Tsuneoka or Mr. Nakata's offer of opening up communications with IS. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - pictured with his wife Akie - has said he will stop at nothing to secure the release of the two hostages . The country has a mixed record on paying ransoms to hostage takers. In 1977, the then Japanese prime minister, Takeo Fukuda, drew accusations of caving in to terrorists when he paid a $6million ransom to Red Army members who had hijacked a Japan Airlines flight en route from Tokyo to Paris, forcing it to land in Dhaka. The deadline for the ransom payment is expected to come just before 3pm on Friday.","Tsuneoka - a Muslim convert - is allowed to travel within the caliphate .

"A family has expressed their anger that a married teacher who had sex with their adopted eighth-grade son has been released from prison for time served. Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, was in court in Harris County, Texas on Wednesday for her sentencing after she pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a child and improper relationship with a student. But because she has been in jail since January 2013, the judge gave her credit for time served and ordered her to be released from jail without probation, KHOU11 reported. As she left the court at the end of the hearing, she was seen smiling, KPRC footage shows. Scroll down for video . Freed: Kathryn Murray, 31, smiled as she was sentenced to time served on Wednesday for repeatedly having sex with her 15-year-old student - even after she was arrested and ordered to keep away from him . In court: She must now register as a sex offender and has lost her teaching license . 'We are very disappointed with the sentence and never agreed with the sentence,' the boy's mother, Jenny Pallais, told KHOU. 'We are still working hard to put our family back together.' Her son Jimmy, who revealed his identity to ABC's 20/20 last year, had been adopted by the family from Costa Rica and brought to the U.S. when he was 14 - and barely spoke any English. Murray, who was 28 at the time, began tutoring the boy at Memorial Middle School to improve his English, and his parents noticed that he took a liking to the teacher. 'Every kid goes through that, has a crush on a teacher,' his father Alex told 20/20. 'This is an adolescent son with just a simple crush. That's it. We thought nothing of it.' Arrested: Murray, pictured left in a school photo and right in a mug shot, was tutoring the teenager to help him improve his English and they began a relationship after he wrote her a note expressing her feelings . In court: Murray leaves a Houston courtroom with attorney Robert Ross in July 2012 after her first arrest . He wrote his teacher a note to tell her how he felt about her, but ripped it up and asked her to throw the pieces in the trash - but she kept them and put them back together. 'She said, 'I read your letter',' he told ABC. 'She told me, 'I really like you, like, for real.' I said, 'I really like you.' And she... told me, 'I know, but we can't have anything'.' The Pallaises expressed their concerns to the boy's principal and asked him to switch classes - but the teenager and teacher continued to speak on Facebook - and soon started a sexual affair. They had sex in Murray's classroom at least twice, as well as at his home and even at a hotel after his father dropped him off at a school dance, according to reports. Mrs Pallais then received a text message from the teacher that was meant for her son, reading: ''You know I love you... I don't know what we're going to do, but we're going to be happy together... I'm worried about how obvious we are at school. I miss you,' ABC reported. Then her 12-year-old son told her that he had gone into his brother's room one day while his parents were out to look for the dog and found Jimmy and Murray in bed together. Victim: Jimmy Pallais, pictured speaking with ABC 20/20 last year, was just 15 when he met Murray. After her arrest, he said that he felt guilty and depressed, and he considered committing suicide . Outrage: Jenny and Alex Pallais said they believe Murray took their son's childhood from him. Mrs Pallais learned about the affair after her 12-year-old son said he found Jimmy and Murray in bed together . His shocked mother went into her son's room and gathered up all the sheets and contacted the police, who ran a DNA test on the items. 'DNA from those sheets proved that she was there,' Alex Pallais told ABC. Murray, who also had sex with the boy in her classroom, was arrested but released on $50,000 bail. She was fired from her job and ordered to keep away from the teenager. But when he started sneaking out of his room at night, his parents hired an investigator who followed the boy to Murray's father's house. Police arrived at the house and Jimmy, who was then 16, tried to escape through the back door. She was arrested again. Scene: After learning about the relationship from her younger son, Mrs Pallais gathered all the sheets from her son's bed (pictured) and they later tested positive for Murray's DNA, she said . After she was arrested for the second time in January 2013, Jimmy said he became depressed over the guilt and considered committing suicide. His parents said they feel the illicit relationship 'took his innocence away'. 'She robbed him of his childhood,' his father Alex Pallais said. Murray will now have to register as a sex offender for life. Her attorney Robert Ross said: 'I'm just glad it's behind us, so is she, so is her family. She'll start anew with a good life.'

"Like many super-organised ladies with an eye for a bargain, Rose Bradley has already bought all her gift-wrap and cards for the coming Christmas in the January sales. ‘I’ve always done it. It’s cheaper and this way you spread the cost throughout the year,’ she says. Old habits die hard, it seems — even when you’ve got a couple of million in the bank. After all, as Rose, 61, points out: ‘Why spend more money than you need to?’ It’s a slogan she’s likely to take to her grave, along with her equally thrifty friends, despite their astonishing good fortune: ten years ago, Rose and ten of her colleagues at the Tesco store where they worked in the Yorkshire town of Driffield discovered they had won £18 million on the Lottery. Valued: Back row, Rose Bradley, Sue Harris and Sue Brusby. Front row, Kirsty Holmes and Elaine Leason . Seven women and two men in the syndicate each pocketed £1.4 million while two members, who had double shares in the group’s 13 entry lines, won £2.8 million. It’s a serious amount of money by anyone’s standards, but particularly for a group who happily describe themselves as working class — checkout assistants who had spent their lives saving to pay for modest holidays and a second-hand car, or who would, in the words of Sue Brusby, 65, ‘panic’ if the washing machine broke down, because it meant blowing a hole in the tight monthly budget. All of them, then, could be forgiven for going a bit overboard with their new found wealth: WAG style mansions, a modest yacht, a Ferrari — all were within grasp in this reasonably priced part of the country. But then this is Yorkshire, where they don’t have much truck with showiness — although Sue’s husband Peter did ‘splash out’ on a second-hand Mondeo. They haven’t even engaged in the sort of bickering that often characterises syndicate relations once the fuss has died down. A decade after their win, a sizeable number of the gang meet for lunch at least once a month. ‘We don’t talk about money,’ says Rose. ‘We don’t need to. Families, homes, holidays — that’s what we chat about.’ Ringleader: Rose (pictured) and her husband Keith, 70, received £4.3 million when they won . Certainly, when I meet with five of them at a pub in Driffield there is nothing to betray their wealth. Except the suspiciously bronzed decolletage of Sue Harris, 64, who has just returned from a month-long Caribbean cruise with her husband Norman, 68, a former factory foreman. But that’s about as flashy as it gets. While Lottery history is littered with fortunes squandered, here in Yorkshire sound good sense and knowing the value of a pound is the order of the day. ‘It’s in your background I think,’ says Sue Brusby. ‘My mum and dad scrimped and saved for everything they had and I think it makes you value things more.’ Ten years ago, on a £5.67 hourly wage on the Tesco checkout, there was no cash to splash. Little wonder the Lottery was a tempting prospect, and it was Rose who kicked off proceedings. She had already worked at the store for nine years when, in 1995, it got a Lottery terminal and she decided to play. Enlisting her friends to form a syndicate, Rose insisted on a couple of rules: you paid a pound a line, if you didn’t pay you didn’t get your share if they won, and the numbers could never be changed. ‘We had 13 of us paying in at a pound a line — when a member dropped out someone else would pick up their line.’ It’s in this way that she got two shares, with her husband Keith, 70, picking up a share, too (giving the couple £4.2 million when they won). Before the big scoop, modest winnings were spent on ‘checkout’ nights out: ‘Alcohol. Lots of,’ cackles Sue Brusby. A £1,000 prize from five numbers one year left them all wondering if that was the only windfall they would ever have. That is, until the evening of Monday July 26, 2005, when Sue Brusby — who had recently been given a pay rise to £200 a week — returned from a weekend away in the family caravan and casually checked the group’s numbers. ‘And there they were,’ she recalls. ‘I said to Peter: “I think we’ve won.” I knew Rose had an early shift the next day and didn’t want to wake her up so I decided to ring her first thing and went straight to bed.’ Modest: Sue Harris (right) and her husband bought a three-bedroom detached house and she had her eyes lasered. While Kirsty Holmes' (left) only serious spending was paying off her mortgage . Astonishingly, she slept like a baby. ‘I suppose I was numb really. It hadn’t properly registered. But my husband was up all night flicking between Teletext and the numbers and back again.’ When she did ring Rose, at 6.30 the following morning, her friend didn’t believe it either. ‘All I could think about was I had to get into work as there was only me and one other lady getting the tills ready for opening,’ says Rose. Off she went, popping the winning ticket into her bra for safekeeping. Kirsty Holmes, at 26 the youngest winner, was similarly shocked. She had moved to work in a different Tesco branch three years before, but carried on paying in. Treats: Elaine Leason (left) only bought her designer handbag six years after her win while Sue Brusby (right) and her husband Peter 'splashed out' on a second-hand Ford Mondeo after the win . ‘After I’d got the call I remember ringing my dad and he kept saying: “You did pay in didn’t you?” It puts doubt in your mind. I was resisting getting worked up until I could know for sure,’ she says. All the ladies worked a shift that day. In those early weeks most of them barely spent a penny — not even Rose and Keith with their £4.2 million windfall. ‘I used to draw my husband £40 out the cashpoint every week for petrol and spends,’ Rose says. ‘After we won he still wanted £40, saying he didn’t need any more. I was the same. ‘A few weeks later I even got a call from my bank saying: “It’s your money, Mrs Bradley, you can spend it you know.” And I told them there was nothing that I wanted.’ She even admits to missing work. ‘Not the early starts — I sometimes used to get up at 4.30am — but I missed the people. I still do.’ Eventually, the Bradleys bought a house — upgrading from their semi to a £350,000 four-bedroom bungalow — and a couple of new cars. They also paid for a ‘fancy bash’ for their daughter’s wedding the following year. The other members were similarly measured. ‘My husband got a BMW, we bought a three-bedroom detached house and I got my eyes lasered — I’d always said that if I had any money I’d get them done, so I did,’ says Sue Harris. There is, though, the cruising. ‘After our first cruise we never looked back. Now we go four times a year. We’ve seen the world, which we never ever thought we’d do.’ Even by the ladies modest standards though, the Brusbys, who have been married for 47 years and have three grown up children, took caution to the extreme. ‘Peter would happily have sat on it for five years,’ says his wife. ‘I did have to point out that he was in his 60s, I wasn’t far off and that we might as well get on with it.’ They bought a bungalow and upgraded their caravan. So diamonds and designer handbags came there none — the rather smart Louis Vuitton I spy on the arm of Elaine Leason, 54, only materialised six years after her win on the insistence of her 24-year-old daughter, who said she should treat herself to mark her 50th birthday. Happy: Top row, Kirsty Holmes, Sue Harris and Sue Brusby. Bottom row, Rose Bradley and Elaine Leason . Her only diamonds, meanwhile, have come in the form of a DIY tile cutter that Rob bought her for a birthday recently. ‘I did ask for something with diamonds in it and apparently there’s a diamond in the trimmer. I still didn’t speak to him for a bit though,’ she says. Even Kirsty, the youngster of the group, was a model of probity: in the months after pocketing £2.8 million her only serious spending was paying off her £70,000 mortgage. She also carried on her work at the Tesco checkout and only left following comments that she was taking work from someone who might need the money. She admits she struggled to know what to do with herself when she stopped working. So she flew to South Africa and spent a year volunteering in schools. She met Chris, 41, a painter and decorator, on her return, and the couple married five years ago. As a single lady in possession of a Lottery fortune, how could she know his intentions were honourable? ‘Of course, you wonder what people are thinking when they meet you. It helped that I knew him through friends. Ultimately you just have to trust your instincts.’ These days the money helps her be a stay-at-home mum to their three children while Chris goes out to work. Time for the million-pound question: can money buy happiness? It comes as no surprise that they all resolutely shake their heads. ‘I lost Dad two years ago and I would give it all away in a heartbeat if it meant having him back,’ says Sue Harris.’ Rose adds: ‘We were happy before all this. It’s about the people you’re surrounded by — children, grandchildren. And your health.’","Ten years ago 11 colleagues at Tesco in Yorkshire won £18m on Lottery .

"Ukip candidate Lynton Yates (pictured) has been suspended after saying the jobless shouldn't drive . A Ukip General Election candidate has been suspended after he said benefits claimants should be banned from driving to cut traffic - and take the bus to job interviews instead. The policy, which was swiftly disowned by the party, was in a flyer boasting 'common sense solutions'  sent out by a 64-year-old county councillor in Leicestershire. Lynton Yates claimed it would remove 6million cars from the roads - adding he'd cut traffic further by forcing cyclists back onto the pavement. The leaflet faced widespread scorn within minutes of appearing on Twitter and has prompted an investigation by party bosses. Mr Yates has now been suspended from his post as Ukip's General Election candidate for the seat of Charnwood. A party spokesman said: 'Lynton Yates' views do not represent Ukip policy. He has apologised for any offence caused and was today suspended as a candidate.' The spokesman would not confirm whether the suspension was temporary or permanent. He remained a member of the party and a councillor today. The leaflet boasted: 'We could likely remove six million cars from the road if benefit claimants were not driving. 'Why do they have the privilege to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned money on a car, when those in work are struggling to keep their own car on the road? 'These people could really catch a bus! 'Yet again we're proposing common sense policies and common sense solutions'. His leaflet added: 'As much as I applaud cycling as a form of exercise and past-time [sic] the already congested roads cannot cope with both bus lanes AND cyclists. 'Cycles should go back to the pavements yet give priority to pedestrians.' Former Conservative Mr Yates became a Leicestershire councillor in 1989 and now serves on the council's transport committee. He was due to fight the Leicestershire seat of Charnwood at the general election in May - where the current MP is former Tory minister Stephen Dorrell, who has been in the Commons since 1979. Mr Dorrell is standing down as an MP to become a health policy adviser for accountants KPMG. Ridicule: This photograph of the leaflet circulated widely on Twitter, where users ridiculed the 'policies' Shadow health minister Jamie Reed said the Eurosceptic party was now 'beyond a joke'. Labour MP Mr Reed said: 'It's beyond a joke now. Not so much a political party but a stag night out of control.' The councillor raised a similar issue during a meeting last month in which he tried to stop cycle lanes being built. 'You're like lemmings when it comes to what central government tells you,' he said. 'They can be wrong. Major got it wrong telling cyclists to come off the payment.' But his comments were disowned today by his only Ukip colleague in Leicestershire David Sprason, who tweeted: 'The views expressed by Lynton Yates are his own and do not reflect my or Ukip's policy'. Elsewhere in the leaflet Mr Yates said he personally believed rapists and child sex offenders should be chemically castrated. He also said he believed all prisoners should have their possessions confiscated and sent to serve their sentences abroad - though how this would save money was unclear. Opinions: The full leaflet by Mr Yates, which said prisoners should be sent to serve their sentences overseas . Campaign: The reverse side of the open letter said David Cameron will 'never, never' give an EU referendum . 'Prisoners cost the taxpayer upwards of £45,000 per annum EACH,' he wrote. 'Any assets of convicted criminals, for example homes, cars, savings, etc, should be confiscated to help pay for their sentence. 'I personally would look to overseas countries who could tender for their incarceration. I'm sure they could dramatically reduce this cost to the taxpayer.' His Labour opponent for the Charnwood seat, Sean Kelly-Walsh, said: 'It is a sad indictment of a political party that is aiming to have a say in how this country is governed that he should state something so inane, not thought through, and frankly depressing in its vindictive simplicity.' But Max Hunt, the Labour group leader on Leicestershire County Council, claimed Mr Yates had previously suggested cutting back bus funding because many passengers were benefits claimants. 'He's not mad', said Mr Hunt. 'There are a lot of people who say things like that in bar rooms. Plenty of people think like that and they're Ukip supporters.' When asked if he agreed with the leaflet, Mr Hunt said: 'Of course not'. A Ukip spokesman said last night the suggestions were 'not Ukip policies and they will not form part of the Ukip manifesto.' Views: Mr Yates during a meeting last month in which he said funding for cycle lanes should be restricted . Gaffes: Party leader Nigel Farage has had to deal with a series of out-of-turn comments by his own members. He personally suggested immigrants might be to blame for congestion on the M4 . This morning the councillor remained in the party and in his county council job. The party's spokesman told MailOnline: 'There's no doubt he's been a bit of an idiot but it's of a different value to racism or things of that sort. 'We can't chuck somebody out even for abject racism in 24 hours. We have to go through due process. 'There will be discussions made and decisions taken as with anything but he is still a member of the party'. Mr Yates did not return requests for comment. This week Ukip was forced to deny claims its policy chief had been sacked amid fears the party's General Election manifesto would not be ready in time for the spring conference in March. Tim Aker left his post with just months to go before the biggest campaign in the party's history, but Ukip candidates still have little they are able to say on the doorstep. That led Twitter users to fill the gap by suggesting their own Ukip policies - including a price cut for mustard-coloured corduroy trousers and renaming Britain 'Bongo Bongo Land'. Many of the supposed policies referenced Ukip's string of gaffes. One councillor said last winter's floods were God's punishment for the legalisation of gay marriage, while party leader Nigel Farage appeared to blame immigrants for congestion on the M4.","Campaign flyer sent out by Leicestershire county councillor Lynton Yates .

"Gun control: Karl Pierson's Facebook posts suggested he favored tighter laws on firearms . Colorado gunman Karl Pierson, who seriously injured a 17-year-old girl when he opened fire at his school, supported tougher gun laws. The 18-year-old, who had been dropped from the debate team, was said to have had strong views on politics and gun control, classmates said. Pierson was also allegedly suspended from the school in September for making threats against the team coach, Tracy Murphy, believed to have been the target for Friday's attack. 'He had very strong beliefs about gun laws and stuff,' junior Abbey Skoda told the Denver Post. The paper reported that Pierson had once posted an image on Facebook with the slogan: 'The Republican Party: Health Care: Let . 'em Die, Climate Change: Let 'em Die, Gun Violence: Let 'em Die, Women's . Rights: Let 'em Die, More War: Let 'em Die. Is this really the side you . want to be on?' The post had been removed on Saturday. Despite seemingly supporting gun control, Pierson legally bought the shotgun that he used only one week before carrying out his attack. The teenager carried out his attack while his mother, who he had been living with since his parents divorced, was out of town caring for a sick relative. During the attack he fired five times, shooting 17-year-old Claire Davis at point blank range, before shooting himself in the library.

Claire, who is not believed to have known Pierson, is in critical condition in hospital. County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said at a . press conference on Saturday afternoon that Claire was 'an innocent victim of . an evil act of violence'. A vigil was held for the popular student on Saturday night, as her parents called for prayers and privacy. Sheriff Robinson said Pierson's 'evil intent' had been to harm multiple people. Several students at Arapahoe High School claimed that the outspoken teenager had been in an argument with Mr Tracy, believed to be his intended target, earlier in the year, which led to him being dropped from the team. Joe Redmond, one of the captains of the team, told the Los Angeles Times that Pierson had been suspended from school for two weeks in September for making threats. 'When he came back he was really, really angry,' Joe said, adding that he asked Pierson to return to the team on Monday after they came first in a tournament. But the 18-year-old said he still hated Mr Tracy and told him: 'Apparently you get suspended for threatening to kill a teacher.' Terror: The students kept their hands in the air where the gunman opened fire on Friday afternoon . Reunited: Students meet with their relieved parents at a fast food joint across from the high school . Joe defended his friend's memory though, telling the paper: 'At the end of the day Karl was a good person ... I loved to be around him. I loved to talk to him. It’s always a shame when you hear friends making bad choices, but this one was particularly devastating.' Some reports said Pierson, who was armed with a shotgun, machete and petrol bombs, had been shouting the coach's name as he began firing inside the school. Mr Murphy was credited for leaving the building in an attempt to move the gunman away from fellow students.","18-year-old legally bought shotgun week before using it in attack .

"A married couple have been trampled to death by an elephant at an Indian wildlife reserve after the flash of their camera caused it to charge at them. The pair were part of a group of eight that had were on a two-hour trekking expedition organised by the state forest department in Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala. According to reports, the couple had tried to take a picture of a herd of elephants, with the flash of the camera provoking the animals. The couple had been trying to take pictures of a herd of elephants at the Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, pictured, when they trampled by one of the animals . It is thought that one elephant then began to charge at the husband and wife, who were trampled and  died on the spot. The couple, from Gujrat, have been named as Bhupendra Raval, aged 52, who works as a general  manager in a private firm and his 50-year-old scientist wife Jagruthy. A forest official told the Times of India: 'The couple did not have time to move from the elephant's path as it ran straight into them in a mad frenzy.' A guide leading the trip was also hurt in the stampede. The tiger reserve is popular with tourists and the town of Gavi, where the reserve is located, attracts more than 1,000 visitors a day during the peak tourist season. Many people go to the area to see the town's large elephant population. It is thought that the herd of elephants were spooked by the flash from the couple's camera, which provoked one of them to charge the couple (file picture) But officials have been concerned that the increase in visitors may be reducing the wildlife there and may restrict the number of tourists. V K Venkatchalam from the Elephant Task Force said: 'Trekking trails should be banned and people should be taken only for Safari rides in grilled vehicles. 'The elephants may turn violent especially if they are in musth.' According to the latest figures, in 2013/14, 19 people, mostly from tribal areas around the forest in Kerala, were killed after being trampled by wild elephants.","Married couple were on a trekking expedition in Periyar Tiger Reserve .

"Sony bosses are bracing themselves for more embarrassment in the latest wave of hacked emails. Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton has called on his department heads to offer a 'blanket apology' in advance of any details that come out, claim industry sources. Insiders said that top executives at Sony Music are particularly worried about details of salaries and artists' contracts and performance riders being released  by hackers Guardians of the Peace. Scroll down for video . Sony Music, whose artists  include Beyoncé (pictured), are concerned about details of  contracts, including live performance riders, being made public in a new wave of released e-mails . Artists signed to Sony labels include Beyoncé, One Direction, David Bowie, AC/DC, Pitbull, Barbra Streisand and Adele. Sony's movie division was rocked with scandal last month after hackers released a series of emails between Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin. They appeared to mock President Obama, implying he only liked movies with black actors and subject matter. Rudin also launched a scathing attack on actress Angelina Jolie, calling her a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton (pictured) called his department heads to offer a 'blanket apology' in advance of any details of their signed artists . Sony's movie division was rocked with scandal after an email exchanges between Amy Pascal (left) and producer Scott Rudin (right) emerged mocking the President and criticising actress Angelina Jolie . Details of employees' salaries and medical records, as well as new scripts were also leaked online, in a series of hacking attacks stemming from Seth Rogen and James Franco's Kim Jong-un assassination comedy 'The Interview.' But now it appears as though Sony Music may have become a target after recently leaked e-mails revealed that the division was working on a 'top-secret project'  to potentially sell off music publishing division Sony/ATV. Mr Lynton and Sony/ATV head Martin Bandier have both denied Sony Music is for sale. Rudin had called Angelina Jolie (left) a 'minimally talented spoiled brat', while another email from a producer said of actor Michael Fassbender (right) 'he makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia' Sony Music's had remained relatively unscathed in the original hacking scandal which stemmed from the Kim Jong-un assassination comedy 'The Interview' (pictured) starring Seth Rogen and James Franco . But insider sources  told Page Six the CEO then called a number of department heads within Sony, including Mr Bandier and Sony Music CEO Doug Morris, 'to give a blanket apology in advance for whatever else comes out,'. However, another source close to Sony disputed the claims that Mr Lynton made a blanket apology and said he only called two top executives about a number of specific issues. Another insider added that Sony Music execs are 'really stressed their stuff is going to get leaked,' including, 'information on salaries and artists' recording contracts.' If looks could kill: Sony chairman Amy Pascal ran into Angelina Jolie days after the emails discussing the actress were leaked . Last month saw a stream of emails released by hackers which appeared to attack many of Hollywood's A listers and even mocked Barack Obama. The shocking revelations were released by hackers Guardians of the Peace, linked to North Korea, in response to the Kim Jong-un assassination comedy 'The Interview'. The hackers began their reign of terror on November 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers 'we've obtained all your internal data.' The computers remained down for over a week, and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the Brad Pitt war drama Fury as well as unreleased studio titles including Annie, Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love On Her Arms online. Speculation began to mount that North Korea was likely behind the hack, based on the fact that the country's UN ambassador Ja Song Nam wrote a letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made, let alone released. In December  the hackers ramped up their attacks, releasing the salaries of the company's top executives and the script for the new James Bond film. They also made public the now-infamous set of emails between Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin. In them, they mock President Obama, implying the President only liked movies with black actors and subject matter such as 12 Years a Slave. Rudin also makes a particularly vicious criticism of Angelina Jolie who he labels 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one email, and in another exchange actually removes her from  the chain in order to tell Pascal that the actress is 'out of her mind.' The pair later made public apologies for their comments. Other emails revealed Pascal was keen for British actor Idris Elba to become the next James Bond, while one producer says of actor Michael Fassbender 'he makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia.' Pascal and producer Scott Rudin had mocked Barack Obama in the email exchange, implying the President only liked movies with black actors and subject matter such as 12 Years a Slave . The cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives also included the pseudonyms actors such as Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman and Jessica Alba used to check into hotels and book car services. The hacking group also starts dumping employee medical records, and most notably there letter on December 8 demanding that Sony stop the release of their upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview. On December 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch, the group announces plans for their upcoming 'Christmas gift' which they say will put Sony 'into the worst state.' Then things go quiet until December 16, when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play The Interview when it is released on December 25. It results in the four largest theater chains in the country announcing they will not show the film, and the following day Sony cancels the film's release. But after facing fierce criticism for canceling the release, the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing The Interview online and in certain movie theaters.","Executives at Sony Music are preparing for hackers to release more e-mails .

"The Doomsday Clock’s minute hand has been moved two minutes closer to midnight as experts warn we are closer than ever to a global catastrophe. In a live international news conference, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) said that the threat of climate change and nuclear war posed a very serious threat to modern society. Their symbolic clock is now set at three minutes to midnight, but while they say it is not too late to avert disaster ‘the window for action is closing rapidly’. Scroll down for full timeline and video . In an announcement today the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) has moved the minute hand of the symbolic Doomsday Clock forward by two minutes. It is now at three minutes to midnight, the closest it has been since 1984. The BAS moved the clock due to the threat of nuclear war and climate change . The conference took place at 4pm GMT (11am EST) today. Key topics discussed included evidence of accelerating climate change and the increasing threat of nuclear war after failed promises from various international governments. ‘The danger is great but our message is not one of hopelessness,’ Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS), said in the announcement. She said that there was still time to act, but real steps needed to be taken soon in order to ‘avert catastrophe.’ ‘We find conditions to be so threatening that we are moving the hand two minutes closer. It is now three minutes to midnight,’ she continued. Countries emitting carbon dioxide and other gases are transforming Earth’s climate in a dangerous way, she said, leaving millions vulnerable to rising sea levels, famines and 'killer storms.' She also cited a failure by governments around the world to reduce their nuclear arsenal, in particular the US and Russia. In total it is estimated 16,300 nuclear weapons remain in the world - and just 50 to 100 could produce massive casualties and long lasting effects on the atmosphere. The BAS was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The physicists later set up the Clock in 1947 after their atomic bombs hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II (pictured) Tick tock: Here Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS), is shown unveiling the New Doomsday Clock during a news conference in 2007. The BAS hosted a live conference to reveal the Science and Security Board's decision to move the clock two minutes closer to midnight . Countries emitting carbon dioxide and other gases (stock image shown) are transforming Earth’s climate in a dangerous way, according to the BAS, leaving millions vulnerable to rising sea levels, famines and 'killer storms.' The BAS want to see action taken to cap greenhouse gases to 2°C above pre-industrial levels . ‘Members of the BAS board are today imploring citizens of the world to speak clearly and demand leaders take necessary steps,’ Ms Benedict continued. The BAS want to see action taken to cap greenhouse gases to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and reduce spending on nuclear weapons. ‘We are not saying it is too late, but the window for action is closing rapidly,’ she added. ‘The world needs to awaken from its lethargy. Moving the clock hand inspires changes to help push the process along.’ The BAS was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The physicists set up the Doomsday Clock in 1947 after their atomic bombs hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. Their Clock was created to convey threats to humanity and the planet. Midnight represents Doomsday, or when these threats will peak and cause a global catastrophe. The BAS also cited a failure by governments around the world to reduce their nuclear arsenal, in particular the US and Russia.

Climate threats: The announcement not only warned of the threat of nuclear weapons, but also climate change as well. This graphic from last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows observed examples of climate change worldwide . The decision to move the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock is made by the Bulletin's Board of Directors in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 18 Nobel Laureates. The Clock has become a universally recognised indicator of the world's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons, climate change, and emerging technologies in  life sciences. Since it was set up, the hand on the clock has moved 18 times, and each move represents how the scientists view the world's chances of survival in the face of these threats.

Source: Bulletin of Atomic Scientists . When the hand was moved to five minutes to midnight in 2012, the BAS said it believed the world had entered a 'second nuclear age'. The first nuclear age ended with the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in 1991 by the US and Russia. However, according to the BAS, both countries have a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons that could be launched at a moment's notice. At the time, the BAS criticised nuclear watchdogs around the world for failing to take a stand on these weapons and national policies. Soaring global temperatures: Noaa's data revealed that 2014 was the hottest year since records began. This map is made up of provisional data from 2014 up to October. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years . Terrorist threats: Recent  attacks in France, following the publication of a a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad in Charlie Hebdo (pictured), could feature among the reasons for moving the Clock's minute hand . Food shortages are expected to get worse . Last year's IPCC report claimed increases in crop yields have slowed over the last 40 years. Some studies now point to dramatic declines in some crops over the next 50 years - especially wheat and corn. Violent conflict may be triggered as a result . Climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees. Fights over resources, like water and energy, hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world. Gap between the rich and poor to widen . Poor people are going to bear an unfair burden of climate change, the report said. Climate change is going to exacerbate existing inequalities, and it is going to make it harder for people to fight their way out of poverty. In 2014,  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report said there was evidence of accelerating climate change, and criticised the world's efforts to curb greenhouse emissions. Global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880, according to US scientists. And 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred in the 21st century, something highlighted by President Obama in his recent State of the Union address. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years. The Met Office had previously announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910. Last year, President Obama  revealed his country's 30-year plan to modernise its nuclear program. The modernisation is expected to cost almost £660 billion ($1 trillion), according to the Centre on Nuclear Security.","Symbolic clock was established by Manhattan Project scientists in 1947 .

The mesage said: 'Clint and I would like to thank everyone again for all of your messages and support. It means so much to us all at this time. I am trying to read all the messages and thank you so much for reaching out to us. Although way too short, our babies lives were incredibly happy and they were loved by so many. Thank you everyone so very much. Love to all. XOXO' The post added: 'And of course Don and Sandy ""Dee Dee and Pop Pop"" the two most incredible, generous, hilarious people anyone could ever know. I am thankful for the 16 years I had with them too, as I'm sure everyone else who had the pleasure of knowing them is as well. According to The Baltimore Sun, Randy and Stacey Boone, parents of Lexi and Katie, have a three-week-old son who was not at the Pyles' home on Sunday. A previous family statement given to WUSA9 read: 'On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need. Emotional: The message put on Facebook by Eve Morrison, mother to two of the child victims, Charlotte, 8, and Wesley Boone, 6 . 'We recognize the dedicated efforts from Anne Arundel County Fire and Police Departments, the Naval Academy, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and other first responders. We want our community to know how proud we are of all who have helped us. 'Our love for our family is boundless. Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. 'Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.' Investigators on Wednesday found two bodies  in the charred remains of the home in Annapolis, Maryland after the property burned to the ground on Monday. The bodies were with the medical examiner and have not yet been identified. It is not known whether the bodies children of adults. Federal and local investigators returned to the site to continue the search on Thursday. Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Three people embrace outside the gates of the home, where Investigators found the bodies of two unidentified people on Wednesday . Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren . 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 'It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.' The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early on Monday. The blaze has reduced the 16,000-square-foot waterfront castle to ruins. The fire was reported about 3.30am on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside. Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby. Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish on Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed. Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play. Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am Monday . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle said the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning. The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack. However, Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene. Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people'.

Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted. His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'","Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8, and six-year-old Wesley Boone were all missing .

"WENT THE DAY WELL? WITNESSING WATERLOO . by David Crane . (William Collins, £20) We know that it was not until Wednesday, June 21, 1815, three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern-day Belgium, that news of the Battle of Waterloo reached London. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, was dining with friends when the exhausted figure of Major Henry Percy burst in, carrying two captured French imperial eagle standards. Liverpool immediately insisted on going to see the Prince Regent, the future George IV, who was also dining nearby. The Prince was naturally delighted, but hoped that ‘we have not suffered much loss’. Went The Day Well? Witnessing Waterloo by David Crane . ‘The loss has been very great indeed,’ said Major Percy sadly. The Prince promptly burst into tears. The Battle of Waterloo is one of the great narrative set pieces in our entire history. The details are irresistible: Napoleon’s flight from Elba; the British officers dancing in Brussels; the French emperor’s arrogant confidence; Wellington’s grim determination; the gruelling clash in the Belgian mud; the final charge of the French Imperial Guard; the last-gasp, Hollywood-style intervention of Marshal Blücher’s Prussians. But it is a familiar story, which historians have told over and over again. How refreshing it is, then, to read David Crane’s magnificent book, by far the most enjoyable account of the battle I have ever encountered. Most military histories are a bit like football books, bogged down in the detail of groin strains and offside decisions — or rather, troop dispositions and artillery mechanics — without ever managing to make you care. But Crane has had the brilliant idea of interweaving a fast, colourful narrative of the battle with the story of what was happening in Britain that drizzly Sunday, June 18. His book is not just a military history; it is a social and cultural panorama, taking in everything from murderers and vicars to portrait-painters and prize-fighters. In his introduction, he compares it with Bruegel’s famous painting The Fall Of Icarus, in which the painter’s stolid labourers plough in the foreground while Icarus plunges to his death far in the distance. But in a sense he is selling himself short, because his book is much more entertaining than that sounds. Much of the action takes place hundreds of miles from Waterloo. We meet an extraordinary range of cultural superstars, from the talented but troubled writer Mary Lamb, who stabbed her mother to death during a bout of madness, to the pamphleteer William Hazlitt, the ancestor of today’s newspaper columnists, who claimed that ‘a man must be a good hater’. But Crane also plunges us deep into Regency London, ‘a world of prize-fighting, carriage-racing, bull-baiting, mail-coach driving, badger-drowning and the great clown Grimaldi’. As his characters move through the day, from the early hours to midnight, Crane gently cranks up the tension. Even as the armies are preparing for battle, he whisks us off to the Scottish isle of Harris, where a poor teenage mother is abandoning her stillborn child by the road. As Wellington’s men take up their positions, Crane takes us to Altrincham, where children are gathering for their weekly Sunday school class. A s the bullets are flying and thousands of men are drowning in their own blood, the narrative switches to Arundel Castle, where day-trippers have come to watch a jousting tournament to mark the 600th anniversary of Magna Carta. All the time there is the almost unbearable sense that everybody is waiting — waiting for news of the battle that they know will decide the Napoleonic Wars. Crane makes a persuasive case that this long struggle, just like the world wars of the 20th century, was a ‘total war’. For two decades, the struggle against the French had been the defining issue of our national life. Little wonder the tension hung heavy that Sunday. In one of countless beautifully observed moments, Crane describes the great moral reformer and anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce, leading his children to church. ‘Perhaps at this very moment,’ Wilberforce said to them as they walked, ‘when we are walking thus in peace together to the House of God, our brave fellows may be fighting hard in Belgium. Oh how grateful we should be for all God’s goodness to us!’ We know that it was not until Wednesday, June 21, 1815, three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern-day Belgium, that news of the Battle of Waterloo reached London . Against this background, the suffering of Wellington’s men is all the more striking. Crane has a superb eye for fascinating little nuggets, such as the fact that nobody at the battle knew what time it was, since in those pre-railway timetable days, even those men who wore watches had them all set slightly differently. But he is also very good at the blood and guts. One memorable passage describes the last moments of the boxer Jack Shaw — then, Crane thinks, the most famous soldier in the army — who, steaming with pre-match booze, smashed a French officer’s head in two with his sword, bashed two more opponents’ brains out and was finally cornered against a wall by a great mob of Frenchmen. Another describes the extraordinary stoicism of Wellington’s cavalry commander Lord Uxbridge, whose leg was shot away and had to be amputated on the field of battle. There was no anaesthetic in those days, but Uxbridge remained remarkably jolly even as the doctor was beginning to slice away. At one stage, the saw got stuck in the bone. ‘Damn the saw!’ said the doctor, at which Uxbridge, said cheerfully: ‘What is the matter?’ The real heroes of Crane’s book, though, are the ordinary, nameless soldiers, the men from Aberystwyth and Aberdeen, Warrington and Wolverhampton, who gave their lives to bring down Napoleon’s empire. One lovely story says it all. A few days before the battle, Wellington met Thomas Creevy, a visiting British politician, in the park in Brussels. Creevy asked if Napoleon could be beaten. At that, Wellington pointed to a small figure in the distance: a British infantryman in his red coat, peering at the park’s statues. ‘There,’ the great man said. ‘There, it all depends upon that article whether we do the business or not. Give me enough of it, and I am sure.’ And he was, of course, magnificently right.","It wasn't until three days after the Battle of Waterloo, in June 1815,  that the news reached London .

"A £900billion bailout for the crisis-torn eurozone was unveiled yesterday in a last-ditch bid to kick-start growth. The European Central Bank outlined a massive money-printing programme known as quantitative easing as it stepped up the fight against deflation and stagnation. The central bank will create nearly £46billion of extra cash every month between March this year and September next year – a total of almost £900billion. The European Central Bank outlined a massive money-printing programme known as quantitative easing as it stepped up the fight against deflation and stagnation . The landmark decision – which will see the ECB buy government and corporate bonds across the 19 countries of the single currency bloc – is intended to cut borrowing costs and boost lending to families and businesses. The prospect of billions of euros flooding into the system sent the euro tumbling on the foreign exchange markets – a move the ECB hopes will boost exports by making goods produced in the eurozone cheaper for foreign buyers. Sterling quickly hit a seven-year high against the euro, with £1 buying 1.32 euros. This makes European holidays cheaper for British tourists, but it also makes British exports to Europe more expensive, so less competitive. The health of the eurozone is crucial to Britain because it is the UK’s largest trading partner and can have a huge impact on confidence on this side of the Channel. George Osborne (pictured) said it was ‘welcome action’ from the ECB ‘but not sufficient for a European recovery’ Speaking at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, George Osborne said it was ‘welcome action’ from the ECB ‘but not sufficient for a European recovery’. Calling on European governments to grasp the nettle, the Chancellor added: ‘We want to see this accompanied by clear plans to make the European continent more competitive, to back business in Europe, to create jobs and to make sure public finances are in order. ‘Now we have all those ingredients in the UK and that is why our economic plan is delivering a strong economic recovery. 'We want to see all those ingredients in place on the European continent so that the whole of Europe recovers. ‘The fact that the ECB had to take this drastic action shows the European economy is much weaker than the UK economy and it’s also a warning to Britain of the risks that lie ahead if we were to abandon our long term economic plan.’ ECB president Mario Draghi (pictured) described the QE programme as ‘very large’ and said it will continue until inflation returns towards the target of close to but under 2 per cent . Unemployment is already stubbornly high at 11.5 per cent in the single currency bloc compared with 5.8 per cent in the UK. Around a quarter of Greeks and Spaniards who want work cannot find a job including half of those under the age of 25. This crisis has sparked fears of a ‘lost generation’ in the eurozone and experts believe it risks a rise in extremist parties – such as the radical Left-wing, anti-austerity Syriza party, which is leading the polls ahead of elections in Greece on Sunday. Eurozone leaders hope that by kick-starting growth the QE programme will prevent a repeat of the riots that have been seen in Greece, Spain and elsewhere against austerity measures, which were introduced to try to tackle the debt crisis . Germany has long opposed QE in the eurozone amid concerns in Berlin that it amounts to bailout for spendthrift countries and could encourage governments to renege on economic reforms. What is quantitative easing? QE is the method used by central banks to stimulate growth in an ailing economy when all else – including slashing interest rates – fails. It involves the creation of new money to be injected into ailing economies to stimulate growth. It is sometimes called printing money but no hard cash is actually printed. Transactions are largely electronic. How does it work? The central bank uses its newly-created ‘money’ to buy bonds from banks and other institutions, increasing the amount of cash in the financial system. In theory this inflow of money encourages cash-rich banks to lend more to business and individuals, enabling companies to expand and people to spend more. This should generate more jobs. Who’s done it before? The Bank of England launched a £375billion QE programme in March 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis and the US Federal Reserve has bought bonds worth $3.7 trillion (£2.4 trillion) since starting QE in 2008. Flashpoint: Police are attacked in Greece during anti-austerity protests in 2012 . Both have now wound down the programme because their economies have improved. Has it worked? It depends who you ask. The Bank of England estimates that its QE programme helped increase the UK’s annual economic output by between 1.5pc and 2pc. Homeowners have benefited, as mortgage rates have fallen to record lows. But QE has been a disaster for millions of pensioners because it has pushed down savings and annuity rates, which determine their annual retirement income. Banks have also hoarded much of the money they have received instead of lending it. What about the eurozone? The European Central Bank’s new QE plan – which will pour around £900billion into the eurozone’s banking system over 20 months – is intended to prevent deflation and address appalling levels of unemployment and economic growth. Deflation – or negative inflation – is when prices fall year on year. This usually leads to a fall in incomes and thus tax revenues. Deflation also means debt becomes more expensive to service and people are reluctant to spend money, believing prices will fall further. Will it work in Europe? It should help, but some experts fear its impact may be limited when the £900billion is spread across 19 countries. The cash might also cause troubled economies such as France and Greece to delay reforming their labour markets and cutting borrowing and debt. How does it affect the UK? The pound is likely to strengthen significantly against the euro. This is good for holidaymakers, but bad for exports because UK goods and services will become more expensive abroad. In the long run it should help Britain if the eurozone – our biggest export market – is shaken out of its torpor. Eurozone countries will have to apply to the ECB if they want to take advantage of the stimulus package. The amount of new money available to each nation is yet to be calculated, but the ECB has stipulated that it will not buy bonds equivalent to more than one-third of a country’s debt. ECB president Mario Draghi described the QE programme as ‘very large’ and said it will continue until inflation returns towards the target of close to but under 2 per cent – raising the prospect of it lasting beyond September next year. ‘We believe that the measures will be effective, will raise medium term inflation expectations and will address the economic situation in the euro area,’ he said at the ECB’s headquarters in Frankfurt. But British business leaders warned that Mr Draghi’s proposals could be ‘too little too late’. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The ECB’s QE programme is unlikely to solve the fundamental challenges facing the eurozone, which needs sweeping structural changes to return to health.’","European Central Bank outlines massive money-printing programme .

"Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by ISIS jihadis, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned today. Speaking ahead of a counter-terror summit in London today, he warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'. As foreign ministers from across the globe fly into London to discuss strategy to take on the jihadis and prevent Paris-style atrocities. Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured with US Secretary of State John Kerry today, warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack' David Cameron met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street, where he vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem'. Speaking in No 10, Mr Cameron said: 'The threat from extremist terror you face in Iraq is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom ... We will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the mayhem we see today.' Later Mr Abadi will join representatives from 21 countries, including US secretary of state John Kerry and French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, for talks which will focus on military support for fighters battling against ISIS - also known as Isil, as well as by its Arabic acronym Daesh. The Hammond is hosting the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS at Lancaster House in London . Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hammond stressed the danger of terror attack in the UK by people inspired by events in Iraq and Syria. 'We have to regard Isil as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment,' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1's Breakfast. 'There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria. 'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent. 'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.' David Cameron met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street ahead of the security summit in London . Mr Cameron vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem' But he warned that Iraq's security forces will not be ready for months to take on ISIS fighters who have seized large swathes of the country. The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that despite huge sums spent by the United States and Britain on Iraq's security forces in the years following the ousting of Saddam Hussein, they had fallen back into a 'state of disarray'. 'There is a big challenge ahead of us,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'We are renewing and regenerating the Iraqi security forces - re-equipping them, retraining them, reorganising them - but it will be months yet before they are ready to start significant combat operations against Isil.' Air strikes by Britain and its allies had 'very effectively' contained ISIS while action was taken to 'rebuild' the Iraqi armed forces to enable them to drive the militants out of their country, he said, adding: 'They will be able to do it, the question is when they will be ready to start that process.'","Hammond warns against complacency in the fight to disrupt terror plots .

"The most likely place in Britain to get burgled is in east London, research found today . The RM8 postcode of Dagenham and Becontree, which has an average house value of £220,000, was said to have the highest rate of burglary insurance claims. Those living in and around the capital are most likely to suffer break-ins - with 14 of the top 20 postcodes in London, according to the study by price comparison site MoneySuperMarket.

Manchester's M21 postcode of Chorlton-cum-Hardy and Barlow Moor, on the outskirts of the city, slipped from top spot last year to third position in this year's burglary claims table. Woodford and South Woodford in E18 in east London had the fifth highest number of claims, while the capital’s sought-after suburbs of Teddington and Bushy Park in TW11 are also in the top ten. Kevin Pratt from MoneySuperMarket said: ‘Our annual Burglary Claims Tracker reveals the nation's burglary claim hotspots, and once again London and Greater London postcodes dominate.

The average is about a third of the mean price in London of £600,000, according to Zoopla. Dagenham, originally a Saxon settlement, was mainly rural until the 1920s when housing estates and the Ford motor factory was built. In terms of the number of criminal offences recorded per 1,000 people, the area is said to be worse than the national average in the categories of vehicle crime, violent crime, robbery, anti-social behaviour and burglary. Its total crime figure is 2.91, which is 17 per cent worse than the national average of 2.48, according to the data website Postcode Area. All three MPs who cover the RM8 postcode are Labour - those being Jon Cruddas for Dagenham and Rainham, Mike Gapes for Ilford South and Margaret Hodge for Barking. The area was found to be the worst place in Britain to retire, in a study by Prudential last year. And it came tenth in a list of the worst places to live in England by website ILiveHere. ‘Burglars often target urban areas where there's more hustle and bustle and so less risk of being caught. ‘But not surprisingly they also follow the money, which is why affluent areas such as Teddington and Temple Newsam in West Yorkshire appearing in the top 20 claims hotspots.’ Postcodes in rural Scotland's Dumfries (DG1) and Lochee (DD2), Felixstowe in Suffolk (IP11) and North Wales's university town of Bangor (LL57) are among the areas with the lowest proportion of burglary claims in the UK, according to the analysis.

"Darren Offord, the homeless brother of  MP Matthew Offord, has spoken of their different fortunes after urging his brother to help him rebuild his life . The homeless brother of a Conservative MP has told of his miserable life on the streets after urging his brother to help him. Darren Offord - the brother of MP for Hendon Matthew Offord - sleeps rough in the family's hometown of Alton, Hampshire. After issuing a plea for support from his brother, he spoke of his dismay that his sibling lives in thatched country house while he sleeps in a council bin shed. The 48-year-old told MailOnline: 'He's with the Prime Minister while I'm sat here like a tramp with long dreadlocks. 'He's better off than we all are. We went to the same school and had a very similar upbringing but things turn out very differently don't they?' Despite enjoying a similar childhood to his politician brother, with the pair attending the same school together, the brothers' lives could not be more different now. Huddled under a blanket next to a row of large council  bins, self-confessed former heroin addict Darren spends his days drinking strong lager. Meanwhile Michael, who is three years his junior, is seen as one of the rising stars of the Tory party after winning the seat of Hendon, north London. The politician married wife Claire at a lavish ceremony in 2010 and  held the reception at Highclere Castle, the home of popular ITV drama Downtown Abbey. He now divides his time between his family home - a thatched £785,000 cottage in Boxford, Berkshire - and his constituency home in the capital. Former HGV driver and psychiatric nurse Darren claims his life went downhill when he was hit by a drink-driver in 1992. The father-of-two said: 'I was in hospital for a long time. I lost everything because I couldn't go back to work. 'I had a normal, nice family life beforehand but I lost my mortgage, my partner and that's how I ended up like I am now. People can learn a lot from that - how not to end up like me.' He has hit out at what he sees as the failure of the government to help people like him get off the streets and urged his brother to 'put your arm out and lift me up'. Relatives say Matthew and others have repeatedly attempted to help Darren back to his feet but his lifestyle is 'his choice'. Then and now: Darren Offord (pictured, left, four years ago and, right, today) says a car accident ruined his life. His family however claim he made a 'choice' to live on the streets . Mr Offord, who sleeps in a council bin shed, has called on his brother to help him off the streets . A family member, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It has hurt the whole family. He has been given every help - he's had no end of help but it's just the drink and the drugs which have made Darren what he is. 'We've done everything we can - he's broken our hearts so much but I can't help Darren, none of us can.' She said he had been in and out of prison for drug-related and public order offences and has been sent to rehab at least five times. The relative confirmed Darren was involved in a horrific car accident, but said his drinking started before the crash. She added: 'I'm sorry because he was a lovely child, he really was. I'm surprised he's still alive with what he's done and the abuse he's put his body through. 'He just drinks and drinks and that's his life I'm afraid. It's very sad and there's a lot of people like it and families have to go through an awful lot with it.' Matthew Offord has yet to comment on his brother's claims. The MP, who used to work for the BBC, was elected to parliament in 2010 and is the treasurer of the All Parliamentary Select Committee on Anti-Semitism. The 45-year-old  previously worked as deputy leader of Barnet Council, where he was also head of cabinet member of environment and transport. Matthew Offord has been MP for Hendon since 2010. In 2011 he tried to overturn a rule banning him from bringing his Jack Russell, Max, to work with him . When his brother was elected as an MP in 2010, Darren Offord posted a video on Facebook of his victory speech along with the caption: 'How lucky am I?' In 2011, he invoked human rights laws to overturn a ban on taking his dog into Westminster. Speaking at the time, he said it was 'ridiculous' he could not bring his Jack Russell, Max, to work with him, insisting: 'He doesn't bark, my staff have no complaints and he's great for taking the stress out of the day.' According to the most recent official statistics, 111,960 people are registered as homeless - a 26 per cent rise over four years. The government recently defended its record on homelessness, pointing to its Fair Chance Fund, a £15million programme to help young people living on the streets. Last month, homelessness Minister Kris Hopkins pointed out that the government has announced £23million-worth of funding to help those with nowhere to live. She said: 'This money will pay for sustained housing, employment and educational support for those with the greatest needs, helping them find accommodation, gain qualifications and move into work.'","Darren Offord ended up on the streets while brother went to Westminster .

"The leader of terror group Boko Haram has threatened more massacres and war on neighbouring countries in a new rant-filled video. Abubakar Shekau says that the recent mass killings in Nigeria by the group, were just the tip of the iceberg and that more deaths are coming. He also threatened war against Niger, Cameroon and Chad for having sympathy with France in the wake of the Paris terror attacks on the satirical French magazine and also burns the Nigerian flag. Scroll down for video . Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau appears in a video released by the terror group where he threatens more massacres . Shekau, flanked by two men covering their faces and holding weapons, also threatened war against Niger, Cameroon and Chad . It comes after as many as 2,500 civilians were killed and 3,700 homes and business were destroyed by an attack by Boko Haram on the towns of Baga and Doro Baga near Nigeria's border with Cameroon earlier this month. The attack sparked international outrage not seen since the militants kidnapped nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in the country last April. In the footage, which had been posted to Youtube, Shekau can be seen wearing a camouflage coat and reading from a script flanked by two men covering their faces holding weapons. He then explains that the group takes responsibility for the mass killings in the Baga before taunting the leaders of Niger, Cameroon and Chad. The footage end with Shekau burning the Nigerian flag and taunting the country's president Goodluck Jonathan . Shekau says: 'Muhammed Yusuf, the president of Niger, so you too have the temerity of coming out to pay sympathy visit to Francois Holland the President of France. 'Is this your true character? Muhammed Yusuf, you have amazed us. You shall soon see our wrath, very soon. 'And you, Paul Biya, the president of Cameroon. Now you are asking for foreign assistance; please don’t waste your time because God is more than all the help you will get. 'And even you Idris Debby, you are not spared. You guys have acted too late, very late.' Earlier this month, Boko Haram carried out a massacre in the towns of Baga and Dogo Baga killing 2,000 people and destroying 3,700 buildings . He also turns his attentions to Nigeria and taunts their president Goodluck Jonathan. Shekau adds: 'Jonathan you are in trouble. All governors of Nigeria are in trouble. All these war equipment that you see being displayed in the screen are gotten from Baga and Doro. 'Your army kept deceiving the world that you can’t fight us because you have no arms. Liars! You have all that it takes; you are just coward soldiers. 'You forgot that it is God that arms. Is it not amazing that we, who started with sticks and machetes, are today the biggest headache to the almighty Nigerian soldiers? What a shame.' 'This is just the beginning of the killings; what you've just witnessed is a tip of the iceberg; more deaths are coming. A map showing Nigeria and the location of Baga which was devastated by a massacre by brutal Boko Haram fanatics . 'This will mark the end of politics and democracy in Nigeria. This is to confirm to you that we carried out the Baga massacre, and we are going to do more.' The video comes after a top security advisor to President Jonathan told an audience in London yesterday that the Nigerian army had 'a lot of cowards'. Critics have said that the Nigerian army are under-equipped to deal with Boko Haram fighters and that is why the town of Baga has fallen under militant control. But Sambo Dasuki said: 'Unfortunately we have a lot of cowards. We have people who use every excuse in this world not to fight. But he added that reinforcements had been sent in to retake Baga, something he hoped would be completed soon.","Terror group has released a new video featuring leader Abubakar Shekau .

"Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Lords should be able to drink the highest quality champagne to have 'some privilege of peerage' Lords should drink the best champagne while in Parliament because they deserve to have 'some privilege of peerage', according to a wealthy Tory MP. Jacob Rees-Mogg, widely regarded as the poshest man in politics, told a Commons debate that peers 'ought to drink the highest quality' of bubbly available. The North East Somerset MP made the comments after reports that Lords refused to share catering services with MPs because they were worried about the quality of champagne. Using the comments to urge MPs to be cautious about reforming the unelected House of Lords, Mr Rees-Mogg said the story - which claimed that plans to merge bars and restaurants in both houses were jettisoned over the issue - had become 'legendary if not mythical'. He said: 'Though, as I understand it, the champagne story turned out to be somewhat legendary if not mythical, and anyway I think their lordships ought to drink the highest quality of champagne. 'If, after all, you are a Lord, you must have some privilege of peerage. 'Although that may have been legendary if not mythical, actually the need to maintain their independence because they do not want to be a subsidiary chamber, they are a second chamber, the second chamber, but not a subsidiary chamber.' The champagne claims were made last month before a committee of MPs by Sir Malcolm Jack, a former clerk of the House of Commons. He told them: 'The person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service, and it was eventually thrown out in the House of Lords because the Lords feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service.' At the time, former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, chairman of the Commons governance committee, was taken aback by the claim and asked: 'Did you make that up? Is that true?' to which Sir Malcom replied 'Yes'. The champagne row caused such a storm that MPs raised it again at a later hearing of the committee, as they interviewed Lord Rogers, who stood down as Clerk of the Commons last year. But Lord Sewel, chair of committees, later hit back at the suggestion. He said it was 'inaccurate' to suggest the Commons had put forward a plan for a joint catering service, which had been rejected by the Lords. He also branded claims the the House had a champagne fund as 'preposterous', saying it was sold at a profit and had helped to cut the cost of catering services. Since 2010 the House of Lords has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £265,770. It is the equivalent of five bottles each for every peer. The former Etonian (pictured left in 2011 and right as a 12-year-old reading the Financial Times) is perhaps most famous for canvassing with his Nanny in a Mercedes when standing election in Fife . Reiterating his point that the chamber must remain an independent second chamber, rather than becoming a subsidiary one, Mr Rees-Mogg added: 'I quite understand why their lordships are very nervous about this place trying to grab power from it. 'If I were in that place rather than in this place I would take the same view that the House of Commons by virtue of ultimately controlling the purse strings, by having the democratic mandate, is always in a position to peer over at what their lordships are doing.' Mr Rees-Mogg, a former Etonian, is well-known for his outlandish comments and bizarre anecdotes about his privileged background. He once casually dropped the word ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’ into a debate on the pay of EU staff and also admitted to reading the Financial Times at the age of eight. At 11, he turned a £50 inheritance into £3,500 on the stock market. He once boasted that he would be ‘a millionaire at 20, a multi-millionaire at 40 and Prime Minister at 70, when I’ve made enough money to be able to afford to waste some on politics’. The North East Somerset MP made the comments amid claims that Lords refused to share catering services with MPs because they were worried about having to drink cheap bubbly (file picture) But the MP is perhaps most famous for  once campaigning with his nanny in a plush car when standing for election in Fife in 1997. Claims that Mr Rees-Mogg toured the area in a Bentley had dogged the MP since he stood in the Labour stronghold   - in which he got just nine per cent. But he later denied it was a Bentley, saying: 'Oh, no. That was wrong. Well, the nanny bit is right. Of course she came canvassing; she’s part of the family after all — she’s been with us 47 years. 'But we took my mother’s Mercedes Estate. I don’t think a Bentley’s a suitable campaigning car. As much as anything it was the petrol consumption: six miles to the gallon.' Last year, Mr Rees-Mogg also sparked outrage by branding the huge bill for taxpayer-funded political portraits as 'chicken feed'. The spending spree since 1995 included £11,750 for an apparently topless painting of Labour’s Diane Abbott – the same amount as was spent on a full-sized statue of Baroness Thatcher. Mr Rees-Mogg called the claims 'legendary if not mythical'. The House of Lords always insisted that champagne was not the deal breaker (file picture) Other works included an £11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a £10,000 portrait of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, an £8,000 painting of Kenneth Clarke and a £4,000 oil painting of Foreign Secretary William Hague. But Mr Rees-Mogg, a member of the committee which commissions paintings, photographs and sculptures of MPs and peers, said in January last year that the average £10,000 for each artwork was just a fraction of the overall cost of running Parliament. He said: 'I’m all for saving money, saving money right, left and centre, but this is chicken feed. 'It’s about £10,000 a year on administrative costs of the House of Commons of £200m. It hardly even ranks as chicken feed.' The former investment banker also admitted that his nanny and maid took turns to stand behind him, shielding his neck from the sun with a book, at the exclusive Glyndebourne music festival. He once also had a private toilet reserved for himself and King Juan Carlos of Spain at Claridge's. He explained: 'You can't have too many people using a special loo or it's no longer special – but it's now a disabled loo, so anyone can use it.' The history buff also admitted changing the last four digits of his phone number to 1649, the year King Charles I was executed, to make easier for him to remember. Mr Rees-Mogg's father, William Rees-Mogg, was himself a peer. A former editor of the Times, Lord Rees-Mogg died in 2012 aged 84 from oesophageal cancer. He received a life peerage in 1988 and sat as a cross-bencher, although he had twice in the 1950s stood for Parliament as a Conservative.","North East Somerset MP Jacob Rees-Mogg made comments during debate .

"Iraqi families have paid as much as £1,200 to secure the safe release of their sons, who were being held captive after ISIS militants decided pigeon breeding was un-Islamic. The militants released a dozen men, aged between 16 and 22, who were taken from their homes in the eastern province of Diyala earlier this week. They had originally captured 15 pigeon breeders, but had executed three, a security official said. Scroll down for video . ISIS militants  captured 15 pigeon breeders,  and killed three, in the eastern province of Diyala, Iraq, after deciding bird breeding is against Islamic religion before it takes time away from worshipping Allah . Farmer Abu Abdullah said he had paid a £1,200 ransom to secure his 21-year-old son's release . Abu Abdullah, a farmer, told NBC News he had managed to get the money together after borrowing from family. Others had handed over jewellery to secure their sons' release. Mr Abdullah revealed his son had been severely beaten and warned not to keep pigeons again. Pigeon breeding is a popular hobby in the region, but it is said to be frowned upon by extremist Islamist fighters because they believe it is a distraction from worshipping Allah. Mr Abdullah, 52, said he was standing beside his son when ISIS militants stormed the family home and kidnapped his son. He said: 'I asked them why and they said: ""He is not following the real Islam, he must be punished for being a pigeon breeder. This habit is taking him away from worshiping Allah."" 'I begged them again to know where are they taking him, what are they going to do to him. They said he is going to be taken to be judged according to the Islamic Sharia. 'They pushed me, and when my son tried to stop them from pushing me they beat him. Then they put him inside the car and left.' It comes after ISIS militants bound and blindfolded men before throwing them off the top of a 100ft tower block for 'homosexual crimes'. Shocking video footage showed the men falling to their death in Raqqa, Syria . A masked Islamic fighter used a handheld radio to read aloud the 'crimes' committed by the homosexual men . Video footage then showed the men being pushed off the top of the tower block and falling to their death . He said the militants also scoured the house for pigeons before rounding up the birds, dumping them in bags and burning them. The news comes after it was revealed that ISIS extremists executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State. The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, according to anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. ISIS now controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq, having taken over a considerable amount since last year . The small activist group said the teenagers were rounded up by militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul after 'breaking religious laws' by watching football. It came just days after ISIS released a video showing two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay. A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities. He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law. The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their death.","ISIS militants reportedly captured 15 pigeon breeders in Diyala, Iraq .

"Sheriff's deputies fatally shot a man they believe killed a police dog during standoff at a Southern California home. The dog was sent Wednesday afternoon to root out a felon who barricaded himself in a crawl space below a house in the Hemet area, Riverside County sheriff's Deputy Albert Martinez told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. The dog emerged injured and later died. Martinez didn't say how the animal was hurt. Sultan, along with handler Deputy Mark Wallace, were the city of San Jacinto's only police K9 team. Fallen: San Jacinto, California police K9 Sultan was killed, likely by a suspect, during a standoff with police on Wednesday . Will be missed: The beloved Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix from Slovakia had served on the force since November 2013 and was half the city's only K9 team . The standoff began around 2:30pm. Hours later, deputies fired tear gas into the crawl space, Sgt. Mike Manning told the newspaper. The man, whose name was not released, emerged about 11 p.m. holding a handgun and deputies opened fire, Manning said. The suspect, whose name was not released, died at the scene. The dog, a Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix named 'Sultan,' had been on patrol since November. The Sheriff's Department mourned Sultan's death. 'There is a very close bond between a K-9 and the deputy that he's assigned to,' Manning said. 'It's more than property or a tool. It's a heartfelt bond between the dog and the handler.' Beloved: San Jacinto police sent Sultan into a home where a suspected was barricaded with a gun. Sultan re-emerged from the home suffering unspecified injuries and would later die . The state Senate took the unusual step of adjourning in the police dog's memory on Thursday. Sultan 'bravely gave his life protecting other law enforcement officers,' said Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula. San Jacinto Mayor Crystal Ruiz told KNBC, 'We've lost a family member, we've lost one of our own...It's heartbreaking and it's scary to think people would do something like this.' Area residents were not evacuated during the standoff, but those who weren't home when the incident began were barred from returning for several hours. Cornerstone Christian School, just north of the incident, was ending its class schedule at 3 p.m. when school officials were asked by officers to lock down the school. Parents, staff and the few remaining students were on campus until deputies lifted the lockdown about two hours later.","San Jacinto police sent Sultan, a Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix, into a home where a suspected was barricaded with a gun .

"Cash-strapped air stewardesses in Japan are reportedly turning to prostitution in order to supplement decreasing wages. Several unnamed flight attendants have been quoted in the Shukan Post claiming that female cabin crew are regularly paid to sleep with the pilots. According to the women, staff can charge between £300 and £450 for 90 minutes with a client. Several unnamed flight attendants have been quoted in the Shukan Post claiming that female cabin crew in Japan are regularly paid to sleep with the pilots . In Japan, becoming a flight attendant - known as a soochoowadesu - is a dream come true for many women. Tens of thousands of young women apply for jobs as cabin crew with the country’s major airlines. The reality, however, is poor pay and long hours and according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, salaries for Japan’s flight attendants have slumped significantly over the past decade. Air hostesses in Japan have even seen their wages cut from £28,000 a year in 2004 to just £22,000 in 2013. One stewardess, is quoted by the Tokyo Reporter as saying: ‘Stewardesses who are willing to do it with a pilot pass their number to a senior stewardess who is effectively a female pimp. According to the Shukan Post, stewardesses may take up part-time work with escort service that specialise in offering clients air stewardesses . ‘There is also a system where the pilots use hand signals to tell the hostesses they are interested, and how much they will pay. ‘Other stewardesses outsource their services through companies, some of which specialise in offering air hostesses.’ During pre-flight checks, the stewardesses line up before the pilot and co-pilot. As the briefing proceeds, the pilots allegedly drop signals with their fingers. According to the stewardess, four digits raised to the nose indicates an offer of 40,000 yen, around £225, for an overnight stay at a hotel. According to the women, staff can charge between £300 and £450 for 90 minutes with a client . According to another stewardess, those under 30 are able to charge the highest amounts for their services. ‘We have an expiration date,’ said a 29-year-old, who is also involved in an escort service that specialises in offering clients stewardesses. According to the magazine, other stewardesses may take up part-time work as party companions or bar hostesses in Tokyo’s ritzy Ginza district. A 30-year-old attendant told the Shukan Post that rumours of a ‘prostitution circle’ had begun several years before she joined an airline in 2007. When upper management got wind of the operation, the ringleader was terminated, it was claimed. 'But since the girls in the circle at the time are still employed at the company, I’m sure it still goes on even now,’ said the attendant.","Unnamed flight attendants made allegations in an article with Shukan Post .

"Leon Brittan gained a double first from Trinity College, Cambridge before becoming a lawyer, MP, minister and EU commissioner . Leon Brittan was today hailed as 'by far and away the most brilliant of his generation' after a stellar career which took him from Hampstead to the House of Commons. Born on September 25 1939, the son of a north London doctor who had emigrated from Berlin, Brittan was brought up in the Orthodox Jewish tradition. He won a scholarship from his state primary school to Haberdasher's Aske's School in Hampstead and went to gain a double first from Trinity College, Cambridge. At University he became president of the Union and chairman of the Conservative Association. In 1961, he was called to the Bar and pursued a successful career as a libel lawyer, taking silk in 1978. But his ambitions to enter the House of Commons were frustrated for 10 years. He fought and lost North Kensington in 1966 and 1970, and was rejected as Tory candidate by more than a dozen safer Tory seats. Finally, he was elected for Cleveland and Whitby in 1974. Before long he was in Mrs Thatcher's shadow team, first as a deputy spokesman on devolution and then in employment. When she won the 1979 election, Lord Brittan became minister of state at the Home Office. Within two years he was in the Cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury. Only days before that promotion he married divorcee Diana Peterson, who had two daughters. In this post, he was an instant success, courteous and decisive and quickly aware of areas where compromises could be successfully reached in his battle to keep public spending under control. But a cloud on the horizon was the projected disappearance of his parliamentary constituency. Lord Brittan, despite his proven ability, had trouble finding another seat to fight. But the intervention of the then-home secretary, Willie Whitelaw, helped him to gain the safe seat of Richmond, Yorkshire. After the 1983 Tory landslide, Brittan became the youngest home secretary since Winston Churchill. But he got off to a bad start when MPs decisively rejected his advice to restore hanging for terrorist murders. His handling of the Libyan embassy siege brought him back to public favour, and it was at that stage that he became talked about as a possible future leader. When Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election, Lord Brittan became minister of state at the Home Office. Within two years he was in the Cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury . After the 1983 Tory landslide, Brittan became the youngest home secretary since Winston Churchill . But his apparently unstoppable rise was halted and then reversed by two issues. His decision to ask the BBC not to transmit a programme on Ulster terrorism made him the target of accusations of censorship and of handing the IRA as major propaganda victory. All this made him a liability and Mrs Thatcher transferred him to trade and industry, which everyone except him regarded as demotion. But within weeks he was caught up in the battle over Westland. Brittan and the rest of the Cabinet wanted an American rescue package to save the company, while Heseltine alone wanted a European solution, and openly campaigned for one against all his Cabinet colleagues. There followed the leaked letter and then Brittan was forced to apologise to MPs for allegedly misleading them over a confidential letter to Mrs Thatcher from British Aerospace, part of the European consortium bidding to rescue Westland. He gained some support with a fighting Commons performance, denying he had lied to the House about an alleged meeting with BAe chief executive Sir Raymond Lygo. But hours later, Sir Raymond issued a long statement contradicting Brittan's version of events. Later, Sir Raymond amended that by saying there had been a 'misunderstanding'. Only days before his promotion to the Cabinet in 1981 Lord Brittan married divorcee Diana Peterson, who had two daughters . Leon Brittan, in his role as vice-president of the European Commission, answers questions at a press conference in Hong Kong . It was too late. The 1922 Committee of Tory back-benchers demanded his resignation and despite pleas by Mrs Thatcher for him to stay, Brittan had to quit. But he took this devastating blow with equanimity. 'I am bruised,' he said. 'But I am certainly not bowed. And I'm not looking back, nor in any state of nostalgia.' Brittan was appointed a European commissioner in 1989 and a year later became vice-president of the Commission. He stayed in Brussels for a decade and it was during this time he gave the now-Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg a job in his office. He returned to Westminster in 2000 as Lord Brittan of Spennithorne but remained low key until Prime Minister David Cameron gave him a job as a trade adviser in 2010. Last year, he was put in the spotlight when allegations of historic sex abuse emerged and Home Secretary Theresa May set up an inquiry to investigate. Lord Brittan leaving his Pimlico home in London on July 8 last year after becoming embroiled in the Westminster paedophile scandal in which he was accused of failing to deal properly with allegations of child abuse . Lord Brittan was likely to be called to give evidence over a dossier he received from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. He had flatly denied failing to act on the abuse file. The second woman appointed to chair the investigation, Fiona Woolf, was forced to quit over links to him - she was a neighbour. Last July, Lord Brittan confirmed he was interviewed by police about a 'serious allegation', but insisted that the accusation was 'wholly without foundation'. It followed press reports that he had been questioned under caution by police in connection with an allegation of rape dating back to 1967. Lord Brittan is survived by a widow and two stepdaughters.","Born on September 25 1939, the son of a north London immigrant father .

"This is the dramatic moment a toddler narrowly escaped being crushed when a manhole cover exploded out of the road in a freak accident. The square metal cover blasted several feet into the air and landed inches from the child who had just walked over it. The violent explosion, so powerful it shook nearby buildings, is believed to have been caused by a build-up of gas under the road, at Acocks Green in Birmingham. The family was seen walking along Warwick Road in Acocks Green, Birmingham moments before the manhole cover (circled) exploded . The toddler was seen on CCTV walking across the large manhole cover seconds before it blasted into the air . Narrow escape: The youngster (pictured left) only just avoided being crushed by the heavy manhole cover . Footage of the incident was captured from by a CCTV camera at a furniture store along Warwick Road as the couple and their young child walked past at 12.20pm today. The child, aged about three, is seen walking over the cover on a stretch of cordoned-off road seconds before the heavy manhole cover explodes into the air. The couple turn in horror to see the cover clattering to the ground just inches from the terrified youngster. West Midlands Fire Service are investigating the cause of the explosion which left a one-metre wide crater in the pavement. A spokesman said: 'We were called to Warwick Road in Acocks Green at 12.21pm today to what's believed to have been a small explosion involving utilities. The manhole cover landed just inches away from the child (left) before the horrified parents turned to see what had happened (right) 'Two manhole covers became dislodged and a one metre deep hole was left in the footpath. 'Fortunately - and amazingly - the family passing weren't hurt. 'Utility companies are investigating who owns the manholes concerned, and the cause.' Haymillsfire tweeted: 'Child narrowly avoids being crushed by manhole cover after explosion underground @ Warwick Rd Acocks Green £nearmiss' Utility companies, including gas and electrical teams, were called to the scene and a cordon has been established around the site while the investigations take place. According to witnesses, smoke was seen coming from a junction box near the manhole which had become dislodged. No injuries were reported. Masood Mushtaq, owner of Divine Collections, a furniture store whose CCTV captured the incident, described an 'almighty explosion which shook the entire shop'. Smoke appeared to be coming out of the hole in the road following the violent explosion, which happened at about 12.20pm today . The parents were said to be 'hysterical' following the explosion and ran to comfort the youngster who had escaped injury . Utility companies, including gas and electrical teams, were called to the scene and a cordon has been established around the site while the investigations take place . He said: 'Everybody ran outside and I saw two parents were rubbing the side of their young daughter's head. She could not be aged any more than two or three-years-old. 'She was OK and uninjured but was obviously quite shaken and was crying. The cover had not hit her but the force of being so close to the blast must have hurt her a little. 'I'm sure she would have been left with a bit of ringing in her ears, that's for sure. She was alive though - that was the main thing. 'She was so lucky really, just a few inches and she would have been dead. He said the parents, who were in their late 20s, had initially been 'hysterical' after the explosion. 'Those manhole covers must be around 100kg, there's no way one person could lift them by themselves,' the 36-year-old added. 'But you can see how the blast tossed it in the air like a toy - she would not have stood a chance if she had been walking over it at the time.'","Family seen walking along Warwick Road at Acocks Green in Birmingham .

Many of those allegations are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. Cosby's attorney Marty Singer has dismissed the allegations as 'discredited' and 'defamatory.' At Wednesday's conference, Leno added that he supported the way the allegations against Cosby were brought into the spotlight, after stand-up comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a performance last October. 'He made a flat-out statement that reverberated around the world. If that was on TV, it would have been edited. If it were on any other medium, it would have been edited,' Leno said. 'But because somebody just filmed it and put it out there, you're getting your news raw and unfiltered, which I think is fantastic.' He dated the beginning of the change in media's control over the news back to the beating of Rodney King in 1991, which was captured by a bystander with a video camera. 'Ten years earlier the Rodney King story would have come to a news editor and he would have said, ""Oh, this is too explosive to put on the air. Let's just put on what the police say."" 'But this went on TV raw. You saw what actually happened.' Hello friend: Bill Cosby performs at the Turlock Community Theatre in Turlock, California. Cosby's attorney Marty Singer has dismissed the allegations against his client as 'discredited' and 'defamatory.' Leno's comments come after actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played Cosby's son on television, told music trade magazine Billboard that he found it painful to hear the claims that the comedian sexually abused more than a dozen women. Warner, who played Theo Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show' in the 1980s and 1990s, said the allegations do not match Cosby's reputation. 'The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people,' Warner was quoted as saying. 'Just as it's painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault, whether true or not, it's just as painful to watch my friend and mentor go through this.' The 44-year-old Warner joined 'Cosby Show' actors Phylicia Rashad and Keshia Knight Pulliam in defending the 77-year-old comedian. 'He's been very influential and played a big role in my life as a friend and mentor,' Warner said. Support: Bill Cosby receives an award from Jerry Seinfeld, alongside fellow Cosby cast members Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Phylicia Rashad, in 2009. Warner said the allegations do not match Cosby's character .","Cosby's attorney Marty Singer has dismissed the allegations as defamatory .

"President Obama was asked about his 'first wife' in a PR-disaster interview on Thursday after picking three of the most popular YouTube content creators to interview him. GloZell Green, a popular YouTube fixture known for her extreme acts like eating a ladle full of cinnamon, offered the president three samples of her trademark green lipstick as gifts for his daughters – and for the woman she called Obama's 'first wife.' 'You know something I don't?' Obama cracked before Green corrected herself and referred to Michelle Obama as 'first lady.' But the PR disaster that was the White House's 50-minute-long 'YouTube interview' was a national joke before it was half-over. Another YouTube star, 19-year-old Bethany Mota, asked the leader of the free world, 'If you had any super power, what would it be?' Obama's answer: the ability to speak to anyone in their native language. And flying. Scroll down for video . 'DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW?' Obama was taken aback when YouTube celebrity GloZell Green gave him a tube of green lipstick 'for your first wife' – instead of saying 'for the first lady' NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME: 19-year-old Bethany Mota asked the leader of the free world what super power he would like to have . OBAMACARE COMMERCIAL: Hank Green got a presidential autograph on a photo showing how cheap his monthly medication got after he bought medical insurance . The Thursday afternoon event, staged on three miniature video sets erected in the East Room of the White House less than an hour after the president's return from speaking in Lawrence, Kansas about his State of the Union goals, included some serious issues. But GLoZell's green lipstick and Obama's 'first wife' will be what's remembered. The married Los Angeles-based video blogger, usually sporting her green lipstick, starts each of her videos with a cheery: 'Hello! This is GloZell! Is you ok? Is you? Good, 'cause I wanted to know!' The White House press corps, accustomed to toiling for a decade or more before ever getting to ask a sitting president a question, was unimpressed when the administration announced the plan to give Mota, GloZell and Hank Green (no relation) a cozy afternoon with Obama following the annual State of the Union address – and a giant platform. One CNN correspondent asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest during a daily biefing: 'I'm just curious – was ""Charlie Bit My Finger"" or ""David After Dentist"" not available?' GloZell screamed to her fans when she heard that she would be included in the mini-cattle-call that she was 'so happy I watched all those episodes of ""Veep""!' The White House intended for the event to draw a younger audience – Americans who get their news from Twitter and Facebook – in the hope of bringing public policy down to the level of the personal. But it's unclear who actually watched. At its peak, slightly more than 84,000 were viewing the presentation, according to live counts displayed by YouTube. THE GIFT: GloZell Green offered the president tubes of greenb lipstick for his wife and daughters . GREAT MOMENTS IN HISTORY: President Barack Obama posed for a selfie with three YouTube celebrities on Thursday after nearly an hour of softball questions . LOW-INFORMATION VOTERS: A Google official told Obama during the broadcast that the most-searched questions during his State of the Union address included those answered in middle-school civics classes . THE EAST ROOM: White House staffers decked out a hallowed hall for Bethany Mota and two other online celebrities; her set was dressed to look like a teenage girl's bedroom . The substantive questions that made the cut were not shown to Obama ahead of time, according to a Google representative who introduced the video segment. Google owns YouTube. Hank Green asked whether the items on Obama's State of the Union wish-list from Tuesday night were pipe dreams. 'None of them are at all politically feasible. Am I wrong?' he probed. Obama offered stock talking points to this and other questions about marijuana policy and drone warfare. But he did offer the president a commercial for his Obamcare insurance overhaul, asking for an autograph on a photo of himself holding a $5 receipt for a monthly prescription order that he said had cost $1,100 before he had insurance. 'That makes me feel good,' the president said, uncapping a pen. 'A lot of young people who are your viewers, they don't have a chronic disease, so they think ""Why do I need it?"" – until something happens.' A bronze-level insurance policy, he claimed, now 'typically costs less than your cell phone bill or your cable bill.' GloZell Green offered a curt 'I sorry' to first lady Michelle Obama for saying she was the president's 'first wife' The Cereal Challenge: For seven minutes on YouTube, GloZell sat in a bath of milk and cereal while eating it . COMMENTS: People who showed up to watch Obama's interviews with YouTube stars had some interesting thoughts to share, many of which we can't show in full . GloZell took her star turn, before suggesting Obama was headed for divorce, to ask him about race relations, gay marriage and Cuba. Strongman Raul Castro 'puts the ""dic"" in ""dictator"",' she told the president. And she said he husband, a retired Air Force officer, was mad at her because she had cut the hoods off his hoodies. She feared for his safety in the wake of racially charged police shootings. 'It's not regular folks,' she told Obama. 'It's the po-po.' GloZell, who made no effort to hide her enthusiasm for Obama, counts among her most-watched video a 100-second short in which she screams, in character, that she loves the president because 'He black! He black he black he black! Yes, I said it!' Mota asked about cuber-bullying, the affordability of higher education and the terror group Boko Haram – before falling back on questions about Obama's super-power wishes, what TV shows he watches and what he wanted to be when he grew up. 'I don't follow politics that much,' she admitted. 'Why should the younger generation be interested in politics?' OBAMA, MEET YOUR PUBLIC: More comments left on YouTube during the White House's historic interviews . The president confirmed he was 'really big on sports' and often watches football or basketbal while he works out. He also said he had 'wanted to be an architect for a really long time' in his youth. Or an NBA player. She ended the interview by asking him to pose for – what else? – a selfie. As the event wrapped up, one commenter asked: 'Is the Presidency a full time job? Because it sure doesn't look like it.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One earlier in the day that the event would involve 'having conversations with particularly popular YouTube content creators to have a conversation about his State of the Union address.' 'And it simply is an effort to try to engage as many Americans as possible in a variety of venues to discuss the president's priorities.'","GloZell Green was one of three YouTube stars granted interviews with Obama in a White House that welcomes few journalists for sit-downs .

"Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, has claimed she doesn't mind being branded Britain's most hated woman and believes she has 'as big a brain as I have boobs' NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has claimed she doesn't mind being branded Britain's most hated woman and believes she has 'a bigger IQ than the majority of people'. The 24-year-old, who shot to notoriety after boasting about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, described herself as 'very intelligent' before exclaiming: 'I've got as big a brain as I have boobs'. The mother of three, from Leeds, who is set to star in a new documentary called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain?, has also revealed how she once applied to the Royal Navy, but had to forgo joining after falling pregnant. It comes after Miss Cunningham, who announced her engagement to fiancé Andrew Goy last month, revealed she would be holding a party at the end of the month to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her breast augmentation. Ahead of her new television show, which is set to air on Channel 4 tonight, the controversial glamour model said she doesn't mind the criticism she receives because she is 'actually hard-working'. Speaking to Newsbeat, she said: 'Everybody just thinks I'm this fame-hungry b**** but actually I'm a hard-working parent. 'I think people are slowly realising there is a game there to be played. 'It's a whole case of don't hate the player - hate the game. 'All this hatred that comes with my name I'd say is worth it because I've got my name out there so much more from being hated. 'All of a sudden everybody knew my name so thanks for that - it's been great.' Her comments came as she revealed she applied to the Royal Navy when she was 16-years-old and claimed officials wanted her to be in charge of weapons after she topped the IQ test. She told The Sun's Antonella Lazzeri: 'I got the top marks in the class. I'd never done an IQ test but it was so easy. 'In fact I'm very intelligent. People think I'm stupid but I'm not. I've got as big a brain as I have boobs. 'I know I'm much brighter than most people because I missed about a year of school thanks to being bullied really badly, but still managed to pass eight GCSEs.' She claimed that she did 'so well' in the IQ test that the Navy wanted her to be a warfare specialist, putting her in control of warship weapons and the coordinates. The real-life documentary about Miss Cunningham follows her day-to-day life and shows her revelling in attention from paparazzi and members of the public. Miss Cunningham, who announced her engagement to 33-year-old fiancé Andrew Goy last month (pictured together above), said she is 'actually very intelligent' and claimed she doesn't mind any negative criticsm . A real-life documentary about Miss Cunningham (pictured leaving hospital with her newborn daughter and agent Rob Cooper last year) called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain? is set to air on Channel 4 tonight . Miss Cunningham's agent confirmed on Twitter that the documentary would be screened on TV this month . It is set to air just over a month after she revealed she had got engaged to her 33-year-old body-building boyfriend by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online. The announcement, which was later confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, came just weeks after the couple were first pictured together in Leeds city centre. There have been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Last November, Miss Cunningham revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter Grace by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But she allegedly mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders. It came after the mother, who also has two sons aged six and three, revealed she was planning to abort her baby for the chance to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. However, she later claimed she 'changed her mind' after discovering her baby was to be a little girl. The 24-year-old (pictured heavily pregnant last year) former escort, from Leeds, revealed she would be holding a party at the end of the month to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her breast augmentation . Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and said she wanted a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Miss Cunningham made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . Ahead of national A-level exam results being released in August last year, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice' Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. It came after she decided not to abort her unborn baby afterall because she 'wanted a daughter'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. At one point, Miss Cunningham suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. However, she later said she had had a change of heart.","Josie Cunningham, 24, claims to have 'got as big a brain as I have boobs'

"An extra £2.9 billion contribution to the European Commission budget has delivered a blow to George Osborne's hopes of cutting the deficit, official figures revealed this morning. The deficit hit £13.1billion in December, up from £10.3billion a year before, the Office for National Statistics said. The difference was entirely accounted for by the UK's higher European contribution, recalculated because the economy was performing better than had been thought. Borrowing for the April-to-December fiscal year to date is now £86.3 billion - just 0.1% lower than in 2013/14 . This will be partially made up for by a refund and rebate totalling £2billion, not likely to be recorded in the public finances until the next fiscal year. But it means borrowing for the April-to-December fiscal year to date is now, at £86.3 billion, just 0.1 per cent lower than in 2013/14. That compares with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of a 6 per cent fall in the annual deficit for the year to March. There was better news from income tax and capital gains tax receipts, which saw their best December performance in four years, climbing by 3.1 per cent to £12.6billion on the year. Revenues from income tax have caused a headache in recent months as they have not been growing as much as expected despite the upturn in growth and record job numbers. The year-to-date borrowing figure was boosted by a £2.5billion downward revision, partly due to a £900million upward revision in income tax receipts so far in 2014/15. VAT revenues for the year to date were also marked up, by £700million. Underlying net debt was £1.483trillion - 80.9% of gross domestic product, a record figure. Britain will receive a  rebate from the EU in the next financial year - totalling £2billion - helping the Chancellor reduce the deficit . A Treasury spokesman said: 'Today's public sector finances show that the Government's long-term economic plan is working, with borrowing down so far this year and the deficit on track to have halved as a share of GDP. 'But the job is not yet done and the risks in the global economy are growing so the only way to deliver economic security is to carry on working through our economic plan.' Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'These figures show George Osborne has broken his promise to balance the books by this year and national debt is still rising. 'His failure on the deficit is because falling living standards over the last five years have led to tax revenues falling short. This Government is now set to have borrowed over £200 billion more than planned.' The European Commission contribution of £2.9 billion was recorded for December to comply with accounting standards, though the cash will not leave the UK until it is paid in the second half of this year. It will be offset by a refund estimated at £1.2 billion and an increase in the UK rebate estimated at £800 million.","UK made a £2.9billion payment to European Commission in December .

"Devoted: Diana Brittan, whom Leon married aged 41 . On the news of Lord Brittan’s death, his one-time Cabinet colleague Lord Debden (formerly John Gummer) said he felt ‘very sad’. ‘A good and honourable servant of his country. A decent and lasting friend. He will be sorely missed. RIP,’ he said. It did not take long, though, for a very different reaction to emerge. First, the Labour MP Tom Watson replied to Lord Debden’s tweet with a single word: ‘Hmmm.’ Then another Twitter user publicly added a message declaring Brittan ‘a nasty little pederast’. Over the next few hours, a torrent of vile abuse was directed, via Twitter, at Lord Brittan. Hundreds of messages, often from people who ‘follow’ Mr Watson on Twitter and at times so obscene as to be unprintable, were sent, accusing the former Tory Home Secretary of having committed a catalogue of appalling sex crimes. Many expressed glee at his death and hoped that he ‘rots in hell’. The vehemence of such remarks, often made anonymously, was entirely at odds with the fact that Brittan was never charged with any criminal offence, let alone convicted. Yet we are living in the internet age, where mob mentality rules, and there is scant regard for traditions of politeness, let alone the old-fashioned notion that a man should be considered innocent until proven guilty. So it was that Brittan was forced to live out his final years under a black cloud, the subject of seemingly never-ending rumours about his alleged involvement in a paedophile ring, which operated at the heart of the British establishment. Recent months had, among other things, seen him investigated for supposedly ‘burying’ a dossier detailing VIP child abusers, questioned by police over an alleged rape and accused in Parliament of ‘improper conduct with children’. Increasingly frail, having spent time in hospital over Christmas 2013, when he was treated for heart trouble and cancer, the old man retreated behind the net curtains of his five-storey home in London’s Pimlico, attended by his loyal wife, Diana, step-daughters Katherine and Victoria, and his 81-year-old brother, Samuel. His final public statement was, perhaps fittingly, made via Mishcon de Reya, the former lawyers of Diana, Princess of Wales. Issued last July after a woman claimed he’d raped her during a blind date in 1967, it read: ‘It is true that I have been questioned by the police about a serious allegation made against me. This allegation is wholly without foundation.’ The woman, a Labour Party member, was a 19-year-old student at the time she claims she was assaulted almost 50 years ago. Downcast: Lord Brittan last year after being questioned by police about serious allegations . We can reveal that she first went to the police in late 2012. But after a lengthy investigation, detectives decided there was insufficient evidence even to question Brittan. They were forced to reverse that decision last June, however, after Labour’s Tom Watson, who was in contact with the woman, complained about it in a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Brittan was interviewed under caution, but not arrested. Details of the case were made public only after they were leaked to the Left-wing Independent on Sunday newspaper. A file was subsequently passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. But there was insufficient evidence for any hope of securing a conviction and no charges were filed. Nonetheless, the rumour mill —mostly, it seems, politically motivated — continued to churn. Watson was often at its centre, as the man originally responsible for kick-starting the wider scandal in which Brittan became embroiled. It had begun in October 2012, when the campaigning Labour MP made an extraordinary speech in the Commons asking David Cameron about claims of a ‘powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10’. Three months later, Scotland Yard launched Operation Fernbridge, an investigation into a VIP paedophile ring said to have included a number of prominent figures, which had operated at the Elm Guest House, a gay brothel in Barnes, South-West London, in the Eighties. As part of the inquiry, detectives raided a property in central London and took away a number of documents that purported to name a string of prominent visitors to the address, including two pop stars, a royal servant, an MI5 officer, Soviet traitor Anthony Blunt and Liberal MP Cyril Smith (posthumously exposed as a child abuser). But is it really credible that a senior minister, with 24-hour Special Branch protection, could slip his security cordon and carry out child sex abuse? Yet, in cyberspace, dozens of websites sprang up alleging that Brittan was guilty of a string of sex crimes over several years. Invariably, such claims were (and remain) unsupported by fact. The websites cannot, for example, find victims prepared to testify on the record or produce documentary evidence that has anything approaching a reliable provenance. Occasionally, lurid reports have spilled over into the mainstream Press. In late 2013, for example, the Sunday Mirror claimed that an unnamed ‘former Tory Cabinet minister’ had been photographed and filmed at a ‘depraved orgy organised by a paedophile’. 'Lasting friend': John Selwyn Gummer, Ken Clarke and Leon Brittan at Clarke's wedding . The police had copies of the pictures and video, the article suggested, and would shortly be questioning the former minister. Yet no such interview is believed to have taken place. No arrests were made, and no charges filed — which, on the face of it, would seem unlikely if such damning pictures exist. Another wild allegation circulating online — and reported by the Daily Telegraph — is that while serving as a Cabinet minister, a Tory was once arrested by Customs officials for smuggling child pornography in his luggage. You can look in vain for evidence to support this outlandish charge. Dark cloud: Rumours about Brittan were circulating around Westminster from the earliest days of his career. Above, Lord Brittan with Margaret Thatcher . One thing we know for sure, meanwhile, is that in 1984 Brittan was, as Home Secretary, handed a ‘dossier’ alleging the existence of a paedophile ring at Westminster by the late Tory MP, Geoffrey Dickens. The dossier later disappeared, prompting endless rumours that Brittan presided over its cover-up. Though he initially denied ever having seen the documents, last year he made a formal statement to the effect that he had passed Dickens’s dossier to officials. ‘I do not recall being contacted further about these matters by Home Office officials, by Mr Dickens or by anyone else,’ he said. The fate of that dossier is one of many issues due to be investigated by the Government’s inquiry into historic sex abuse, if it ever gets off the ground. Indeed, its existence led to the resignation in October of inquiry chair Fiona Woolf, after it emerged that she had a personal friendship with Brittan’s wife. Largely lost in that controversy, however, was a pertinent fact: if Brittan had been part of the Westminster paedophile ring laid bare by the ‘dossier’, why would Dickens hand that dossier to him? Dark rumours about Brittan were, it must be noted, circulating around Westminster from the earliest days of his career. A single man when he entered Parliament in 1974, he had no known girlfriends before marrying aged 41. In 1984, Brittan was at the centre of another poisonous rumour during which several newspapers reported that an unnamed frontbencher was a predatory paedophile. The so-called ‘Cabinet Minister Scandal’ died down when the investigative journalist Paul Foot published an article in Private Eye that named Brittan and said untrue rumours had been circulating ‘around in Fleet Street’ about him for some time. After lengthy investigations, several newspapers, including the News of the World, had concluded there was nothing in them. Vicious: In 1984, Brittan was at the centre of another poisonous rumour during which several newspapers reported that an unnamed frontbencher was a predatory paedophile. Above, with his wife Diana . Private Eye said the rumours were a smear circulated by MI5 officers who had targeted Brittan because they were upset by reports claiming he was planning a ‘big shake-up’ of their operations following the fatal shooting of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy. There was also prejudice against Brittan because of his Jewish faith. Private Eye concluded: ‘The MI5 spooks and loonies who object to having a Jewish Home Secretary . . . [have] retaliated by resurrecting the Brittan smear and spreading it around the Street of Shame.’ Thirty years on, such smears refuse to go away — and have been lent oxygen by the internet. To add to Brittan’s pain in his final months, Labour MP Jim Hood used Commons privilege (which protects MPs from libel) last October to accuse him of ‘improper conduct with children’ during the miners’ strike. Mr Hood cited no evidence in support of such claims. Throughout this barrage of allegations, one may wonder: why haven’t all the victims come forward to testify to Brittan’s guilt? The fact is they have largely been conspicuous by their absence.","Hundreds of messages on Twitter expressed glee at Leon's Brittan's death .

In a documentary on Channel 4 last night, the 24-year-old said: ‘If anyone ever did say anything to my children about me as their mum, I believe my kids will take it on the chin. ‘They’ll have had a lifetime of love and care, and they’ll have been well provided for, and they'll know that as a mum I've done everything I can to be a good mum for them. ‘My children don’t see their dad, so it is important to me that I do provide for them, and it does hurt to think that people might pick on them and things. But kids can get picked on for anything.' The mother - who had her third child, Grace, last September, and also has two boys - Harley, seven, and Frankie, three - added: ‘I am a nice person, I’m not a scrounger, I’m not a bad mum.’ Urinated on: Miss Cunningham (left, as a teenager) was so badly bullied at school that it led to the the involvement of a police scenes of crime officer, according to her mother Lisa Cunningham (right) And her mother Lisa Cunningham, 50, revealed that Miss Cunningham was bullied at school so badly that it allegedly led to the involvement of a police scenes of crime officer (Soco). She said: ‘For the first few years of being at high school she was terrorised by other people for having no boobs. She was photographed by a Soco on several occasions. 'I’ve got a list as long as your arm. I've kept every single document from the police of every incident when she's been attacked, poured petrol on, tried to set her on fire, washing lines round her neck, urinated on, everything.’ Last June Miss Cunningham hit out at a decision to stop her taxpayer-funded taxi trips to take her children to school - state-funded transport estimated to have cost £6,000 a year. However, Leeds City Council decided to axe the free transport, which she received on health grounds after claiming the stress of unwanted ‘negative attention’ was giving her anxiety attacks. Media appearances: Miss Cunningham, who lives in Leeds, also appeared on ITV's This Morning yesterday . Last night’s documentary - entitled Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain? - also looked at her agent Rob Cooper, with whom she has worked to orchestrate one media storm after another. Earlier, she told MailOnline: 'Eventually I would like to be in a position where I no longer have to do things in order to stabilise my children's future. For now me and my kids are the priority, and that's all that matters.' Miss Cunningham first came to prominence in early 2013, when she sold her life story. The tale, about how she, a single mother on benefits, came to be given a free breast enlargement on the NHS, sparked instant outrage in a Britain just emerging from recession. She followed that appearance with another, this time on Page 3, which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination. Revelling in the furore, she then made appearances in which she played on her new-found infamy, most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with NHS-branded tape. Breast enlargement: Miss Cunningham first came to prominence in early 2013, when she sold her first story . Home life: Miss Cunningham poses in her kitchen in a publicity photograph for her Channel 4 documentary . Along with media notoriety, the other result of her going public about her breast enlargement has been a deluge of hate, both online and delivered via Royal Mail. The documentary offered a snapshot into a life where domestic chores are juggled with headline-generating antics and where every foray onto Twitter results in a barrage of hatred. It also heard from a 24-year-old salesman from Newcastle named Robin Armstrong, who describes himself as 'Josie's biggest hater’ and posts daily expletive-laden videos of himself ranting about her latest doings. And in a comment outlining her career ambitions, Miss Cunningham told the documentary: 'Where I want to end up is in every lads' mag with my bangers out.' Miss Cunningham on This Morning yesterday . Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and said she wanted a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Ahead of national A-level exam results being released in August last year, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. 'Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t**s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice' Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. It came after she decided not to abort her unborn baby afterall because she 'wanted a daughter'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. At one point, Miss Cunningham suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. However, she later said she had had a change of heart.","Single mother-of-three was allegedly severely bullied as a teenager .

"Swiss ski resorts are being forced to cut prices by up to 20 per cent in a desperate bid to lure back holidaymakers put off by the surge in the Swiss Franc which has sent prices spiralling. The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 per cent to 0.81 against the euro last week following the Swiss National Bank's decision to remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro. It means the cost of ski holiday essentials such as lift passes, ski hire as well as food and drink has rocketed for visitors in a country  already well known for its sky high prices. The Swiss ski resort of Zermatt where local businesses are being pushed to cut prices to appeal to tourists following last week's surge in the value of the franc . In the plush resort of Zermatt for example the currency surge means a British visitor now has to pay £80 more for their week-long lift pass bringing the total to £380, while a single day pass went up by around £16 to £60. Meanwhile the cost of enjoying just a small glass of beer while taking in the majestic view of the Matterhorn mountain jumped by around £1.30 to £4.60. A glass coke rose by £1 to almost £4 and a burger and chips at a modest restaurant was up by almost £4 to £15. In Portes du Soleil a skiing area which covers 13 resorts the lift operator has cut the cost of lift passes by 15 per cent. However the Swiss Tourist board said the decision to cut prices was down to individual businesses and insisted they were waiting for the exchange rate to level out before taking any action. The currency surge means a British visitor now has to pay around £80 more for their week-long lift pass in Zermatt bringing the total to £380, while a single day pass went up by around £16 to £60. A spokesman said: 'Measures are being taken and everyone is looking at the situation but one week after the event is too early to make any decisions. As a result of the currency surge holidaymakers who had booked in Switzerland have reportedly been racing to change their travel plans with many hoping to switch to Austria where they can pay in Euros. Some speculators have even suggested that the currency surge could even spell the death knell for the Swiss Tourist Industry altogether. In a bid to keep the tourists arriving, the Zermatt tourist board reportedly sent an email to all 1,100 local businesses with advice ranging from reinstating the 1.20 franc per euro cap, offering discounts of 20 per cent or cutting prices by 10 per cent, according to Bloomberg News. The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 percent against the euro after the Swiss National Bank's announcement that it would remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro . Other resorts are reportedly offering similar deals. Rolf Sigg, who lives in the resort of Morgins  on the Swiss-French border for 30 years, told the Telegraph: 'We live and rely on winter tourism and since the Swiss central bank stopped the exchange rate cap we haven't really known what to think – everyone is doing their own thing, introducing special offers to ensure it doesn't become too expensive for tourists. 'Visitors shouldn't hesitate to ask for discounts because we are really having to sell ourselves now as well as offering the very best quality and service.' Tourists from Europe accounted for 37 percent of overnight stays in 2013, according to latest data from the Swiss statistics office, but the country will be out of reach for many after 'SNB Day'. Last week Swiss hoteliers vented their fury on social media and politicians urged the Swiss to support the country's tourism industry, while resorts across the French border cheered a 'Godsend' as they looked forward to new Swiss clients. ‘Swiss people! Take your holidays in Switzerland!’ said Swiss tourist office chief Juerg Schmid on a twitter account. In Gstaad, hotelier Thomas Frei tweeted: ‘Great, first rejections, wanting to know the euro rate and whether we can do a better rate. While I'm at it, does anyone want to buy my hotel?’ Tourism contributes three percent of Swiss GDP and hotels and restaurants employ five percent of the labour force. The franc's abrupt surge comes weeks before European school half-term breaks which mark the height of the ski season . ‘The original forecasts predicting growth once again in the Swiss tourism industry over the next two years probably won't stand up any more,’ Christoph Juen, CEO of the Swiss hotel association hotelleriesuisse, told Reuters. That is an ‘existential threat’ to some hoteliers, he said. ‘I'm glad I'm just here for one day,’ said Amit Raj, 29 from Seville in Spain. ‘I'm definitely going to be a lot more cautious tonight and won't withdraw any more money,’ he added. Even before the decision to allow the Franc to surge, Europe's economic woes had seen the number of German travellers to Switzerland drop 19 percent over five years to 1.9 million by 2013, according to the latest available German tourism association data. In Alpine ski resorts, the economic chill has worsened in the past year as the number of Russian visitors fell sharply due to Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine and because of a weaker Russian rouble. Tourism from Japan has also been hit as the yen weakened. An even bigger test for the mainly small businesses in the hotel and restaurant industry could come during the summer. In the busiest summer months 2.5 million nights per month are booked by foreigners at Swiss hotels, 70 percent more than during the peak ski season, says Eurostat.","Swiss franc rose 30% against Euro and almost that against the pound .

"Mali has refused to accept the body of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly in a sudden U-turn the day before he was expected to be buried in the soil of his birth country. The gunman who murdered four hostages in a Kosher delicatessen as well as a policewoman was due to be buried in Bamako today; instead he remains in a fridge in the Forensic Institute in Paris. Malian authorities have reportedly given no reason for the change of heart, which means Coulibaly is now likely to be buried somewhere in France. Scroll down for video . Nowhere to go: The body of French jihadi Amedy Coulibaly has been rejected by his birth country, Mali. Coulibaly killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman . 'If Mali refuses to bury him on its territory, he will be buried in France,' said government spokesman Stéphane Le Foll this morning, without elaborating. The 32-year-old small-time dope dealer-cum-terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in east Paris on January 9, the day police tracked down Charlie Hebdo massacre gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi. A day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper. The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris - last weekend. Both were interred at night in unmarked graves, as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists. The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which they killed 12 people. Charlie Hebdo killers: The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris . Neither brothers' hometown wanted the terrorists, but were forced to find graves for them by a French law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. French media reports that no request for a grave has been made in Grigny, the impoverished south Paris suburb where Coulibaly grew up and where his mother and sister still live, nor in Viry-Chatillon, where he was registered to vote. So it seems most likely Coulibaly will be buried in Fontenay-aux-Roses, the Paris suburb where he had rented a safe house. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'","West African country gave no reason for rejecting the killer's body .

"A lost seal has been spotted 27 miles inland in a Lincolnshire town while fishing for food. The common seal normally found living off the east coast was pictured at Low Locks, off the River Welland, near Deeping St James. Normally found in the Wash, it is thought to have arrived at its current location during the last week. The seal was spotted by photographer Paul Marriott at the bottom of a residential garden 27 miles inland . A seal expert said it was rare for them to receive a call regarding a seal like this one discovered on land . RSPCA officer Sarah Angell said: 'We have received a number of calls about a seal that has been spotted in the rivers around Deeping St James, in Lincolnshire. 'One of our inspectors has gone out to check it and he is happy this seal is fit and healthy. 'Seals will swim down rivers in search of food. This seal appears to be following a dredger that is turning up fish, it is likely this easy meal is what has brought the seal inland.' Normally found in the Wash, it is thought to have arrived at its current location during the past week . The RSPCA said the seal appears to be healthy and should find its own way back in time . The seal was found 27 miles from the nearest water, the River Welland in Lincolnshire (above) Nigel Croasdale, general manager of the Hunstanton sea life centre, told MailOnline: 'We get alerted to one or two seals every year that have come up stream from an estuary and ended up in river water. 'It's rare, as the seal is typically on the coast in salty water. 'My advice to people would be to not approach the seal as it is a wild animal and it could bite. It could also be dangerous for dogs.' He added: 'It is very hard to catch a seal when it's healthy, it is an enormous risk. 'More often than not, when you approach a seal on land it will go back into the water. 'But if it's poorly then you have more chance of catching them and we can then give them an immediate inspection and bring them back to a rescue centre.'","Seal spotted at Low Locks, off the River Welland in Lincolnshire .

"A 35-year-old Nebraska man who is a registered sex offender allegedly forced a female victim to sign a 'slave contract' before torturing her, burning her with cigarettes and lighters and forcing her to drink urine every day. Nicholas Allen Talbot, of Lincoln, wrote 'PROPERTY OF NICK' on the woman's arm in black marker and told her she 'only had rights the master gave her' after forcing her to sign the contract, which he said was legal. Police arrested Talbot after the victim - a 32-year-old woman described as 'sweet' and vulnerable' - told her pastor and his wife. She claims Talbot has been abusing her for almost 10 years, according to The Journal Star. Sick: Nicholas Allen Talbot, of Lincoln, Nebraska, has been charged with domestic abuse after allegedly enslaving and torturing the 32-year-old victim for almost 10 years. He previously served three years in prison for sexually assaulting a child twice in 1998 . However she did not speak out because Talbot threatened to kill her family and made her believe the police were part of his 'gang'. That is until Monday, when she finally confessed to her pastor, Rev. Kathy Gouin at Lincoln Foursquare Church, and another woman at the church. She showed the women her wounds. There were four to six burn marks on the woman's spine that were black, where Talbot had extinguished cigarettes, the victim told police. Then there were burns on her right buttocks, which Talbot had done with a lighter. A similar bruise was found on her right breast, where Talbot had put the tip of a heated screwdriver on January 15. The woman also told investigators Talbot forced her to drink his urine once or twice a day. Rev. Goun said the woman's wounds were 'horrific'. She said she has known the woman through church for about a year and that she had volunteered to take food to the poor. 'She’s very sweet and innocent,' Gouin said. 'She’s a vulnerable young woman. 'She’s very innocent and believes people.' Talbot is a registered sex offender. He served three years in prison for sexually assaulting a child twice in 1998 and for forgery, according to Nebraska Department of Correctional Services records obtained by The Journal Star. He was charged with domestic assault on Tuesday and bail was set at $25,000. He remained behind bars Wednesday.","Nicholas Allen Talbot, 35, of Lincoln, was charged with domestic assault .

"David Cameron last night vowed to strip Scottish MPs of the power to decide policy on health, education and tax rates in England. The Prime Minister said the introduction of ‘English votes for English laws’ at Westminster was a matter of ‘fairness’ in the wake of Scottish devolution, and vowed to make it a priority if he wins the election. His decision to include income tax rates among the areas on which Scottish MPs will lose the vote could cause havoc for a future Labour government, or any administration propped up by the SNP. David Cameron (left) intervened following talks with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (right) in Edinburgh on Wednesday . The intervention followed talks in Edinburgh on Thursday with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who beforehand had enraged Tory MPs by threatening to end her party’s policy of not voting on English matters at Westminster. Mr Cameron described the talks as ‘businesslike’ but said Scotland’s First Minister was ‘wrong’ to end the SNP’s bar on voting on devolved matters at Westminster. He had travelled to Scotland to outline a raft of new powers for the Edinburgh parliament that were promised in the run-up to last year’s independence referendum, including tax powers enabling it to raise 60 per cent of its budget. Scotland will also gain control of £2.5billion of welfare spending, on top of its existing powers over education, health and justice. Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling (pictured) warned that barring Scottish MPs from voting on tax would undermine the ‘fiscal integrity’ of the UK . And it will be able to extend the voting age in Scottish polls to 16 and 17-year-olds, in time for the Holyrood election next year. Miss Sturgeon reignited the debate about English devolution on Wednesday by warning the SNP would end its ‘self-denying ordinance’ on voting on matters such as health at Westminster. The move was seen as paving the way for a post-election deal in which the SNP could prop up a minority Labour government in return for more powers and cash for Scotland. It also helps to neutralise Labour’s central message north of the border that a vote for the SNP risks a Conservative government at Westminster. Yesterday Mr Cameron indicated there would be no further devolution to Scotland, describing the new powers as ‘the resting place’ for the issue, while the SNP said the proposals did not go far enough. He made clear that the new powers for Scotland will come in parallel with a reduction in the voting rights of Scottish MPs. He also suggested the issue would be a ‘red line’ in any coalition talks, pledging to act on it if he remains as prime minister. He said: ‘You will get in full these [devolution] measures, set out in a Bill in the first Queen’s Speech of any government I lead. 'But there will also be very clearly set-out rules put in place so that English MPs have the decisive say on issues that only affect England. 'I think that is fair and right.’ Mr Cameron also said the proposals would prevent Scottish MPs having a decisive say on income tax rates in England – potentially making it difficult for a future Labour government to pass its Budgets. He said: ‘It wouldn’t be appropriate for English constituents to have a rate of tax essentially imposed on them by Scottish Members of Parliament.’ Mr Cameron said the Conservatives would set out their proposals on the issue ‘within days’. Options include a complete ban on Scottish MPs voting on English matters, and the introduction of a separate parliamentary stage on which they would be excluded – effectively giving English MPs a veto. Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling warned that barring Scottish MPs from voting on tax would undermine the ‘fiscal integrity’ of the UK. He said: ‘We must do nothing in any reforms that ... undermine the fiscal integrity of the UK because if we do that we will end up with all the structures we see in the eurozone, which no one wants to see.’","PM says introducing 'English votes for English laws' at Westminster was a matter of 'fairness' in wake of Scottish devolution .

"Air strikes have killed more than 6,000 ISIS fighters including half of the top command, according to U.S. officials. U.S. intelligence estimates that ISIS – also known as Islamic State – has a total force of between 9,000 and 18,000 fighters. Stuart Jones, U.S Ambassador to Iraq, said yesterday that more than 6,000 ISIS extremists had been killed in Syria and Iraq since air strikes began. Scroll down for video . U.S. intelligence estimates that ISIS – also known as Islamic State – has a total force of between 9,000 and 18,000 fighters but officials claimed yesterday that coalition air strikes have killed more than 6,000 militants . The figures come as U.S officials said the fight against ISIS would take longer in Syria (pictured) than in Iraq . Stuart Jones, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, said yesterday that more than 6,000 ISIS extremists had been killed in Syria and Iraq since air strikes began and said the military effort was having a 'devastating' impact on ISIS . Prime Minister David Cameron met with  Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at 10 Downing Street yesterday . He told Al Arabiya television that the military effort was having a 'devastating' impact on the extremist group. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel would not confirm the exact number of militants killed but confirmed 'thousands' had died. It came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Iraqi ground forces, backed by coalition air strikes, have taken back 700 square km of territory in Iraq from Islamic State. Mr Kerry, who was in London for a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, said the fight against ISIS in Syria would take longer than in Iraq. A large consignment of U.S.-made M16 rifles would be arriving in Iraq 'very, very shortly,' he said. Mr Hagel, a Vietnam veteran, also agreed that the war could be lengthy and played down the importance of the recent estimated body count. He said: 'I was in a war where there was a lot of body counts every day. And we lost that war. 'It's a measure but I don't think it's the measure.' His comments came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he feared lower revenues from falling global oil prices could hurt his country's military campaign against ISIS. Speaking after attending a meeting with Mr Cameron in London, Abadi said allies could help by potentially allowing Baghdad to defer payment for ammunition and weapons. 'Oil prices have dropped to about 40 per cent of their level last year. Iraq's economy and budget relies 85 per cent on oil and this has been disastrous for us,' he told a news conference. 'We don't want to see a reverse of our military victory due to our fiscal and budget problems.' However, Mr Hagel in Washington blasted some of Abadi's recent criticism of the pace of past U.S. and coalition efforts to support Iraq. 'I do disagree with the prime minister's comments. I would say, even further, I don't think they're helpful,' he told a news briefing. 'We have a coalition of over 60 countries that have come together to help Iraq. And I think the prime minister might want to be a little more mindful of that.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in London yesterday), warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack' Mr Hammond hosted the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS at Lancaster House in London . Mr Cameron vowed the UK would do 'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join ISIS and cause 'mayhem'. Pictured:  Prime Minister David Cameron with Haider al-Abadi . Prior to meeting Mr Cameron, Mr Abadi asked the Prime Minister for more military training and ammunition. Mr Cameron responded by confirming that Britain was ready to help, but stopped short of making any new commitments. 'The threat from extremist terror you face in Iraq is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom,' he said. 'We will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the mayhem we see today.' Mr Hammond said the London meeting planned the next steps of the coalition's campaign against ISIS in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. He said plans included doing more militarily, more to cut off the group's finances, and more to stem the flow of foreign fighters. Mr Hammond said that the coalition could take up to two years to expel ISIS fighters from Iraq, and that Baghdad's own forces would be incapable of proper combat operations for months. The meeting took place a day after Kurdish forces in northern Iraq said they had broken an Islamic State supply line between Mosul and strongholds to the west.","Air strikes have killed more than 6,000 ISIS fighters, report U.S. officials .

Emersyn 'Emmy' Waddle, from Moore, Oklahoma, passed away on Wednesday evening, her family announced on a Facebook page,'Praying 4 Emmy'. 'It is with saddened and broken hearts that we lost our precious baby princess at 8:57 pm this evening,' they wrote. 'She will always be loved and adored by her friends and family. Emmy had an amazing life and we were blessed by the Lord to have the opportunity to share it with her.' The little girl, the third of four siblings, was kept home from school on Friday after she started feeling ill and was diagnosed with strep throat and the flu on Saturday, according to a gofundme page. Loss: Five-year-old Emersyn 'Emmy' Waddle, from Moore, Oklahoma, passed away in hospital on Wednesday evening, four days after she was diagnosed with the flu and strep throat . By Saturday night, she had a fever of 107 and started having seizures, her father Dylan told KOCO. She was rushed to hospital by ambulance and doctors learned that her brain was swollen. In Facebook updates, her mother Leah said that Emmy's liver and kidneys were also struggling to function properly and, by Tuesday, she had slipped into a coma. 'She's a very sweet, gentle little girl that loves life,' her father had told KOCO. 'We're trying to cherish every single moment and remember as much about her as we can while we still have her.' After she passed away, loved ones paid tribute to the beloved little girl. 'I believe you had a bow on your head within the first 30 minutes after you were born and tonight you had a bow bigger than Dallas when you left and you would not have had it any other way,' her aunt wrote on Facebook. Devastated: Her mother Leah, left, and father Dylan, right, said their daughter was a gentle little girl . Loved: Her aunt paid tribute to the little girl and said that her parents put a bow in her hair minutes after she was born and that she passed away wearing a huge bow - 'and you would not have had it any other way' Emmy's death comes amid a flu outbreak and largely ineffective flu vaccines. Already this season, 45 children have died from flu across the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the first week of the year, 19 children died. More than 8,000 people have been hopitalized with the flu since the start of October, with the elderly the most affected, the CDC reported. The central states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Texas, have reported the highest incidence of flu illnesses. Emmy's death also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three quarters of people who had the flu vaccine this year will get the virus anyway. The percentage of effective injections - 23 per cent - is one of the worst performances since the government started tracking how well vaccines work in the 2004-2005 season. The effectiveness has ranged from 10 to 60 per cent effective. Spread: A map shows the high activity level of flu that has swept the U.S. during the 2014/2015 season . Tragedy: Earlier this month, 15-year-old Kobi Pickett died at home in Houston, Texas on Sunday after passing out in the shower and crashing through the glass door while suffering from the flu . This year, the vaccine doesn't include the specific virus that is making most people sick. Experts had warned that the predominant flu virus, influenza A (H3N2), had changed genetically since the shot was made. Among the victims who had been vaccinated was 26-year-old Katy McQuestion, from Wisconsin, who passed away from the flu after developing sepsis that caused her to have a heart attack. Before her death, she had been suffering from the flu from three days. Also recently, 15-year-old Kobi Pickett died at her Houston home on Sunday after fainting in the show and crashing through the glass door while suffering from flu. To date, 45 children have died from the flu this season and more than 8,000 across the country have been hospitalized with the virus since October 1, the CDC has said. At the end of the year, the CDC confirmed for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 per cent of all deaths. And now, in the midst of a worrisome flu season, health officials are pushing doctors to prescribe antiviral medicines more often. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week sent a new alert to doctors, advising prompt use of Tamiflu and other antivirals for hospitalized flu patients and those at higher risk for complications like pneumonia. CDC officials say a nasty strain of flu is going around that is more dangerous to elderly people and very young children. What's more, officials think the flu vaccine doesn't work well against this particular virus. So 'it's more important than usual' that doctors treat certain patients with Tamiflu or other antiviral medications, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at a press conference Friday. CDC research suggests doctors prescribe antivirals to one in five high-risk flu patients. CDC officials say the number should be higher. When given promptly - within two days of the beginning of flu symptoms - they can shorten the amount of time someone is sick with the flu, a number of studies have found. The drugs also can prevent patients from becoming sick enough to end up in a hospital intensive care unit - or worse, Frieden said. 'Antiviral flu medicines save lives,' he said. The CDC sent an advisory to physicians last month, warning them this could be a potentially bad flu season and encouraging prompt treatment with antivirals. Officials said doctors should not wait for test results confirming the flu if they are dealing with an elderly patient, someone who is very sick from the flu, or someone with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes and heart disease.","Emmy Waddle, from Moore, Oklahoma, started feeling ill on Friday and by Saturday, she had a 107-degree fever and started suffering seizures .

"The sight of three suns in the sky is enough to make most of us rub our eyes in disbelief, but centuries ago, the strange sight was seen as a bad omen. The unusual spectacle, called a parhelion, was captured on camera in Mongolia. It is the result of a  natural phenomenon in which sunlight passes though snow crystals in a particular way when they are suspended in the air. Scroll down for video . Seeing treble: This strange sight was captured in Mongolia and is the result of a rare natural phenomenon called a parhelion, which occurs when sunlight passes though snow crystals in the air . Stills of the event caught on an ITN video show the sun in the centre of the snowy scene, with two reflections either side, which can be described as sundogs or ‘phantom suns’. Sundogs are created when sunlight is refracted by large, hexagonal ice crystals, such as those in snowflakes. They typically appear as two coloured patches of light either side of the sun and though rare, can in theory be seen anywhere in the world in any season. Photographs of the event show the sun in the centre, with two reflections either side, which can be described as sundogs or ‘phantom suns’. They are always at the same level of the sun on the horizon, as seen here . They are created by the refraction of light passing through flat, hexagonal ice crystals in high, cold clouds. The crystals act like prisms so that as light passes through them, it is bent  by exactly 22 degrees  before reaching viewers' eyes to make the illusion. If the crystals are more randomly located in clouds, a complete ring around the sun is visible, called a halo. But if the crystals sink through the air, they become arranged in vertical lines, so that the sunlight is refracted horizontally, to make sundogs, as seen in these images. If the phenomenon is seen as the sun is rising, the sundogs gradually move further away from the sun, but always stay at the same elevation, so the three 'orbs' appear to be the same distance from the horizon. They are reddest in colour when they are near to the sun and fade to yellow, orange and then blue as they move away. The colours of sun dogs merge into a white halo in some instances. The strange phenomenon is first known to have been recorded by Aristotle between 384 and 322 BC. The Greek philosopher wrote: 'two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it all through the day until sunset'. He noted that they were always to the sun's side and never rose above or below it. The poet Aratus, who lived between 310 and 240 BC mentioned them in his catalogue of Weather Signs, saying that they indicate wind, rain or an approaching storm, while Artemidorus, a diviner in the second century, included the phantom suns in his list of celestial deities. Sundogs were sometimes seen as an omen for bad times ahead, such as war, and observations of them feature in ancient texts by Aristotle, Seneca and Cicero, among others. This depiction of sundogs appeared in the Nuremberg Chronicle, an early printed book shwoing world history, published in 1493 . Roman authors Cicero and Seneca mention them in their writings too. In later works it was feared that sundogs were omens for bad times ahead, such as war. An anthelion is said to have occurred before the Battle of Mortier's Cross in Herefordshire in 1461 - a major event in the War of the Roses. Apparently the Yorkist commander, later Edward IV of England, convinced his frightened troops - who feared the worst - that the event represented the three sons of the Duke of York and they won a decisive victory, as described in William Shakespeare's King Henry VI. A powerful anthelion in the summer of 1629 is believed to have influenced René Descartes to write his work of natural philosophy called The World. Sun dogs typically appear as two coloured patches of light either side of the sun and can be seen anywhere in the world in any season.

"Jamaican lawmakers have announced plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in a move that will pave the way for medicinal use. Debate could start before the end of the month in the drug-steeped country where marijuana, known popularly as 'ganja,' has long been culturally entrenched but is illegal. Following approval by the country's cabinet, Justice Minister Mark Golding said he expects to introduce the legislation in the Senate by the end of this week. A farmer shows off a marijuana plant during at his plantation in Jamaica's central mountain town of Nine Mile . Golding said the bill would establish a 'cannabis licensing authority' to deal with the various regulations needed to cultivate, sell and distribute marijuana for medical, scientific and therapeutic purposes. 'We need to position ourselves to take advantage of the significant economic opportunities offered by this emerging industry,' he said. It would make possession of 2 ounces or less of the drug a ticketable offense that would not result in a criminal record and growing five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted. Rastafarians would also be able to legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time in Jamaica, where the spiritual movement was founded in the 1930s. For decades, debate has raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja. But now, with a number of countries and U.S. states relaxing their marijuana laws the Jamaican government is advancing reform plans. Golding stressed that the government would not soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking and it intends to use a portion of revenues from its new licensing authority to support a public education campaign to discourage pot smoking by youngsters and mitigate public health consequences. The head of Jamaica's Cannabis Commercial and Medicinal Research Taskforce said he expected the bill to be passed soon in Parliament, where Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller's governing party holds a 2-1 majority. 'The development is long overdue,' task force director Delano Seiveright said.","Jamaican cabinet has approved bill to decriminalise marijuana possession .

"A journalist also known as a top player and spokesman for the hacking group Anonymous has been sentenced to just over five years in prison by a federal judge in Dallas on Thursday for charges including aiding in cyber crime. Barrett Brown, arrested in 2012, was originally charged with collaborating with hackers but later pleaded guilty to lesser charges including accessory to the unauthorized access of a protected computer. The judge sentenced Barret Brown to 63 months in prison, including the 31 months he has already served. He was also ordered to pay $890,000 in restitution. Barret Brown, who said he was a top player in the hacking group Anonymous, was sentenced to just over five years in prison by a federal judge on Thursday for charges including aiding in cyber crime . Brown, 33, pleaded guilty in April to being an accessory after the fact for attempting to assist a hacker, hiding two computers from FBI agents who were executing a search warrant and threatening an FBI agent in a video. The accessory after the fact charge relates to an incident in December 2011 when someone Brown knew as 'o' hacked the computer network of Austin, Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor and obtained confidential information, including credit card details, according to court papers. Brown knew that the incident harmed Statfor's website and removed confidential data, according to court documents. He also attempted to communicate with Stratfor's top official on behalf of the hacker to minimize damage, the papers said. In a statement read in court on Thursday, Brown - who had written for Vanity Fair and other news outlets - said his role was to post a link which had already been made public. He said the government 'exposed me to decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link to a publicly available file that other journalists were also linking to without being prosecuted.' Brown claimed he was in a manic state brought on by sudden withdrawal from Paxil and Suboxone at the time he threatened an FBI agent via YouTube videos in 2012 . Brown expressed regret for some of his actions, including threats made in online videos against an FBI agent. 'The videos were idiotic, and although I made them in a manic state brought on by sudden withdrawal from Paxil and Suboxone, and while distraught over the threats to prosecute my mother, that's still me in those YouTube clips talking nonsense about how the FBI would never take me alive,' he said. Brown's defense was supported by media rights organizations including the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders, which claimed he was prosecuted for his actions as a journalist. Brown and his supporters had asked him to be sentenced to time already served, or 30 months. In a statement after the sentencing, Brown appeared defiant as he mocked the process. 'Good news! -- The US government decided today that because I did such a good job investigating the cyber-industrial complex, they're now going to send me to investigate the prison-industrial complex,' he said. 'For the next 35 months, I'll be provided with free food, clothes, and housing as I seek to expose wrongdoing by Bureau of Prisons officials and staff and otherwise report on news and culture in the world's greatest prison system.'","Freelance journalist Barret Brown has been sentenced to 63 months, including 31 months that he has already served .

"Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond opened up a Cabinet split yesterday by questioning government plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. He said there were concerns the scheme could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes, depriving the Treasury of revenue. His comments came a day after David Cameron finally threw his weight behind laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings. Scroll down for video . The government has announced plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes that includes grisly warnings about the dangers of smoking . MPs will have a free vote on the plans before the election but are expected to back them, with the law expected to come into force next year. But Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 5 Live the issue was complex, and he would look ‘very carefully’ at the evidence before deciding how to vote. ‘It’s a complex issue because experiments have happened around the world,’ he said. ‘It’s very important to look at the evidence of those experiments and see what the evidence shows. ‘Also some concerns have been expressed about whether it’s going to make the counterfeiting of cigarettes easier and increasing trade, which deprives us of a lot of revenue.’ A packet of 20 cigarettes costs £8.47 on average, of which £6.49 is tax. Smoke from e-cigarettes at ‘high voltage’ levels is more toxic than tobacco because it contains higher levels of cancer-causing formaldehyde, a study has found. A study found that e-cigarette smoke can contain up to 15 times more formaldehyde than traditional tobacco, though other research says that the electronic devices are safer than normal cigarettes . The amount of the chemical inhaled by e-cigarette users can be between five and 15 times higher than from smoking normal cigarettes, researchers said. Battery-powered e-cigarettes convert liquid nicotine into a mist, allowing users to inhale the drug while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke, a process known as ‘vaping’. Users change the voltage to decide how much vapour they want. The US study looked at smoke from e-cigarettes with a ‘tank system’ at various voltages. David Peyton, a chemistry professor at Portland State University who helped conduct the research, warned that e-cigarettes were not ‘absolutely safe’. Colleague James Pankow said: ‘There are toxins and some are (there) more than in regular cigarettes. ‘If you are vaping, you probably shouldn’t use a high-voltage setting.’ However the study is at odds with research last year by Queen Mary University of London which found e-cigarettes cause less harm than smoking tobacco to users and bystanders. Other studies into e-cigarettes have been inconclusive about their dangers. In 2011, Mr Hammond was treated to more than £1,000 worth of hospitality at the Chelsea Flower Show by Japan Tobacco International. The company, which owns Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut cigarettes, tried and failed to overturn a ban on the display of tobacco in shops introduced by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. Medical experts say non-smokers, and younger children in particular, are likely to find plain packaging less appealing. Philip Hammond said the issue is 'complex' and that the packaging scheme could lead to smuggling . But right-wing Tory backbenchers see it as a ‘nanny state’ measure, and others are concerned it would lead to job losses. One law firm said plain cigarette packaging could be the thin end of the wedge, with alcohol, chocolate and fizzy drinks targeted next. Tom Scourfield, head of intellectual property at CMS, said: ‘This is a first foray into depriving proprietary rights to perfectly legal products to discourage their consumption.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the plan was ineffectual and ‘counter to freedom, the basic building block of prosperity’. Liberal Democrat communities minister Stephen Williams admitted there was division within the Government over plain packaging. Tory MP Dame Angela Watkinson said she would not vote in favour of plain packaging despite being a life-long non-smoker. ‘There can’t be anyone in this country, young or old, who does not know about the health risks of tobacco,’ she said. ‘Nobody smokes in ignorance.’","David Cameron backed proposal to put grisly health warnings on packs .

"Matching his World Cup screamer, the golden boy of Australian soccer  Tim Cahill has added yet another notch to his impressive career after scoring one of the finest goals ever seen in Australia last night. Surrounded on each side by Chinese opponents, the Socceroo flipped his body away from the goal in an iconic bicycle kick, four minutes into the second half, and blasted the ball overhead into the corner of the net from close range.

Matching his World Cup screamer, the golden boy of Australian soccer Tim Cahill has added yet another notch to his impressive career after scoring one of the finest goals ever seen in Australia last night . Cahill  scored both goals in Australia's 2-0 triumph against China in Thursday night's quarter-final. He has made a habit of scoring stunning goals for his country -- most memorably his volley against the Netherlands in last year's World Cup -- but Thursday's eye-popper was perhaps his finest. The first goal was a Cahill trademark after Ivan Franjic  headed the ball into the box in the direction of Cahill, who seemingly had nowhere to go with a defender breathing down his neck. But the 35-year-old, displaying the sort of athleticism of a teenager, leapt into the air and performed a perfect overhead bicycle kick, angling the ball across the six-yard box past the astonished Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei.

The ins don't come any bigger for the Socceroos and also included captain Mile Jedinak, Robbie Kruse, Mathew Leckie and Mark Bresciano, who was given his first start of the tournament.

"Lazy: John Fennell, 23, said he would prefer a year in jail to unpaid work after having to do 150 hours . A serial criminal shrugged as he was jailed for almost a year and told friends: 'It's better than unpaid work.' John Fennell, 23, had been made to work 150 hours instead of going to prison in November after he stole jewellery from a dead woman's house in Hull. Just six weeks later the painter and decorator was at it again - smashing a bottle into a nightclub door and picking a fight with a stranger - so a judge jailed him for almost a year. But despite having spent Christmas Day in the cells away from his young son, his only reaction was to shrug. He turned to friends in the public gallery at Hull Crown Court and said: 'It's better than unpaid work.' It was the 21st conviction for Fennell, who is a familiar face in the city's courts and once admitted to being 'excited by crime'. The court heard Fennell had broken into a house in Hessle, East Yorkshire, in August last year with accomplices James Shaw and Carl Legg. The trio smashed the windows of the house, which had been empty since the death of its former owner, and stole jewellery including a silver necklace and watch and three gold earrings. For the burglary Fennell was handed a suspended prison term of 11 months and three weeks in November, when a judge told him he would have to work for 150 hours without pay. Six weeks later, on Christmas Eve, he was arrested for smashing a window of Hull's Diva's bar and being aggressive towards a man who was getting out of a taxi. Dale Brook, prosecuting, said: 'The security guard was asked to go inside because the defendant was becoming aggressive towards another male. 'He was removed and he had a bottle of Becks in his hand. He used the base of the bottle to smash glass in the door. 'The defendant stayed around the bar but then went down a passageway. 'He came out where a taxi was and he kicked the taxi door. 'The passenger got out and the defendant was heard asking him for a fight, so security intervened again.' Brawl: Fennell smashed a window and threatened a man outside Hull's Diva's bar (pictured) on Christmas Eve . He was arrested a short time later after being spotted on CCTV. John Thompson, defending, said Fennell had argued with the man in the club because he had thrown a drink over him. 'He reacted badly,' said Mr Thompson. 'It was an offence entirely different to the one he was given a suspended sentence for. 'He was living with his mother, having contact with his young son. Then on Christmas Eve, he was thrown into a cell, deprived of being with his son on Christmas Day. 'He wasn't released until Boxing Day.' Fennell admitted breaching a suspended sentence order, criminal damage and using threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour. He was jailed for 40 weeks for the suspended sentence breach and a month consecutively for each of the other two offences, making approximately 11 months' jail in total. Judge Michael Mettyear told him: 'You were given a golden opportunity and given a suspended sentence. Unfortunately, you haven't been able to take advantage of the chance given to you. 'You seem out of control at the moment, committing all sorts of offences as the mood takes you.'","A court had ordered John Fennell, 23, to work 150 hours for burglary .

"In a throwback to the Cold War, a Russian spy ship caused a stir after unexpectedly docking in Havana on the eve of historic talks between the U.S. and Cuba. There was nothing stealthy about the arrival of the Viktor Leonov CCB-175, which was moored to a pier in Old Havana where cruise ships often dock. But the visit was not officially announced by Cuban authorities. The timing also raised eyebrows as it came on Tuesday, the eve of historic U.S-Cuba talks aimed at normalising diplomatic relations. U.S. officials in Washington played down the presence of the Russian vessel, saying it was perfectly legal and not at all out of the ordinary. 'It's not unprecedented. It's not unusual. It's not alarming,' a defense official told AFP news agency. Scroll down for video . Arriving unnanounced: The Viktor Leonov CCB-175, a Russian Navy intelligence warship, is seen docked to a pier in Old Havana after sailing into the harbour on the eve of historic talks between the U.S. and Cuba . The Vishnya or Meridian-class intelligence ship, which has a crew of around 200, went into service in the Black Sea in 1988 before it was transferred seven years later to the northern fleet, according to Russian media. The vessel previously docked in Havana in February and March last year, staying there for a few days. Those visits were also unannounced. The Russians said the visit was scheduled a long time ago and was yesterday opened up for the children of Russian diplomats. For Cubans, who became increasingly dependent on Russia after the 1959 revolution,  the ship's latest visit has taken them down memory lane. Raphael Hernandez told ABC News: 'We have normal relations with Russia. 'One day, when we have normal relations with U.S., we could have an American ship visiting.' The highest-level U.S. delegation in 35 years will conclude two-day talks in Havana today with both sides cautioning an immediate breakthrough was unlikely. Senior U.S. officials say they hope Cuba will agree to reopen embassies and appoint ambassadors in each other's capitals in coming months. Nothing to see here: U.S. officials in Washington played down the presence of the Russian vessel, saying it was perfectly legal and not at all out of the ordinary . The United States also wants travel curbs on its diplomats lifted and unimpeded shipments to its mission in Havana. During talks on Wednesday, the Americans vowed to continue granting safe haven to Cubans with special protections denied to other nationalities. Cuba complained the U.S. law promotes dangerous illegal immigration and protested against a separate U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors to defect, calling it a 'reprehensible brain drain practice.' As her deputy sparred with the Cuban officials over immigration policy, the lead U.S. negotiator in the diplomatic talks, Roberta Jacobson, arrived in Havana aboard a commercial charter from Miami. She became the first U.S. assistant secretary of state to travel to the communist-led island in 38 years and the highest-ranking visitor in 35 years. Cuban and U.S. delegations take part in negotiations to restore diplomatic ties in Havana on Wednesday . Her Cuban counterpart will be Josefina Vidal, director of the foreign ministry's U.S. affairs, who also participated in the immigration talks. The meetings are the first since U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Dec. 17 they would work to restore diplomatic ties snapped by Washington in 1961. Despite resistance from some in Congress, Obama has set the United States on a path toward removing economic sanctions and a 53-year-old trade embargo against Cuba. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday he looked forward to formally opening a U.S. embassy in Cuba. Kerry also said he was prepared, when the time was right, to meet his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez, with whom he has only talked by telephone. 'And when it is timely, when it is appropriate, I look forward to traveling to Cuba in order to formally open an embassy and begin to move forward,' Kerry told reporters in Washington. In his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Obama urged Congress to start work on ending the embargo. But critics say Obama first needs to win concessions on Cuban political prisoners and democratic rights, the claims of U.S. citizens whose property was nationalised after Cuba's 1959 revolution, and U.S. fugitives who have received asylum in Cuba. The former Soviet Union was Cuba's main patron during the Cold War.","Viktor Leonov moors up in Old Havana pier during key diplomatic talks .

"The number of young children diagnosed with coeliac disease – where they react to gluten in food – has tripled in the last 20 years, say researchers. But poorer children are only half as likely to be diagnosed with the condition as those from wealthier families. The disease causes stomach pain and weight loss, and at its most serious can lead children to be malnourished. Scroll down for video . The number of children diagnosed with coeliac disease, where foods with gluten such as bread trigger bad reactions from the body's autoimmune system, has skyrocketed since 1993 . Attacks are triggered by the body’s reaction to foods that contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye cereals. Often mistaken for a food allergy or intolerance, coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease triggered by the immune system mistaking parts of the body as foreign. For people with coeliac disease, this attack is triggered by gluten. Once diagnosed with the condition, sufferers are advised to eat a gluten free diet for the rest of their lives. As many as one in every hundred children in the UK have blood markers for the disorder, which can occur at any age. Researchers at Nottingham University have found a big increase in the number of children who have been diagnosed with the disease. A UK database of health records identified all children from birth to the age of 18 registered with general practices between 1993 and 2012. Sufferers of coeliac disease are advised not to eat any foods with gluten. Rates of disease rose 39 per cent in boys and doubled in girls since 1993 . Among the total of 2,063,421 children, 1,247 had been diagnosed with coeliac disease during this period, corresponding to around 1 new case in every 10,000 children every year. This case rate was similar across all four UK countries, and was 53 per cent higher among girls than among boys. Between 1993 and 2012, diagnoses rose by 39 per cent in boys, but doubled in girls. While the numbers of new cases in infants and toddlers remained fairly stable, diagnoses among children older than two years almost tripled in the space of 20 years. They found that children from less well-off backgrounds were only half as likely to be diagnosed with the condition. This pattern was evident for both boys and girls, and across all ages, says a report published online in Archives of Disease in Childhood. The researchers said the rise in cases may be partly due to more sophisticated biopsies carried out today compared with GP-initiated tests in the 1990s, as well as better awareness. But this does not explain the differences in diagnoses among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds, they say. Lead researcher Dr Laila Tata, a public health specialist at City Hospital, Nottingham, said the ‘most plausible explanation’ was lower rates of diagnosis among those in deprived areas, rather than wealthier areas having a greater problem.","Coeliac disease is autoimmune disorder triggered by foods with gluten .

"A group of divers received a revolting surprise when they were engulfed by a giant underwater poo cloud while photographing a sperm whale underwater. Described as a 'poonado' by Canadian photographer, Keri Wilk, 30, the peculiar behaviour is thought to have been evidence of a rarely seen defence mechanism. Scroll down for video . Canadian photographer Keri Wilk was in the water when the sperm whale let loose with a massive bowel movement (pictured) The water turned a deep red brown colour as the substance filled the water all around the whale and divers . The sperm whale's reaction is believed to be a rarely seen defence mechanism . The excrement was spread throughout the water when the sperm whale spun on its side and flapped its tail . After spotting the aquatic mammal in waters off the small Island of Dominica, the four free divers began to take pictures as part of a government approved expedition. But the routine dive soon took a turn for the strange when the whale began releasing wave upon wave of faecal matter right in front of their eyes. The marine mammal managed to create a whirlwind of excrement by spinning on its side and flapping its tail. Although it isn't uncommon to see whales defecate before they descend, this was a bowel movement with a difference, spanning over 30 metres in diameter. To make matters worse, Mr Wilk prefers to dive with just goggles and a snorkel as bubbles from scuba diving equipment tend disturb the whales. He said: 'Four of us got into the water near the whale, then it slowly approached us, stopped, and pointed itself straight down before storm began. 'At first, it seemed like a regular bowel movement but rather than continuing its dive down, it remained at the surface and continued to defecate for a startling length of time. Photographer Keri Wilk said he had 'poop in my eyes, mouth, wetsuit, everywhere and I was soaked in it from head to toe' The whale swims through its own 30m-wide bowel movement, which quickly enveloped the shocked divers . 'Four of us looked at each other with confusion, then back at the whale, expecting that any second its call from nature would come to an end. 'Instead, the whale bobbed up and down, spun in circles and waved the poo in every direction for several minutes while we just sat back and watched. 'The water was crystal clear, initially, and was the most idyllic Caribbean blue water that you could imagine. 'After a few waves of faeces were released and stirred vigorously by the whale, the water was like chocolate milk, I couldn't see my hand when I held it in front of my face. 'I had poop in my eyes, mouth, wetsuit, everywhere and I was soaked in it from head to toe. But, after leaving the cloud, it quickly washed away, and didn't leave a smell on us. 'I did take an extra long shower once I returned to shore later that day, just in case. 'I've never heard of it happening before, and I don't know anyone that has had this happen, it very well could be the first time that it has been photographically documented.'","The sperm whale released a massive bowel movement as it was being filmed in the waters off the island of Dominica .

"At least 13 people died in Ukraine today after shelling hit a tram in the war-torn city of Donetsk hours after peace talks called for a ceasefire. The shell struck the vehicle, instantly killing numerous passengers and blowing out the windows of a nearby building. Twelve people were killed in the tram while another died in a car that was passing nearby, an emergency services official said. It came as Ukrainian forces all but abandoned the city's airport after months of bitter fighting which has left 10 government soldiers dead in the last day alone. The shelling took place in a part of the city under the control of Pro-Russian separatists who are fighting Ukrainian government forces. It was not immediately clear which side was responsible for the attack, but angry residents punched and kicked a captured soldier who was dragged to the scene by the rebels. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk blamed pro-Russian rebels for the attack. Scroll down for video . Several passengers were killed in Ukraine after a tram in the war-torn city of Donetsk was hit with a shell hours after peace talks called for a ceasefire . Blown out: Several passengers died on this tram when it was hit by a shell during heavy fighting between government forces and Pro-Russian rebels in the war-torn eastern city of Donetsk . The civilian death toll has been mounting in the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 4,700 people since April . 'Today Russian terrorists again committed a terrible act against humanity. Russia bears responsibility for this,' he said at a ceremony to mark Unity Day in Kiev. The civilian death toll has been mounting in the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 4,700 people since April. Meanwhile, Kiev said its soldiers pulled out of the main part of the airport, although military officials continue to insist they hold part of the complex. 'Yesterday evening, we made the decision to leave the new terminal,' military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov said in reference to the main airport building that had been held by Kiev forces since May. 'We continue to control the southern part of the airport... we left the new terminal because it looks like a sieve and there's simply nowhere to hide there.' Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk blamed pro-Russian rebels for the deadly attack on the tram (above) in the eastern city of Donetsk  and said Russia should bear responsibility for the incident . Civilians survey a burnt-out car which was passing the tram when the shell hit.

He said that 'on the whole, 10 soldiers were killed and 16 wounded in the past day of fighting' across the pro-Russian separatist east. Russian television reporters yesterday toured the airport building and showed the bodies of dead Ukrainian soldiers. Fighting for the airport peaked over the weekend, shattering the relative tranquility in place since a new truce was reached in early December. Hours before the tram shelling, Russia and Ukraine agreed on a dividing line from where both sides should pull back their heavy weapons in the city. Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who hosted a meeting of his counterparts from Russia, Ukraine and France, said the four parties had agreed the demarcation line defined in the Minsk agreement of last year should form the basis for the withdrawal. Donetsk People's Republic soldiers of the 'Sparta' squad clear debris in the destroyed Donetsk Airport. The government announced that it had withdrawn from the main terminal after fierce fighting with rebels . Destroyed: The Defense Ministry said six soldiers had died over the previous day of fighting for the airport, which lies on the northern edge of the Russian-backed rebel stronghold . Under the plan, Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists would pull back their heavy arms nine miles on either side of the line, though there was no agreement on a withdrawal of all troops. 'Today we have finally agreed that the demarcation line mentioned in the Minsk agreement is the line from where the withdrawal of heavy weapons needs to take place now,' Mr Steinmeier told reporters after the meeting in Berlin. He said the agreement had been 'difficult work' and the talks, which follow a fruitless round of negotiations last week, were 'testing the patience of all involved'. The parties also agreed that the contact group of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) should meet as soon as possible to lay further groundwork for a high-level meeting in Kazakhstan's capital Astana aimed at reaching a long-lasting settlement. Residents remove debris at a house damaged by recent shelling in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, on Wednesday . A Ukrainian serviceman is seen during fighting with pro-Russian separatists in Pesky village, near Donetsk . Separately, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the 'strong support' for the pull-back was the meeting's most important result. He said the foreign ministers did not discuss the sanctions that the West has imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis: 'The sanctions are not our problem, it is the problem of those who introduced them and now do not know how to extricate themselves.' Earlier yesterday, Mr Lavrov had urged measures to contain the unfolding unrest, but said nothing about the rebels surrendering territory they acquired in violation of a peace deal concluded in September in Belarus. Ukraine says separatist forces that are backed by Russia have overstepped agreed-upon frontline boundaries between the warring sides by 190 square miles. A fresh separatist advance is under way in an area north-west of Luhansk, the second-largest rebel-held city. The fighting is centred on two checkpoints along a strategic highway. Ukraine's defence ministry said one of those positions, Checkpoint 31, had been abandoned but that operations were under way to retake it. A Ukrainian armoured vehicle seen during fighting with pro-Russian rebels in Pesky village, near Donetsk . A Ukrainian serviceman fires a weapon during fighting with pro-Russian rebels in Pesky village near Donetsk . Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing material support to the separatists, which Moscow denies. The sheer amount of sophisticated heavy weaponry in the hands of the insurgents, however, is widely seen as overwhelming evidence of direct involvement by Russia. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko held up a piece of a bullet-riddled bus as evidence of shelling last week by Russian heavy artillery in his country. He said the metal came from a bus in the town of Volnovakha, where 13 people were killed by what he described as Russian shelling. 'For me this is a symbol, a symbol of the terroristic attack against my country,' he said, comparing it to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over rebel-held eastern Ukraine last summer. He called it a 'global problem,' extending far beyond just Ukraine's borders, cutting short his visit to Davos to deal with the crisis in his country. He says 9,000 Russian troops are occupying 7 per cent of Ukrainian territory. The fighting in the Luhansk region follows intense clashes over the weekend for control of the airport on the fringes of the main rebel city, Donetsk. The terminal - once the pride of the city but now reduced to a burned-out shell - is of limited strategic value. Now, however, it has acquired symbolic value because of the Ukrainian forces' stand against waves of separatist attacks. The fierce airport battle shattered the relative tranquility that had been in place since a new truce was reached in early December.","At least 12 died in the tram while another was killed in car passing nearby .

"Well this is awkward. The Prime Minister makes a lot of his special relationship with Barack Obama - but it seems the President who calls him 'bro' doesn't feel the same way. Mr Obama is following the wrong David Cameron on Twitter - a computer game-lover from Oregon who tweets about Back to the Future and Star Trek.

'I am a dude from America, who is more awesome than the prime minister.' He has 1,143 followers compared to the PM's 897,000 - though they do include Stephen Fry.

The closest he has ever come to enacting a new law has been to suggest 'banning the practice of packing books into cardboard boxes' while he was moving house. That's all without mentioning his profile picture is a still from Back to the Future Part II. The President is not the only Twitter user who has mistaken Oregon's David Cameron for the real thing - he receives a daily tide of abuse from people unhappy about government policy. Definitely not Britain's David Cameron: The Oregon tweeter's updates are decidedly un-Prime Ministerial . Sometimes he replies, telling one person who said 'please shut up @davidcameron': 'Nope'. He gave the same response to another user who wrote: 'Can @davidcameron confirm whether 24hrs in A&E is a Channel 4 documentary or Government policy?'

"A travel company in North Korea is looking to recruit English-speakers to provide training for the country’s tour guides. The project is being launched by Juche Travel Services (JTS), and who are offering specialists the chance to spend four weeks teaching at Pyongyang Tourism College. The company say they are looking for foreigners with a Tefl (teaching English as a foreign language) qualification, or English speakers with experience in tourism management. North Korean travel company Juche Travel Services are recruiting English-speakers to provide training for the country’s tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College . JTS believes that the programme will be able to ‘contribute positively to growing the country’s tourism industry’. The company want to take five volunteers on trips  scheduled for May and November. The scheme will cost €1,000 Euros - or £765 ($1,160) - for each person, with the fee covering travel expenses and accommodation. JTS says it is operating on a not-for-profit basis, with any excess funds to be spent on the tourism library at the college. North Korea has begun investing in tourism, with Masikryong ski resort and the city of Wonsan becoming one of the Communist state’s most popular destinations. Supreme leader Kim Jong Un is keen to develop the tourism industry in the isolated country . Western interest in North Korea has risen significantly over the past five years, with an estimated 6,000 tourists annually visiting the country through accredited travel agencies. ‘The country has made it clear that it’s looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,’ David Thompson from JTS told the Guardian. ‘To do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.’ According to Thompson, volunteers will face the same restrictions as other tourists in North Korea. Western interest in North Korea has been on the rise since 2009, with an estimated 6,000 tourists annually visiting the country through accredited travel agencies . Foreigners arriving to the country are usually closely monitored by the secret services, and are only allowed to interact only with specially selected members of North Korean society. Mr Thompson said that he understood foreign visitors would not be able to wander freely in the country. UK student, Ben Griffin, one of the first to take part in the program, said he was surprised to find his students ‘were just real people’, with the same worries and interests as young men and women their age anywhere in the world. Griffin added that he showed his class the British sitcom Only Fools and Horses, and the movie adaptation of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, both of which went down well with the audience. It is a big advance for a country that has been accused of grave human rights abuses against its people.

Mr Thompson stressed that JTS maintains ‘tourism has a positive impact’ on North Korea and its relations with the outside world. ‘By building bridges and engaging with the country, you are helping to break down mistrust and preconceptions that have persisted for the past 60-odd years. That can only be a good thing,’ he said. Although Mr Griffin says he was not allowed freedom of movement around the country, he told The Guardian that he did not feel uncomfortable with the situation.","Juche Travel Services running four-week training project in Pyongyang .

"A veteran Philadelphia homicide detective stashed his girlfriend out-of-state and hid her car while colleagues sought her in the slaying of her ex-husband, an indictment charged Thursday. Detective Ronald Dove has been charged with obstruction, evidence tampering, flight and conspiracy in a case the city prosecutor compared to 'a cheap novel.' Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said that Dove hid girlfriend Erica Sanchez in an upstate New York motel for several weeks and even took her to Niagara Falls during a weekend visit. Charged:Authorities say Det. Ronald Dove, stashed his girlfriend out-of-state while colleagues sought her in the slaying of her ex-husband. He was indicted on charges that include obstruction, evidence tampering, flight and conspiracy . Girlfriend: Erica Sanchez was arrested about five weeks after Cesar Vera's body was found inside a closed nightclub on Sept. 8, 2013. Prosecution: Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams speaks during a news conference on Thursday . 'He checked with a supervisor (after the slaying), ... but failed to say he was, at the very moment, with a prime murder suspect,' Williams said. A defense lawyer said that Dove regrets the heartache he caused his peers. 'Ron did not believe he was helping a criminal but believed he was protecting a victim of domestic violence who acted in self-defense,' lawyer Brian McMonagle said. Sanchez was arrested about five weeks after Cesar Vera's body was found inside a closed nightclub on Sept. 8, 2013. Vera had been stabbed once in the heart. The delay cost police the chance to gather her clothes, fingernails, car seat and other physical evidence, Williams said. Officials say Dove had driven her home from the scene and spent much of that day with her before the pair fled to New York. And they say he later lied to detectives and prosecutors as they tried to investigate the case — and urged him to disclose what he knew about his so-called 'friend.' He ultimately told several investigators that Vera had been abusive and asked them to go easy in questioning Sanchez. Dove was fired a few months later. He surrendered Thursday morning and was expected to be arraigned later in the day. Prosecutors said they would not oppose bail. Sanchez's murder trial is pending. The grand jury that heard Dove's case is also investigating at least one other death that may be connected, authorities said. 'We are trying to put together all the pieces, to solve all the homicides that may be associated (with the case),' Williams said. That could include a slaying that took place inside a bar owned by Sanchez's father in 2010. Dove was the lead detective. He and Sanchez started dating about that time, prosecutors said. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said that Dove hid girlfriend Erica Sanchez in an upstate New York motel for several weeks and even took her to Niagara Falls during a weekend visit .

"Weeks after some Twitter users reported spotting a catch-up feature in their news feeds, the social network has announced it is rolling out a ‘while you were away’ summary feature across its apps and website. The tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in. The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. At last! Twitter has announced it is rolling out a ‘while you were away’ summary feature (illustrated) across its apps and website. The tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in . In a blog post detailing the changes, Product Manager, Paul Rosania wrote: 'Today we’re introducing something new to your home timeline: a recap of some of the top Tweets you might have missed from accounts you follow.' 'Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up - with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter. 'With a few improvements to the home timeline we think we can do a better job of delivering on that promise without compromising the real time nature of Twitter' The feature was first spotted by a number of users over Christmas. It works in a similar way to Facebook’s news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order. The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site, and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. The feature was first spotted by some users (an example is shown) in December, but the feature has now been officially unveiled . The tool was officially announced by Twitter today, despite some users seeing the new feature pop up in their news feeds since December. It shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in. The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site, and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. Twitter didn't explicitly explain how it prioritises tweets, but said that it will pull out the best ones 'determined by engagement and other factors' to fill in the gaps. Twitter said the new feature is designed to help users keep up and catch up with news, no matter how regularly they check Twitter. The update will roll out on iOS devices from today and will be coming 'soon' to Android devices and twitter.com. The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the Twitter update is likely to cause similar frustrations. The site did not explicitly reveal how it prioritises tweets, or what it considers 'important' but said that it will pull out the best tweets, 'determined by engagement and other factors' to fill in the gaps in news while users are away. Mr Rosania explained: 'If you check in on Twitter now and then for a quick snapshot of what’s happening, you’ll see this recap more often; if you spend a lot of time on Twitter already, you’ll see it less.' Users who access Twitter on iPhones and iPads will begin to see the 'while you were away' feature from today, while it will appear on the company's Android app and twitter.com 'soon'. Twitter first announced its plans to roll out features to boost engagement in November, stating at the time: ‘Every time you open the Twitter app, you’ll see something great.’ It added: ‘We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app.’ The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the app (pictured) or website - a new feature, which has delighted some, while annoying others who took to Twitter to complain . It works in a similar way to Facebook’s Top stories news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order (pictured). The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear . In November Twitter revealed its plans for the ‘while you were away’ feature. Here is what it said in a blog post: . 'Right now, what you see of the 500 million tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow, and that’s a great model for many people. 'But with that many tweets every day, there’s no way even the most avid Twitter user will find everything that’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment. 'That’s why we’re exploring ways to surface relevant tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special. 'For instance, we’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to Twitter for: a snapshot of what’s happening. 'We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. 'We’re also working on ideas such as an instant, personalised timeline for new users who don’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own.' The 'while you were away' feature is the first one rolled out by the company, based in San Francisco, California, since it launched promoted tweets and adverts, which also buck its chronological approach. The tool is designed to attract a user's attention to important tweets that can get easily lost in the rapid flow of information, especially if they follow hundreds of people, or do not check their feed very regularly. A staggering 500 million tweets are published every day. People reacted on Twitter to the change, with some pouring scorn on the new feature. Before the official roll-out was announced, one user wrote: '#Twitter new feature to tell me what happened while I was away. I was away because I didn't want to know anything', while another said: ‘Why does Twitter show me tweets from last night ""while you were away"" .. Wack.’ However, one Californian user was among many who praised the change, saying: ‘Love the 'While You Were Away' feature at Twitter. Achieves its purpose without affecting real time news feed!’ The new feature may be seen as a move by Twitter to close in on Facebook’s social media lead, which has 1.3 billion users, compared to Twitter’s 284 million. Twitter is expected to roll out another new feature called ‘instant timeline’ to reinvigorate current users and attract news ones early this year. Last year, Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app (pictured). Twitter is now releasing new features to make its offering more appealing to current and new users . In August, Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November. Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent. Snapchat's popularity is growing among 25 to 34-year-olds, and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the younger age group. The figures were taken from comScore’s  Mobile Metrix report.","Twitter has officially launched the new feature, after some users have reported seeing 'while you were away' updates since December .

"Egyptian police have been accused of raping both female and male anti-government activists  with claims one man was thrown half naked into a cell as a guard shouted 'here is your lollipop'. The country has faced almost four years of unrest since a popular uprising against former president and autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011. There appears to be increasing pressure on the authorities to release thousands of protesters, who were locked up during the riots. Anti-government protesters demonstrating at a university campus in Cairo, last month. There has been allegations that police have used rape as a weapon against both male and female protesters . Now it has emerged that some activists have claimed that they were sexually assaulted by police after joining in with the protests. One woman told the Daily Telegraph how she had been raped when she was arrested at a protest in support of former Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi. She told the newspaper: 'The policeman shouted ""You want to act like a man? Let me show you what it is to be a woman"" - and then dragged me to the truck. The woman also recalls how she was watched as the assault took place and received no medical attention during her time in custody, which has now led her to become isolated from her husband and friends. She added: 'I lost everything. Now I am afraid of almost all men, sometimes even my two-year-old son.' Earlier this month, a lawyer representing a defendant in the trial of 26 men accused of debauchery at a public bath-house told the court his client was thrown half-naked into a cell, with officers telling fellow prisoners 'here is your lollipop'. Meanwhile Amnesty International say they too have received accounts of sexual assault and abuse by both men and women and say they reflect a much wider trend. Amnesty International say they too have received accounts of sexual assault and abuse of both men and women protesters . Earlier this week President Sisi had said that Egyptians had the right to protest but cautioned that demonstrating could cause more harm to the country's battered economy . However, Egypt's interior ministry has refused to comment on the allegations. It comes just a day after around 50 people staged an anti-government protest in downtown Cairo against what they called the 'military rule' of new president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Security forces used tear gas and birdshots to quickly disperse the crowds, according to security sources and added that 13 people were arrested. Earlier this week President Sisi had said that Egyptians had the right to protest but cautioned that demonstrating could cause more harm to the country's battered economy. But human rights activists say a law restricting protests and other security legislation enacted by President Sisi in the absence of a parliament have rolled back freedoms won in the 2011 uprising.

He was elected virtually unopposed last May, almost a year after the military he then led toppled freely elected president Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood, which has been weakened by one of the toughest crackdowns against the movement, has called on Egyptians to stage mass protests to mark the 18-day uprising. A security crackdown under President Sisi's watch ended months of economically ruinous anti-government unrest and jailed thousands of Islamists and liberal activists alike, including people for demonstrating without a police permit. Egypt will hold a long-awaited parliamentary election in two phases starting in March. President Sisi hopes the vote will deliver stability after years of upheaval.

"It has been an eyesore for the past two decades as mounds of rubbish continued to pile up outside this home in one of Australia's most sought after suburbs. But the dilapidated house just streets back from Sydney's Bondi Beach and estimated to be worth $2 million is now going under the hammer. Rubbish has been a constant fixture at the property at 19 Boonara Ave over the years and the family who own it, dubbed the Bondi hoarders, have simply refused to clean up. Scroll down for video . This residence in the beachside Sydney suburb of Bondi has been and eyesore for locals for at least two decades - but now it's going under the hammer after being listed for sale by a real estate firm . Rubbish has been a constant fixture at the property at 19 Boonara Ave over the years and the family who own it, dubbed the Bondi hoarders, have simply refused to clean up . The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'. The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement. The estimated rice range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data. The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard. More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property.

The front gate and fence can barely contain the trash which fills the front yard and covers the front porch . With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years. But the Bondi hoarders still inhabit the front and back yards of the Boonara Avenue house, guarding their piles of trash as if it is treasure. Plastic bags full of rubbish, old paint tins, a rusted wheelbarrow and a suitcase have caused the gates to almost burst at the seams as they hold back the mountains of trash.

The property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home. The council cleaned the property in mid-2014, but some neighbours said the house was as bad as they'd ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'. Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity. One neighbour described the Bobolas family as 'nocturnal' and said they found one of the women going through her rubbish .

"Benefits cheat: Vincent Siracusa pocketed thousands of pounds in hand-outs while working as a DJ in venues across the north west . A benefits cheat who swindled the taxpayer out of almost £30,000 by pretending to be unemployed while actually working as a nightclub DJ has been spared jail. Vincent Siracusa pocketed thousands of pounds in hand-outs while working the bar and club scene as a popular DJ in the north west of England. A court heard the 58-year-old had legitimately started claiming income support and council tax benefit from 2002. But he failed to inform the authorities when he begun working as a DJ from August 2004 and went on to earn £80,000 by the end of 2009. Siracusa was overpaid £25,000 in income support as well as £4,800 in council tax benefit while entertaining at trendy Northern Soul nights as well as pubs in bars. Yesterday Siracusa avoided jail after pleading guilty to two counts of benefit fraud at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. He was sentenced to 36 weeks in prison, suspended for two years and handed a 12- month supervision order and a four-month curfew. Sentencing, Recorder Nigel Daly told him: 'You are a person who has done charity work, donating almost £2,000 to Help For Heroes. 'You have been involved in other charity events, one raising £1,000 for the Donna Louise Trust. 'But at the same time you have been effectively stealing from the public, receiving £30,000 over about five years. 'At the same time you were working on a regular basis and receiving money, which would have put you as having income in the region of £16,000, none of which was declared to the authorities.' The court heard Siracusa, of Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., worked at bars and clubs and even performed at functions at Port Vale Football Club. But he was rumbled by the Department of Work and Pensions after they received an anonymous tip-off from a member of the public. Escaped jail: Siracusa avoided prison after pleading guilty to two counts of benefit fraud at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, above . Prosecutor Fraser Livesey told the court: 'The defendant claimed benefits from 2002. 'They were not dishonest from the outset. He began working from August 2004. 'He would not have been entitled to benefits if he declared his work. 'He was working as a disc jockey at pubs and clubs. He had two bank accounts, one which he used as a cash account, the other appeared to be an account for regular gigs. 'He appears to have worked at Port Vale Football Club in terms of their social functions and he worked at Northern Soul nights.' Stuart Muldoon, defending, said Siracusa - who has no previous convictions - didn't use all the cash himself and paid others who helped him at events. He added that the DJ carries out a lot of charitable work which has raised 'not insubstantial' amounts for worthy causes.","Vincent Siracusa, of Stoke-on-Trent, given thousands in income support .

"Rail passengers between England and France and commuters in Kent are facing travel chaos for the sixth consecutive day amid ongoing power supply problems in the Channel Tunnel. There are severe delays for freight and car passengers, who are trapped in worsening tailbacks stretching at least 20 miles on the M20 in Kent. With just a single line working Eurostar is warning its customers that they will experience delays of up to an hour today while engineers try to restore service to full capacity. There are further delays and tailbacks for freight and car passengers on the M20 in Kent . Eurotunnel said its service for freight and car passengers is operating with one departure every 90 minutes . Rail passengers should check in at least 30 minutes before their departure, said Eurostar . Kent Police are asking motorists to avoid the coastbound M20 today unless journeys are essential, as the queue of stranded lorries causes major delays for commuters. The situation is causing tempers to flare in Kent, where residents are growing increasingly frustrated and calling for an end to Operation Stack, which sees lorries parked on the M20 when Channel Tunnel service is disrupted. Ashford MP Damian Green told his Twitter followers he requested a meeting with the Transport Secretary  to discuss concerns about Operation Stack. He and fellow Kent MPs later met with Roads Minister John Hayes,  and he said that the minister understands 'the scale and urgency' of the situation. Meanwhile officials at Eurotunnel, the operator of the 31-mile Chunnel and the Le Shuttle passenger car and freight service, said they are working around the clock to return to a full timetable, saying it would be done ‘as soon as it’s safe’. But the delays are expected to continue tomorrow. Kent residents are growing increasingly frustrated with the delays associated with Operation Stack . Ashford MP Damian Green told his Twitter followers he requested a meeting with the Transport Secretary . A group of Kent MPs met with John Hayes, Minister of State at the Department for Transport . For rail passengers, Eurostar is operating a normal timetable. A spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'As a result of ongoing engineering works by Eurotunnel, and the continued closure of the North Tunnel, trains will continue to experience delays of 30 to 60 minutes. ‘Passengers should check in as normal, 30 minutes before departure, but should continue to check Eurostar.com for updates.’ As a result of the disruption Eurostar has modified tomorrow's timetable and cancelled four trains – one each on the London-Brussels and London-Paris routes, and one each on the Brussels-London and Paris-London routes. Eurostar is warning passengers that they will experience delays of up to 60 minutes today . A power supply problem in the Channel Tunnel has caused disruption and delays all week . Freight and car passengers are facing further delays and disruption with Eurotunnel's Le Shuttle service . Paris-based Eurotunnel said Le Shuttle is operating with one departure every 90 minutes on both sides. It normally operates up to four departures per hour. It has been a chaotic week for cross-Channel travellers, who have endured lengthy delays and disruption since the weekend. Trains were cancelled and thousands of passengers were left stranded by a lorry fire on a train in the tunnel on Saturday. More woes followed a day later as officials tried to resume full service. On Sunday, a power supply problem saw 11 trains cancelled on the service as people tried to restart their journeys. That problem has persisted throughout the week. Cross-Channel travellers have been caught up in significant delays and disruption this week . Kent residents said they are frustrated with Operation Stack as it causes severe delays for commuters . One Twitter user was forced to take the train to work as traffic congestion made it impossible to drive . In Kent, police said that phase two of Operation Stack, where lorries are queued on parts of the M20 to ease congestion leading to the Port of Dover, remains in place. A police spokesman said: ‘Overnight and this morning further traffic has joined the M20, leading to congestion back to junction 6.’ Drivers planning journeys to work today were being urged by police to find other routes and to plan ahead if going to the coast. In addition to causing traffic disruption, the situation is costing haulage firms massive amounts of money as lorries sit idle on the motorway. Natalie Chapman, head of policy for the Freight Transport Association, told Kent Online that it costs £1 a minute to run an HGV, and there will be costs associated with spoiled products and lost contracts. She said: ‘In this day and age we shouldn’t be having drivers parked up on the side of a motorway sat in their cabs with very little in the way of facilities. ‘It is cold, it’s not pleasant and I think we should be doing much better in the 21st century.’ Trains were cancelled and travellers were stranded after a lorry caught fire in the tunnel on Saturday . Dover District Council leader Paul Watkins lamented the lack of resilience to cope with a dramatic rise in traffic whenever there is congestion at the Chunnel or port. He said: 'It is unacceptable that communities in east Kent are expected to bear the burden of what is a national issue. 'The UK economy relies on Dover and the Channel Tunnel to keep the nation's trade moving. 'Yet time after time we are left isolated and cut off by the lack of resilience in the road network and a lack of investment to support the nation's premier roll-on, roll-off port.' He called on the government to develop a strategy on cross-Channel freight transport to manage problems ""more proactively"". 'Dover is as important to the national economy as Heathrow Airport,' he said. 'If Dover's not working, the nation isn't.' Eurostar is facing a multi-million pound compensation bill after passengers were left stranded at the weekend . Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe told BBC Radio Kent: ‘We are working round the clock and we will have it back as soon as it's safe to go into full operation.’ Bookings for all services have been closed down in the meantime, but people with existing bookings should still turn up, he added. Mr Keefe said: ‘We have put in a batch system where we are running seven trains at a time through the one directional section. ‘That's giving us enough capacity to carry the passenger car traffic that we have got. ‘Unfortunately, at the moment there isn't enough capacity for all of the trucks. That's why Operation Stack is in place.’ Kent residents also complained about the public costs associated with Operation Stack, with police and firefighters positioned along the queue. Meanwhile, the Port of Dover said there were no delays on ferry services. But due to volume and the difficulties at the Channel Tunnel, traffic was queuing on approach roads to the port. A port statement said: ‘The Port of Dover, together with its major ferry partners, will do all that it can to minimise any customer delays and community impact. ‘Customers are therefore advised to allow plenty of time for their journey and the community should consider using alternative local routes to move around the area where possible.’ The Channel Tunnel is the only land link between Britain and the European continent. It is used by passenger and freight trains, and conveys road vehicles by rail.","Cross-Channel travellers have faced disruption and delays since Saturday .

Brady also stressed this was not as serious as everyone has been making it out to be these past few days, noting; 'This isn't ISIS, no one's dying, we'll get through this.' The NFL seems to feel the same way too, with Brady revealing investigators have not even reached out to him. Some members of the press were shocked however when Brady said he would not even be able to notice the difference in ball pressure while playing as he is only focused on the game. 'Everybody has a preference. Some guys like them round. Some guys like them thin. Some guys like them tacky. Some guys like them brand new. Some guys like old balls,' he explained. He also says he checks the leather, laces and tack of the ball before games, but never squeezes them. 'I think there’s a lot of people who have more information than me,' said the two-time Super Bowl MVP. 'I have questions, too.' He later said; 'The integrity of the sport is very important.' Brady (shown practicing on Thursday) hinted at his possible involvement in Deflategate Thursday afternoon as he told members of the New England Patriots in a closed door meeting that he liked his balls 'a certain way' Meanwhile, the eternally gruff and forever short Belichick addressed the media Thursday morning and kept it simple, saying he was 'shocked' to learn that 11 of his team's 12 balls were underinflated and that he never even touches game balls, let alone knows anything about 'football air pressure.' Belichick had told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to Brady. 'I think we all know that quarterbacks, kickers, specialists have certain preferences on footballs. They know a lot more about it than I do. They're a lot more sensitive to it than I am,' he explained. 'I hear them comment on it from time to time, but I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject. Zero. Tom's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than I can possibly provide.' He then added; 'In my entire coaching career, I have never talked to any player or staff member about football air pressure,' said Belichick. He also said he would be sure to keep the balls on the higher end of the inflation scale moving forward to make sure this does not happen again. 'Obviously, with our footballs being inflated to the 12.5-pound range, any deflation would then take us under that specification limit,' he said. 'Knowing that now, in the future, we will certainly inflate the footballs above that low level to account for any possible change during the game.' The conference ended, in typical Belichick style, with the coaching great giving the same response to every question asked by the press; 'I've told you everything I know.' If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's underinflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine . This as Brady and Belichick prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks on February 1 in their record sixth Super Bowl appearance. The Seahawks, the reigning Super Bowl champions, have remained somewhat quiet about the recent controversy, though the team's cornerback Richard Sherman did say of Brady while speaking to the press on Wednesday; 'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise.' Also making comments about brady was Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, who was far more complimentary than his teammate. 'He’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game, one of the greatest at least,' said Wilson. 'I just think that he’s as good as it gets and watching him play the game of football is truly spectacular.' 'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise,' said Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman (above with Brady after a 2012 game) 'He’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game,' said Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson (above at practice on Thursday) of Brady . If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's underinflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine. As for Belichick, the incident has many referencing his previous discipline from the league in 2007 when it was discovered that he had sent someone to record the defensive signals used by the New York Jets. It is worth nothing however, that while 11 of 12 balls were underinflated by two pounds, they were adjusted at halftime when the score was 17 - 7 in favor of the Patriots. With the balls in the acceptable range in the second half, the Patriots outscored the Colts 28 - 0 meaning that should anyone on the Patriots have been involved this would have ultimately proven to be a high risk situation with a very, very low reward. Then, there is what Martin Schmaltz, a Professor of Physics at Boston University, had to tell Boston.com about the possibility no one did anything to the balls and it was just simple physics. 'If they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount, and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower, that would drop the PSI by between 1 and 2,' Schmaltz explained.","Bill Belichick addressed the Deflategate scandal Thursday morning saying he was 'shocked' to learn team's balls were underinflated on Sunday .

Firefighters  took about 10 hours to extinguish hot spots on Monday and one area flared up on Tuesday again. Two bodies have been found and four people were still unaccounted for on Thursday . The statement given to WUSA9 read: 'On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event. We are blessed that so many family, friends, and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need. 'We recognize the dedicated efforts from Anne Arundel County Fire and Police Departments, the Naval Academy, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and other first responders.

We ask that you respect our need for privacy. 'Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.' Investigators on Wednesday found two bodies  in the charred remains of the home in Annapolis, Maryland after the property burned to the ground on Monday. The bodies were with the medical examiner and have not yet been identified. It is not known whether the bodies children of adults. Federal and local investigators returned to the site to continue the search on Thursday. Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Three people embrace outside the gates of the home, where Investigators found the bodies of two unidentified people on Wednesday . Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren. They have not been accounted for . 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 'It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.' The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early on Monday. The blaze has reduced the 16,000-square-foot waterfront castle to ruins. The fire was reported about 3.30am on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside. Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby. Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish on Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed. Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play. Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am Monday, and was reduced to ruins . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle revealed  that the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning. The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack. However, Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene. Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people'.

Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted. His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation.

"Travellers will be forced to prove they are actually travelling around the country under a new Government crackdown to stop them setting up camps on green belt land. Under new plans, to be announced by the Government next month, travelling communities will be expected to prove that they have moved for two months every year. The new draft planning rules state that 'for planning purposes the Government believes a traveller should be someone who travels'. Scroll down for video . Under new plans, to be announced by the Government next month, travelling communities (pictured in Staffordshire) will be expected to prove that they have moved for two months every year and are 'nomadic' It comes after Eric Pickles, Communities and Local Government Secretary, was found to have 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies by using his ministerial powers to decide personally whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land. The new regulations mean travellers will no longer be automatically banned from setting up camp on green belt land, although they must prove they have a 'nomadic' lifestyle. The draft planning rules also state that 'travellers who have given up travelling permanently should be treated in the same way as the settled community, especially regarding sites in sensitive locations, such as in the green belt'. Under current planning rules, councils must provide land to house traveller communities and the Housing Act 2004 also states that authorities must regularly carry out assessments of their accommodation needs. Mr Pickles said the new regulations would allow a fairer planning system. He told The Telegraph's Christopher Hope: 'The public want to see fair play in the planning system, with planning applications being decided on the basis of their effect on the environment, not who the applicant is. 'This Government will stand firm in allowing councils to safeguard the green belt which prevents urban sprawl and stops the open countryside being covered in concrete.' It comes after Eric Pickles, Communities  Secretary, was found to have 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies by using his powers to personally decide whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land . Mr Pickles had said that travellers would be barred from settling on green belt land to prevent a re-run of battles such as the £7million eviction of Dale Farm (pictured) travellers. However, it's now been overturned . However, Joseph Jones, a spokesman for the Gipsy Council, disagreed. He told the newspaper: 'This is a very, very divisive issue – they are saying if you live on a gipsy site and you don't go travelling every year, you lose your gipsy status.' He said travellers have 'always travelled for work' and said it is not a nomadic way of life. Last year, Mr Pickles announced that travellers would be barred from settling on green belt land to prevent a re-run of battles such as the £7million eviction of the Dale Farm travellers. He said he took action because his advice to councils to only allow green belt developments in 'very special circumstances' was not being followed. Eric Pickles . Eric Pickles took matters into his own hands when travellers set their sights on his constituency. As he saw 15 caravans turning off the motorway as he was driving home, he chased them down and confronted about 40 travellers after they pulled on to a cricket pitch in Mountnessing, Essex. Unhappy with their answers, he then called in the police and local council to deal with them. The group were eventually issued with a Section 61 eviction notice and told to leave the field. After the incident in 2013, Mr Pickles said: ‘After seeing the trouble this has caused I’ve never felt it more important to protect our green belt land and the communities who live in and around it.’ The new rules were intended to prevent a repeat of the forcible clearance of Dale Farm, once the UK's largest traveller sites, on green belt land in Crays Hill, Essex. It followed a 10-year legal wrangle with Basildon Council, which in 2011 mobilised hundreds of police and bailiffs to clear the site as the residents fought back. However, earlier this week Mr Pickles and his department was found to have breached both human rights and equality laws for 'calling in' cases which would normally be considered by his planning inspectors. In a ruling likely to affect many other travellers, Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting at the High Court in London, said Mr Pickles was operating a legally-flawed policy of 'recovering' for his own consideration appeals by travellers who claim there are exceptional circumstances for allowing them green belt sites. No attempt had been made by Mr Pickles and his ministers to follow steps required by the 2010 Equality Act to avoid indirect discrimination, and 'substantial delays' had occurred in dealing with the appeals in violation of Article Six of the European Convention on Human Rights, the judge said. The judge also said that Mr Pickles' department had 'coined and developed' a practice in 2013-2014 of calling in all, and then a majority, of green belt traveller cases - most involving Romany gipsies or Irish travellers - 'which discriminated unlawfully against a racial group'. Following the ruling, Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'This Government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard green belt protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system. 'The Government's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the green belt. Today's judgment does not question that principle.' There are currently an estimated 300,000 gipsies and travellers in the UK. However, it is believed that only about 40 per cent regularly travel for two months or more every year, meaning many could be affected by the new planning rules.","Travellers will have to prove they live a 'nomadic lifestyle' under new rules .

"Julie Davies has been paid around £22,950 in salary since being suspended by Haringey Council, in North London, on July 17 last year over concerns from headteachers and over alleged tweets . A teaching union rep who hasn't taught a lesson for 14 years remains on full pay six months after being suspended - costing the taxpayer £46,000 a year. Julie Davies has been paid around £22,950 in salary since being suspended by Haringey Council, in North London, on July 17 last year over concerns from headteachers and over alleged tweets. The £45,900-a-year English teacher who now works as a National Union of Teachers (NUT) rep has not actually held a lesson for 14 years and has earned around £500,000 since 2000. Disciplinary proceedings against the teacher are still to be resolved but the local authority has refused to say whether an end is in sight, and has confirmed she remains on full pay. Mrs Davies was suspended in July over the concerns expressed by heads as well as other allegations, including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a Haringey mayor 'abusing' her position and also that she fired off a rude email to a councillor after food waste was not collected in her street. Headteachers has accused Mrs Davies of encouraging a 'climate of mistrust' and she has also angered parents by leading strikes at two North London schools over her own suspension. A website set up in support of Mrs Davies has claimed she has 'filed a legal claim for victimisation'. A spokesman for the Labour-run local Haringey council said this week that the 'matter was ongoing'. They added: 'We cannot comment on an individual case, but it is council policy, and well-established in employment law, that when an employee is suspended, they continue to receive full pay.' Mrs Davies was suspended in July over the concerns expressed by heads as well as other allegations, including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a Haringey mayor 'abusing' her position and also that she fired off a rude email to a councillor after food waste was not collected in her street . Mrs Davies wrote on Twitter this week: 'I have been suspended for 6 months. Could the #haringeycouncil officer who reads my tweets for a living get back to me? #stillhere'. The JulieDavies.org.uk website claims the rep is facing dismissal, with a decision on whether charges against her should proceed to a disciplinary hearing still to be taken. They relate to Mrs Davies allegedly tweeting about the borough mayor, a settlement agreement she was offered and bin collections in her street. It adds that further charges are still being investigated while others, relating to complaints about the rep by headteachers, have been dropped. Mrs Davies wrote on Twitter this week: 'I have been suspended for 6 months. Could the #haringeycouncil officer who reads my tweets for a living get back to me? #stillhere . A statement on the website reads: 'We think the council is moving out of the realms of victimising its rep and could now be accused of political persecution'. The NUT bankrolled the strikes, which disrupted the education of around 3,000 children at two state schools and took place despite only 50 to 60 per cent of teachers voting for them. Mrs Davies had previously lost a legal claim that Haringey did not have the power to suspend her or take any other disciplinary action against her.","Julie Davies has been paid around £22,950 in salary since being suspended .

"The 87-year-old owner of the New Orleans Saints and Pelicans caused a massive shake-up on Wednesday by cutting his daughter and grandchildren out of his will and announcing that his much-younger wife Gayle would instead take control of the teams when he dies. In a press release, Tom Benson said that the move was for the long-term health of his franchises and the community, and insured that his daughter and grandchildren 'will be very well taken care of after I die'. 'This is a decision that I have decided was in the best interest for the long-term stability and success of our football and basketball teams...This is not something that came about overnight, but over time,' Benson said. But his daughter Renee LeBlanc and her children Rita Benson LeBlanc and Ryan LeBlanc claim the move is all third-wife Gayle's doing, in a lawsuit filed less than 24 hours after the announcement. The lawsuit filed Thursday paints 67-year-old Gayle as an evil stepmother straight out of a children's fairytale, who allegedly staged a 'coup' to take control of her husband's life for her own selfish benefit. Change of plans: Tom Benson (left), the 87-year-old owner of the New Orleans Saints and Pelicans, changed his will this week to transfer ownership of the teams to his wife Gayle, 67 (right), in the event of his death. The couple of ten years pictured above at a Saints game on October 26, 2014 . Suing: Benson's daughter Renee LeBlanc and her two children are now suing claiming that Benson is no longer fit to make financial decisions. Above, New Orleans Saints players in white battle off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a December 28 game . Under the original terms of Benson's will, his daughter Renee was set to take a 60 per cent interest in the football and basketball teams upon his death, with Rita and Ryan each getting 20 per cent. They will no longer inherit any interest in either team according to the terms of the new will. The announcement comes as a tough blow for the auto-dealership magnate's granddaughter Rita, who had been primed to take over her grandfather's sports businesses and was serving as vice chairperson of the board for both teams. Rita, her mother and brother have since been stripped of their jobs and their names removed from the  Saints employee directory following the announcement. The trio are now hoping to regain their power over the teams in court, by proving that Benson is no longer fit to make decisions about his businesses and that his daughter should be placed in charge of his financial affairs. In the lawsuit, the LeBlancs say Benson has become increasingly ill in the past year and that his wife has been using his reliance on her to her own advantage. In the past year, Benson has undergone two knee surgeries and a stomach surgery which have left him bound to a wheelchair and walker. The suit says Benson became incoherent on a plane to an NFL owners meetings last May where he passed out, leading to the stomach surgery. He was also unwell during the Saints training camp where he was again hospitalized twice 'due to irregular vital signs, weakness and dehydration'. Benson is allegedly not eating well either, subsisting on a diet of 'candy, ice cream, sodas and red wine'. Estranged: Perhaps most hurt in this shake-up is Benson's (center) granddaughter Rita (left) who was has lost her position as chairperson to the board on both his sports teams. She will no longer get a stake in either team when her grandfather dies, according to the new will . Disinherited: Benson's daughter Renee (left) and grandson Ryan (right) are also left without a stake in the teams according to the new will . The LeBlancs say Benson has been 'heavily medicated' and has 'acknowledged on occasions that he does not know his age, where he is, what day of the week it is, nor what the date is'. 'On at least one occasion (he) failed to recognize his daughter, Renee, failed to remember or commemorate her birthday,' the lawsuit reads, adding that he also couldn't remember the name of the current president once, guessing Ronald Reagan and Harry Truman. And in a strange move, he last year tried to buy a race track which is against the NFL owners rules on gambling businesses. The children say Benson is now more dependent than ever on his wife of ten years, who appears to have taken over every aspect of his life. They claim she stopped their traditional holiday celebrations this year, has removed their photos from Benson's home, and is constantly monitoring his phone calls and emails. His doctors, caregivers and household staff have also allegedly been replaced by people loyal to Gayle. The LeBlancs also shared a heartbreaking letter in their lawsuit, which Benson sent to them at the end of the last month. The letter bans his daughter and grandchildren from Saints and Pelicans games for allegedly disrespecting his wife. Harsh: Included in the LeBlancs's lawsuit filed Thursday is a copy of a letter Tom Benson sent them last month, banning them from Saints and Pelicans games for their behavior towards his latest wife . The lawsuit also seeks to discredit Gayle's competence to lead their father's sprawling empire, based on her limited career as an interior designer. The suit says that before the two married, Gayle's business had been sued 'multiple times' and that she was in 'significant debt' with 'limited credit'. 'Gayle has never owned, operated or managed a substantial business enterprise,' the lawsuit says, adding that she also 'had no interest in football, basketball, or in sports in general before marrying' Benson. Benson first purchased the New Orleans Saints in 1985, and more recently acquired the Pelicans  in 2012. He met his third wife in 2004 at a mass at St Louis Cathedral. He asked her to an indoor football game and she agreed, hoping to get a donation for the church. They were married just a few months later in a ceremony in San Antonio, where his car business is headquartered. During their decade-long romance, the Bensons have been awarded the highest papal honor for Catholic laypeople, the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice Award, for their large donations to the church. They have donated $5million to found the Ochsner's Gayle and Tom Benson Cancer Center, $8million to build a Jesuit Center at Loyola University, among other charity programs. Though her personal interior design business doesn't translate much to the sports world, Gayle is well loved by members of the community, which generally responded positively to the announcement that she would be taking over this week. 'All I can say is I absolutely love Gayle,' Saints quarterback Drew Brees said. 'I think she's one of the sweetest people. I know she's one of our biggest fans. Her presence at practice with Tom all the time and the way she treats the wives and the players, she's first class.' Gayle has also been instrumental in securing a Mercedes sponsorship for the Superdome and re-branding the Pelicans team.","New Orleans Saints and Pelicans owner Tom Benson, 87, announced Wednesday he was transferring control of the teams to his wife Gayle, 67 .

"One of the star’s of TLC’s hit reality series My 600lb Life has been out on her first ‘traditional’ date, after losing over half of her body weight. During a special one-off episode of the TLC show, which aired last night, viewers were given a chance to see how life has changed for season two success story Tara, 36, who managed to shed more than 300lbs during her time on the show. When viewers first met the mother-of-two, from Lafayette, Louisiana, she weighed 606lbs. But, after achieving her dream of getting down to a healthy size, Tara revealed in last night’s show that she had been on the lookout for a good man to share her new life with and had agreed to a dinner date with her son's barber, Eugene. Scroll down for video . New beginnings: On Wednesday's My 600lb Life, the show revisited season two star Tara, 36, who was starting to date after losing 300lbs . But, despite revealing that she has known Eugene for 14 years, she admitted that she was still nervous about going out on an official date with him. 'I have never in my life been on a traditional date,' she said. 'I don't know if I am ready, but I am going to take a chance.' When Tara started the show, she spent most of her days in bed because of the constant pain in her joints. She depended on her family members to come to her because she was almost completely unable to leave her house. If her two children needed to go somewhere, she relied on her mother and step-father to take them. Within a year of undergoing major weight loss surgery, Tara lost 300lbs. Something more: Tara (left) agreed to have dinner with her son's barber, Eugene (right), whom she has been friends with for 14 years . Eye on the prize: Tara ordered a shrimp salad and refused to have any of Eugene's appetizer during their date. 'If it's not healthy or its too much food, I'm not going to do it,' she told the cameras . After meeting outside a restaurant, Tara and Eugene ventured inside where he told her that she looked 'stunning', which seemed to put her at ease. 'Now that I have lost the weight, this is a whole new world for me,' she said. 'The reason I am willing to give Eugene a chance is that he is a good man.' When the waiter came to take their order, Tara proved once and for all that she is still dedicated to her weight loss – and has not fallen back on her bad eating habits. 'I have to be careful about what I eat,' she told Eugene after ordering a small shrimp salad. Different world: Tara used to weigh 606lbs and was forced to rely on her family members to take care of her and her two kids . Barely moving: Before her weight loss, Tara spent most of her days in bed because her joint pain prohibited her from walking . She refused to share any of his appetizer - not even the tomato that he had offered her. 'If it's not healthy or its too much food, I'm not going to do it,' Tara told the cameras. She explained to Eugene that if she ate the tomato, she was going to get full. 'Okay. Good girl,' he replied with admiration. Incredible journey: Tara underwent weight loss surgery and lost half of her body weight within a year . Starting over: Tara said she has no desire to regain the weight she had lost. She is dedicated to her health and continues to watch what she eats . Eugene later asked Tara about her health and where she sees herself five or six years from now. 'I am not trying to get back [to 600lbs] because that's not healthy for nobody,' she responded. 'I want to be a wife one day.' Tara said that losing the weight and starting to date was something that she was doing for herself in order to try and move on with her life. 'I have to be happy with myself to find someone. I am starting to feel like I can have a life again and I can be happy.' She added: 'It's scary, but it is exciting at the same time.'","Tara, 36, from Lafayette Louisiana weighed 606lbs when she starred on season two of the TLC reality series .

The video, shot by Shapovalov and his friends, show the adrenalin junkie sitting in the chair as it is dragged down the frozen streets of Krasnoyarsk in central Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai region, behind the Subaru Forester. After spotting a car park where there were other young car drivers trying out drifting techniques, he and his friends decided to join in complete with armchair.

Sparks fly from underneath the armchair as it speeds along, attached by rope to the Subaru Forester . The group filmed Shapovalov being dragged in the armchair behind his drifting car and at one point turning over, sending him skidding across the road. Travelling at considerable speed, sparks can even be seen flying from underneath the piece of furniture. Shapovalov, who escaped the tumble unhurt, said: 'I  decided to tie (the armchair) up behind my car and drag it there with one of my friends driving, and as it was on the road anyway I decided to sit on it. 'It was always comfortable but I never knew it could also be so much fun.' After several others had also tried surfing with the armchair, the friends are finally seen dragging it to the tip. There, Shapovalov said a fond farewell to his faithful piece of furniture with a goodbye kiss. Shapovalov said he had been planning to take the old armchair to the rubbish tip but could not fit it into his car .

"Thankfully the umpire did not have to ask for 'new balls, please' after this uncomfortable incident at the Australian Open on Thursday in Melbourne. Instead of a line judge calling 'out!', it was a case of shouting 'ouch!' after a ferocious serve from Spain's Feliciano Lopez hit a stunned ball boy right where it hurts. The unfortunate ball boy got in the way of Lopez's 200km/h serve during the first set of his match with Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, and had no chance of getting out of the way before it thumped into the tenderest of regions. Scroll down for video . Bullseye: There was no way the ball boy could get out of the way of Feliciano Lopez's 200km/h serve . The ball boy reacts too late and the ball  spins away after it hits him in the tenderest of places . Take a breather: The ball boy does his best to regain his composure after the incident . Grimacing in pain the stunned ball boy spun around after being hit and briefly tried to walk it off. But he soon got down on one knee to get his breath back as a worried Lopez then walked down the court to make sure he was all right. The umpire and players stood around the teenager giving words of encouragement, but they could do little to ease his pain. A worried Lopez of Spain can only look on and hope that the ball boy is OK after the incident . Lopez and his opponent Adrian Mannarino of France try to comfort the injured ball boy . Minutes later he was forced from the court as an anxious Lopez walked along with him. Ironically it wasn't the only retirement of the match as Lopez moved into the third round after Mannarino called it quits in the fourth set, despite leading two sets to one. At least in the poor ball boy's case he probably had a much stronger reason not to play on.

"A firm which supplied ducks for Gordon Ramsay's foie gras dishes appeared in court in France today accused of 'serious animal cruelty'. Ernest Soulard, which is based in Oie, in the west of the country, is said to have kept birds in appalling conditions as it created the delicacy. If they become the first ever foie gras producer to be found guilty of animal cruelty, senior executives face prison sentences and fines of up to £25,000. Ernest Soulard, based in Oie, west France, supplied foie gras to Gordon Ramsay and the Eiffel Tower, is said to have kept birds in appalling conditions as it created the delicacy (stock image) Videos offered as evidence in the high profile trial in La Roche-sur-Yon, in the Vendee region, show ducks lying dead and dying in the same cage. Many have chronic eye injuries and abscesses, and all are force-fed grain through a tube to make their livers 10 times the normal size. This happened during a two-week ordeal in a windowless shed before they were slaughtered, and used to make foie gras. On hearing of prosecution in 2013, Ramsay cancelled all purchases from Ernest Soulard, pending 'further investigations'. Ernest Soulard also sold ducks to some of the best restaurants and hotels in Paris, including Alain Ducasse's Jules Verne, on the Eiffel Tower, Le Meurice, Georges V, and Fouquet's, on the Champs Elysee. Videos from insiede Ernest Soulard's farm show ducks lying dead and dying in the same cage . In one particularly disturbing scene in the video, an exhausted and clearly distressed duck can be seen lying on its back with its tongue hanging from its beak. The practice of enlarging livers by injecting food directly into the gut is known as 'gavage' in France, and animal rights campaigners want to see this legal process used as a test case to get the practice banned. An organisation called L214 initiated the case - the first in which a major foie gras producer has gone of trial for cruelty. Ducked out: Ernest Soulard supplied foie gras to Gordon Ramsay's restaurants . 'It's the first time gavage has gone on trial,' said L214 in a statement, adding that the case would allow 'a wide-ranging discussion' about gavage and 'the consequences it can have on the animal.' 'If the company is convicted, it will obviously affect the practice of gavage which is banned in numerous countries,"" Helene Thouy, lawyer for L214 told the AFP news agency. But Roland Tonarelli, director general of Ernest Soulard, insisted that the video was a fake. He added: 'Gavage is not on trial. The question is was there cruelty or not? We will show step by step, minute by minute that this is not the case. 'We have factual evidence to show that the video is a montage, and not all of it was filmed at our plant.' The foie gras producer is counter suing L214 for trespass and damage to its property. Mr Tonarelli added: 'We are not barbarians - the video has damaged producers and created a climate of suspicion.' The European Union banned individual cages for birds in 2011, but gave producers until the end of 2015 to install larger collective cages for the gavage. France produces almost three quarters of the world's foie gras and has around 8,000 producers. The process of obtaining foie gras is so cruel its production has been banned in Britain, but imports from across the Channel are not controlled.","French poultry farm Ernest Soulard in court over treatment of ducks .

"Kid Rock is making sure his fans know exactly where he stands on the controversy surrounding box office champ 'American Sniper' with a profanity-laden tirade aimed at the film's critics. The Clint Eastwood film profiles Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. While critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the U.S. military. Scroll down for video . Kid Rock is making sure his fans know exactly where he stands on the controversy surrounding box office champ 'American Sniper' with a profanity-laden tirade aimed at the film's critics . Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II . Actor Seth Rogen and filmmaker Michael Moore have been made controversial statements about the film on Twitter. CBS Detroit notes that Kid Rock has responded in a post on his site titled 'AMERICAN SNIPER, MICHAEL MOORE AND SETH ROGAN (sic).' Rock writes: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' Rogen, the star and director of the almost-banned comedy The Interview issued a statement about this weekend's blockbuster hit American Sniper, comparing the Clint Eastwood-directed film to Nazi propaganda. 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds,' Rogen tweeted on Sunday. Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride. 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds,' (right) Rogen tweeted on Sunday . Rogen has since elaborated that just because he was reminded of the Tarantino scene does not mean that he was drawing any comparison between Kyle and Nazi, and that he even enjoyed the film . One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle. American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills. The film based off Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help. Rogen isn't the first to criticize the film this weekend, during which American Sniper topped the box office and raked in a record $105.3million. Rogen has since elaborated that just because he was reminded of the Tarantino scene does not mean that he was drawing any comparison between Kyle and Nazi, and that he even enjoyed the film. 'But if you were having a slow news day, you're welcome for me giving you the opportunity to blow something completely out of proportion,' he added, on Twitter. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper. Meanwhile, Rogen's film The Interview was not eligible for any Academy Awards . Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War. American Sniper has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor for Cooper and Best Picture. Seth Rogen's film The Neighbors was eligible for this year's Academy Awards, but was not nominated in any category. Rogen's other film The Interview, nearly banned for fear that screenings of the North Korean-set comedy would be targeted by terrorists, was not eligible for the Oscars since it was released online a day before it premiered in theaters.","The Clint Eastwood film profiles Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history .

"She's the single mother of three who shot to infamy in 2013 when she appeared on the cover of a tabloid to brag about her free boob job under the headline: 'National Hooters Service'. Nearly two years on and Josie Cunningham, aka the NHS boob job scrounger, has become a media sensation, regularly sparking outrage courtesy of off-colour comments on everything from breast feeding (incest apparently) to the identity of her third child's father. But, she says, despite the lurid claims, she is far from being a scrounger and instead, is a loving, hard-working mother. Scroll down for video . Glamour girl: Josie Cunningham, Britain's most hated woman, appeared on today's episode of This Morning . Unfair: Ms Cunningham says she isn't the UK's most hated woman and says she does it all for her children . Notorious: Ms Cunningham shot to fame in 2013 when she spoke about her NHS boob job . Speaking on ITV's This Morning, where she debuted an eye-catching blonde new look, Ms Cunningham said she had worked since the age of 16 and is now self-employed. 'I'm far from a scrounger,' she insists. 'I have worked since I was 16 years old and I'm self-employed now.' Ms Cunningham was making the appearance ahead of a new documentary that follows her as she prepares give birth to baby daughter Grace. In it, the Leeds 24-year-old is seen working with agent and former club promoter Rob Cooper as they orchestrate one media storm after another - usually via social media. But while it might look tawdry, Ms Cunningham says her antics are all for a good cause - providing for her three children, Taylor, Harley and Grace. 'Eventually I would like to be in a position where I no longer have to do things in order to stabilise my children's future,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'For now me and my kids are the priority, and that's all that matters.' But making money for those children has seen her lurch from scandal to scandal, all faithfully documented via appearances on breakfast TV and tabloid splashes. Ms Cunningham first came to prominence in early 2013, when she sold her first story. The tale, about how she, a single mother on benefits, came to be given a free boob job on the NHS, sparked instant outrage in a Britain just emerging from recession. 'I phoned up and told [The Sun] that I've had my boobs done on the NHS,' remembers Ms Cunningham. 'I said I want to be a glamour model and [the boob job] has changed my life. 'They seemed keen. Overly keen. Next thing I knew, I was on the front page as New Hooters Service. 'I'd been portrayed completely opposite to what I was expecting, which was to encourage other young girls, to tell them that if you're depressed there's help there.' She followed that appearance with another, this time on Page 3, which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination. Working hard: Ms Cunningham used the appearance on This Morning to tell the world she is not a scrounger . Misunderstood: She also told hosts Phil Schofield and Christine Bleakley that people have the wrong idea . Upset: She said people don't realise that she is actually a hard-working single mother-of-three . Not bothered: Ms Cunningham, pictured with fiance Andrew Goy, says she will 'never' go away . Help: Miss Cunningham's media career has been orchestrated by agent Rob Cooper (left) Revelling in the furore, she then made a series of appearances in which she played on her new-found infamy, most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with NHS branded tape. Along with media notoriety, the other result of her going public about her boob job has been a deluge of hate, both online and delivered via Royal Mail. That it continues to this day, says Ms Cunningham, is the result of jealousy. 'I think it was originally about having my boobs on the NHS,' she explains. 'Now I think a lot of people hate the fact I've managed to gain a lot of media attention - people get jealous of that.' She doesn't read unpleasant comments, saying that looking at them would 'just annoy me' but revels in the knowledge that she's doing nicely, thank you very much, out of the unending bile. Nevertheless, Ms Cunningham does take exception to being described as 'the most hated woman in Britain' and says calling her workshy is wide of the mark as well. Wide of the mark: Miss Cunningham says calling her a scrounger and hated are wide of the mark . Fixture: Miss Cunningham, seen here appearing on This Morning, has become a tabloid darling . Controversial: The 24-year-old has kept her profile high with a carefully orchestrated media campaign . Big plans: Ms Cunningham says she wants to feature in every lads' mag with 'my bangers out' 'I think I'm probably up there in the top ten most hated but I don't think it's justified,' she says. 'I understand why people criticise me as they've only seen one side to my personality. 'After the documentary airs tonight, a few more people may warm to me.' The documentary, Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain?, offers a snapshot into a life where domestic chores are juggled with headline-generating antics and where every foray onto Twitter results in a barrage of hatred. In some respects, it's hard not to sympathise with Ms Cunningham, particularly when a man named Robin Armstrong, a 24-year-old salesman from Newcastle who describes himself as 'Josie's biggest hater' is brought on to comment. Mr Armstrong, who posts daily expletive-laden videos of himself ranting about Ms Cunningham's latest doings, says she has earned every bit of the hate she gets. 'She is the most hated woman in Britain and she proves it day in day out,' he froths. 'Who would want to watch her give birth apart from her mother and one of the 55 potential dads? 'She thrives off the hate. She just thrives off it. She's not bothered, she doesn't care. Because while we're all saying [rude things], she's making piles of money.' Armstrong is certainly right about the latter. 'They think I'm sitting at home and crying but I'm not,' snaps Ms Cunningham. 'You can all hate me until the day I die. I'm going nowhere. Nowhere. For as long as I'm making a stable lifestyle and career out of this industry, I am not going nowhere.' But while she might be making a decent living out of her notoriety, Ms Cunningham says she does have one ambition left for her to achieve. 'Where I want to end up is in every lads' mag with my bangers out,' she says, laughing. 'That can sound as trashy as it it wants but if you had no legs you would want to be Usain Bolt. 'I've had no tits for 23 years and I want to be the next big glamour model.'","Ms Cunningham says she is not the most hated woman in Britain .

"Over 1,000 energy firms were infected with a sophisticated cyber weapon that gave hackers access to power plant control systems, it has been revealed. Called 'Energetic Bear', the malware was unmasked by security firm Symantec. It said the software allows operators to monitor energy consumption in real time - and to cripple physical systems such as wind turbines, gas pipelines and power plants at the click of a mouse. The virus infected power plant control systems, allowing operators to monitor energy consumption in real time - and to cripple physical systems such as wind turbines, gas pipelines and power plants at the click of a mouse. The most ambitious attack campaign saw it compromise a number of industrial control system (ICS) equipment providers, infecting their software with a remote access-type Trojan. This caused companies to install the malware when downloading software updates for computers running ICS equipment. These infections not only gave the attackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations’ networks, but also gave them the means to mount sabotage operations against infected ICS computers. Dragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are remote access tool (RAT) type malware which provide the attackers with access and control of compromised computers. The attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the sabotage capabilities open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries. The attack is believed to have compromised the computer systems of more than 1,000 organisations in 84 countries in a campaign spanning 18 months. 'Among the targets of Dragonfly were energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers,' Symantec said. 'The majority of the victims were located in the United States, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Poland.'

The Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, appears to have been in operation since at least 2011 and may have been active even longer than that, Symantec said. 'Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies in the US and Canada before shifting its focus mainly to US and European energy firms in early 2013.' 'Dragonfly bears the hallmarks of a state-sponsored operation, displaying a high degree of technical capability. 'Analysis of the compilation timestamps on the malware used by the attackers indicate that the group mostly worked between Monday and Friday, with activity mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period that corresponded to a 9am to 6pm working day in the UTC +4 time zone. 'Based on this information, it is likely the attackers are based in Eastern Europe.' Stuart Poole-Robb, a former MI6 and military intelligence officer and founder of KCS Group, a security consultancy, told the FT: 'To target a whole sector like this at the level they are doing just for strategic data and control speaks of some form of government sanction.

"PC Warren Luke has been cleared of assaulting a woman at Great Ormond Street hospital . A police officer was cleared yesterday of assaulting a woman in front of her daughter at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Pc Warren Luke, 38, was accused of attacking the 41-year-old when she refused to leave the side of the seriously ill seven-year-old. But a jury acquitted him of a single charge of assault after hearing that he acted in self-defence when the woman became violent. The policeman closed his eyes and nodded as the verdict was revealed as colleagues sobbed with relief. Trial judge Peter Ader told him there were ‘lessons to be learnt’ from the case to prevent the situation ever happening again. The Met officer remains suspended from duty and could yet lose his job pending the outcome of an internal disciplinary hearing. Pc Luke clashed with the woman in a private room at the world famous children’s hospital in December 2013. He had been called by medical staff to help diffuse a stand-off with the woman who refused to leave and was shouting at doctors. Pc Luke was arrested within hours after fellow police officers reported his actions to a senior member of staff. The jury was told the officer punched the mum in the face and kicked her as he tried to subdue her and remove her from the room. The woman claimed she feared for her life and was ‘helpless’ as the officer punched her and kicked her ‘six or seven times’. Two of Pc Luke’s colleagues described the attack as ‘horrific’ and said they were shocked by what they saw. But his defence team successfully argued he acted in self-defence and the jury concluded he had acted reasonably in the lawful execution of his duty. Following the verdict, Judge Ader said to Pc Luke: ‘Can I make a suggestion that there are lessons to be learned from this case? ‘You wouldn’t want a repeat of this situation on another occasion, would you?’ The officer replied: ‘No, Your Honour.’ PC Luke declined to comment as he left court. A Met spokesman said: ‘There will now be a misconduct review.’ Pc Warren was accused of assaulting the woman when she wouldn't leave the bedside of his daughter at Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London (pictured above)","PC Warren Luke was accused of assaulting woman, 41, at the hospital .

"It's the stuff of nightmares - going for a life-changing  operation only to realise you have ended up with a botched up body. Yet for mother-of-six Sue MacManus, who lost a nipple in a horrifying complication after breast reduction surgery, and Hannah Costayer, who was left with wonky lips after plumping injections, this is their reality. The two women starred on tonight's Botched Up Bodies on Channel 5 and have suffered immensely thanks to their bungled surgery. Scroll down for video . Jacob was once 24 stone but he lost so much weight he's been left with sagging skin and drooping nipples . They featured on the show alongside a young man called only Jacob who, having lost an incredible amount of weight has ended up with such sagging skin, his nipples droop to his ribcage. Although Hannah was a pretty teen at just 18 she decided to have lip injections, not knowing that they would change her appearance forever. The procedure initially went well but she soon started to notice problems. Hannah's bottom lip started to swell and in time became lumpy. She said: 'One side of the lip became bigger and bigger and the other side just stayed the same. 'The skin is so stretched that it is cracking and bleeding all the time. It is so upsetting you can no longer feel confident around people because you are aware of the problem and you behave in a certain way.' Although Hannah tried to have her lips fixed, a second lip job saw little improvement and she is now looking at having another operation. 'After examining my lips the doctor said that the filler had gone into my connective tissue and in order to make my lips smaller he needs to extract part of the tissue. Hannah Costayer's lip job left her with wonky lips which she has had surgery to correct that hasn't worked . 'He needs to make an incision and cut part of my lip out and sew it back together,' she said of her third consultation. Meanwhile, having ballooned, Jacob lost an incredible amount of weight that left him with sagging skin that looked like an old man's. The doctor Peter revealed it would take four operations to return him to a normal state. He said during surgery which removed six and a half stone of excess skin: 'One of the problems with the skin with young people who have lost a lot of weight the skin is stretched anyway so it's not the best quality material to work with. 'You can imagine that when Jacob was 24st the blood vessels behind that huge amount of tissue were huge too so when he loses his weight his vessels don't go away and they remain very big which means he is prone to bleeding which means we have to take our time with the surgery.' And then there was Sue. Sue had spent her life feeling unhappy with her size 38G breasts and decided to go under the knife to have a breast reduction. But when she came around from the operation she instantly noticed something was wrong. She said: 'It was very uncomfortable having large breasts. I was a 38G. I had a lot of backache and shoulder ache, so I asked my GP if it would be possible to have the operation done. 'I was looking forward to having smaller breasts and not having the back pain any more and just to feel normal.' 'I was in the theatre for about five or six hours and when I woke up I was losing a lot of blood. At the time I could feel that there was blood oozing out of the right breast. And then the unthinkable happened: 'When I had to go and see the consultant the day after I was still losing a lot of blood, I was still bleeding heavily. 'As he took the dressing off to check, the nipple actually just came off with the dressing.' But according to research Sue's not alone, the hit TV series revealed that up to five per cent of those going under the knife will lose a nipple. Hannah's lips were normal before she had lip injections at just 18 which left her with a lop-sided smile . And while Sue was devastated, her doctor didn't seem to see it as an issue: 'He was just quite blasé about it and he just said I'm sorry but your nipple's died and it's come off.' But things were only going to get worse for Sue who had developed necrosis, when body tissue dies,  and was admitted straight back to hospital. Sue said: 'The smell is your flesh being eaten, it's just a smell that I can't describe. I went back to theatre and I had to have the inside of my breast cut away.' Sue's husband Steve has remained supportive but he understands that she has lost a lot of her confidence after her surgery. He said: 'You try to tell her that everything's alright, everything's fine, don't be worried about it. She feels odd, to me she wasn't, she was still the same' Six months after her initial operation Sue went back under the knife to try and rectify the damage but was horrified when she realised the new implant was the wrong size. 'When I went back to have it checked they realised that they had put the wrong sized implant in, it wasn't big enough,' Sue lamented. 'My body is worse now than it's ever been and I was just told by the consultant that there was nothing else that could be done - that they'd come to the end of the road. 'I can't look at myself in the mirror. I've got no confidence at all I don't like anybody seeing me, not even my husband. I don't like my husband to see me undressed. I don't feel like a woman any more I just feel like some kind of alien.'

"iPhone users have a reputation for being smug – and now they may have a good reason. A recent study has found that people who use an iPhone are smarter than those who prefer Android devices. This is based on research that found states with more college graduates also tend to have higher iPhone sales. Scroll down for a breakdown of results by state... Alaska, Montana and Vermont have the largest number of iPhone users in the US. These states also have the highest percentage of college graduates in the US. Meanwhile, New Mexico, Iowa and Delaware have the lowest percentage of people who use iPhones . The study, by Massachusetts-based advertising group Chitika, discovered that Alaska, Montana and Vermont have the largest number of iPhone users in the US. These states also have the highest percentage of college graduates. Meanwhile, New Mexico, Iowa and Delaware have the lowest percentage of people who use iPhones, and a lower number of graduates. As well as intelligence, the research found that wealth was linked to higher iPhone use – a factor that Chitika says is related to education. The study also found that iPhone sales are linked to population density. The more densely populated an area, the more chance iPhone sales will be higher.

Previous research from TalkTalk mobile surveyed 2,000 smartphone users about their personality, habits and jobs. Apple owners were the most ambitious and vain, BlackBerry owners earned the most and people with Android phones are polite and more creative . Apple is chipping away at Samsung Electronics position in its home turf of South Korea - thanks to its new iPhone 6 series. Apple captured a record 33 per cent market share in South Korea in November, the highest ever for a foreign brand, according to a monthly report released by Hong Kong-based market research company Counterpoint on Wednesday. In contrast, Samsung's share slipped to 46 per cent after hovering around 60 per cent for five months. Apple's gains in South Korea are telling, as November was the first full month that the larger-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were sold in the country. Other studies have uncovered similar results. Ladbrokes for instance, challenged a thousand smartphone users to take a series of online brain teasers designed to test their mental agility. iPhone users were found to have the quickest wits of all, completing the test in 94 seconds, on average, while BlackBerry users were the slowest at 118 seconds. In second place were Google Nexus owners, who completed the test just five seconds slower, on average, than top place Apple. Although the fastest test of all was completed by a Samsung owner, at just 47 seconds, the group as a whole were in third place with an average completion time of 103 seconds. HTC owners were fourth with an average time of 105 seconds, while people with Nokia handsets scored 109 seconds. A study in 2013 found that iPhone owners are vainer and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android phones. BlackBerry owners earn the most and are more likely to have long-term relationships, while people with Android handsets have the best manners and are handy in the kitchen. The study, commissioned by TalkTalk Mobile, surveyed 2,000 owners of the three major smartphone brands to determine whether the choice of handset was an extension of their personality. On the whole, Google’s Android sales are higher than Apple’s, but the iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the US. More than 42 per cent of smartphone are iPhones.

"Mothers invited to a conference on breastfeeding were told by the government it was 'not appropriate' to breastfeed at the event. The summit on nursing babies entitled 'Shifting the Curve - Sharing the Challenge' was scheduled to take place at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium next month. The Scottish government invited dozens of volunteers and NHS workers to the event. But mothers who asked to bring babies to the conference were told by officials the venue 'is not designed to accommodate breastfeeding'. Dr Lesley Taylor, pictured with son Tristan, 14 months, said she was 'shocked' by the government's decision . Dr Taylor, with Tristan and Cameron, four, also runs Supporting Public Breastfeeding in Scotland. She said the government was being hypocritical in excluding mothers from breastfeeding at an event promoting it . Elise Stirling (pictured), who runs parenting consultancy Bond, Baby!, said she was sent an email by organisers informing her it was 'not appropriate' to breastfeed at the event . Elise Stirling, pictured right with her seven-month-old daughter Tabitha, said the decision to exclude mothers from the summit was 'preposterous' Mothers were told in an email the conference on breastfeeding was 'not designed to accommodate mothers who are still breastfeeding' Elise Stirling, who runs parenting consultancy Bond, Baby!, said she was sent an email by organisers informing her it was 'not appropriate' to breastfeed at the event, after she told them of her dietary requirements because she was breastfeeding. Ms Stirling, who lives in Falkirk, told MailOnline: 'Their reason for turning us away was very flaky, they made it all about the babies, implying that despite breastfeeding my baby on demand (the very thing they are meant to be encouraging) that I would still be welcome without my baby. 'I replied that this was still discriminatory (and illegal, if they followed through on it) and the ​next reply I got was a group email to multiple respondents saying that they had updated the arrangements and it was now suitable. 'The point is, though, that nursing mothers don't need extra facilities, they just need a chair and their baby - the rest is all natural. 'Most people in other lines of work wouldn't take their baby to work with them. Lots of these ladies either work voluntarily while breastfeeding themselves or work from home to spend time with their children. 'The summit was open to ""anyone who works with parents and children"" and many of these women struggle to find relevant, affordable cpd to keep their professional learning up to date. To exclude these women was preposterous. 'There was no apology or admittance of guilt provided in the final email, just an assurance that the matter had been resolved.' The summit on breastfeeding will take place at Murrayfield Stadium, in Edinburgh, on February 24 . Labour MSP Elaine Smith (pictured) said it was 'astonishing that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome at a conference on the very issue' Campaigner Dr Lesley Taylor, 31, told MailOnline: 'Everyone was quite shocked. When mothers are breastfeeding they don't need any accommodation, they just want a seat to sit on. 'But they were told the summit could not ""accommodate"" breastfeeding. The advert for the event said the Government is trying to break down the barriers to breastfeeding. 'So by excluding mothers from breastfeeding they are being hypocritical.' She added: 'The government has now said they are happy to accommodate mums at the event, but I hope they don't set aside a separate area so they cannot attend the session.' Dr Taylor added that women who emailed officials to check whether children could come, received a reply saying the event was 'mainly aimed at professionals and service providers' and requesting that 'babies and infants are not brought along'. Fellow campaigner Labour MSP Elaine Smith added: 'It's astonishing that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome at a conference on the very issue.' The Scottish Government has now backed down and arranged for facilities to be provided for the event following the complaints. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'A statement was put on the event website advising attendees that the conference was mainly aimed at professionals and service providers, and that facilities for mothers were limited. 'However, the number of mothers with babies planning to attend the event was underestimated. Consequently we have already arranged for an extension to the baby changing facilities, and a quiet area for mothers and babies to ensure that all who wish to attend can.' The event was organised to address the relatively static rates of breastfeeding in Scotland over the last decade. Experts will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding, review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates. A key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities. Mothers planning to attend a summit on breast feeding were told it was 'not appropriate' to do so at the event . The conference also comes in the wake of strong political debates on the subject in recent months. The exclusive Claridge's hotel was widely criticised last month when a woman was asked to cover herself with a 'ridiculous shroud' while breastfeeding her three-month-old daughter. Louise Burns said she burst into tears when staff members at the five-star venue asked her to cover herself and her baby with an oversized napkin in order to avoid 'causing offence' to other guests. Also last month, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said breastfeeding mothers should 'sit in the corner' rather than feed their babies in an 'ostentatious' way, while London Mayor Boris Johnson said breastfeeding mothers 'can do it in a sort of discreet way.'","Event on breastfeeding scheduled to take place at Murrayfield next month .

"Air pollution inside the home is putting people at risk of developing heart disease, cancer and breathing problems, experts have today warned. Toxic Home Syndrome, which affects around 15.3 million houses in the UK, is where a person's health deteriorates because of the air circulating in their home. Scientists have warned simple day-today tasks, such as doing the washing or cooking dinner, could be putting families at risk of cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and asthma. Air circulating inside contains more than 900 chemicals, particles and biological materials with potential health effects. Mould spores, pollen, radon, carbon monoxide and dander all lurk within homes, seeping through cracks in walls and floorboards, brought in on clothing or produced by wood burners, gas hobs and detergents used in cleaning. Scroll down for video . Air circulating in the home contains more than 900 chemicals, including mould, which can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, cancer and asthma . Experts at the My Health My Home website warned failing to ventilate your home properly can increase the risk of falling ill. Simple day-to-day tasks including drying washing inside and heating the home with wood burners can cause symptoms including coughing, headaches, rashes, nose bleeds and lung disease . Coughing, watery eyes, dizziness, sneezing, feeling tired and suffering headaches can be common signs of poor indoor air quality. While more severe symptoms include eye irritation, rashes, muscle pain, respiratory problems, asthma, fever or chills, hearing loss, nose bleeds, wheezing and lung disease. The My Health, My Home infographic reveals from top to bottom, the key danger points in every home. The World Health Organisation states everyone has an uncompromised right to a healthy living environment. But air pollution is estimated to be the leading cause of environmental burden of disease in Europe. Experts have called for people to ensure their homes are properly ventilated and urged the authorities to make it mandatory for new builds to come with a 'Healthy Home Mark', indicating a good ventilation system is installed. Is where a person's health deteriorates as a result of the air circulating in their home. The condition affects more than 15.3 million homes across the UK, experts believe. Professor Peter Howarth, who specialises in allergy and respiratory medicine at Southampton University, called for increased awareness of what is being termed 'Toxic Home Syndrome'. 'Toxic Home Syndrome occurs when individuals and families are exposed to a potent mix of airborne pollutants within the home arising from poor ventilation, causing respiratory and skin diseases to occur more frequently,' he said. A pan-European study, carried out by the National Institute for Health and Welfare, revealed the impact indoor allergens has on disease and life expectancy. Researchers confirmed a link between indoor exposure to pollutants and cardiovascular disease. The annual burden of disease caused by inadequate indoor air quality is estimated to correspond a loss of more than two million healthy life years in the EU. The researchers found pollutants  in the home increase the burden of disease. More than 15.3 million homes in the UK are at risk of Toxic Home Syndrome, where a person's health deteriorates because of the air circulating in their home . Fifty-seven per cent of the total burden relates to cardiovascular diseases, 23 per cent to lung cancer, 12 per cent to asthma and the remaining eight per cent is linked to other respiratory conditions. 1. Ventilate . Make sure you have effective ventilation throughout your home. 2. Use eco friendly products . Less toxins and pollutants are found in eco-friendly products, making the air fresher and cleaner . 3. Roll with it . Opt for roll on deodorant and beauty products rather than aerosol cans . 4. Choose wood flooring . Carpets harbour dust, dust mites, pet hair, fungus and other harmful particles . 5. Unplug . Switch off your technology when you've finished using them . 6. Take your shoes off . Shoes can carry pollen, dirt and soil from outside, spreading it through your home . 7. Get it tested . You can make sure your home is radon free by getting a test . 8. Watch paint dry . Ensure paint has dried compleletly before using a newly painted room . 9 Crack it open . Dry your washing outside, if possible. If not, make sure you open the windows . 10. Time for a change . Ensure shower curtains are changed regularly and avoid ones made from vinyl, because the material harbours water and creates mould . The researchers suggest a change in the way homes in Europe are ventilated could reduce the overall burden of disease, by around 38 per cent. Professor Howarth, said: 'Many people associate indoor air quality with more innocuous conditions such as eczema or asthma, however, I have seen many patients with serious health conditions due to pollutants within the home and the risk of cardiovascular disease should not be dismissed. 'With respect to asthma, mould allergy is recognised to be associated with worse asthma and poorer asthma control. 'The presence of moulds within the home is a reflection of poor ventilation and increased humidity. 'Homes with mould are also likely to have higher house dust mite allergen levels and this may worsen both respiratory and skin conditions. 'The lack of adequate ventilation within the home can also be associated with the build up of non-allergenic noxious fumes which are detrimental to health.' He urged people to assess the systems they have in their homes, and called for new homes to come with a 'Healthy Home Mark', as an indication of good ventilation. 'I advise my patients to prioritise good household ventilation – assess the systems your home has in place and look to update them if they are faulty or out of date,' he told MailOnline. 'I would also like to see a 'Healthy Home Mark' on new homes to confirm that they have mechanical ventilation systems with effective heat exchange installed – to help reduce the health risks for future generations.' Currently, just two per cent of the UK has mechanical ventilation systems installed throughout their home; which is concerning given this data, Professor Howarth added. 'If people are exposed to high concentrations of pollutants over long periods of time, even non-chemically sensitive individuals can be susceptible to the associated serious health risks,' he said. For more information and advice on the best way to ventilate your home, visit www.myhealthmyhome.com . Video courtesy of Envirovent . Mould spores increase a persons susceptibility to asthma and allergies . Homes with poor ventilation can become a breeding ground for a number of different pollutants that increase the burden of disease. Around 81 per cent of people are at risk of suffering a respiratory or dermatological condition because of poor indoor air quality. Fifty-eight per cent of people have experienced mould or condensation in their homes, increasing to 70 per cent among 25 to 34 year olds. Mould spores, released in the atmosphere by damp spots on the walls, window frames and decaying foods are among the most common biological pollutants. The increasing prevalence of dampness in homes has caused a rise in mould levels, which in turn increase people's susceptibility to asthma and allergies. Pollen can also be a pollutant in the home, usually brought inside when windows are left open or people walk through the house with shoes they have worn outside. Meanwhile dander are tiny particles, which come from feathers, skin or hair and can also cause allergies. Volatile organic compounds, found in everyday cleaning products, can trigger asthma. They are commonly found in air fresheners, carpet cleaners, polish and oven cleaners. As well as biological pollutants and VOCs, there are a number of different gases, which are common within the home. Radon is a natural radioactive gas, that comes from the soil. It can seep into the home through cracks in solid floors, construction joints, cracks in walls, gaps around pipes and the water supply. Pollen, a common allergen, is often brought into the home on people's clothes and shoes, aggravating respiratory problems . Carbon monoxide is another gas common in the home. It has no odour or colour and can have serious effects on health. It is highly toxic and is thought to cause around 50 accidental deaths a year in England and Wales. Carbon monoxide can enter the home through cooking, heating, from outside, clogged chimneys, wood burning, incense burning, cigarette smoke and burning candles. Building materials stored in the home, paint for example, can contain chemicals including lead and formaldehyde, which are known to cause breathing difficulties, increased blood pressure and joint pain.","Toxic Home Syndrome is where a person's health deteriorates because of the air  in their home - increasing the risk of cancer and heart disease .

"A Wisconsin man has been sentenced  to 40 years in prison in the fatal shooting and dismemberment of a Minnesota man. Kou Thao, 28, of Wausau, pleaded no contest in September to second-degree intentional homicide in the April 2013 death of 58-year-old , of St. Paul, Minnesota. Thao was sentenced in Marathon County Circuit Court, also receiving 20 years of extended supervision after his release. Kou Thao (above) sentenced to 40 years in prison in the fatal shooting and dismemberment of a Minnesota man . Thao, who was also convicted of hiding a corpse and possession of a firearm by a felon, was accused of shooting and dismembering Hang, and taking Hang's severed head to Milwaukee in the trunk of his car in the spring of 2013. Other body parts were found in the basement of a Milwaukee home. A motive in the killing was unclear with prosecutors saying it appeared the two men met just days before the shooting. A Marathon County judge ruled last year that Thao was mentally capable of assisting with his own defense. Thao's attorney, Steven Kohn, had argued his client deserved less than the maximum sentence of 80 years in the prison system, including time in prison and on supervision. 'I don't think this is a young man who is a worst-case offender and for whom we have no hope,' Kohn said Wednesday. But Marathon County Deputy District Attorney Theresa Wetzsteon told Judge Michael Moran that Thao had a ""pattern of criminal behavior and violence"" as far back as 2002. Hang's son, Shoua Neng Hang, said that his father was a loving man who was devoted to his family and took his children fishing and camping. 'Losing and saying goodbye to my father is one of the most difficult things I have gone through,'  Hang said. 'If tears could build a stairway to heaven, I would walk right up there and bring my dad home again.' When it was Thao's turn to speak, he said the killing was not premeditated or intentional, but that it happened in the heat of the moment. He also apologized to the victim's family and his own, according to the newspaper. 'I am not a monster,' Thao said. 'I am truly sorry.' Before sentencing Thao, the judge said that the crime had shocked the community. 'It's more like an execution than an accident,' Moran said.","Kou Thao, 28, of Wausau, Wisconsin was sentenced to 40 years in prison and 20 years of probation for a 2013 murder .

"Be your best you:  Louise Roe, pictured at a Golden Globes afterparty, says many of the women she made over on Style By Jury had lost confidence . I’ve always been fascinated by the power of a first impression. When you walk into an interview, a meeting, to a first date, or even just down the street – statistically you’re judged by others within eight seconds. Eight seconds. That’s fast, and brutal. It would be great if those around us didn’t make assumptions based on appearance, but the harsh reality is, almost everyone does. So, it’s important to give yourself the best chance: to give your outfit some thought and make that first impression count. Clothes and make-up are certainly not as important as what’s on the inside, but I believe they should at least reflect a person’s best qualities. Many of the women I made over on Style By Jury were selling themselves short. They were funny, intelligent, kind and generous, but they had lost their way and their confidence, and it showed in the way they projected themselves – dressing like they’d given up and couldn’t care less. It’s not about spending a fortune on new clothes or having your hair blown out every day, but making small changes – figuring out the silhouette that flatters your figure best; wearing brighter color to express your personality; trying a little makeup to give your skin a glow; having fun with accessories. Preston [Konrad, Louise's co-host] and I are all about giving tips to help women watching the show find their very own style, to make the very best first impression possible. And we had fun doing it! Take Sloane, for example, the lovely lady you see in this video clip. She's a dedicated mom, sparky, hilarious and full of life. The kind of woman that, after five minutes chatting with her, you want to open a bottle of wine with and laugh all night. Her story is like so many other women: after years running around after her kids, with a full time job, she multi-tasks from dawn til dusk and puts herself at the end of a very long priority list. Sloane just didn't see herself as important enough to shine anymore, or to turn heads when she walked into a room. Emotional: Sloane sheds a tear when she hears what the jury has to say about her appearance . The comments our secret jury made about her when she first walked into the room, were honest and raw, and of course, upsetting. It was a horrible moment for Sloane to hear strangers' first impressions, but it was also a defining, pivotal moment that lead her to make a big change. Preston and I taught Sloane about body shape, how to wear print, how to wear comfy heels (yes I promise they exist!) and how to fix her hair so it didn't look like a messy mushroom (her words, not mine). Turning point: Louise says it was a horrible moment for Sloane to hear strangers' first impressions, but it was also a defining, pivotal moment that lead her to make a big change . Brutal: Louise's co-host Preston Konrad (far left) seen with the jury shortly before they deliver their verdicts . When her daughter and best friend saw the final result, well I won't ruin the surprise, but let's just say there was a new person, inside and out, standing before them. Making a good first impression is a mindset just as much as an outfit. If you feel confident on the inside, it radiates on the outside. Top that off with a well-fitting, attention-grabbing look, and I'm not exaggerating when I say the world is your oyster.

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned trip to Washington in March is kicking up a diplomatic dust storm in the nation's capital. On Thursday, the White House said President Barack Obama would not meet the prime minister when he comes to the U.S. to address a joint session of Congress. The decision comes just one day after GOP lawmakers blindsided Obama, announcing to the public that Netanyahu would visit Washington on March 3 -- just two weeks before the Israeli election -- rather than the original February date, without giving the Obama administration so much as a heads up. Prime Minister: President Barack Obama (right) is withholding an invitation for Oval Office talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) during his March 3 visit to Washington because the administration does not want to appear to be taking sides with the Israeli election falling so close to the visit . Arrangement: GOP lawmakers and Netanyahu (left)  worked out the arrangement without consulting with the White House or State Department, only alerting the Obama (right) administration a few hours before the Israeli leader's trip was made public . The White House said that as 'a matter of longstanding practice and principle' Obama is withholding an invitation for Oval Office talks with Netanyahu because the administration does not want to appear to be taking sides with the Israeli election falling so close to the visit. '...we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections, so as to avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country,' National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. But the timing of Netanyahu's visit also gave the White House a convenient means of retaliating against the prime minister for his decision to accept an invitation from Republican leaders to address Congress. GOP lawmakers and Netanyahu worked out the arrangement without consulting with the White House or State Department, only alerting the Obama administration a few hours before the Israeli leader's trip was made public. Warnings: Obama has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions  could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk . Proceed: House Speaker John Boehner helped orchestrate the visit and told a private meeting of GOP lawmakers Wednesday that Congress would proceed on further penalties against Iran despite Obama's warnings . Return: here, Obama returns to the White House after a two-day trip to Idaho and Kansas . Proposals: Here, Obama returns after wrapping up a two-day  trip to conservative states to sell his State of the Union proposals . The White House appeared stunned by what it saw as a breach of diplomatic decorum by Netanyahu, a leader with whom Obama has a history of tension. 'The typical protocol would suggest that the leader of a country would contact the leader of another country when he's traveling there,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. 'That certainly is how President Obama's trips are planned when we travel overseas. So this particular event seems to be a departure from that protocol.' At the center of the maneuvering around Netanyahu's visit are the high-stakes, U.S.-led nuclear negotiations with Iran, a nation Israel views as an existential threat. Netanyahu and Republican lawmakers, along with some Democrats, are united in their belief that Congress should pass legislation threatening Iran with new economic sanctions if the talks break down. Obama has vigorously warned that a sanctions bill could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk. Disagrees: ouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  said in a news conference on Capitol Hill that she disagrees with Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu to address Congress without consulting the White House . In another eyebrow-raising bit of foreign intervention, British Prime Minister David Cameron said during his own visit to Washington last week that he had been calling U.S. lawmakers to voice his concern about sanctions legislation. Britain is one of the U.S. negotiating partners in the Iran talks, along with France, Germany, Russia and China. House Speaker John Boehner, who helped orchestrate Netanyahu's visit along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, told a private meeting of GOP lawmakers Wednesday that Congress would proceed on further penalties against Iran despite Obama's warning. 'He expects us to stand idly by and do nothing while he cuts a bad deal with Iran,' Boehner said. 'Two words: 'Hell no!' ... We're going to do no such thing.' Netanyahu was originally scheduled to address Congress on Feb. 11. But the date was changed to March 3 to coincide with the prime minister's address to an annual conference held in Washington by AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby group. Request: Boehner tweeted Thursday that Netanyahu requested to address Congress on March 3 so he could attend the AIPAC conference in DC . Tough Fight: Netanyahu is in a tough fight against Yitzhak Herzog in the march 17 election and stands to gain politically at home from the U.S. visit . Netanyahu stands to gain politically at home from the U.S. visit. He is in a tough fight to win re-election in Israel's upcoming March vote. Netanyahu's Likud Party is running behind the main opposition group headed by Yitzhak Herzog's Labor Party, which has been highlighting rancor in the country's critical relationship with the United States. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was inappropriate for Boehner to invite Netanyahu to address Congress in the shadow of the election and give the appearance of endorsing the prime minister. 'If that's the purpose of Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit two weeks before his own election, right in the midst of our negotiations, I just don't think it's appropriate and helpful,' Pelosi said. In 1996, then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres traveled to the U.S. to meet with President Bill Clinton less than a month before Peres faced voters. Peres faced some criticism for using the trip as a ploy to win votes, particularly from opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu. 'I can't find an example of any previous Israeli government whose prime minister, on the eve of elections, made a cynical attempt to use relations between Israel and the United States as a party advertisement,' Netanyahu said.","On Thursday, the White House said President Barack Obama would not meet the prime minister when he comes to the U.S. on March 3 .
The White House said the decision was made to avoid the appearance of taking sides with the Israeli election just two weeks away from Netanyahu's U.S. visit .
The decision comes just one day after Republicans blindsided Obama, announcing the prime minister's visit without giving the administration so much as a heads up ."
"Zookeepers are to give two rare rhinos animal 'viagra' in a bid to get them to mate. The two southern white rhinoceros, Rumbull and Rumba, have become long-term partners after spending more than a decade at Noah's Ark Zoo Farm in Wraxall, North Somerset. But despite now reaching sexual maturity, the 14-year-old pair have so far failed to conceive naturally despite encouragement. Scroll down for video . Zookeepers are to give two rare rhinos animal 'viagra' in a bid to get them to mate at Noah's Ark Zoo Farm in Wraxall, North Somerset . The two southern white rhinoceros Rumbull and Rumba are reaching sexual maturity but the 14-year-old pair have so far failed to conceive naturally despite encouragement . Keepers at the animal park, are now hoping to speed up the process by giving them an aphrodisiac. Specialists are considering giving the large mammals a special feed pellet high in b-carotene, a compound thought to help reproductive success in rhinos. Specialist keeper, Emma Green, is also monitoring dung samples for oestrogen levels, the female sex hormone linked with reproductive cycles, to analyse Rumba's fertility. Miss Green said: 'I've got to know Rumba and Rumbull's habits well over the past few years as I work so closely with them.

"Benjamin Knight, of Eaton Rapids, Michigan, is facing charges of distributing disturbing child porn . A 28-year-old man is facing charges after he was found with child porn that police have said was the most 'gruesome' they'd ever seen. Benjamin Knight, of Eaton Rapids, Michigan, was arrested earlier this month for alleged child porn distribution of images depicting babies and bestiality. He is due to appear in court next week after police found images of children under the age of five engaged in sexual acts on his phone and home computers. A Battle Creek Police Department spokesman told Daily Mail Online on Thursday that the case was one of the most 'gruesome' he had ever seen. Major Jim Grafton also told freep.com: 'There are some disturbing images of some very young children doing bad things.' The police chief said that at time the investigation had become too much for his officers and they had to shut off the sordid tapes and 'walk away'. Police obtained a search warrant for Knight's home after he showed a disturbing video to a fellow customer at an adult store, Romantix, in Battle Creek. He was arraigned on January 12 on eight counts relating to distributing child porn and was held on $250,000 bond. Investigators do not believe that the abusive material was made locally and it does not appear that Knight is in the images. The 28-year-old, who does not appear to be married according to public records, faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty. He does not appear to have a criminal record. The investigation is ongoing and police are coming through Knight's electronic devices.

"Simple measures such as staying inside and watching TV can help combat potential flu epidemics, experts have revealed. Vaccinations and medications provide an effective form of response in the face of an outbreak. But avoiding social activity and staying at home can help halt the spread of infectious diseases, scientists have said. Scroll down for video . Simple measures such as staying at home during a flu pandemic can help halt spread of the virus, scientists have today revealed . A new study by a team of scientists at the University of California, Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Yale University found these non-pharmaceutical interventions can prove effective. Whether privately initiated or policy directed, actions calling for the closure of schools and entertainment venues, and cancelling public events are becoming more relevant in control strategies. Lead author of the study economist Michael Springborn, from the Univeristy of California, said: The swine flu outbreak that hit Mexico City in April 2009 could have been worse, but spread of the virus was reduced by people's behavioural response of distancing themselves from each other.' The researchers created a a new model that incorporates behavioural responses into existing models of disease spread. In April 2009 in Mexico, following confirmation of a new strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus, or swine flu, the federal government closed public schools in Mexico City and 'social distancing' measures were put in place. Researchers looked at television viewing in the home in Central Mexico as an indicator of behavioural response, during the pandemic. Professor Springborn said television ratings are consistently and widely available and 'highly correlate' with time spent in the home. The data provides a good indicator for the level of social interaction, with time spent watching TV increasing with the amount of time spent in the home. When people are at home, they limit the number of other people they come into contact with. In March 2009 following confirmation of a new strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the federal government closed public schools in Mexico City and 'social distancing' measures were put in place . 'We found that the behavioural response to the outbreak was initially strong but waned sooner than expected,' Professor Springborn said. 'This dynamic is interpreted as a rebound effect.' At the onset of the flu outbreak, the public responded strongly to the directed control policies. But after a period of time of staying at home, people began to leave the confines of their houses. Professor Springborn said: 'This suggests that efforts to utilise social distancing to mitigate disease spread may have a limited window of efficacy, before pent up demand for activities outside the home takes precedence.' The study revealed measures including using face masks can be effective at halting the spread of flu during an outbreak . In 1918 the influenza pandemic in Australia reflected that behaviour pattern. When the perceived risk decreased, the public reverted back to normal behaviour. 'Our study reinforces the view that capturing behavioural changes that amplify or blunt the transmission rate is key to improve our ability to make predictions about the impact of epidemics,' said co-author Dr Gerardo Chowell, from Georgia State University. The study's findings revealed differences in age groups and socio-economic groups. The researchers found that the increase in television watching for children and wealthier groups was more pronounced. The authors speculate that those from poorer backgrounds may face greater difficulty in taking self-protective measures, like social distancing, because of less flexibility with working hours. They suggest the differences could have implications for policy makers directing responses to future outbreaks, directing more resources to help those with lower financial means. Professor Springborn, said: 'This affects public health authorities tasked with planning epidemics. 'This has implications for management advice, including the allocation of resources between pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.' Other forms of non-pharmaceutical interventions include closing businesses and distributing face masks. But people can also take personal action, washing their hands thoroughly and wearing personal face masks to help reduce transmission. The study was published in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases.","New study focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop flu .

"Three members of the same family have been killed in a fatal crash between a four-wheel-drive and a truck. Michael Camporeale and his two sons Lee and James Camporeale, lost their lives in the head-on collision at Cultana, halfway between Whyalla and Port Augusta in South Australia. The three Port Pirie men, who are builders by trade, were travelling in a Nissan station wagon heading north on the Lincoln Highway. Police were called at 4.30pm yesterday to the devastating scene after the Nissan station wagon collided head-on with a semi-trailer travelling in the opposite direction. Three members of the same family have been killed in a fatal crash between a four-wheel-drive and a truck . All three of the Camporeale family who in the Nissan station wagon died at the scene after reports emerged that the vehicle burst into flames after the crash. The male truck driver was treated in hospital for minor injuries. Dino Gadaleta, President of the Italian Community in Port Pirie said he was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy. ‘It’s a big loss to the community, not just the Italian community but to the whole of Port Pirie,' Mr Gadaleta told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I’ve known them all my life, they were great guys. I’ve seen all their kids grow up’ ‘We are grieving for the family,’ he said. Major Crash Investigators flew to the scene last night to examine the circumstances surrounding the crash. The head-on collision occurred at Cultana, halfway between Whyalla and Port Augusta in South Australia and claimed the lives of the three men travelling in a Nissan station wagon heading north on the Lincoln Highway .

"Sydney siege survivor Marcia Mikhael has revealed how crazed gunman Man Haron Monis told her two people would be shot for every hostage who escaped from the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place. The chilling revelations come from a preview for Channel Seven's Sydney siege special, Inside the Siege: The untold story, which will also show footage filmed by the network from its position directly across from the Lindt cafe, including snipers taking aim from inside the newsroom. Monis held 18 hostages for almost 17 hours from 9.45am on Monday December 15, until police stormed the cafe at 2.10am the next morning. Mikhael, 43, was one of the first to agree to an exclusive interview with Seven, which is thought to have paid between $350,000 and $400,000 for her story - after the Nine Network tabled at $300,000 offer which was rejected. She tells former Sunrise host Melissa Doyle during the special: 'For every person that escapes I will shoot two, that's when I lost hope. 'And then I asked them if I could call my kids and speak to them because I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.' Scroll down for videos . The Seven Network has focused on at least four of the hostages locked inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe by gunman Man Monis last December and are promoting the program as 'What Really Happened' Marcia Mikhael has told how she pleaded with Monis to let her call her children and husband to say goodbye . Mikhael as seen at the window wiping away tears at the height of the Sydney siege in December . When the shootout brought the stand-off to a bloody climax, Marcia Mikhael suffered gunshot wounds to the legs and was carried out of the cafe by paramedics . The Seven program will reportedly show how police snipers trained their weapons on the gunman for many hours, along with other footage from inside the newsroom across the way from the cafe . Man Monis is pictured here using one of the 18 hostages as a human shield, as he did throughout much of the ordeal inside the Lindt cafe . Doyle also interviews John O'Brien, 82, who was the first hostage to run free on Monis' clutches, closely followed by barrister Stefan Balafoutis. He tells how there was little choice to be made. 'He said ""I'll kill you all one by one"",' Mr O'Brien said. 'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out.' Mr O'Brien, who reportedly received $100,000 to speak with Seven, also talks of the mental torture the hostages suffered and the confusion as they tried to comprehend what had just happened: 'Then all hell broke out once they locked the front door.' Scroll down for more videos . John O'Brien tells how he was resigned to being shot, whether he stayed inside or made a break for it . The oldest hostage among the 18 trapped inside, Mr O'Brien broke away from Monis' clutches first . As authorities grappled with the claims by Monis that he was carrying bombs in his backpack, so too did his captors. 'The threat of carrying bombs sort of stopped all of us from doing anything,' Puspendu Ghosh admitted during his interview. The IT manager was one of four Westpac workers who were trapped by Monis inside the cafe, only escaping as the stand-off reached its tragic climax on Tuesday morning. His colleague, Viswakanth Ankireddy, 32, is also heavily featured in the show. Viswakanth Ankireddy is forced up against the window of the cafe with hands in the air. His ordeal is also captured through the Seven program . The Westpac employee, one of four trapped inside, is seen here being forced to raise a flag with Islamic script on it, as were several others during the 17 hours . Viswakanth Ankireddy (front with hands up) was one of the last hostages to escape before the shootout. He is featured in the Seven siege special . The preview of Seven's special comes as Louisa Hope revealed she turned down the chance to tell her story on national television, despite significant financial offers, because she doesn't want to 'exploit' the incident which saw three people killed. Ms Hope, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, has also closed down a funding account to help aid her medical bills, refusing to talk about the deadly attack. The former bank executive was used as a human shield by Man Haron Monis during the ordeal, and was shot in the foot during the dramatic end of the siege when Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson died. Seven cameras capture Tactical Operations Unit police rushing to the scene of the siege at Martin Place . Louisa Hope, 50, was used as a human shield by Man Haron Monis, but is refusing to take money for her story . Ms Hope was allegedly picked by Monis as she could not put up a fight, as her MS drains her of energy and the ability to walk. Originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, Ms Hope, 50, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning. Robyn, 68, has been noted for her bravery during the siege, refusing to leave her daughter and eventually injured from a shot to the shoulder, reported The Daily Telegraph. Ms Hope's stand against media interviews comes in the wake of a series of promotional videos in which many of the other siege victims recount their terrifying ordeal. 'She doesn’t want to be seen to be exploiting the situation and is really appropriate in what she does,' Craig Wallace, president of People with Disability Australia, told The Daily Telegraph. 'She already has to walk with a cane, and she is going to need a lot of support to get her back on her feet,' Mr Wallace said. Under the NSW Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, Ms Hope and her mother are only entitled to $1500 of compensation, and up to $30,000 for medical compensation. The new Seven footage shows images of hostages collapsing from their forced position against windows . Louisa Hope - who also was featured in a hostage video - is pictured here being stretchered out of the Lindt Cafe after the shootout which claimed the lives of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson . Both Channel Seven and Channel Nine have secured exclusive interviews with several of the survivors, with the cost for the networks believed to be nudging $1 million. The networks were so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they were sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all. 60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon' but there is a school of thought they will screen the show next Sunday week, head-to-head with Seven's Men's final at the Australian Tennis Open. The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.' 'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.' Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. Gunman Man Monis told hostages they had '15 minutes' to live as the Sydney siege reached its tragic climax inside the Lindt Cafe last December . Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape . Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. Daily Mail Australia also understands the rival specials may both air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29. Seven would need to slot its program in before the men's final, if that was the case.

"The golden mask of Tutankhamun (pictured) has been permanently damaged after its 'beard' was stuck on with epoxy . The blue and gold braided beard on the burial mask of famed pharaoh Tutankhamun was hastily glued back on with the wrong adhesive, damaging the relic after it was knocked during cleaning. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where the burial mask is kept, is one of the city's main tourist sites, but in some areas, ancient wooden sarcophagi lay unprotected from the public, while pharaonic burial shrouds mounted on walls crumble behind open glass cases. Tutankhamun's mask, over 3,300 years old, and other contents of his tomb are the museum's top exhibits. Three of the museum's curators reached by telephone gave differing accounts of when the incident occurred last year. They also could not agree whether the beard was knocked off by accident while the mask's case was being cleaned or if was removed because it was loose. They did agree, however, that orders came from above to fix it quickly and that an inappropriate adhesive was used. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of professional reprisals. 'Unfortunately he used a very irreversible material - epoxy has a very high property for attaching and is used on metal or stone but I think it wasn't suitable for an outstanding object like Tutankhamun's golden mask,' one curator said. 'The mask should have been taken to the conservation lab but they were in a rush to get it displayed quickly again and used this quick drying, irreversible material,' they added. The curator said that the mask now shows a gap between the face and the beard, whereas before it was directly attached: 'Now you can see a layer of transparent yellow.' Another museum curator, who was present at the time of the repair, said that epoxy had dried on the face of the boy king's mask and that a colleague used a spatula to remove it, leaving scratches. The first curator, who inspects the artifact regularly, confirmed the scratches and said it was clear that they had been made by a tool used to scrape off the epoxy. Egypt's tourist industry, once a pillar of the economy, has yet to recover from three years of tumult following the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Museums and the opening of new tombs are part of plans to revive the industry. But authorities have made no significant improvements to the Egyptian Museum since its construction in 1902, and plans to move the Tutankhamun exhibit to its new home in the Grand Egyptian Museum scheduled to open in 2018 have yet to be divulged. The burial mask is kept in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (pictured), which is one of the city's main tourist sites . Neither the Antiquities Ministry nor the museum administration could be reached for comment Wednesday evening. One of the curators said an investigation was underway and that a meeting had been held on the subject earlier in the day. The burial mask, discovered by British archeologists Howard Carter and George Herbert in 1922, triggered worldwide interest in archaeology and ancient Egypt when it was unearthed along with Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb. 'From the photos circulating among restorers I can see that the mask has been repaired, but you can't tell with what,' Egyptologist Tom Hardwick said. 'Everything of that age needs a bit more attention, so such a repair will be highly scrutinized.' The mummified and embalmed face of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, pictured on display in a climate controlled case in his tomb at the Valley of the Kings . Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh who ruled from 1332BC - 1323BC after taking the throne at the age of nine or ten. The son of Akhenaten, when he became king, he married his half-sister, Ankhesenpaaten. However, his reign was short-lived; he died at the age of 19 and is believed to have suffered from scoliosis, a condition which means the spine is curved. He remains one of the best known pharaohs and there has been widespread research about his life and health following the discovery of his tomb. In 1907, Lord Carnarvon George Herbert asked English archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter to supervise excavations in the Valley of the Kings. On 4 November 1922, Carter's group found steps that led to Tutankhamun's tomb, which would eventually lead to what was the most complete ancient Egyptian tomb ever discovered. He spent several months cataloguing the antechamber before opening the burial chamber and discovering the sarcophagus in February the following year.","The braided gold beard on Tutankhamun has been permanently damaged .

"Charged: Christopher Phillips is the man Canadian police arrested this morning in connection to a chemical threat in Nova Scotia . The ex-husband of decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller has been charged over an investigation into hazardous chemicals in Nova Scotia. Police allege Christopher Burton Phillips, 42, possessed a chemical called osmium tetroxide for a dangerous purpose. The discovery of hazardous chemicals prompted the evacuation of two neighborhoods in Halifax this week and an Ottawa hotel where Phillips was arrested. Royal Canadian Mounted Police refused to identify the suspect who was apprehended at a hotel in Ottawa on Wednesday. However Miller's business manager confirmed the wanted man was her ex-husband Christopher Phillips, an American former biochemical weapons expert. Phillips has been charged with uttering threats against police and possessing a dangerous chemical, police announced Thursday. The hunt for Phillips began Tuesday after police found large quantities of dangerous chemicals at two Nova Scotia homes connected to his family. His current wife warned police that he was on his way to Ottawa, about a 14 hour drive west, in a van that could possibly be packed with even more hazardous materials. A Canada-wide alert issued Tuesday night stated that the suspect was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues. After Phillips' van was spotted in the parking lot of an Ottawa hotel Tuesday night, the building was evacuated and he was arrested without incident the following morning. A subsequent search found no chemicals at the hotel or in his van. Court documents allege the offenses took place between Dec. 26 and Jan. 21 in a Halifax suburb. Police did not elaborate on the charges. Happier times: U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller and ex-husband Christopher Phillips are pictured on their wedding day in June 1999. Phillips has been charged with threatening police and possession of dangerous chemicals . Dangerous: An arrest warrant was issued for Phillips Wednesday morning after hazardous materials were found at two properties connected to his family in  Nova Scotia, and his wife called police to inform them that he was travelling to Ottawa. Above, a member of the RCMP  explosive disposal unit prepares to enter a residence in Cole Harbour, a Halifax suburb, on Tuesday . Stockpiles: The above cottage in Grand Desert is one of  two homes where authorities found hazarous chemicals. Firefighters and other emergency personnel seen gathered around the building on Wednesday. Authorities would not say what type of chemical was found inside, or how much . Arrested: Phillips was tracked down to a hotel in Ottawa on Tuesday night, and he surrendered to poice without incident the following morning - his 42nd birthday. Ambulances and police are shown at the scene on Wednesday . Phillips, a former ophthalmologist, married U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller in June 1999, three years after she won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics. However, they separated in 2004 and officially divorced in 2006 and Phillips later moved to Canada. 'I'm thankful that the brave men and women of the Ottawa police department and other law enforcement agencies were able to apprehend him and (defuse) the situation without incident,' Miller said in a statement released by her manager, Nick Furris. Miller now works as a motivational speaker. Decorated athlete: Phillips and Miller have been divorced since 2006. Miller pictured on the left accepting her gold medal at the 1995 Pan American Games in Argentina. On the right, at an event in New York City leading up to the London Olympics in 2012 . Champion: Miller won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics. Pictured above practicing her floor exercises at the games . Police in Nova Scotia were first alerted to a possible threat Monday night around 9:20pm when they received a call about a suspicious package at a local home. They went on to investigate three homes connected to Phillips in two neighborhoods which were evacuated over the dangerous materials thought to be inside. Of the three buildings searched Tuesday, 'hazardous and volatile' materials were found in two - one home on Lakeridge Crescent owned by Phillips' current wife Gosia Phillips and a cottage on Dyke Road registered to a Marian Sue Phillips of El Reno, Oklahoma. It's unclear the relationship between Marian and the suspect. 'The chemicals are of a nature that we need to employ a chemist to help us identify what type of chemicals that they are,' RCMP Corporal Greg Churcd said of the materials found in the cottage. Police would not elaborate on how many chemicals were found, or what type. However, residents in  the Grand Desert neighborhood of the Dyke Road cottage remained evacuated Wednesday evening. Suiting up: A member of  the RCMP explosive disposal unit prepares to enter a residence in Cole Harbour, a Halifax suburb, on Tuesday. Police evacuated homes within 100 meters of the house after finding a suspicious package . Family connections: Another home registered to Phillips' wife Gosia on Lakeridge Road was found with chemicals as well. Above, the cottage on Dyke Road where 'large quantities' of chemicals were found and a mass evacuation was issued . Leaving: Residents in Cole Harbour flee their homes with a few belongings on Tuesday after reports of a suspicious package at a local home . Do not disturb: Those staying at the Chimo Hotel (pictured above) were told to quietly leave their rooms Tuesday night after it was suspected Phillips might have brought chemicals into the building. No hazardous materials were found, but police were able to apprehend Phillips staying in one of the rooms . Gosia Phillips allegedly told police that her husband was en route to Ottawa in a Chevy cube van, that was feared to be packed with even more dangerous chemicals. Police issued a Canada-wide alert for the van Tuesday night, saying the suspect driver was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues and an 'anti-police' attitude. 'Person reported to have mental health issues/PTSD and has issues with law enforcement personnel. Person may have chemicals or hazardous materials in the vehicle,' the report read. It was later revealed that police believed Phillips was carrying the chemicals osmium and osmium tetroxide in his van. The lab chemicals are highly dangerous and can easily penetrate the skin. About a decade ago, the chemicals were feared as a possible terrorist weapon. Around 10pm, an Ottawa police officer spotted a van matching the description in the parking lot of the Chimo Hotel. All of the guests were called and told to quietly evacuate so police could search the building for chemicals and the suspect. Authorities also closed down several roads surrounding the hotel as a precaution. Phillips was apprehended the following morning - his 42nd birthday - without incident from a room on the sixth floor of the hotel. Police finished searching the building and Phillips' van later that afternoon without finding any chemicals. Phillips LinkedIn page shows a diverse academic background with advanced degrees in medicine, law and business. Re-married: Phillips pictured above in a picture posted to Facebook. He is reportedly married to Harvard University-educated a sleep doctor named Gosia Phillips . He studied medicine at the University of Oklahoma and Boston University before pursuing opthamology at the University of Texas. He also has a law degree and MBA from Suffolk University. It has been reported that Phillips was a former biomedical weapons expert for the U.S. Army. However, the U.S. military says they have no record of Phillips, though the records only date back to 1999. His LinkedIn page lists his current job as the manager of Neurology and Sleep Medicine Associates Inc, which was searched Tuesday and found to contain no hazardous materials. His wife Gosia Phillips is equally accomplished. She attended Harvard University and is a specialist in sleep medicine, in addition to teaching medicine at Dalhousie University. Records show that Gosia Phillips changed her name from Malgorzata Ewa Klonowska in February 2010. Before he moved to Canada and married Gosia, Phillips' career appears to have been plagued by complaints of botched surgeries. The Washington State Health Department investigated Phillips over several complaints from former patients at his laser eye care clinic and he eventually agreed not to renew his expired license to practice. And in 2008, Phillips reportedly stopped going to work because of psychiatric issues. According to a documents obtained by the Ottawa Citizen, Phillips was hospitalized between March 3 and March 7, 2008 and March 22 and April 18, 2008 for an unknown psychiatric diagnosis. 'The records from this hospitalization contain diagnoses which would make it very difficult or impossible for (Phillips) to obtain employment as an expert witness,' the documents state. Nova Scotia court records also show that Phillips was charged for uttering threats and possession of a weapon between December 26 and Wednesday.","The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Christopher Phillips, 42, Wednesday morning .

Silver, one of the most powerful politicians in the state, was taken into custody around 8am on Thursday and was later charged at Manhattan federal court with taking $4million in bribes disguised as legal fees. He was  released on $200,000 bail. The 70-year-old Democrat was arrested by the FBI on federal conspiracy and bribery charges that carry up to 100 years in prison and could cost him his political seat.

Arrested and charged: Silver, pictured leaving a Manhattan court today, was arrested on bribery and corruption charges on Thursday morning after a long-term investigation by the FBI . 'I'm confident that after a full hearing and due process I'll be vindicated on the charges,' said Silver, who seemed unfazed in court, even pausing on his way out to sign a sketch artist's rendering of the scene. He did not enter a plea. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Silver — a lawyer by training — lined up jobs at two firms and then accepted large sums of money in exchange for using his 'titanic' power to do political favors. A lot of the money was disguised as 'referral fees,' Bharara said. Along with the Senate majority leader and the governor, he plays a major role in creating state budgets, laws and policies in a system long criticized in Albany as 'three men in a room.' He controls, for example, which lawmakers sit on which committees and decides whether a bill gets a vote. In a measure of his clout, he helped persuade Cuomo last spring to disband a state anti-corruption commission that was investigating Silver's financial dealings and those of his colleagues. Silver had fought the commission's subpoenas and refused to provide information about his outside legal work. facing the public: Speaker of the New York State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, walks out of a New York court house after being arrested on federal corruption charges . Opening the door: Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York State Assembly, leaves federal court after a hearing following his arrest earlier in New York and may face years behind bars . Leaving court: The 70-year-old Democrat Sheldon Silver, pictured leaving court, was arrested by the FBI on federal conspiracy and bribery charges that carry up to 100 years in prison . On his way: New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is surrounded by photographers trying to get up close as he leaves a federal courthouse in New York on Thursday . Despite his outsized influence, he is pretty much an unknown outside New York State. Even in Albany, he is one of the most private and least-understood figures, sometimes called 'the Sphinx.' Newsday reported the charges stem from an alleged $4million worth of bribes which were handed to Silver over a period of years. The paper cited the five-count criminal complaint which accuses Silver of taking more than $3million from a personal injury law firm for referrals from a doctor he gave state contracts. He is also accused of earning $700,000 from a real estate law firm which got work from developers he favored. 'Silver used the power and influence of his official position to obtain for himself millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks masked as legitimate income earned by Silver as private lawyer,' says the complaint. Silver said he hoped he would be 'vindicated' before entering court and his lawyers said they were 'disappointed' with the 'meritless criminal charges'. They also said the politician expects to be fully exonerated. Arrested: Sheldon Silver was taken into custody around 8am Thursday, he was later charged at Manhattan Federal Court . Undeclared: A source said the payments in question were substantial and made over several years and Silver failed to list them on his annual financial disclosure filings . The arrest comes just a day after Silver shared the stage with Gov. Andrew Cuomo during his State of the State address . Silver is a longtime speaker of the New York State Assembly (pictured) in Albany . Selected as Assembly speaker in 1994, Silver ranks as the top Democrat in the state Legislature and wields enormous political clout as one of Albany's three principal dealmakers - along with the governor and Senate majority leader - on fiscal matters and major legislation. He also has long been criticized for his continued employment in one of the state's larger private law practices, which some have said poses a conflict with legislation that would be of interest to his firm, such as medical malpractice or tort reform. The reported charges pending against Silver would mark the latest case to involve allegations of wrongdoing by state lawmakers in Albany, where at least 30 politicians have faced legal or ethics problems since 2000. Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat sworn into his second term earlier this month, created an independent anti-corruption commission in 2013 but shut it down this year, prompting an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York who are looking into the panel's unfinished cases.","Sheldon Silver left the courtroom today seemingly 'unfazed' and even signed a court sketch on his way out .

"In court: Rihanna has won a two-year multi-million pound legal battle with Topshop who unlawfully used her image on a popular T-shirt . Rihanna has won a two-year multi-million pound legal battle with Topshop after they unlawfully used her image on a popular T-shirt sold to thousands of fans. The pop star sued Topshop's parent company Arcadia for £3.3million ($5.5million) over the clothing, which featured a photo taken during a video shoot for her hit 'We Found Love' in 2011. In 2013 her legal team successfully argued her fans, who saw her as a fashion icon, would have falsely thought she had endorsed the garment sold by the high street fashion store. In their first legal skirmish the courts banned the store selling a Rihanna 'tank' sleeveless T-shirt without her permission  - but the fashion chain then tried to overturn the initial ruling. Today the Court of Appeal upheld the ban agreeing that marketing the clothing  without the 26-year-old singer's approval amounts to 'passing off,' a term used to enforce unregistered trademark rights. It also found the image was similar to the one used on her 2011 Talk that Talk album and fans could be misled. The legal battle threat came despite the What's My Name singer having dined with Sir Philip and music mogul Simon Cowell while on her Christmas break to Barbados in 2010. The star, who in 2012  signed a deal worth a rumoured £800,000 to design a range with High Street rival River Island, tweeted about the Boxing Day meal they had together, saying: 'Just had dinner w/ Simon Cowell Philip Green @ Sandy Lane! Great night!' She has also spent time with Sir Philip's daughter Chloe while holidaying at the same time in the Caribbean two years ago. Today Lord Justice David Kitchin said: 'People could be deceived into buying the t-shirt perhaps believing it was authorised by Rihanna. 'Topshop sold the t-shirt without Rihanna's approval and this amounted to passing off.' In the appeal, heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in November last year, Topshop lawyer Geoffrey Hobbs QC, who was trying to overturn the previous ruling, argued there was a tradition of merchandising star images over the decades, including those of Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and Prince. However, Rihanna's legal team said the image was from an unauthorised photograph taken while she was filming a music video in Northern Ireland and Topshop should be banned from exploiting it. It was this view that was endorsed by today's judgement. Row: Rihanna and Topshop owner Sir Philip Green are good friends, left, but his business has fought to use the picture taken during a music video, right, on its clothing but has failed at the High Court today . Chat: Sir Philip's daughter Chloe sits with Rihanna on Barbados over Christmas 2011 . Lord Justice Kitcin added: 'In the present case I am entirely satisfied that the judge did have a proper regard to the distinction between endorsement and general character merchandising. 'The judge considered the use of this image would in all the circumstances of the case, indicate that the t-shirt had been authorised and approved by Rihanna, many of her fans regard her endorsement as important for she is their style icon, and would buy the t-shirt thinking she had approved an authorised it. 'In short the judge found that the sale of the t-shirt bearing this image amounted to a representation that Rihanna had endorsed it. In my judgement the reasoning of the judge discloses no error of principle.' He added though Rihanna knew she had no right in English law to prevent any use of her image, this did not rule out the judge finding Topshop had been guilty of 'misrepresentation'. He added: 'The vice in the impugned activities lay not in the use of Rihanna's image but in using it in such a way as to cause misrepresentation. 'Topshop is in effect contending not for the image right but rather for a positive right to market goods bearing an image even if the use of that image in particular circumstances to particular customers gives rise to a misrepresentation. 'To accede to that submission would be to sanction a trade which results in in the deception of the public.' Demands: Rihanna  instructed a British law firm to deal with the case with Topshop on her behalf, as she says they should pay to use her image - and judges agree . He added the judge was right to find Topshop was 'recognizing and seeking to take advantage' of Rihanna's public perception as a style icon. Lord Justice Kitchin also added the judge was right to find the 'striking' with Rihanna posing facing the camera with her hair up in a scarf looked similar to images from the recent Talk that Talk album. He said this meant there was a danger it could be taken to be an 'authorised' publicity shot from the single, which it was not. A legal expert has said today's ruling should be a warning to businesses who use celebrities images without their permission, as it will allow others to bring similar cases to court. Mike Gardner, a partner and head of intellectual property at Wedlake Bell, said: 'Rihanna was forced to rely on the English common law right of passing off because in the UK, unlike certain other countries, there is no 'image rights' law to help celebrities to control the commercial use of their image. 'This ruling, in what was seen as a finely balanced case, may encourage other celebrities to make similar claims in the future. 'Retailers will have to be extra careful in how they sell items bearing celebrity images. 'They will need to learn lessons from what happened with Topshop. 'Anything that is seen as wrongly suggesting an official tie-up or endorsement by the celebrity could lead to legal action.'","Rihanna was in £3m battle with Topshop over image on T-shirt since 2012 .

"Falling sperm counts could be caused by traces of the contraceptive pill in drinking water, a new study has claimed. U.S. scientists say the sex hormone oestradiol - the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants - has an even larger effect on sperm than Bisphenol A or BPA, as it is widely known. BPA is found in some plastics used to make food containers, bottles and coatings in tin cans, and is also commonly used in thermal paper in cash register receipts. Scroll down for video . Decline: Falling sperm counts could be caused by traces of the contraceptive pill in drinking water, scientists in Washington have claimed . But researchers claim BPA can disrupt hormones, raising the risk of a wide number of health problems such as diabetes, obesity and cancer. The chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in Europe because of safety fears. But the transparent resin is still used to line most plastic and tin food packaging - despite the calls for an all-out ban by campaigners. The UK Food Standards Agency says strict regulations mean that the health risk from food packaging is minimal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPA from baby bottles in 2012, but said there was not enough evidence for a wider ban and has found the chemical safe at low levels. However in the new study, Washington State University geneticists found a direct link between BPA and disrupted sperm production. Writing in the journal PLOS Genetics, they say the chemical disrupts the delicate DNA interactions needed to create sperm. In addition to the BPA effects, principle investigator Dr Pat Hunt saw an even larger effect on sperm by oestradiol, the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants. She believes she and her team may have unearthed the reason why numerous studies have revealed sperm counts are falling. The issue has been a subject of concern and since the early 1990s, when Danish researchers reported 'a genuine decline in semen quality over the past 50 years,' with possible implications for male fertility. Trail: The researchers saw an even larger effect on sperm by oestradiol, the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants . Two years ago, a large Spanish study warned that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame. Researchers from the University of Murcia found that even in young men, sperm concentration fell by an average of two per cent a year - and could soon hit levels where fertility is compromised. Dr Hunt, author of the new study, has a long history of working with BPA, which is often found in plastic bottles, the linings of food and beverage cans, and thermal receipts. Much of her work has documented its effect on female reproduction, from mice to monkeys. She argues the study also bolsters the hypothesis that 'oestrogen' disruptors in the environment are at play. 'This provides some real insight into what exactly might be going on,' Hunt says. 'It's kind of bizarre because we got into it through a back door, not really starting out to look at that question.' In the new study, Dr Hunt and her colleagues gave newborn male mice oral doses of BPA. They also exposed mice to the synthetic oestrogen ethinyl oestradiol. The researchers exposed the developing testis and saw that the sperm of exposed animals did a poorer job of meiosis, the process in which cells combine the genetic information of their parents. As a result, more sperm died. Worrying: Two years ago, a large Spanish study warned that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame . Dr Hunt said: 'We have a window of just a few days and we permanently change the way that the testis makes sperm in the adult.' The study looked at three mice population: one outbred like humans and two other, very common strains that are inbred. Researchers saw a 'very strong effect' on outbred mice and one inbred strain and no effect on the other inbred strain. This would account for earlier researchers not seeing an effect on testes in earlier studies. Dr Hunt said: 'This mouse model would suggest that here's actually a reason why these sperm counts would be falling. 'We're actually doing something to this process that's going to cause the death of more cells as they're trying to make sperm. 'They're going to get culled out by this quality-control mechanism and the upshot of that will be that if you do enough of this, you'll drop sperm counts. 'We've seen effects over the course of several decades. What about several generations? Infertility is becoming more common. Are we creating the perfect storm? BPA is also commonly used in thermal paper in cash register receipts . Just yesterday, Europe's food safety watchdog EFSA - the European Food Safety Authority - said BPA poses 'no health risk to consumers of any age, including unborn children, at current levels of exposure'. The chemical, which is used to stiffen some plastic food containers, poses no health risk to consumers of any age, including unborn children, at current levels of exposure, the agency said. Some studies have suggested possible links to everything from cancer to heart disease to infertility to kidney and liver problems, prompting European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to re-evaluate the potential risks of BPA. The EFSA acknowledged in its assessment that BPA residues could migrate into foods and drinks and be ingested by consumers, and that BPA from thermal paper, cosmetics and dust could be either inhaled or absorbed through the skin. But it found that exposure to BPA was 'considerably under' the safe level known as the 'tolerable daily intake', or TDI. It said that after weighing up 'a significant body of new scientific information on its toxic effects', EFSA's expert panel concluded that high doses of BPA -- hundreds of times above the TDI -- were likely to adversely affect the kidney and liver, and might also cause effects animals' mammary glands. But at current levels -- which it said were often three to five times lower than the TDI of 4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day -- it found 'no consumer health risk from bisphenol A exposure'.","Sex hormone oestradiol - the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants - has larger effect on sperm than Bisphenol A .

"A man's threatening tirade on board a Sydney-bound Virgin flight which forced the plane to turn back to Perth has cost him almost $60,000. But the embarrassing debacle on July 9 doesn't seem to have bothered Brenden James Tume too much as he has posted a TV news report about his antics as the cover photo on his Facebook profile like a badge of honour. The 23-year-old father of two appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday, pleading guilty to two offences related to his aggressive outburst, while under the influence of alcohol and cannabis, which has cost him $48,500 in reparations for the distressing disruption and a $10,000 fine. Brenden James Tume posted the TV news report about his antics as the cover photo on his Facebook profile like a badge of honour . The plane left Perth at 5pm on July 9 but returned two hours later when Tume woke up during the flight and became abusive towards crew members. 'Stop talking s*** about me,' he repeatedly said to the flight staff. 'You have got my f***ing wallet.' The court heard Tume shook his fists and threw magazines around with children seated nearby. He then went on to threaten staff saying: 'I will get you. I will cause a stir and bring this plane down.' The court heard Virgin suffered a significant financial loss for fuel and to accommodate passengers for the night because a curfew prevented it from arranging another plane.

"Seyi and Robert are just like any other parents. They raise two young sons, go to weddings together and give each other parenting advice. However, there's a catch; because Robert is gay. The pair, like a rising number of people, are co-parents. Co-parents are two people who want children but may not have found The One or aren't able to have offspring themselves. Seyi Joseph, 38, was desperate to be a mother while she was young but hadn't found Mr Right so she decided to  became a co-parent with a gay man. Here, she is pictured with their first son Alexander, now 6 . Indeed, Seyi Joseph was desperate to be a mother while she was young but hadn't found Mr Right so she decided to do things her own way. Seyi, 38, who was born in London, but grew up in Bradford and  Nigeria, made the decision to co-parent with Robert, who also wanted children. Speaking to FEMAIL about her decision, Seyi said: 'I had always known I wanted to be a mum. Naturally growing up I expected to meet Mr Right, fall in love and build a family with him, unfortunately I don’t have much luck when it comes to men.' When she was 26, the former secondary school teacher tried online dating and introduction agencies. 'I realised I’d rather be a mum with no husband than wait for Mr Right and leave it too late to have children,' she said. Seyi met Robert - a homosexual man who wanted to be a father - on a donor site. She felt that Robert, pictured with their second son, Elias, shared her values  and be involved in their children's lives . 'I applied for adoption in 2003. After a year of intense scrutiny I was turned down on account of being too young, too single and likely to get into a relationship; that’s when I decided to use a donor to conceive. 'Whilst I was trying to adopt I had read quite a lot about donor children, their feelings and experiences, about how not knowing their biological background affects their sense of identity. 'This - in addition to my African background - makes it a big deal for me that a child have as much information as possible about their biological background and know their biological parents if at all possible.' Seyi believes that artificial insemination works just as well as natural insemination. Seyi gave birth to a Alex, pictured, now six. They also welcomed Elias, now two, and both sons are the light of their lives . Seyi then met 47-year-old Robert - a homosexual man who wanted to be a father - on a donor site. She explained: 'I had been in touch with quite a number of possible donors but hadn’t found someone who shared my values and who was happy to have his identity known or be involved in our children’s lives. 'I was at the point of giving up when I contacted Robert; we both have a similar outlook to life and similar views on parenting. I was working overseas at the time so we had time to get to know each other properly via email for almost a year before eventually meeting up.' They opted for artificial insemination - a treatment for infertility, when a couple cannot conceive a baby that involves directly inserting sperm into a woman's womb. Seyi believes that artificial insemination (AI) works just as well as natural insemination (NI). Seyi gave birth to a Alex, now six. They also welcomed Elias, now two, and both sons are the light of their lives. The pair attend family functions together; Robert was at her brother's wedding last year, and is named on both sons' birth certificates . 'Robert and I are great friends, so much so this is the longest relationship I’ve had with a man who is not a relative!,' she said. 'Our boys stay with me as we both agree we’d rather they had a stable base. Robert sees the boys at least every other week and speaks to them on the phone at least once a week. Whenever possible we do things together as a family such as going to a farm, or fair or live shows. 'We also attend family functions together; Robert was at my brother’s wedding last year for instance. Robert is named on both their birth certificates and our children have both our surnames.' Seyi's experience spurred a business venture and she launched Feelingbroody.com - a website for men and women looking for donor or fellow co-parents. Speaking about her company, which charges a £150 registration fee and a further £395 for those seeking co-parents, she said: 'Feelingbroody.com is an introductions site for those seeking known sperm donors or co-parents. Unlike other sites we don’t have any profiles on our website and all members have to prove they are STI tested, provide proof of identity and agree to background checks. 'They also have to answer questions about their health and family. The aim  is not just to introduce a recipient to any donor but to the right donor, to ensure people are being safe and asking the right questions before doing something that will no doubt impact their lives and those of any resultant children.' Seyi used her experience to launch 'Feelingbroody.com - an introductions site for those seeking known sperm donors or co-parents . Seyi launched the site as a result of her experience trying to conceive as a single woman. After she was turned down for adoption, she turned to a fertility clinic and says there were quite a few things that didn’t sit well with her. 'All their donors were anonymous. As a black woman I could only receive donation from a black donor (and they only had two at the time). Plus, recipients were only given minimum information about their donors i.e. age, height, eye colour, hair colour, occupation and interests.' She continued: 'It was all so clinical, I had an IUI twice (think cervical smear), not best for relaxation or conception. On top of these it was expensive, almost £3,000 per cycle (£295 consultation, £295 tests, £1,600 (two vials at £800 per vial of semen) and £795 for the treatment itself. 'I also tried donor sites and many were not moderated or monitored so anyone could join. My main concerns with these was that you never truly know if people are who they say they are, also it seemed no one was keeping track of who was donating to who. 'There were requests for donors who were ""available this weekend"" or ""in the next two days"" - hardly any time to get to know each other or to get tested. 'Feelingbroody.com is not nearly as popular as other donor sites but we meet the needs of a certain group of people not currently being catered for by fertility clinics or donor sites.' Her clients are single women in their mid to late thirties, with good jobs, and lesbian couples who have been in a relationship for some time, as well as some single gay men in their 30s and older straight men in their 50s. 'Like me they all want to know who they are procreating with and be able to answer any questions their children may have in future,' added Seyi. While Seyi is still single and 'open to a relationship', now that she has the two sons she'd always dreamed of, if she doesn't meet anyone she says it 'wouldn’t bother her in the least'.","Seyi Joseph hadn't found the right man but wanted children .

"Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are making a third push to move his trial outside Massachusetts, citing a large number of prospective jurors who already believe he's guilty and the personal connections many have to the attack. Tsarnaev's lawyers renewed their bid for a change of venue on Thursday, the same day court officials announced that opening statements will not be heard as expected on Monday because jury selection is taking longer than anticipated. The defense cited the attitudes of prospective jurors in the case, saying of the 1,373 prospective jurors who filled out questionnaires, 68 percent already believe Tsarnaev is guilty and 69 percent have a self-identified 'connection' or expressed allegiance to the people, places and/or events in the case. Scroll down for video . Suspect:  The focus of the Boston Marathon bombing trial figures to be as much on what punishment Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (pictured)  could face as on his responsibility for the attack (file photo) 'Stronger support for a finding of presumed prejudice in Boston is difficult to imagine, and the existing record precludes a fair trial in Boston,' Tsarnaev's lawyers wrote in their motion. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz declined to comment on the defense request. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. rejected two earlier requests to move the trial, saying he believes a fair and impartial jury can be chosen in Massachusetts. Tsarnaev's lawyers urged the judge to stop individual questioning of jurors immediately, order the trial moved and hold a hearing to determine where it should be held. O'Toole did not immediately rule on the request and continued questioning prospective jurors. He did, however, lash out at the defense for publicly releasing excerpts of confidential juror questionnaires in its latest motion, calling it improper. In an order late Thursday afternoon, he wrote that 'great care' had been taken to protect the privacy of prospective jurors, and he instructed that the defense motion be sealed from public view. 'Why waste time on this guy you know he is guilty,' one prospective juror wrote. Another, when asked if there is anything the court should know, wrote, 'We all know he's guilty so quit wasting everybody's time with a jury and string him up.' Another wrote, 'For this case I think a public execution would be appropriate, preferable by bomb at the finish line of the marathon.' Another prospective juror mentioned close friends who work in the emergency room at Massachusetts General Hospital, which treated many of the people injured in the bombings. 'My friends still have nightmares of that day!' the potential juror wrote. The defense also listed prospective jurors and their close connections to the marathon or the bombing. Among them: an ER doctor who personally treated Tsarnaev and his brother after they were apprehended. On trial: Tsarnaev is accused of 30 crimes for allegedly working with his brother, Tamerlan, to plan and carry out the 2013 attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260 (Jan 15 courtroom sketch) Proceedings: In this January 5 courtroom sketch, Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, is depicted beside U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., right, as O'Toole addresses a pool of potential jurors . O'Toole had originally said he hoped to question 40 prospective jurors each day, but he only questioned a total of 61 people over four days. The process has been slowed as the judge has probed prospective jurors at length about whether they have already formed on opinion on Tsarnaev's guilt and about their feelings on the death penalty. Only jurors who express a willingness to consider both execution or life in prison as a punishment can be seated on the jury. During the first four days of questioning, many people have said they could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances. Many others have said they already believe Tsarnaev is guilty. A small group of people have said they can be impartial and can consider both life in prison and the death penalty. Massachusetts abolished its state death penalty three decades ago, and numerous attempts to reinstate it have failed in the state Legislature. Tsarnaev is being prosecuted under the federal death penalty statute. He is accused of 30 crimes - including 17 capital crimes - for allegedly working with his brother, Tamerlan, to plan and carry out the 2013 attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police days after the bombings. In announcing the delay Thursday, Ginny Hurley, the outreach coordinator for U.S. District Court in Boston, said jury selection is taking longer than anticipated 'in the interest of thoroughness.' Opening statements from prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers were originally scheduled for Monday, but Hurley said that date is now unrealistic. No new date has been set. The judge is hoping to get a pool of about 70 people. At that point, prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers will be able to eliminate prospective jurors for strategic reasons. A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be seated to hear the case.","Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are making a third push to move his trial outside Massachusetts .

"Duke University says it has suspended a fraternity while police investigate allegations a woman was sexually assaulted at an off-campus party. A statement from the university says Alpha Delta Phi has been suspended while Durham police investigate what happened at an off-campus house leased by fraternity members. Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez told WRAL-TV that his department is seeking information from anyone at the January 8 party. No charges had been filed as of Tuesday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Duke University says it has suspended a fraternity while police investigate allegations a woman was sexually assaulted at an off-campus party . Local media outlets obtained a search warrant that says the woman told police she had drinks at the party before waking the next day dressed in a T-shirt that didn't belong to her. She claims to have lost consciousness after drinking a hot chocolate. In the morning she is said to have received two text messages. The first simply said 'yo!', the second 'ha, ha, you went back with a kid I know... you're screwed', according to Jezebel.com. The warrant says that the last thing the woman remembers is dancing with friends. Investigators took a mattress, comforter and condom from the house. The private university in Durham, North Carolina, was founded by Methodists and Quakers. It has nearly 15,000 students, including about 6,500 undergraduates. In 2006 a woman falsely accused three Duke lacrosse players of raping her. Crystal Mangum claimed Duke lacrosse players Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans gang raped her at a team party where she was hired as a stripper. The three men were arrested but eventually declared innocent by North Carolina's attorney general after the evidence failed to back up Magnum's inconsistent story and her mental stability was called into question. Alpha Delta Phi has been suspended while Durham police investigate an alleged sexual assault at one of its off-campus parties . Magnum was found guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of her boyfriend in 2013. Last year eight college fraternities announced  an effort to work together on new training aimed at combating sexual misconduct, hazing and binge drinking. The focus is on learning to recognize, diagnose and intervene in potentially harmful situations. An estimated 35,000 undergraduates are anticipated to participate in the first year of the Fraternal Health and Safety Initiative consortium. The participating fraternities include Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Triangle — groups with a combined 75,000 undergraduate men at more than 550 college campuses. The consortium plans to use training that organizers say is based on research and created for retreat-like settings. 'If you think of the power of having all of these fraternities on a particular campus going through similar programming and similar messaging, it could definitely impact the culture on that campus fairly quickly,' said Marc Mores, executive vice president of the James R. Favor & Company, last September. The insurance company insures campus fraternities and organized the effort. At around the same time the White House started the 'It's On Us' campaign, which is focused on encouraging people to consider stopping sexual assault to be part of their personal responsibility and to intervene when they suspect a potential victim can't or won't consent. A White House task force on campus sexual assault, in a report issued  in 2014, said that one of the most promising prevention strategies is bystander prevention. Within higher education, there has been growing pressure to curb sexual assault and better protect victims.

The three-year-old figured out how to unfasten his and an assistant is meant to be on the bus and assist in that case, Rouse explained to KMGH. Griffin told the news outlet 'Instead, what they had been doing to him was tying him down on the bus with ropes and putting belts onto the thing because he comes out of the harness.

"A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that 'consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings' Hitting the shops after heartbreak or not getting a promotion does not make you happy and even backfires by making you think more about your failures, a new study warned . Retail therapy is thought to make you feel better when you treat yourself to that luxury watch or bag that you have always coveted when faced with a disappointment. But in fact you are more likely to dwell on your problems than others. Researchers found consumers who buy luxury products after a personal failure are simply masking the issue rather than recovering. The study by Monika Lisjak of the Erasmus University, Andrea Bonezzi of New York University, Soo Kim of Cornell University, and Derek Rucker of Northwestern University showed shoppers who buy to boost their self-worth could actually feel worse. They said: “When consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves, buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings. “This can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self-control.” The study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it. Results showed that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term. The researchers concluded: “Consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures, but this doesn’t always work. “Consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self-control is impaired. “After experiencing a setback in one area of their life, consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life. “For example, a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self-worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence.” The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

Mr Johnson said there was a 'mutual interest' in the 'security and prosperity' of Kurdistan and Iraq as a whole. British military personnel in Kurdistan are training the region's Peshmerga forces, who have been involved in some of the heaviest fighting against ISIS. A source said: 'He wants to see first hand the work being done to keep ISIS at bay, the same ISIS that wants to send back terrorists who would blow themselves up in London given half a chance.' The main focus of Mr Johnson's visit, made at the invitation of Kurdish prime minister Nechirvan Barzani,  has been to boost trade links with the Kurdistan region. Mr Johnson said: 'Over the last decade Kurdistan region has seen considerable economic growth and social development, and I'm here to mark London's role as an active ally in this.'

The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said the Kurdistan region in Iraq was a 'beacon of tolerance and moderation' in a part of the world beset by extremism and instability. But while the regional government in Irbil was anxious to develop links with the UK, the committee warned that the current level of diplomatic resources committed to the region was 'not adequate'. The Mayor's visit to Kurdistan follows reports that he 'caved in' and paid up a U.S. tax bill for several thousand dollars. Mr Johnson is born in the U.S. and has dual citizenship and as an overseas American he is obligated to pay income tax. American citizens must pay income tax to US authorities if they earn more than £62,000.

"The Alaska Court of Appeals has overturned the murder conviction of man charged with killing his romantic rival at the urging of the woman they both hoped to marry because of an 'improperly introduced' letter from the victim found following his death. The court on Wednesday reversed the murder conviction for John Carlin III, who was convicted in 2006 of killing Kent Leppink on an isolated trail about in a small community south of Anchorage 10 years earlier. Carlin was beaten to death in prison in 2008 shortly after he arrived at the state facility in Seward to serve a 99-year sentence. The case went unsolved until Alaska State Troopers reopened it in 2004. Overturned: The court on Wednesday reversed the murder conviction for John Carlin III (left), who was convicted in 2006 of killing Kent Leppink (right) on an isolated trail about 10 years earlier . Prosecutors had claimed he was coaxed into killing Leppink by the woman at the center of the romantic triangle, Mechele Linehan, an exotic dancer who lived with the two men in Anchorage. Prosecutors maintained she was inspired by the 1994 movie, 'The Last Seduction,' in which a femme fatale coaxes her lover into killing her husband for money. But just as the court did when overturning Linehan's conviction in 2010, the court ruled the state improperly introduced a letter from the grave during the Carlin's trial. Before his death, Leppink wrote his parents saying that if he died under unusual circumstances, Carlin and Linehan would likely be responsible. The motive:  Prosecutors had claimed Carlin was coaxed into killing Leppink by the woman at the center of the romantic triangle, Mechele Linehan, an exotic dancer who lived with the two men in Anchorage . Hollywood influence: Prosecutors maintained Linehan was inspired by the 1994 movie, 'The Last Seduction,' in which a femme fatale coaxes her lover into killing her husband for money . 'We conclude that it was improper for the trial court to allow the state to introduce this letter, and we further conclude that the introduction of this evidence appreciably affected the jury's verdict,' the court opinion says. A message left after hours by The Associated Press with the state attorney general's office was not immediately answered. 'We are disappointed in the result,' Alaska Department of Law spokesman Ken Rosenstein said. KTUU-TV first reported the appeals court decision. Carlin's estate filed the appeal. Attempts to reach their attorneys weren't immediately successful Wednesday evening.

"A private school in Nashville has turned down two prospective students because their parents are gay, telling the parents 'we strongly believe in a strict interpretation of the Scriptures regarding the institution of marriage'. Brian Copeland and Greg Bullard are married and have two children — a son who is about to enter pre-kindergarten and a daughter who is 8 months old. The couple had scheduled a visit to Davidson Academy after receiving a recommendation from a friend, but were shocked on January 14 when they received a letter informing them that their visit was cancelled after the school learned that their children were being raised by two gay men. Brian Copeland, left, and Greg Bullard, who are married with two children, received a letter from Davidson Academy in Nashville informing them they wouldn't accept their son because of they are homosexuals . In a letter addressed to Copeland, a real estate agent, the school wrote that homosexuality goes against the school's admission policy as stated in their handbook. 'I believe another education provider would be a better fit for your children. Therefore, we cannot grant admission to your children,' read the letter. Copeland posted the letter on Facebook but redacted the name of the school, however The Tennessean has confirmed that the school is Davidson Academy. On its website Davidson Academy describes itself as an 'interdenominational, college-preparatory school serving students age three through 12th grade'. Copeland wrote on Facebook that he had shared the letter to 'let my friends know that discrimination affects people you know and love and still hurts no matter how many times you go through it. 'We chose this school because of its rigorous faith-based K-12 academics and extracurricular activities; and, a friend with a son there asked them if a family like ours would be allowed and was told yes. Copeland and Bullard, who is a pastor, officially married in California in 2013 after holding a ceremony in Nashville in 2006. They have raised both children since their births . 'After a phone conversation, fully disclosing we are a two-dad family, an appointment was set for us. I receive this letter canceling our appointment without even getting a chance.' Copeland and Bullard, who is a pastor, officially married in California in 2013 after holding a ceremony in Nashville in 2006. They have raised both children since their births. In the letter sent to Copeland by Davidson Academy officials, they wrote that the school was founded by Christians and operates in the Christian tradition based on 'clear tenets of faith and practice.' The letter also made reference to the school's admissions policy as outlined in its handbook, which requires all students, parents, guardians, teachers and administrators and staff to 'manifest lifestyle conduct and actions which project an image consistent with the expressed purposes, missions and beliefs of the school.' One example of this, the policy says, is homosexuality. The couple don't intend to take legal action against the school and are currently looking at alternatives . 'Davidson Academy has the right and responsibility to do everything possible to ensure that its expressed purposes, mission, and beliefs continue in their highest traditions and are not harmed, compromised, or hindered by unacceptable lifestyle conduct on the part of its students, parents or guardians ...' the policy reads. Copeland told The Tennessean that he and Bullard's goal is 'not to harm the school' but to show that 'discrimination and inequality is alive and well.' He also stressed that he and his husband are not victims. 'I want to make that very clear,' Copeland said. 'We want our children to have a Christian education, and we're finding that very, very hard.' The couple don't intend to take legal action against the school and are currently looking at alternatives. 'We want the best for our kids, and THEY deserve to be given a chance,' wrote Copeland.

"Ed Miliband yesterday dismissed claims he delayed the inquiry into the Iraq War 'again and again' by voting against it being set up. David Cameron said the report would have been published 'years ago' had it not been for Labour MPs blocking the plans – with Mr Miliband himself voting against an inquiry on four occasions. The Labour leader hit back saying he wanted the report published as soon as possible – and claiming his anti-war stance was 'well known'. But that is not how his brother David Miliband and the shadow chancellor Ed Balls remember it. Former foreign secretary David told his brother he could not credibly claim to be against the Iraq war because he never made his views known at the time. Mr Balls went even further – dismissing the claim that the Labour leader was against the war as 'ridiculous'. Former foreign secretary David Miliband (left) told his brother Ed (right) he could not credibly claim to be against the Iraq war because he never made his views known at the time . The allegations were made during a heated Labour leadership hustings in 2010, when Mr Miliband was trashing Labour's foreign policy record to distance himself from his brother in the race to succeed Gordon Brown. In a two-hour debate hosted on Radio 5, Mr Balls said: 'I do not think Ed or any of the rest of us can claim with any credibility that in 2003 we thought the war was wrong but we just forgot to tell anyone, because that would make us look ridiculous.' Mr Miliband insisted he opposed the war at the time of the invasion in 2003 but was living in the US, so his views were not known in the UK. But David Miliband said: 'Diane Abbott is the only candidate that can say she was against the war at the time, and if that is the sole criterion, she is in a different position to every other candidate. She did not just think she was against it, she said she was against it, and she marched against it.' Ed Miliband insisted on his opposition: 'I did tell people at the time that asked me that I was against the war.' But Mr Balls said under his breath 'you did not tell people' and pointed out that in 2005, when the Times newspaper asked Labour figures whether they would have voted for the war, Ed did not answer the question. David Miliband (right), Ed Miliband (second right) and Ed Balls (left) went up against each other to win the Labour leadership . Ed Miliband yesterday insisted that his views on the Iraq War were 'well known' - but Mr Balls has previously insisted that was not the case . The remarks undermine Mr Miliband's claim during yesterday's Prime Minister's Questions that he opposed the Iraq War from the beginning. Despite the row dominating news bulletins all day, Mr Miliband skated over the issue at Prime Minister's Questions – dismissing it in two sentences. The Labour leader did not even ask Mr Cameron about the issue, saying only that he agreed the report should be 'published as soon as possible'. Labour MPs opposed a series of proposals for an inquiry in the Commons until one was ordered by Gordon Brown. Mr Miliband personally voted against starting an inquiry on four occasions as an MP, first in October 2006, then in June 2007, once more in March 2008 and again in March 2009. Several former senior Labour figures, including Mr Miliband's brother David, will come under scrutiny when the report is finally published. At the start of Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Miliband said: 'Let me start by saying, on the Iraq inquiry, that it was set up six years ago and I agree with the Prime Minister that it should be published as soon as possible.' He then moved swiftly on to the economy. The PM countered, saying the report would have been published 'years ago' had Labour MPs voted in favour of setting up the inquiry earlier. 'So perhaps he could start by recognising his own regret at voting against the establishment of the inquiry,' he said. Mr Miliband was at a business reception  at Titanic Belfast in Belfast, Northern Ireland today . David Cameron was in Edinburgh today - his first visit to Scotland today  since the independence referendum last September . Mr Miliband replied: 'The inquiry was established six years ago, after our combat operations had ended, and frankly, my views on the Iraq war are well known and I want this inquiry to be published.' Unlike his brother, Ed Miliband was not an MP in 2003 in the run-up to the war. At the time he was at Harvard University in the US. During his campaign for the Labour leadership he said the invasion was a 'profound mistake' and claimed to have opposed it in private. But according to reports, his brother dismissed this claim, saying that the only candidate for the leadership who could say they were against the war at the time was Diane Abbott.","Ed Miliband yesterday dismissed claims he delayed the  Iraq War inquiry .

"A teacher who appeared in the TV documentary Educating Yorkshire has been banned from the classroom after having sex with two former pupils. Neil Giffin, 35, began a relationship with an 18-year-old girl following his school’s end of term ball, which continued after she went to university. The fling ended when Giffin ‘rekindled a relationship’ with another ex-pupil of the same school, whom he met on a night out. Scroll down for video . Neil Giffin, 35, has been banned from the classroom for life after admitting to having sex with two pupils of Bishop Heber High School, Cheshire, after they had graduated . The secondary school teacher also used fake names to send messages to three other former pupils on social media, a professional conduct panel heard. His ‘inappropriate’ contact with one 17-year-old girl was deemed to be ‘sexually motivated’ and included chats about cross-dressing. He told the vulnerable teenager about a sexual fantasy which involved her ‘on top of him’ in school uniform. All the girls he targeted were pupils or ex-pupils of Bishop Heber High School in Cheshire, where he taught history before moving in 2012 to Thornhill Community Academy near Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, which was featured in the award-winning Channel 4 series. An investigation was launched in January last year after a report that Giffin was communicating in an inappropriate way with the 17-year-old, named only as Pupil A, from his former school. He was suspended from his job as head of humanities at Thornhill and resigned three months later. Giffin also admitted sending sexual messages to a vulnerable 17-year-old girl from Bishop Heber while he was working at Thornhill Academy, where Educating Yorkshire was filmed (file image showing Thornhill headteacher Jonny Mitchell) Details of his behaviour and indefinite teaching ban were revealed by the National College for Teaching and Leadership in a summary of the disciplinary panel’s findings. Giffin admitted allegations concerning five pupils between 2007 and 2012. The panel was told how he sent messages to three pupils at the Cheshire school on Facebook after moving to his new job. He hid his identity by using fake names – Guy Andre, Chelsea Smith, Frank Shepard and Alan Shepard. Only Pupil A responded, and they began chatting over social media. Giffin soon admitted his real identity to his former student, who had special educational needs. Through text and Whats-App messages to the girl, he ‘raised a question about what students thought of cross-dressing’, the panel heard. He said he was jealous of her and other girls in her class who ‘looked sexy in tights’ because he wanted to wear them himself. Giffin sent messages discussing sexual fantasies, including imagining Pupil A in her school uniform and smoking a cigarette ‘on top of him’. The girl told police she had begun to trust him. While employed at Thornhill (pictured) Giffin sent the girl Facebook messages discussing cross-dressing, and saying that he wanted to see her 'in her school uniform and smoking a cigarette on top of him' Giffin told investigators he regarded the messages as ‘silly conversations’ and that he had been drinking when he sent some of them. But inquiries also uncovered an ‘inappropriate relationship’ with a Year 13 pupil several years earlier. Giffin said it started during the summer holidays when he saw her as a ‘former pupil’. The panel heard they saw each other for about six months and became ‘intimate’ when the girl went to university. Another sexual relationship with an ex-pupil from the same school was not found to be inappropriate, as the girl was not at Bishop Heber while Giffin taught there. They had ‘met on a night out in Chester’ rather than at school, the panel was told. Banning Giffin for life from teaching in any school or children’s home in England, the panel concluded that he had ‘acted dishonestly and breached his position of trust’. Giffin had claimed he used the fake Facebook accounts to ‘escape’ from stress and financial problems. He was not available for comment yesterday. Neil Giffin was banned from teaching after admitting to having a sexual relationship with two girls, one of which was ruled to be inappropriate. Both of them had left school when the relationships took place, but teaching guidelines were still applied. This is because the guide allows for any behaviour 'within and outside school' to be considered, if it might call the profession into disrepute. Of the two sexual relationships Giffin admitted, the one that was found to be inappropriate was with a girl who had been at Bishop Heber High School while Giffin was teaching there. This is because the guide specifically refers to 'safeguarding pupils'. The second girl likely cannot be considered a Giffin's pupil if she was not at the school at the same time as him. The panel also said they were concerned 'that there was a pattern of repetition' to Giffin's actions that put vulnerable students at risk . As well as engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a girl who had left the school, Giffin went on to send 'sexually motivated' messages to current pupils. When he was questioned over his behaviour towards Pupil A, he acknowledged he was wrong and deactivated his Facbook account, only to reactivate it and carry on offending. His behaviour fell 'significantly short' of the Teachers’ Standards, which say instructors must 'uphold public trust in the profession and maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour.' The panel also found that he showed little understanding of the impact of his actions, especially considering that one girl had special educational needs. He was given a lifetime ban from the classroom on the grounds of unacceptable personal conduct which was likely to bring the profession into disrepute.","Neil Giffin, 35, had relationships while at Bishop Heber High School .

"Police have seized more than 5,000 antiquities worth a record £38 million, after uncovering a criminal network that trafficked classical treasures out of Italy through Switzerland. The rare antiquities, including vases, jewellery, bronze statues and frescoes that were looted from illegal digs in Italy, were discovered in warehouses in Switzerland belonging to a Sicilian art dealer.

Prosecutors say the Basel-based dealer Gianfranco Becchina and his wife, Ursula Juraschek, are part of an art smuggling ring stretching from 'tombaroli' grave robbers in southern Italy, to buyers across the globe. Dealers produced forged certificates of authenticity and created fake histories for them, so that museums and private collectors could buy them in good faith, police said. The works were restored in Switzerland before being sold in Germany, Britain, the United States, Japan and Australia. Becchina was detained by Italian police while his wife was arrested by Swiss police.

Jerry Aldrich, an theme-park consultant who has helped Disney with safety issues, told the paper that the slow speeds of the child-friendly rides make it unlikely they contributed to the deaths of the women. 'That's just where they happened to be at the time,' he said. 'In A Small World, I wouldn't think that would cause you a spike in blood pressure or anything like that.' Disney told the Sentinel the rides were operating normally at the time of the incidents, which were revealed in the latest report published by Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides. The agency releases reports of injuries linked to major theme parks' rides every quarter, reported by the theme parks themselves to the state as part of a deal which exempts them from public regulation. Disney reported nine further incidents; Universal Orlando reported five incidents; and SeaWorld reported two incidents. Wrong place, wrong time: Jerry Aldrich, a theme-park consultant who has helped Disney with safety issues, said the slow speeds of the child-friendly rides make it unlikely they contributed to the deaths of the women . The report comes as a measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California led to warnings against visiting if tourists or their children have not been vaccinated against the highly contagious respiratory disease. New infections linked to the theme parks emerged Wednesday in an outbreak that has spread to five U.S. states and Mexico, though the vast majority - 62 - occurred in California. People who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine are susceptible to contracting the highly contagious illness and should avoid Disney 'for the time being,' state epidemiologist Gil Chavez said. The same holds true for crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports, Chavez said. People who are vaccinated don't need to take such precautions, he said. Disneyland Resorts spokeswoman Suzi Brown said officials agreed with the advice that 'it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated.'","Slow rides unlikely to have caused victims' deaths, says expert .

"For most of us 'liking' a status or 'sharing' a picture can seem like completely natural acts, but would they make any sense when taken out of context? A YouTube video blogger, Jena Kingsley, took to the streets of New York to see what  reaction she would receive if she used online lingo in day to day life. Her video, which captures her approaching strangers to poke, like and view them, has been viewed 90,000 times. Scroll down for video . Jena Kingsley put social networking to the test in real life, taking to the streets of NYC with a personal update . Reenacting page views on LinkedIn, Jena informs a subway passenger how many 'views' he has had . The comedian begins the video, which she created with Relationship Science's Mine app, by explaining the intention behind the film. She said: 'Social networking is completely out of control these days but do the things we do online make sense in real life?' The film swiftly moves on to Jena stalking a woman before tapping her on the shoulder and calling out to her. 'Mam, I just want to let you know that I'm following you. Just giving you an alert' says Jenna, referring to the act of 'following' someone on Twitter. Unsurprisingly the woman looks a little confused before mumbling 'okay', but Jena keeps up the act saying: 'You don't have to do anything. Just know it and enjoy it.' Jena continues to 'follow' several people on the street telling one bewildered woman: 'Jena Kingsley is now following you, just do whatever and I will just watch.' At Grand Central station she announced that she had 'checked in', a way of updating location on Facebook . The film switches to the vlogger prodding a man in a blue jacket. 'You want to poke me back?' she asks him and he obliges. 'Isn't that fun?' she says. Her fellow 'poker' doesn't seem as sure, 'Yeah, it's just weird though I don't even know you,' he points out. 'I know but that's what you do right?' she responds after re-enacting the Facebook action of using the poke button to contact a friend. Jena continues the Facebook theme, this time by providing passers-by with a notification of a friend's change of job. Jenna makes connections much like on LinkedIn using  the man sitting next to her . Using a megaphone Jena announces: 'Tom O'Donnell started working at McGuire law firm,' before asking pedestrians to 'comment' on the update. The comedian then decides to see how the characteristics of the professional network LinkedIn would work in a actual social situation. She approaches a man who is adding sugar to his beverage and compliments him on his technique before adding: 'I want to endorse you for your coffee-making skills' she tells him. She continues to endorse several other customers before asking another if she would like to endorse her back. At this point Jena decides to send out a few friend requests, which users of Facebook will be familiar with, this is the action of inviting another user to connect with you. Jena Kingsley teamed up with Relationship Science to see if social networking behaviour can work in real life . She approaches a table where two men are siting and says: 'Hi guys I was wondering if you would accept my friendship request?' When they just look at her blankly Jena decides to change her approach and see if they would rather be connected in a business sense as done on LinkedIn. 'He looks really important with, like, the whole button-down,' Jena says to one of the men, adding, 'do you want to be connected?' Jena then takes the professional network to the New York subway letting travellers know just how many 'views' their 'profile' has received. 'I just want to let you know that 12 people have viewed you,' she tells one of the passengers. 'What does that mean?' asks a bewildered woman. 'I don't know, you must be really important they're like viewing you. That guy chose to remain anonymous,' explains Jena. Next up Jena takes to the busy Grand Central station to play out some popular Facebook interactions. 'I have just checked into Grand Central station,' she screams, before grabbing a stranger and asking his name before repeating 'Jenna and Andrew have just checked into Grand Central station with about 452 other people,' referencing the popular craze of listing your location. Jena asked people to comment on something before telling them she 'liked' it, a common Facebook action . One of the few actions that Jena recreates that actually does seem to make some sense in a social situation is the act of sharing, whereby users can re-post something they have found amusing. A woman with a small dog walks by and Jena stops her: 'Oh my God, mam, that is so cute, I have to share this with everybody.' This seems to encourage the most normal reaction. 'Do you want to comment on how cute this is?' she asks one elderly woman who agrees. 'This is cute,' she says while Jena gives her the thumbs-up and tells her, 'I like your comment.' The final part of the video sees the act of making connections online, something that can be done through having mutual connections on LinkedIn, allowing users to make even more connections. 'Excuse me sir, can you introduce me to that guy who's sitting next to you?' Jena asks her neighbour in a shoe-shining booth. The man to her left, is completely bemused but introduces the pair before Jena explains why she thought they ought to meet. 'We had him in common so I figured I should meet you. And now we're all connected.'","Jena Kingsley liked, poked, followed and shared with people in real life .

"The front row may have been the worst place to be at Rick Owens' Paris menswear show today. The designer - who's been dubbed #d***owens by Twitter wags - sent men down the catwalk out in loose hanging, draped smocks with one very particular detail - groin peepholes,  treating fashion fans to the sight of model manhood in all its glory - as part of his autumn/winter 2015 show. While for some of the gentlemen the outfits sat so low their modesty was protected, others weren't so lucky and one chap wore a top which, due to the unfortunate crotch-level cropping, gave the world an X-rated eyeful. Scroll down for video . This model did not seem that happy to have his penis on show to the whole world today at the Rick Owens show in Paris . Male models at the Rick Owens show turned heads for more than just their clothes, draped gowns with cut-out crotches revealed all . No sooner had the show ended than many fashion fans took to Twitter to express their excitement and amusement at the outfits which were thought to have been inspired by religious robes. One user said: 'I bet more than height and waist measurements were taken at the Rick Owens casting.' Another quipped: 'Immediate reaction to the Rick Owens crotch cutouts: that male model's mom is going to be placing a VERY stern phone call.' Fashion editors were quick to review the show with New York Magazine saying: 'Just as 2014 was the year of the butt, 2015 is shaping up to be about the bulge in fashion land.' However they said many of the attendees missed the big moment because they were too busy on their phones: 'The penises weren't the point of the show - it was blink-and-you-miss-it - but many editors were cursing themselves afterward for missing them because they were too busy texting.' For some of the models the outfits were long enough that they covered their modesty - others weren't so lucky . Some of the attendees at the show said that you could blink and miss the full frontal male nudity that took place at the show . And fashion blogger Susie Bubble didn't seem to think the outfits were that big of a deal. She told Dazed And Confused: 'I liked that you hardly noticed it. It wasn't nudity for the sake of nudity. I honestly didn't see until somebody pointed out the d*** flaps and the undie holes.' Many people took to Instagram to repost the pictures which quickly went viral, sharing them under the hashtag #d**kowens, a play on the California-born designer's name. Many Twitter users took to the social media site to express their amusement at the Rick Owens show in Paris today . According to fashion insiders at the show there were a total of three penises in the show although to what degree they were seen varied depending on the model. Rick's show and his penis peephole outfits are the latest in a long line of bizarre offerings which have taken place during the men's fashion weeks. In London models walked down the catwalk with lego stuck to their faces. While not all of the models showed off their whole bodies it seems that wearing underwear will be a definite no-no this autumn . And at the house of Christopher Shannon they were photographed coming down the runway with plastic bags on their heads and others had the same emblazoned on their jumpers. At the DSquared2 show and Salvatore Ferragamo in Milan it was all about giant winter warmers. While DSquared controversially showed giant fur hats and huge lined coats, Ferragamo had models walk down the runway in giant scarfs. At the Gucci show men were dressed in very feminine outfits including lace tops, pussybow blouses and vests.","Designer Rick Owens showcased draping gowns with crotch cut-outs on the catwalk in Paris today .

"The United Nations has demanded that Burmese leaders condemn a Buddhist monk who called a visiting envoy a 'bitch' and 'whore' because she criticised curbs on religious conversions. Firebrand cleric Ashin Wirathu made the comments at a public rally last week when he described human rights expert Yanghee Lee as a 'whore in our country'. Ms Lee had previously said draft legislation including curbs on interfaith marriage, religious conversion and birth rates, would be a further sign that Burma was 'backtracking' in its democratic reforms if passed by parliament.

UN human rights expert Yanghee Lee, who said curbs on religion would be would be a further sign that Burma was 'backtracking' in its democratic reforms if passed by parliament . Now Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called the language used by Wirathu as 'utterly unacceptable' and demanded he be condemned. He said: 'I call on religious and political leaders in Myanmar to unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to hatred including this abhorrent public personal attack. 'It's intolerable for UN Special Rapporteurs to be treated in this way,' before adding that the language he used was 'sexist' and 'insulting.' During the rally last week, Wirathu stood on a stage and shouted to loud applause as he hit out at Ms Lee. He told the crowd: 'We have explained about the race protection law, but the bitch (Lee) criticised the laws without studying them properly. 'Don't assume that you are a respectable person because of your position. For us, you are a whore.' His speech generated a flurry of comments on social media, with many people expressing shock at his language. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, pictured, has called the language used to describe Ms Lee as 'utterly unacceptable' and has demanded that Burmese leaders condemn Wirathu . But earlier this week, the monk, who has been accused of fanning religious tensions, said he stood by his comments. He explained: 'That was the harshest word (I could think of), so I used it. 'If I could find a harsher word, I would have used it. It is nothing compared to what she did to our country.' New found freedom of expression has accompanied predominantly Buddhist Burma's transition from a half-century of military rule in 2011. It lifted the lid on deep-seated prejudice against members of the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, and those seen as defending them. Most of Myanmar's 1.3 million Rohingya live under apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine state. Denied citizenship by national law, they have limited access to adequate healthcare and education, and face restrictions on movement. More than 100,000 have fled the country in the last two years. Wirathu has been accused of inciting violence with hate-filled, anti-Islam rhetoric that has left hundreds of people dead since 2012 and which has forced hundreds of thousands more to flee their homes, most of them Rohingya in Rakhine state.","Human rights expert Yanghee Lee visited Burma as part of an Asian tour .

"Marine and Patrick Wood's pet cat, Chloe, survived six weeks trapped in a chimney at their Dorset home . A homesick cat used up at least one of its nine lives after surviving for six weeks stuck inside a chimney. The moggy, named Chloe, endured a 20ft plunge before going weeks without food and water behind the sealed up fireplace. The stricken pet had been trying to get back into her home while her owners Marianne and Patrick Wood were on holiday. She was pulled, barely alive from the shaft, six weeks later when the couple returned home and heard her  cries coming through the walls. The couple had arranged with a neighbour to look after Chloe in their absence, feeding her twice a day and letting her inside at night. But the homesick cat decided to try and break in to the house on December 6 - two days after the Woods arrived in Vietnam for a six week trip to see their son, Stephen. Their neighbours spent a week searching for Chloe but to no avail. Mrs Wood even emailed them a photo of the seven-year-old cat from 10,000 miles away to be used on 'missing' posters. Then the day after the couple returned home they heard a pathetic meowing from behind the sealed up fireplace in an upstairs bedroom. Mr Wood, 74, used a knife to cut a hole through the sealant and found a skeletal-looking Chloe barely alive. The white and ginger cat was rushed to a vets where she was found to have lost more than half her body weight and was given a 50/50 chance of survival. She was put on a drip and fed small amounts of food to help her build her strength up and is now well enough to be allowed home. Mrs Wood, a retired schoolteacher from Stoborough, near Wareham, Dorset, said: 'It is almost unbelievable that a cat could survive without any food or water and in a tiny space of about one foot square for six weeks. 'She was covered in cement dust from where she had desperately tried to claw her way into the room. Scroll down for video . Chloe, pictured above, survived without food and water during the six weeks inside the sealed up fireplace . A vet said that if Chloe had been left for another week she would have died inside the chimney . 'She was barely alive by the time we found her and the vet said had she been left for another week she would have been dead. I would think she has used up about eight of her nine lives in one go.' The couple left for their trip to Vietnam and Australia on December 4. Two weeks before their other pet cat Honey was sadly run over and killed in an accident. Vets found Chloe lost half her body weight during the ordeal . Neighbour Tammy Parkin, who happens to be a veterinary nurse, kindly agreed to let Chloe in and out of the house and feed her twice a day. Mrs Wood said: 'The last time Chloe was seen was on the roof on December 6. She wouldn't have fallen down the chimney by accident because she is so sure-footed. 'She must have climbed down it as a way of getting into the house. 'Our neighbours were marvelous. They looked everywhere for her; combed farm fields, spoke to people in the village with sheds and garages and printed posters with a photo I emailed them from Vietnam. 'They did their very best to find her. 'We got back last Saturday and the next morning I was in the spare bedroom on my own and heard a pathetic meow. I thought I was going mad. Then I heard it again and thought it must be Chloe but had no idea where she was so called my husband up. 'We tracked it down to the fireplace and Patrick cut a hole in the cardboard and pulled Chloe out by the scruff of her neck, headfirst. 'She was half-dead; emaciated and couldn't see anything as her eyes were opaque. We put her down but she couldn't stand up by herself.' Neighbour Tammy rushed the severely malnourished and dehydrated cat to her work at Castle Vets in Poundbury where she was given emergency treatment that saved her. Vet Jeremy Wright said: 'It is extraordinary. She seems to have recovered very quickly and has bounced back.'","The cat, named Chloe, spent six weeks stuck inside a chimney breast .

"Devoted: John Bayley and Iris Murdoch. The couple met while he was a young academic at Oxford . The film Iris, about the novelist Iris Murdoch’s descent into Alzheimer’s disease, was directed by Richard Eyre — whose own mother suffered from this appalling form of dementia. It was, obviously, an extremely harrowing story, which touched the hearts of many. Audiences watched the young Iris (played by Kate Winslet), a tousled tomboy cycling round Oxford, her head full of philosophy and the fiction which would make her name. Then we saw Dame Judi Dench (as the older Iris) in a cardie, becoming at first muddled, and then more or less witless. Iris’s husband, John Bayley, in old age, was played by Jim Broadbent, an avuncular, gentle figure, whose devotion to his wife was saint-like. I watched the film, which appeared in 2001, with a mixture of emotions. I had known John, who died this week aged 89, and Iris well for many years. John had been my tutor at university, and Iris was a good friend, who encouraged me in my early writing career. We had seen a great deal of one another in over 30 years of friendship. Like all their friends, I had admired the gallant way in which John coped with his wife’s illness. He scarcely left her side during the four years the nightmare went on. No doubt about it, John was a hero in the way he had nursed her. But even before she died, he published a memoir — the book on which the film was based, and what would be the first of a trilogy about Iris. It was moving, telling how, as a shy young academic at St Antony’s College, Oxford, he had one day looked out of the window and seen this young woman (rather older than himself) cycling past. He had decided she was the girl for him — not because he fancied her, but because he didn’t! Scared of sex, he was not particularly interested in the act (still less in the idea of offspring). The passages about sex in the book were both unconvincing and more than a little bit troubling. But if we all knew that Iris was bisexual and that she had several lovers, none of us guessed, until a biography published after her death, how unfaithful she had been. There were dozens of lovers, throughout her marriage. Men and women alike. I had always had a half-sense that this pair, so close in many ways, and so obviously in a ‘good marriage’, were not quite as other couples. I suppose I had known them about 20 years when Iris suggested she and I went to lunch, just the two of us. Another friend of theirs, who had known John since they were students together, said: ‘But you normally have lunch with John.’ ‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘but Iris has suggested we meet up in London.’ ‘Well, I’m telling you,’ said the friend, ‘if you say yes, you’ll never have another lunch with John.’ I thought the friend was being absurd. At the time, I had lunch with John, on average, every couple of weeks, and had done so for 20 years. I did not refuse Iris’s invitation. Adaptation: The couple were played by Jim Broadbent and Judi Dench (pictured) in the film version of Iris . But sure enough, my friend was right. Though I sometimes had dinner with them together, that lunch with Iris was enough to bring my special friendship with John to an end. I realised then how very jealous he was, and after she died, I saw how much he must have resented her repeated unfaithfulness. When I reread his accounts of their life together, and of her illness, I came to think that, despite his love and willingness to care for her, other things had been going on as well. One was a possessive desire to have Iris all to himself. Another was a little like vengeance. His accounts of her ‘in her water-buffalo guise’ — a reference to her lumbering movements — are not very loving. The descriptions of her loss of bodily control, of her dirtiness, of his need to hose her down when she was doubly incontinent, are profoundly shameful. These descriptions, and the subsequent film, had the effect of almost expunging Iris Murdoch’s fame as a writer. She was no longer the woman who, for three decades and more, had written witty novels about the emotional chaos in which we live. She was the Alzheimer’s lady played by Dame Judi. Had John intended this? As well as being an Oxford don and literary critic, he was an unsuccessful novelist. Was he, consciously or not, envious of his wife’s success, and boiling with resentment at all the girlfriends and boyfriends with whom she had made a fool of him? That was how it must have seemed to many readers of his very strange memoirs. I published my own account of the Iris I knew, and did not hide my unhappiness at John’s unflinching portrait of her. Strange: Bayley's descriptions in his memoir, and the subsequent film, had the effect of almost expunging Iris Murdoch’s fame as a writer. Above, the couple together . But the years have passed, and now that he is dead, I find my mind going back to the time when I first knew John Bayley. He was one of the most amusing, original beings I ever met. He was very widely read, but he bore his learning lightly, and he was in no sense a scholar. He loved C.S. Forester’s Hornblower stories and childish books about World War II aeroplanes as much as he loved the highbrow stuff, even though, at his best, he was one of the finest critics of difficult modern poetry I ever read. His books were rather waffly. They belong to a vanished era of literary criticism and I can not imagine anyone getting anything out of them today. However, his conversation could be sublime, whether expounding his reason for loving the novels of Tolstoy, the poetry of Browning, or the plays of Shakespeare. At the same time, there was a strong element of blarney. He was well-known for having ‘learnt Russian’, but I remember his face, at a party, when a friend of mine quoted perhaps the most famous lines of the Russian poet Pushkin to John. The passages about sex in the book were both unconvincing and more than a little bit troubling . It was quite clear he hadn’t the foggiest what was being said. Yet he went on to be the judge of the Russian Booker prize! John also chaired the English Booker Prize committee, yet, after stammering out the winner’s name, he told me he had not actually read the winning entry. Charles Arrowby, the narrator in Iris’s novel The Sea, The Sea, dreams up some highly distinctive dishes to eat alone, such as braised onions dusted with curry powder and served with a little tomato ketchup (‘Only a fool despises tomato ketchup’). These odd recipes were all supplied by John. In the days of Iris’s health and vigour, dinner with them would include some very weird concoctions — slices of pork pie as a starter, Battenberg cake for pudding, and chicken scattered with dandelions and curry powder as a main course. Once we went to supper with them in Iris’s London flat and four people shared one scrambled egg. Corned beef in their fridge would quite often be growing a grey mould. But those meals were joyous, with lots of cheap wine and whisky. Even with appalling hangovers the next day, it did not stop one remembering the hilarious, frivolous talk. They were both tremendous gossips, but — unlike me, I fear — they were not malicious, and I think John was right when he used to say that Iris never found anyone boring. In their heyday they were universally adored. I never met anyone who disliked them. They seemed like babes in the wood, and their curious partnership — whether or not it had ever possessed a sexual element, and perhaps because it did not — seemed harmonious and fun. Bald, bespectacled, shambolic, clad in ill-fitting clothes from charity shops, and seldom without a cloth cap, John was eccentric almost to the point of lunacy. At a tea-party at my college, I once saw him stuffing sandwiches and delicate, creamy meringues into his pockets. Suppers at home often consisted of the fried-up contents of his pockets. He was not really able to cope with ‘normal’ life. John had a stammer, a very posh voice and had been educated at Eton. Harmonious: In their heyday, Iris and John were universally adored and their partnership seemed harmonious . John was terrified of ‘ordinary people’. Once, he found himself opposite one of these frightening beings on the train. Even worse, the man tried to make conversation. ‘Now don’t tell me,’ said the man. ‘I’d guess you are a lawyer.’ ‘S-s-s-sort of,’ was John’s nervous reply. ‘Where are you going to?’ Edinburgh was the real answer, but either because he could not say the word, or because lying came naturally to him, John answered, ‘B-B-Birmingham.’ When they reached Birmingham, the man stared at him so hard that John felt obliged to get out. Iris, who was waiting anxiously for him on the platform at Edinburgh Waverley, had no idea where he had disappeared to. After Iris died in 1999, John married their friend Audi Villers. He once said they talked ‘incessantly about Iris; never stop, really’. I sorely regret, in many ways, having gone public with my feelings of dismay about the memoirs John had written. It still strikes me as weird, even incomprehensible, that he could have written in that humiliating way about Iris, and that — conscious or unconscious of his feelings of envy and resentment — he reduced her by writing the books. He was furious with me for writing as I did and our friendship was, of course, utterly destroyed. This does not prevent me from seeing that, with his passing, we have lost one of the greatest, most glorious English eccentrics.","John Bayley wrote memoir about wife Iris' descent into Alzheimer's disease .

"Soaring house prices have led to a dramatic fall in the number of young people who can buy their own home, new research showed today. More than a third of 16-25 year olds were on the property ladder in 1991, but two decades later the figure had fallen to just one in 10. Since the early 1990s, only the over-65s have seen growing numbers of homeowners, as first-time buyers struggle even to get a loan. Only the over-65s have seen an increase in the level of home ownership since 1991, according to the Office for National Statistics . Deposits for first time buyers peaked during the economic downturn in 2009 at 28 per cent of the purchase price . The number of first-time buyers has not recovered since the financial crash in 2008 . The Office for National Statistics examined the state of the housing market over 30 years. It found there has been growing demand but low levels of new homes being built, pushing up asking prices. ‘House prices have been increasing, and first time buyers are finding it more difficult to get on the property ladder – while home ownership among younger age groups generally has declined,’ the ONS said in a new report. Number of mortgage loans for first time buyers, UK, 1980 to 20134 . Between 1980 and 2002, the number of mortgages agreed for first time buyers was averaging around 486,000 per year. As a result of rising prices and bigger deposits, the average age of first-time buyers is now 30, according to the Council for Mortgage Lenders . The ONS says a major cause of the problem is rising demand, but fewer homes being built over many years . But there was a 31 per cent decline in mortgages for first time buyers from between 2002 and 2003, and another 47 per cent drop in 2007 to 2008 in the wake of the financial crash. Even now the level of loans to first-time buyers remains below the average seen before to 2003. As a result, the chances of young people owning their home have slumped dramatically. In 1991, 67 per cent of the 25 to 34 age group were homeowners. By 2011-12, this had slumped to 43per cent. Among 16-25-year-olds the figure fell from 36 per cent to just 10 per cent over the same period. For the 35 to 44 age group it fell from 78 per cent to 64 per cent while home ownership has increased among older age groups. House prices have risen dramatically since the early 1980s, even allowing for the economic crisis the ONS said . The ONS said a key factor in the shift is likely to be the larger deposits people need to get on the property ladder. Between 1988 and 2013, the average deposit as a percentage of purchase price increased by almost 10 percentage points. Deposits for first time buyers peaked during the economic downturn in 2009 at 28 per cent of the purchase price. Since then they have begun to fall, but remain among the highest for the last 25 years.","Only  over-65s saw increase in the level of home ownership since 1991 .

"A dead 32-foot gray whale floated under a Washington state ferry terminal Thursday sending up a foul odor and diverting some passenger ferries to another slip. The whale drifted in from open waters in downtown Seattle and has since been moved so biologists can figure out how it died. The whale was towed from the dock to a nearby location Thursday afternoon, said Broch Bender, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Ferries. The plan is to move it to another secure location for an autopsy. Float: A dead 32-foot gray whale (photographed) floated under a dock at the Colman Dock Washington State Ferry Terminal in Seattle Thursday . Carcass: Here, a crew tows the carcass of the dead whale in Elliot Bay after it was discovered under a busy commuter ferry terminal . The female whale was quite decomposed, but biologists hope to learn as much as possible about its death, said Michael Milstein, a spokesman with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service. The animal likely had been dead for at least several days, though it might not have been under the dock that long, he said. It's not known yet how it died, how it got under the dock, or other details. The whale was discovered under Colman Dock ferry terminal late Wednesday. Ferry service wasn't affected, but people reported a foul odor. This is the tail end of the period when gray whales migrate south, Milstein said. They spend their summers feeding in Alaska. Each fall, they travel along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.

"Forget points on the board, it’s about followers on the web these days. At least, that is, according to Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. The Old Trafford chief made the bizarre attempt to satisfy investors this week by highlighting the impact signing for the club has had on the social-media popularity of players such as Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao. Manchester United's Daley Blind has had a 73 per cent increase in Twitter followers since joining the club . In the case of Blind, Woodward pointed to his 73 per cent increase in Twitter followers, a figure which equates to 173,000. However, if Blind’s motivation for joining United was simply to maximise ‘retweets’ and ‘favourites’, perhaps he should have signed for Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal. For Sportsmail can reveal the big winners of this summer’s Twitter Transfer Tussle. We have obtained numbers from Twitter which disclose the growth in following for close-season signings from each Premier League club. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has attracted 900,000 followers since his £30million switch from Barcelona . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has added 462,000 followers since his £16million switch . And we can reveal that it is Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas who has attracted the most new followers since his £30million move from Barcelona. The Spaniard’s numbers are up by 900,000, taking his total to 7.42m. Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, has added 462,000 in the wake of his arrival at Liverpool. Woodward, however, may well point to percentage increase as a true barometer of social-media success and Blind – at 73 per cent – still outdoes Fabregas (14 per cent) and Balotelli (16 per cent). But none of those three can compete with the 203 per cent rise enjoyed by Calum Chambers following his move from Southampton to Arsenal. Ex-Southampton defender Calum Chambers (second left) has a 203 per cent rise since joining Arsenal . Newcastle Ayoze Perez has 28,000 followers on Twitter - a 197 per cent rise since joining the Magpies . Manchester United midfielder posted this picture to his twitter account on Thursday afternoon . The 19-year-old is up from 84,000 to 255,000 in just four months – now those figures really would have Woodward purring. But Chambers isn’t alone in recording a three-figure percentage jump. Newcastle’s Ayoze Perez is up 197 per cent to 28,000. The 21-year-old - a previous unknown in the Spanish second tier - has scored three times in his last three matches to announce his arrival on the Premier League stage following a £1.6m move from Tenerife. Hull defender Andrew Robertson notched for Scotland against England on Tuesday night and he is another enjoying new-found notoriety, the former Dundee United youngster seeing his following rocket 123 per cent to just over 12,000. Andrew Robertson (left) and Eric Dier have seen their Twitter following increase triple-fold . Eric Dier, at Spurs, is up 150 per cent to 44,000, while West Brom’s Brown Ideye has nearly trebled his following. Other summer signings have not been quite as lucky, Crystal Palace’s James McArthur has only attracted 2,900, while Leicester’s Marc Albrighton has added just 1,500. But does any of the above really matter in comparison to Premier League points? Only at Old Trafford, it seems… .

"Claims: Fred Talbot arriving at court today, where it was heard he staged a naked 'orgy' on a canal boat . TV weatherman Fred Talbot coerced schoolboys into stripping naked and pretending they were having an orgy on a canal barge before fondling one of them on board, a court heard. Talbot, now 65, was working as a  teacher in the 1970s when he allegedly asked the boys to lie on top of others who were pretending to be girls during a school trip. Today one of the former pupils, aged around 14 at the time, said the 'orgy' went on for up to two hours - with explicit photographs being taken as Talbot and two adult friends watched. He then had to share Talbot's bed and the teacher sexually assaulted him, he said. A total of ten boys were said to have been involved in the 'orgy'. The witness is one of five  who say Talbot sexually assaulted them as pupils before going on to become a charismatic TV personality. During the late 1980s and early 1990s Talbot was a regular on ITV's This Morning, where he presented weather updates from a floating map in Liverpool's Albert Dock. The witness said the 'orgy' took place on a weekend school trip in the mid-1970s organised by Talbot when he taught biology at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Greater Manchester. The boy was 'quite drunk' after Talbot, two adult friends and  older boys returned from the pub and shared beers  with younger boys, Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard. He said: 'He then (Talbot) said ""let's pretend we have got some girls back from the pub"" and we had an orgy. He said we needed to take some photographs so you can pretend there is some girls here. 'We were very drunk. I think they turned the heat up and we took our clothes off. One boy would lie on another boy and would pretend the one underneath was a girl. 'They took a lot of photos.' In charge: Talbot coerced a group of boys into posing naked on top of each other for photos, the jury heard . He recalled one of Talbot's friends on the trip was a man in his late 20s or early 30s nicknamed Spider, who wore biker-type clothing. The witness said Talbot was 'in charge' and 'telling us what to do'. 'We were innocent,' he said. 'We didn't know anything. Basically it was his thing... he decided when it started and finished.' He said the 'orgy' went on for up to two hours before everyone went to sleep. Talbot then said the boy should stay in his double bed because there were not enough bunk beds for everyone, the witness said. The pair slept naked behind a partition before Talbot fondled the teenager and persuaded him to perform a sex act on him, the court heard. A prosecuting lawyer said 'the qualities that made Fred Talbot successful as a TV celebrity - his boundless energy - helped him gain the boys' trust'. The accused is pictured while presenting on ITV's This Morning . 'He showed me what to do,' the witness said. 'He said this is natural and this is how men touch other men, because I didn't know what was going on.' The following morning he said that Talbot told him to never speak about the incident or of the photographed 'orgy' and it was their secret. He told the jury he had few friends and lacked confidence at school, which meant he was flattered by the attentions of the 'friendly, kind of hip' Talbot. The court heard the witness had complained to police about Talbot in 1992, but police closed the investigation because of a lack of evidence. 'I felt it was my responsibility because this kind of person was at large and they would be continuing their activities,' he said. 'There was nothing particular to gain for myself. I just thought it was the right thing to do.' Career: The claims date to when Talbot was a biology teacher at Altrincham Grammar, Greater Manchester . Trial: Talbot, 65, denies indecently assaulting five boys at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court (above) He said he wrote to police again in 1996 and provided a statement about the alleged abuse, but later admitted this account had been 'exaggerated'. 'I think I was angry and annoyed that the prosecution had not gone ahead,' he said. 'It was a very stupid thing to do.' He withdrew the exaggeration, but made  complaints against Talbot again in 1998 and 2000. The witness said he had never made a claim for compensation, and denied  wanting to make one in the future. Talbot, 65, denies indecently assaulting five boys between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. The trial continues.

"It's a show in which stars reveal their pet hates in the hope of seeing them banished to Room 101. For Ray Mears, however, appearing on the BBC programme to talk about one of his biggest grievances – caravans – has proved rather costly. After describing them as ‘hideous’ to Room 101 host Frank Skinner, the bushcraft expert was dropped as a speaker at the forthcoming Caravan, Camping and Motorhome Show – a job which was set to make him at least £10,000. Mears (right) appeared with newsreader Fiona Bruce (left) and comedian Katherine Ryan on host Frank Skinner's BBC One show . Discussing caravans in the episode, which was filmed in September but aired on BBC1 last Friday, Mears, 50, said: ‘I just think they’re hideous. ‘Huge swathes of our coastline are just covered in these things. I wouldn’t mind so much if they could be painted green, but they have to be painted white. ‘You go down to Devon and all you can see are cities of these displaced urban people in their ghastly white caravans.’ While his comments may have been meant as a bit of fun, the organisers of Mears’ speaking engagement were not amused in the slightest. Mears said on the show that caravans were a blight on Britain's coastline and are 'hideous' and 'ghastly' Emma Entwistle of Pelican Communications, which is promoting the event next month at Birmingham’s NEC, confirmed he had been dropped. She said: ‘We booked Ray Mears in November after the show was filmed, and there was never any mention of what he had said when we signed him up. ‘There was no way we can now have him come along to speak at our event – he has slagged off the community we are in charge of promoting and protecting. ‘We can’t align with someone who doesn’t agree with our core values. He has insulted the people who come to the show.’ She confirmed he had lost out on a ‘five-figure sum’, adding: ‘It’s all a bit elitist, saying that you are OK going outdoors if you are staying in a man-made shelter. 'It’s a shame because we are all about getting kids off their backsides and into the outdoors, an ideology I’d have thought we would have shared.’ Mears has not responded to requests for comment, but Ms Entwhistle claimed his agent was 'very apologetic'. She added: 'He shouldn't have taken the job if he has fundamental issues with caravans.' But his tirade has hit him in the pocket after a £10,000 appearance at the Caravan, Camping and Motorhome Show was cancelled after the programme was aired . Mears had been used on publicity material for the show, but organisers now feel he's 'slagged them off' Many caravan fans have criticised the ‘hypocritical’ survival expert online. Writing on a forum at caravanclub.co.uk, a user called Trini said: ‘Pity he is so against caravanning, until of course there’s [a] chance of some money.' ‘He should be taken to the NEC in a caravan with Jeremy Clarkson towing it!’ IanH wrote: ‘Oh dear ... I wonder how much he’s being paid to be a complete hypocrite?’ Organisers of the show, which runs between 17 - 22 February, are hoping Helen Skelton, formerly of Blue Peter, will be able to replace Mears. Other stars who are expected to appear include TV presenter Matt Baker and former athlete Sally Gunnell. The caravan show's promoters accused Mears of being 'elitist' for backing only camping and not caravanning .","Star told of his pet hates on the BBC One comedy show aired on Saturday .

"Concrete evidence for the existence of Bigfoot has so far failed to materialise, but a man who’s spent 37 years hunting the beast hopes to change all that by funding expeditions using money from an initial public offering (IPO). Carmine ‘Tom’ Biscardi, from Las Vegas, hopes to raise $3million by selling stock in Bigfoot Project Investments. This money will be funnelled into making DVDS, but a large slice - $113,805 a year – will be used to fund Bigfoot-finding missions. Scroll down for video . Las Vegas Bigfoot expert Tom Biscardi with his crack team of Sasquatch hunters . Biscardi told 2014 BBC documentary Shooting Bigfoot ‘I've seen the creature with my own eyes'. This image is from the famous 1968 Patterson Gimlin video . ‘Capture the creature known as Bigfoot’ is listed as a company priority on documents filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to The Wall Street Journal. Many are likely to consider this plan unrealistic, but it certainly won’t stop the IPO going ahead. The SEC has said in the past that it ‘does not evaluate the merits of any IPO or determine whether an investment is appropriate for any investor’. Biscardi told 2014 BBC documentary Shooting Bigfoot: ‘I've seen the creature with my own eyes. I was 12ft away from one once and I freaked out. I made a dedication to myself that day that I'm going to bring one of these things back because I know they exist. 37 years later, I'm still doing it.' Quite what Mrs Biscardi makes of it all is anyone's guess, although his son TJ has been known to team up with his father and his crack 'A-team' of Bigfoot hunters. Travelling with TJ and Tom is Young Blood, described by Biscardi as his 'chief tracker and sharpshooter' and Chico, an elderly survival specialist. When Biscardi isn't out hunting for Bigfoot, he's busy making documentaries; among them Bigfoot Lives, Bigfoot Lives 2 and Bigfoot Lives 3. It might sound bizarre but Biscardi is convinced he knows what he's doing. 'You hear about people saying they're a Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot researcher, Bigfoot this and that, crypto zoologist,' he complains. 'Crypto my ass - the name of the game is this: you either heel and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or you'll never find anything.' 10: The photographic and video evidence is awful: Besides the famed 1968 Patterson Gimlin video that purports to show bigfoot walking all footage is grainy and photographs blurred. We wonder why? 9: Bigfoot fails to fit into the food chain in North America: The beast is supposed to be 9ft tall and weigh 600 pounds. That would mean it would need to eat 5,000 calories a day to survive - which would lead to a huge unexplained dent in the natural food chain. Scientists have said they have never detected a gap this size before. 8: Bigfoot is just too big: Logically, a 600-pound, 9ft tall ape-man would not go unnoticed by people not even on the trail of the Bigfoot. Basically, if the creature did exist, we would have found it by now. 7: There is no fossil or bone record: A creature this big would have left bones or fossil records behind. However, never once have any ape-like creature's remains or bones been found. 6: Breeding is impossible: If bigfoot is an ape, it would live a longer lifespan than other mammals in North America and the population would run into the thousands. Apes are not solitary creatures - unlike how all Bigfoots are presented. 5: Wrongly identified: Most experts point out that the majority of Bigfoot sightings could simply be black or brown bears walking on their hind-legs. 4: Explosion in sightings after the Bluff Creek Discovery of 1958: Like Roswell in 1947 can be seen as year dot for UFO sightings, so the discovery of several large footprints in 1958 at Bluff Creek in California can be said to have started the Bigfoot phenomenon. After that there were a spate of sightings which haven't stopped to this day. 3: Lack of a body: There is a long standing $1,000,000 reward for the body of sasquatch. 2: Hoaxes: But exactly because of the immense financial rewards should a hunter be proved correct, people try to seek fame and fortune with fake Bigfoots. 1: No evidence: If Bigfoot exists, all scientists need is one strand of hair to determine through DNA that a new ape-like creature has been identified. That has not happened.","Tom Biscardi from Las Vegas has been hunting Bigfoot for 37 years .

"Smokers in America will burn up as much as $2 million in a lifetime thanks to the habit, a study has found. The study, from finance site WalletHub, found that lifelong smokers in the states where cigarettes cost the most are hit hardest. Feeling the pinch the worst are smokers in Alaska, Connecticut and New York where the cost over 50 years hovers around $2 million. Costly: A recent study puts the cost of smoking over a lifetime near $2 million for some Americans . Even in the states where cigarettes cost the least, bulk of the cost came from the cigarettes themselves. In South Carolina, where a pack of smokes costs around $5, the typical smoker can expect their habit to cost them $786,346 in cigarettes and missed investment opportunities. In Alaska, where a pack of cigarettes costs double what it does in much of the South, WalletHub puts the lifetime cost at just over $1.5 million. To reach its upper end lifetime cost estimate, WalletHub added to the cigarette cost/lost investments: health care costs, income loss as well as other costs like higher insurance premiums or denied insurance claims. Rounding the top five most expensive states to be a smoker are Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The cheapest places to puff away after South Carolina were West Virginia followed by Kentucky, Mississippi and Georgia. Smoking costs Alaskans, New Yorkers and residents of Connecticut on average $2 million over their lives in tobacco costs, missed investment opportunities, and other costs .","Lifelong smokers in the states where cigarette cost is highest--such as New York and Alaska--can expect to shell out the most .

"Is this the future of drug trafficking? Police just south of the California border have recovered six packets of methamphetamine after a drone that was carrying the drugs crashed in Tijuana, Mexico. The battery-operated drone was found in the carpark of a supermarket in Pueblo Amigo , just southeast of the San Ysidro Border Crossing, about 9.50pm Tuesday, . A witness had called Tijuana police to report seeing something fall from the sky.

Smash: The battery-operated device was found in pieces in the car park of a Tijuana supermarket . The drone was identified as a 'Spread Wings 900' model, which is reportedly available online for $1,400, according to Raw Story. The device likely crashed from the weight of load. The drugs measured at almost seven pounds. The packets had been attached using tape. According to U-T San Diego, meth seizures have increased at U.S. ports of entry have increased since marijuana was legalized in certain American states, with drug cartels now concentrating on making and smuggling meth that drug and heroin. However, police do anticipate drones becoming future drug mules any time soon.

"The most detailed eyewitness account of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in existence is set to go on sale 150 years after the former president was shot dead by John Wilkes Booth. The chilling note was penned by W. Martin Jones who, who had gone to Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on the night of April 14, 1865, to see a performance of Our American Cousin. Mr Jones, who worked as a secretary to several politicians, was sitting in front of the private box that had been prepared for Lincoln and his presidential party. Scroll down for video . In a letter to a friend, W. Martin Jones (right) detailed the moment Abraham Lincoln (left) was assassinated. The letter is now set to go on sale 150 years after the night the former president was shot in a theatre . Mr Jones wrote the letter to Captain H. Bowen 10 days after the assassination at Ford's Theatre on April 14 . He describes how the theatre had been packed out amid rumours Lincoln might be attending the performance, and how cheers erupted when he arrived. He then recalls the moment a shot rang out around the theatre and the chaos that ensued when the audience realised Lincoln had been murdered by actor John Wilkes-Booth. In a letter to a friend, Captain H. Bowen, written 10 days after the assassination, Mr Jones wrote about the 'recent assassination of out late illustrious chief magistrates, which has cast a gloom over the land'. Mr Jones describes actor John Wilkes Booth as a 'man with face of livid whiteness' He said: 'The theatre was well filled, and the play opened soon after eight o'clock. 'I occupied a front seat in the first section from the private box fitted up for the Presidential company. 'In the middle of the first scene of the first act, the attention of the actors and audience was attracted by the rustling of silk and other movements to the rear of the dress circle. 'The tall and manly form of President Lincoln greeted the anxious eyes of the assembly. Cheer upon cheer welcomed him as he passed to the entrance of his box.' 'He paused a moment to gratify those whose cheers seemed to die away, and then followed Mrs. Lincoln into the box, and was shut from the view of most of the assembly. 'The President, as usual with him, had no guard - except that which in the greatness and goodness of his heart he deemed sufficient.' He added: 'The play went 'smoothly on,' and the attention of the audience became so engrossed in it that little thought was given to other subjects. 'All was still. Sharp and clear, amid the silence that reigned in that vast theatre, sounded the report of a pistol. All eyes were turned whence came the unwelcome noise. 'A thousand thoughts flashed through my mind in an instant. This was a comedy not a tragedy, why this sound of fire arms? There must be a mistake. 'The shot first appeared to me, in the position which I was occupying, as having been made behind the scenes - to the right of the audience. 'It was but an instant, and the slim form of a man with face of livid whiteness, stopped in front of the box in which was seated the President. An illustration shows John Wilkes Booth assassinating President Lincoln at Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865 . Mr Jones was sitting in front of the private box that had been prepared for Lincoln and his presidential party . He describes how the theatre had been packed out amid rumours the president might be attending and the cheers when he arrived . The former president had attended Ford's Theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, to see a performance of Our American Cousin. Abraham Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C. 'The words 'Sic Semper Tyrannis' was hissed between compressed lips. Another instant and the form had vaulted over the balustrade and upon the stage below - a distance of over twelve feet. 'The words 'The President' and 'Assassination' were murmured by persons in the assembly just as the form struck the stage. 'Turning one ghastly look upon the awe stricken people before it, with a long glittering dagger raised high above its head and with rapid strides, it disappeared behind the scenes. 'In an instant the stage was filled with actors and audience. 'A surgeon immediately clambered or was lifted from the stage to the box. 'Laura Keene stepped forward and endeavoured to restore quiet, but suddenly, as if seized with a new thought, she rushed to the President's box, and taking the head of the murdered man in her lap, did what she could to bring back the life that was fast passing away. 'This in the public theatre of Washington the life blood of the illustrious Chief Magistrate of the Nation stained the robe of an actress. 'The theatre was soon after cleared of people, and the President removed to a private house on the opposite side of the street.' He then recounts Lewis Payne's attack on Secretary of State Seward and the filling of the streets with troops. 'on the morning of Saturday, April 15, the slow and solemn tolling of the church bells in the city, announced that ""Abraham Lincoln is dead!""' Mr Jones writes: 'Sharp and clear, amid the silence that reigned in that vast theatre, sounded the report of a pistol' 'The words 'The President' and 'Assassination' were murmured by persons in the assembly just as the form struck the stage' He says Laura Keene rushed to the President's box, and 'taking the head of the murdered man in her lap, did what she could to bring back the life that was fast passing away' Experts say the letter is the finest and most detailed description of the assassination in existence. It is being sold for the first time in 30 years by Donald P. Dow, an American collector who specialized in Abraham Lincoln memorabilia. The 11-page letter is set to fetch $8,000 (around £5,000) when it is sold at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas later this week. Don Ackerman, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'This letter was written 10 days after the assassination by a clerk called W. Martin Jones who was completely unknown before the shooting. 'His report of the event basically became his one claim to fame. 'It is by far the finest, most detailed account of the killing known to exist. 'The most amazing thing about the account is that it comes directly from the hand of someone who was actually there in the theatre when Booth killed Lincoln. 'The letter is so well-written and descriptive that you almost feel like you're there in the theatre.' Tom Slater, director of Americana at Heritage, added: 'Donald P. Dow was a meticulous collector who obtained many of his pieces 20 to 30 years ago, and this auction marks the first time in a generation that collectors have seen these items. 'Considering Mr Dow's effort to document the assassination and the nation's reaction, it's fitting the collection is offered during its sesquicentennial year.'

"A baby elephant almost found its way into an early grave after falling down a  pit at a nature reserve in southwest China's Yunnan Province. The calf was immediately trapped within the four walls of smooth dry earth and struggled to raise itself back up. Fortunately, some local villagers found the hungry and dehydrated animal squealing for help on Tuesday and recorded its exciting rescue. Police came bearing some basic tools to help it climb out of its temporary confinement which was approximately two-meteres deep. In the footage, one man can be seen using a rake to break down the parched soil while another pours water down the hole for the elephant to drink via its trunk. The calf has quite a struggle as it attempts to hike its body up and its legs slip and slide because the unstable land is hard to keep hold of. Yet it gets a lot of encouragement from the group who cheer it on as it lifts its self to freedom. It takes a lot of strength for the exhausted elephant to maneuver its body and it stops to have a break while hanging from the hole. Trapped: A baby elephant finds itself in a life-threatening situation after falling down an empty water storage ditch in China . Slippery slope: The elephant is unable to set itself free after slipping into the pit the previous day when it was raining . One of the rescuers says: 'Looking at the traces at the scene, it probably fell into it yesterday [Monday]. 'Because it rained yesterday, the ground around the pit was slippery.' After a necessary break, the elephant continues with the strenuous, life-saving exercise. An hour down the line, it reaches the top and roams free in the forest while onlookers wail with excitement. Challenging: Local villagers use a rake to break down the wall but the elephant still struggles to keep its footing on the slanted wall as the soil buckles under its weight . Freedom!

"It may look like an optical illusion, but there's no need to think twice. A Latvian thrill-seeker really has joined two car fronts together in order to perform epic 360 degree turns. What's more, the freezing weather  in his hometown of Sigulda provides the optimum conditions to take this baby out for a spin. Artūrs Bondars created the extraordinary hybrid car - half red, half blue - with two engines and no rear end. By fusing the fronts of a pair of VW Passats together he has ensured that he’s able to pull off perfect multiple spins - with the added bonus of freaking out passersby. The car features two drivers seats placed next to one another in the middle of the vehicle, but facing opposite ends. As seen in a video, which demonstrates all the fun that this wacky creation is capable of, Artūrs and a friend are utterly fearless as they let loose. Double trouble: Artūrs Bondars from Latvia has fused together the front ends of two Volkswagen Passats .

"STUFFOCATION . by James Wallman . (Penguin, £9.99) Do you have too much stuff? Of course you do. Everybody has, and many of us are about to pop out to the shops and buy some more. Shopping has become what people do for fun when they can’t think of anything else to do. And what do you get for it? A massive credit card bill, a pair of shoes that looked nicer in the shop and a horrible feeling at the back of your mind that there’s got to be more to life than this. Stuffocation by James Wallman . And there is, says James Wallman, there really is! Wallman isn’t the first writer to tell us that retail therapy is no kind of therapy at all — Oliver James has done so memorably in Affluenza and other books. But something about this one feels particularly timely. Maybe it’s because it’s January, the month of regret. Or maybe the tide really is turning against the tyranny of having too much stuff. Wallman, who calls himself a ‘trend analyst’, begins with a description of one of those men who has successfully banished stuff from his life. You know the type: no paintings on the walls, no books on the shelves, no shelves to have books on. Just a bed, a few clothes, a laptop and an insufferable smugness that makes you want to spike his mug of rooibos tea. But some people will always go too far in any direction. Wallman believes that stuffocation afflicts us all to some extent. Which of us doesn’t have a drawer in a cupboard somewhere that is full of bits of string and old batteries and other bits of rubbish that ‘might come in handy’? When our cupboards can take no more, we’ll hire storage space before we get rid of it. As Wallman reports, ‘the average British woman now buys 58 items of clothing each year. There are twice as many things in her wardrobe today as there were in her equivalent’s wardrobe in 1980. There are 22 things in there she has never worn.’ (It’s even worse in America, where they buy a new item of clothing, on average, every four or five days; they buy 279 million toasters a year, for heaven’s sake.) Instead of materialism, Wallman believes we should favour what he calls ‘experientialism’, by which he means doing things, having experiences, using our minds and bodies and souls, and not just watching the TV. Who can disagree? Stuffocation is effectively his manifesto for a better, fuller life, based on ‘the absolute imperative that happiness is more likely to come from the enjoyment of experiences rather than the accumulation of stuff’. And he argues it well, if sometimes a little glibly, in the manner of someone who has written a lot of marketing documents. Wallman reports, ‘the average British woman now buys 58 items of clothing each year. There are twice as many things in her wardrobe today as there were in her equivalent’s wardrobe in 1980. There are 22 things in there she has never worn.’ The very slight problem with ‘experientialism’ is that you still need money for it. The best things in life really aren’t free, and the wonderful holidays he seems to suggest we all take aren’t on the menu for most of us. I sense that he’s mainly writing for an American readership (most of the examples he gives are American, although Wallman himself isn’t) and for bored businessmen on planes. Nor am I entirely convinced that materialism is quite as washed-up as he would like it to be. Anyone who went to Argos in the week before Christmas knows that the British are addicted to shopping, dangerously so in some cases. My son wanted a Playstation 4 because all his friends were getting one, which immediately rendered his Playstation 3 obsolete and surplus to requirements. In other words, the manufacturers have him — and, therefore, me — exactly where they want us: within their grasp and being squeezed for every penny. So rather than forecasting, there’s an element of wishful thinking to this book. But why not? Even if he does occasionally write like a Dalek, I think Wallman is fundamentally right. Too many of us are working too hard in jobs we don’t enjoy in order to earn money to buy things we don’t need or want. There has to be a better way. And he is spot on about the clutter. Indeed, it’s quite hard to read his book without looking round your home wondering what you can get rid of. Staring up at my own overloaded bookshelves, I realised it might be time for another visit to Oxfam. I’ll probably keep his book, though. Might come in handy.","Wallman believes that stuffocation afflicts us all to some extent .

"The widower of novelist Dame Iris Murdoch has died aged 89. John Bayley, a Professor of English at Oxford University, wrote the best-selling memoir, Iris, which charted the tragic decline of his wife’s health and intellect to Alzheimer’s disease. Professor Bayley was widely regarded as being extremely devoted to his wife, and was her carer during her four-year long battle with the disease. Scroll down for video . Devoted: John Bayley, a Professor of English at Oxford University, and his wife, Dame Iris Murdoch . The book, which was adapted into a film of the same title in 2001 featuring Judi Dench as Dame Iris and Hugh Bonneville as a young Professor Bayley, brought the novelist to a new generation of readers. The memoir laid bare her declining health and his care, but also included details of how, in her final days, she was unable to wash herself or control her bodily functions. Although many regarded the work as poignant, Professor Bayley was also criticised for publishing the book before Dame Iris’s death aged 79 in 1999. Novelist Dame Muriel Spark accused Professor Bayley of ‘muckracking’ and writing a ‘sordid’ account. Poignant: Professor Bayler's best-selling memoir (left) and with his wife, who died aged 79 in 1999 .

The book also charted his courtship of the young writer and how he fell in love when he saw her riding a bike through Oxford. The pair had never spoken. He also admitted that his wife had a string of affairs during their 43-year marriage. Later, Professor Bayley went on to write two more books as part of a three-part series devoted to his wife. They had been married for 43 years. The final of the trilogy, Widower’s House, published in 2011, depicted life after his wife’s death.

"President Barack Obama's top military adviser said Sunday that while he hasn't seen the need for ground troops in Iraq so far, there's a strong chance combat troops will be needed to fight the Islamic State in the future. 'Yeah, there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes,' Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview with ABC that aired on This Week. 'But I haven't encountered one right now,' he added. Dempsey's interview aired on the same day Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned that Islamic radicals are perilously close to taking a key city along Syria's border with Turkey. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC that there may be 'circumstances' in the future when ground troops will be needed in Iraq . The U.S. has launched more than two dozen airstrikes against ISIS in the Kobane region, and 'some progress made,' but the situation continues to be 'dangerous,' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday during a trip to Chile, according to BBC. A Kobane official told Reuters that fighters on the ground do not have enough weapons. And 'without weaponry, is not going to make a critical difference,' he said. A senior Kurdish official, Ismet Sheikh Hasan, told the Associated Press on Friday that airstrikes had not deterred ISIS and warned that a massacre would occur if the international community did not step in. He also urged Turkey to open a closed-off corridor to Kobane's remaining residents and to allow arms to flow through the country to Kurds fighting against ISIS just over the border. Turkey has been unwilling to intervene in the violence taking place in the Syrian city, even after the U.S. State Department dispatched Gen. John Allen to the country last Thursday to plead for their help. Allen is coordinating the Obama administration's assault on ISIS. The Syrian border state has long said its strategy would focus on taking out its neighboring country's corrupt president, Bashar al Assad, not Islamic radicals. 'The government is not going to budge on this,' a Turkish official told the Wall Street Journal on Friday. 'As long as you have Assad there, with his policies of dropping barrel bombs, chemical weapons, this vicious cycle is going to continue on and on with more groups, different groups, coming in.' The U.S. has also refused to engage ISIS militarily in Syria, even as it has acknowledged the limitations of it's airstrike campaign. Gen. Dempsey confirmed Sunday that it is becoming more and more difficult for the U.S. to identify suitable targets in Iraq and Syria to bomb as the war against ISIS rages on. 'An enemy adapts and they’ll be harder to target,' Dempsey said. 'They know how to maneuver and how to use populations and concealment.' In a portion of the interview that aired earlier in the week, Dempsey told ABC News' Martha Raddatz that ISIS is 'becoming more savvy with the use of electronic devices.' 'They don't fly flags and move around in large convoys the way they did. ... They don't establish headquarters that are visible or identifiable.' The four-star general did not specifically advocate for the use of U.S. combat forces in the battle against ISIS, but he's said in the past that he would make that recommendation if push came to shove. A circumstance that could call for U.S. military involvement on the ground, for example, would be a mission to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, Dempsey told a Senate committee last month, speaking hypothetically. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd yesterday that up to this point, however, 'there has been no recommendation' by 'military commanders, either on the ground, nor here in Washington, that the United States put any ground combat forces into Iraq. 'That has not come up the chain to anybody at the White House. And I don't anticipate that it will,' she said, citing the president's promises that he would not send U.S. troops into Iraq to engage in combat. 'The president has been very plain that this is not a campaign that requires or even would benefit from American ground troops in combat again.' President Barack Obama meets with military senior leadership to receive an update on the campaign to combat Islamic State last Wednesday. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, left, and Dempsey, right, sit next to the president. Hagel cautioned on Sunday that ISIS was dangerously close to taking control of Kobane, a Syrian city that's a stone's throw away from Turkey . Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Kobane this morning. An Islamic State suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives on Monday in the besieged Kurdish town near the Turkish border crossing with Syria, a monitoring group and Kurdish sources said . The Obama administration official said the United States' previous involvement in Iraq serves as proof that the country will not be able to stave off terrorists like ISIS after the United States leaves if its citizens 'aren't willing and committed' to protecting their country. 'It's not going to happen overnight. But if it isn't achieved, nothing is going to be sustainable,' she said. 'So people need to understand there are going to be good days, bad days, victories, and setbacks, as the Iraqis themselves take this fight to ISIL.' Rice threw her full support behind the president's strategy to eliminate ISIS  and encouraged Obama's critics to give him more breathing room. 'This is going to take time,' she said. 'It can't judged by merely what happens in one particular town or in one particular region. 'The American people need to understand that our aim here is long-term degradation and building the capacity of our partners.' Turkish soldiers hold their position on a tank as they keep an eye on Kobane on Monday. The strategic border town, located just a mile outside of Turkey, has been beseiged by Islamic State militants since mid-September . Meanwhile,  ISIS has inched closer and closer to taking control of Kobane, which is located less than a mile away from the country's border with Turkey. The Islamic State is also making an aggressive play for the Baghdad airport in Iraq. Republican Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate's Armed Forces and Foreign Relations committees, said Sunday that he believes ISIS could capture the airport in Iraq's capitol city. 'They're winning, and we're not,' McCain said of ISIS on CNN's State of the Union. 'The Iraqis are not winning. The Peshmerga, the Kurds are not winning. 'There has to be a fundamental re-evaluation of what we're doing because we are not...""degrading and ultimately destroying ISIS"" ' as the Obama administration has said it would, McCain said. The former Republican presidential nominee said the U.S. needed to provide arms to both the Peshmerga and moderate rebels who are part of the Free Syrian Army. He also called on President Obama to expand his strategy against ISIS to include deposing al Assad. 'You have to go after ISIS and Bashar al Assad at the same time or you will not succeed,' he said. Former McCain adviser and business executive Carly Fiorina separately argued on Fox News Sunday that Obama has to follow through on his previous promise to hold Assad accountable for his actions. Obama has said he wants Assad out, but he 'clearly doesn't believe,' Fiorina, a dark horse 2016 presidential candidate, charged. She further claimed that Obama 'never had a strategy in Syria' and 'there is no explanation' for the way he's inconsistent policies toward the country. 'Meanwhile, things continue to go from bad to worse,' she said, according to Politico.","'Yeah, there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes,' Gen. Martin Dempsey said in an interview that aired Sunday .
'But I haven't encountered one right now,' he added .
Dempsey confirmed that it is becoming more difficult for the U.S. to identify suitable targets in Iraq and Syria to bomb .
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned Sunday that ISIS is perilously close to taking the city of Kobane along Syria's border with Turkey ."
