"One of football's great novelties will take place on Thursday afternoon as Mali and Guinea draw lots to decide which will advance from Group D at the Africa Cup of Nations. The two nations finished joint second behind the Ivory Coast with identical records - they both drew all three of their matches, scored three times and conceded three times. And so, at 3pm UK time during a Confederation of African Football meeting at the Malabo Hilton hotel, a ball will be picked out of a pot to determine which of the pair will take on Ghana in the quarter-final on Sunday. Mali and Guinea will learn their Africa Cup of Nations fate when lots are drawn on Thursday afternoon . Guinea coach Michel Dussuyer has been outspoken in his criticism of the drawn lots system . His Mali counterpart Henryk Kasperczak was in agreement at the harshness of the drawn lots method . A statement on the official tournament website explained the procedure: . 'In pursuant to Article 74 of the regulations of the Orange Africa Cup of Nations, a random draw will be conducted to determine the second place team in Group B, between Mali and Guinea. 'The draw will take place during the meeting of the Organising Committee of the Africa Cup of Nations on Thursday, 29 January 2015 at 16H00 local time at the Hilton Malabo. 'There will be two balls with position two (2) and position three (3), and the representative of the two teams will pick a ball from the pot. The one who picks position two (2) qualifies for the quarter final.' The drawing of lots is certainly a cruel way to be eliminated from any football tournament since it comes down entirely to luck rather than skill. And that's not been lost on the two managers, who have been outspoken in their criticism of this 'last resort' of splitting teams. 'We have to solve the problems of qualification without a drawing of lots,' said the Mali coach Henryk Kasperczak after his team drew 1-1 with Guinea on Wednesday afternoon. 'We must find a more sporting way. This does not correspond to a sporting spirit.' His Guinea counterpart Michel Dussuyer agreed: 'Mali do not deserve to be eliminated in this way, just as we do not.'

Both camps have endured an agonising wait, with the draw originally due to take place immediately after the match before being moved to Thursday. It is not without precedent at the Africa Cup of Nations. In 1988, Algeria went through from the group at the expense of the Ivory Coast following the drawing of lots. And this situation has also arisen at the World Cup on two occasions. In 1954, a qualifying match between Turkey and Spain played in Rome ended in stalemate and a 14-year-old boy, the son of a stadium employee, was called onto the pitch to draw lots from a trophy. He picked out Turkey, sending them to the World Cup finals in Switzerland and condemning Spain to a summer at home. The drawing of lots ceremony will mean an anxious wait for fans of both nations . And at the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland were tied for second place in their group. Both were guaranteed qualification for the second round but their ranking had to be determined and so Sepp Blatter, then FIFA's second-in-command, drew lots live on television in Rome. He inserted a slip of paper bearing each teams' names into each of two orange plastic balls and then marked another two yellow balls with the numbers 2 and 3 for the positions. He then asked a World Cup hostess in a blue uniform to pull a ball from each bowl. The decision proved crucial - Ireland drew Romania in the last 16 and beat them, while the Dutch were paired with eventual winners West Germany and went out.","Lots will be drawn to see whether Mali or Guinea make it through .

"Since the 1930s it has been an iconic part of the South London skyline, appeared on a Pink Floyd album cover and in several films. Now investors into an £8bn project to develop Battersea Power Station are allowing a sneak preview of what the multibillion-pound development will look like in a bid to attract the best businesses and retailers - and heading out on a 'global tour' to promote them. The project will see the 42-acre former . brownfield site transformed into homes, shops, cafes, offices and public . space, including the restoration of the Grade II-listed power station. Scroll down for video . Foreign investors have been given a sneak preview of what the multibillion-pound development at the iconic Battersea Power Station will look like . The £8 billion project, backed by a consortium of Malaysian investors, will see the 42-acre former brownfield site transformed into homes, shops, cafes, offices and public space, including the restoration of the Grade II-listed power station . Shareholders and representatives behind the redevelopment will market the project to 13 cities in 11 countries in October and November to find UK and global brands, businesses and restaurants to take up residence at the landmark London site. Announcing the global tour, Battersea Power Station Development Company chief executive Rob Tincknell said it was vital to get the ingredients right for the 'cocktail' that will form the huge development. Building work began in July 2013 - the building's 80th anniversary - with the overall development hoped to be completed in 2025 and the power station itself open to the public for the first time in more than 30 years in 2019. The project is divided into seven phases, each designed by specialist architects including award-winning Frank Gehry, and once complete the development is expected to see 25,000 people living and working on site, with 40 million visits anticipated each year. Mr Tincknell said the global tour was about finding the best overseas occupants for the site, as well as the best of British. He said: 'Because it's a mix of uses it will become much more attractive to a wider group of potential investors and occupiers. 'We want the best local tenants, the best British tenants, but we want the best international occupiers too. 'It's a carefully-curated cocktail of different uses - the offices are really important, the retail is extremely important, and the residential aspect is really important, and if we don't get each individual part right the other parts will suffer. The never seen before artists impressions of what the iconic site will look like followng its completion are being taken on a global 'tour' in a bid to attract the best businesses and retailers . The project is divided into seven phases, each designed by specialist architects including award-winning Frank Gehry, and once complete the development is expected to see 25,000 people living and working on site, with 40 million visits anticipated each year . 'That cocktail isn't going to taste right if you're missing a vital ingredient.' Mr Tincknell said the project was going 'extraordinarily well' with more than 1,100 apartments already sold. He said there was clear support from the public and urged any critics to come and 'see for themselves'. 'The residential sales that we have done have been extraordinarily successful. We've had more demand than any scheme in London has ever achieved before,' he said. 'This is a valuable investment - the commercial space at Battersea Power Station creates something like 15,000 jobs for London, it creates £1 billion of income for the British Government. 'This is an inward investment story for London. It's the total opposite of any idea of creating a ""ghost town"". 'The proof is in the pudding. We have already seen the public supporting us. We understand what makes a large mixed-use project, we're delivering that and it's being supported.' Mr Tincknell said his position at the helm of the 'Everest of real estate' had become more of a 'quest' than a job. Building work began in July 2013 - the building's 80th anniversary - with the overall development hoped to be completed in 2025 and the power station itself open to the public for the first time in more than 30 years in 2019 . During the tour, which will see exhibitions in London, Kuala Lumpur, New York, Dubai, Paris, Los Angeles, Milan, Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Doha, developers will be looking for businesses to lease the 3.5 million sq ft of commercial space . 'It's a privilege to be leading the scheme and an absolute joy to be working with shareholders who really understand what makes a complex project like this work and have demonstrated such enormous commitment to London. 'They have done something which no other developer was ever able to do - they have unlocked Battersea Power Station.' 'It's a challenge; we're not there yet, but we're extremely confident we're going to get there. 'The challenge is to maximise the opportunity because we can do things with this site that we couldn't do anywhere else in the world. 'I honestly believe it would be remiss of us as developers if we didn't take that opportunity.'

"Rosie O'Donnell has gone ballistic...again. This time it's because producers of The View, backed by Whoopi Goldberg, want to draw in a younger audience and to that end add flash sales to the mix and finally fill the fifth seat - with a much younger host, a show insider tells MailOnline. The View is desperately trying to find younger viewers. Hosted by Whoopi, 58, Rosie, 52, Nicolle Wallace, 42, and Rosie Perez, 50, the show is drawing in a much older AARP-friendly audience. ABC executives are intent on making changes in an effort to attract viewers in the 18-to-34 demographic, an age group coveted by advertisers. Currently, The View is being crushed in the 18-to-34 demo group by both The Wendy Williams Show (in first place) and new talk show The Real (in second). Scroll down for video . The old: Gone is the all-white studio that research showed 'made the show feel old' The new: They've added blue, yellow and orange panels with matching lighting to the stage and a multicolored backdrop on the jumbo screen behind their desk . 'ABC is really concerned about how poorly The View is performing with younger audiences. They never thought The Real would beat them out in key demographics and now they have to do something to make the show more youthful, which is hard when the average age of your co-host is 50,' a source at the network told MailOnline. A popular trend with younger TV viewers on all talk shows is the flash sale segment, offering exclusive bargains to viewers. The Wendy Williams Show, The Talk and Good Morning America all regularly do segments where they announce on TV that the audience can buy an item at a super low price from the show's website for a limited time. The View did a version of this segment last summer that was popular with viewers. But when Whoopi announced yesterday that they would be doing the segment next Monday, dubbing it the 'Must-Have Flash Sale,' a shocked O'Donnell expressed concern on live TV. 'I didn't know we were doing that. That makes us like the home shopping club, what is that?' she asked. Status quo: Her sweatshirt logo notwithstanding. Rosie's not happy with the way things are shaking out . Numero uni: Wendy Williams is grabbing a much younger audience in the all-important younger demographic . And in second place: The Talk stars (from left) Sara Gilbert, Sheryl Underwood, guest Bellamy Young, Julie Chen, Sharon Osbourne and Aisha Tyler are also reaching more younger viewers than The View . Whoopi replied: 'It's something that allows us to keep changing our set.' Rosie shot back: 'I didn't enjoy those, but maybe it’s just me. Keep going,' and then went into an uncomfortable giggle. At the end of the show in the production meeting, O'Donnell went nuclear. 'Why didn't someone tell me about this segment? Who in the hell approved that concept? 'I hated it on the previous version of the show. I won't stand for this crap,' she yelled at producers, who sat and took their scolding. The executive producer attempted to explain to an irate O'Donnell that the concept tests well with other shows and younger viewers love it. That made her explode even more. 'Don't give me that bull***t,' she screamed. 'Stop trying to change this show to get younger viewers. This is not what I signed up for.' ABC has already begun quietly scouting for a fifth co-host to join the panel - a younger personality under 35 who has a strong social media following and a definitive voice. The original format for The View centered around five co-hosts and network executives feel now is the time to bring that back. Go with the flow: Whoopi seems large and in charge at The View these days . Talks of them adding a fifth new co-host as soon as January has also upset O'Donnell, who wants the show to go an entire year without a fifth person. 'Rosie O has made it clear she's not happy about the network looking for a fifth co-host. She hates the idea that they are trying to be competitive with the younger audience and thinks they should cater to the people who are currently watching the show,' says the source. The View has had two changes to the set since their September 15 premiere show. Two weeks ago, they finally ditched the loveseats and low table that viewers dogged on social media. They added brown velvet chairs and a higher table, though co-host Wallace complained 'it still wasn't quite high enough.' Whoopi even griped on air about hitting her knees on the table. On Monday, the show unveiled their second more drastic overhaul to the set. Gone is the all-white studio that research showed 'made the show feel old' and now they have added blue, yellow and orange panels with matching lighting to the stage and a multicolored backdrop on the jumbo screen behind their desk. They've also stopped the walking from the back of studio in Oprah Winfrey-like fashion and now enter on stage behind their desk. 'The set change and new entrance was done to make the show look and feel younger. They're trying anything now to appeal to a youthful demo. Only time will tell if it works,' offered the source.","Rosie O'Donnell went ballistic when she learned The View will be selling discounted merchandise to draw in a younger audience .

"When Gerard and Christina White moved into their home 37 years ago, they felt the leafy street of detached properties was among the finest in the suburb. But the couple fear their £275,000 home is now unsellable – after an extension on the house next door effectively turned the Whites’ three-bedroom detached property into a semi. The two 1930s houses originally stood 4ft apart but are now separated by only inches. They stand so close together that their roofs and gutters overlap. Scroll down for video . Too close for comfort: Since the extension has been built, there is only a gap of a few inches . How it was: The gap between the Birmingham homes used to be around four foot . Gerard and Christina White say the huge extension will knock thousands off the value of their home . Mrs White, 65, a retired deputy headmistress, said: ‘All professionals involved agree the build is not according to plan but, as far as we know, the planning department intends no further action. ‘This will knock thousands off the value of our home. In fact, it probably makes it unsellable.’ Mr White, 70, a retired motor engineer, said 345 people from their neighbourhood of Moseley, Birmingham, had signed a petition against the plans, including 125 from their own street. Buy-to-let landlord Mohammed Nazir bought the house next door for £225,000 in December 2012 and submitted plans to extend the detached home at the front, side and rear. The plans were due to leave only a 12-inch gap between the properties. The Whites objected, fearing the extension would block out light to the rear of their home, and would leave them struggling to address any maintenance issues because of the two homes’ close proximity. The plans – under which a garage and conservatory are replaced with additional living space, as well as a new rear dining room and the addition of a fourth bedroom upstairs – were approved by Birmingham City Council in June last year. But to the Whites’ horror, the side extension went up only eight inches from their property. They complained and the council halted the building work while the issue was investigated. Last week the council wrote to the Whites saying that the extension would be allowed to remain. The Whites say they are now unable to maintain their wall and guttering problems could damage their home . The couple are shocked after building work extended the house next door to within inches of their property . The letter from planning support officer Martin Mackay said: ‘While the development as built is not considered ideal by officers, it is considered not sufficiently harmful to warrant formal enforcement action.’ He added that the Whites may wish to ‘pursue the matter with your neighbour and if necessary, through a civil court’. Mr Nazir’s application for the ‘single storey front and rear extension and two storey side extension’ was approved subject to conditions which stipulated that the build ‘must be in accordance with the plans’. Mrs White said she was shocked that the council failed to order him to rebuild the extension to the original plan. Local MP Steve McCabe says planning conditions to ensure space between the homes was ignored . Birmingham council says the work is not sufficiently different from that approved to require them to take action . Local residents have signed a petition against the development, which has been branded 'a monstrosity' She added: ‘We’ve lost a degree of the morning light because it’s blocked by the wall. Their guttering lies underneath ours which renders theirs completely useless and is bound to cause problems when we have heavy rainfall.’ Mr Nazir was not at the property yesterday and could not be contacted for comment. Michael Healy, a surveyor who acted as his agent on the planning application, said: ‘I drew up the plans but he (Mr Nazir) didn’t stick to them.’ A council spokesman said the case has now been closed.","Suburban Birmingham homes used to have clear gap between them .

"Stick men, scribbles and smiley faces might be what you would expect to see inside the notebooks of bored students. But the discovery of doodles adorning the margins and blank pages of the world's oldest manuscripts prove that medieval scribes got just as distracted at work as you do. Dr Erik Kwakkel, a book historian from Leiden University, Netherlands, revealed that there are two types of medieval doodle. Dr Erik Kwakkel, a book historian from Leiden University, Netherlands, believes the doodles, often made by monastic scribes  are 'the closest we can get to the users of these books and their lives' He highlighted the idle shapes that we all produce and also said the monastic scribes would perform 'pen trials' to get the nibs of the quills flowing after regular cutting. The least imaginative doodlers would write, repeatedly, 'probatio pennae' ('I test my pen'). Dr Kwakkel told the Independent on Sunday: 'This was a time when a book cost as much as a second-hand car today and there was no scrap paper. 'One of the few places you could test your pen were the pages of completed books. There are two type of medieval doodles,  'pen trials' to get the nibs of the quills flowing after regular cutting and the idle shapes that we all make . Dr Kwakkel uses these accidental signatures to trace the movement and work of scribes . 'They are the closest we can get to the users of these books and their lives.' The 44-year-old has studied scribes who moved from the Netherlands to Kent. 'You can see how they adapted their writing style. But when you look at their pen trials, they switch back,' he said. Dr Kwakkel uses these accidental signatures to trace the movement and work of scribes, the nameless printers and photocopiers of their time. They also offer clues about personality and mood, with law manuscripts featuring more smiley faces than other types of work, the academic says. 'In general there is hardly any book that doesn't have at least one addition to the text. Some books have lots from different scribes, opening a window on the scriptorium, writing room].'","Medieval doodles adorn the margins of the world's oldest manuscripts .

"Dissolving dead bodies  to create a brown, foul-smelling syrup may sound gruesome, but that’s exactly what some people are hoping to happen to them once they pass away. The process is called alkaline hydrolysis and was developed more than two decades ago to get rid of animal carcasses. It’s a more efficient and environmentally-friendly of getting rid of dead bodies, according to scientists. Alkaline hydrolysis uses lye, 300°C heat and huge amounts of pressure to destroy bodies in big stainless-steel cylinders that look similar to pressure cookers. Scroll down for video . The process involves submerging the body in a solution of water and potassium hydroxide, which is then pressurised and heated for two-and-a-half to three hours. Pictured a machine in which the body is dissolved . Caitlin Doughty, a mortician from Los Angeles, has used her latest YouTube blog to explain the process with the help of a disco ball Absolut Vodka bottle and a silk purse. ‘The dead body is put in a silk bag’ explains the 30-year-old. ‘That silk bag is putting into a metal tube that looks like the cryogenic tank they put Mel Gibson in, in Forever Young.’ The process involves submerging the body in a solution of water and potassium hydroxide, which is then pressurised and heated for two-and-a-half to three hours. This leaves a green-brown tinted liquid containing amino acids, peptides, sugars and salts and soft, porous white bone remains which are easily crushed. In 2011, America's first funeral home which cremates bodies by liquefying them has been ordered to stop the controversial practice. Officials at Ohio Department of Health say the procedure called alkaline hydrolysis using lye and heat is not approved under state law. Jeff Edwards, owner of the funeral business Columbus, had used the method on 19 bodies before he was told to stop the practice. The health department ordered officials not to issue permits or accept death certificates when bodies are to be disposed of by alkaline hydrolysis. But Mr Edwards said: 'There's no law that says you can't do this.' According to James Olson, chairman of the National Funeral Directors Association's green burial work group, the procedure merely speeds up the body's natural decomposition process into a matter of hours. He said at the time: 'I think burning a body at 2,000 degrees has more of a ""yuck factor"" to it than putting it into a solution where it's just naturally going to break down.' Because of its environmental advantages, some in the funeral industry say it could someday rival burial and cremation. It also eliminates concerns about crematorium emissions, including carbon dioxide, which can be released into the air as part of the process. But getting the public to accept the process is challenge. The process enables a portion of the human remains to be flushed down a drain, and some have branded this ‘undignified.’ ‘I’m guessing that the people who say that, don’t know that in the embalming process, for a traditional funeral, the blood drained out of the body goes right down the drain,’ said Ms Doughty. As well as the liquid, the process leaves a dry residue similar in appearance to cremated remains. It could be returned to the family in an urn or buried in a cemetery.

"A ramshackle garage in north London that does not even come with planning permission has gone on sale for £359,950. The 640 square foot single-storey building is located in Springdale Mews in Stoke Newington - where the average house price is in excess of £614,000. A spokesman for Courtneys estate agent, who is advertising the garage, said:  'I know it seems crazy, but that's just the market. It could be a good investment.' Scroll down for video . The 640 square foot single-storey garage in Stoke Newington is being advertised for £359,950 . A Courtneys estate agent said: 'I know it seems crazy, but that's just the market. It could be a good investment' The garage is the latest in a trend of tiny plots of land without planning permission that are being advertised or sold for huge sums because of the  shortage of housing in London . On the Courtneys website, it says: 'The property is in a very quiet and central area just north of Newington Green with Dalston and Stoke Newington Church Street also very close by. 'Based on a few other former garages in the same mews road being developed into residental premises, we believe that this property can be developed into a two-storey three-bedroom mews house.' According to the agents, a similar sized three-bed ex-council house in the area would cost in excess of £460,000. A similar garage in the same road was converted into a home in 2007 – and is now being rented out for £350 a week. But specialist architect Martyn Brown, the managing director of Everchanging Mews, warned of the extra costs that come when developing garages. He told the Evening Standard: 'I would estimate you could spend the same again as the purchase price - between £300,000 and £350,000. It could take between 12 and 18 months to do - depending on how long getting planning permission takes and the state of the property. 'Also, as it is one of the first in this row to be converted, you could be living on a building site for 10 years as the rest of them are turned into houses.' The average price in Greater London hit £533,489 between April and June – up 12 per cent from last year . Because of the shortage of housing in London, tiny plots of land without planning permission are being sold . The garage is the latest in a trend of tiny plots of land without planning permission that are being advertised or sold for huge sums because of the chronic shortage of housing in London. Last month, a row of three 1950s garages near Wandsworth Common sold for £500,000 — four times the guide price — after an auction bidding frenzy. The new owner is expected to apply to demolish the lock-ups and build a house on the site, in the desirable residential area. In May, six garages in affluent Parsons Green sold for £700,000. And in April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war. The brick-built former coach house was used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car. In April, this garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court was sold for £550,000 in an auction . In August 2013, a 224sqft Highgate lock-up which was transformed into a studio flat sold for £250,000. Two months later, a double garage in the area sold for £251,000. Across London as a whole, the average home is now worth more than half a million pounds, according to the latest Land Registry figures. The average price in Greater London hit £533,489 between April and June – up 12 per cent on the same time last year. This compared to the average house price in England and Wales that reached £256,883 by June. For the same price as the garage, buyers could get this castle in Clackmannanshire, Scotland . Buyers could also snap up the six-acre Caribbean island of 'Bonefish' cay in the Bahamas for £360,000 . This Grade-II listed pub, Ye Old Star Inn, in East Yorkshire, that also has an 11 bedroom hotel and restaurant is being sold for the same price as the North London garage . For the same price as the dilapidated North London garage, prospective buyers could snap up the six-acre Caribbean island of 'Bonefish' cay in the Bahamas. The luxury island that has two long, white beaches is currently unoccupied, but an area has been landscaped in preparation for a luxury house. Alternatively, they could buy 'Mansion House' in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, part of a former Scots Baronial Castle close to the town of Dollar. The house is set within 5 acres of gardens and grounds. They could also purchase an East Yorkshire pub - the Grade-II listed Ye Old Star Inn - in the Old Town area of Bridlington that comprises an 11 bedroom hotel and a restaurant. In 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping £1.25million asking price. In 2012 a six-metre long garage (pictured below) went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's richest people. The garage in Knightsbridge (pictured) is part of a trend that has seen sales in garages boom in recent years . In August 2013, a 224sqft Highgate lock-up which was transformed into a studio flat sold for £250,000. Two months later, a double garage in the area sold for £251,000. In April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war. In May, six garages in affluent Parsons Green sold for £700,000.

"A group of Eastern European builders have been found living in portable cabins while working on a multi-million pound redevelopment in central Manchester. The six Latvian men, who have been spotted walking around the site topless during the day, will now be removed from outside Jactin House after residents complained of late-night drinking and anti-social behaviour. The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) said it is considering legal action against Manchester-based developers Northern Group after it was made aware of the situation at the property - which is being transformed into office space. The group of Latvian builders have been living in portable cabins outside Jactin House in Manchester while they work on a multi-million pound redevelopment . Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said she would be seeking answers as to how the situation had been allowed on a government site. She said: 'Workers shouldn’t have to live in these conditions and residents shouldn’t have to put up with this disturbance after hours. 'This shouldn’t happen on any site, let alone one funded through a government agency. 'I’ll be getting in touch with the agencies involved to get to the bottom of this. Action needs to be taken to rectify this situation for all concerned.' Six Latvian workers have been observed living in portable cabins in the car park of the derelict site on Hood Street over the last four weeks. The HCA-owned former mill workers’ hostel is undergoing a £5million transformation to accommodate new businesses - funded by the European Regional Development Fund. A HCA spokesman said: 'The Homes and Communities Agency strongly opposes the unsanctioned use of Jactin House as a temporary place of residency during the construction period, which breaches the terms of Northern Group’s lease. Anger: Residents have complained that the men are involved in anti-social behaviour and late-night drinking . 'We are taking action to put a stop to this, and are reviewing our legal options.' After being told of the HCA’s response Northern Group said it would take immediate action and be removing the workers by Monday. Councillor Bernard Priest said: 'The city council does not encourage, nor does it condone developers allowing their contractors to live on-site.' Work on the site is expected to be completed next summer. Once completed the five-storey building will house office space as well as community facilities, including a gym and a nursery. Sean Wood, construction manager of Ancoats-based developer Northern Group, said the company would find new accommodation for the workers. Action: The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) have said they will take legal action against the Northern Group, the builders' employers, after they were made aware of the situation . He said: 'One of the subcontractor teams working on this site are living in Health and Safety Executive approved accommodation supplied by Oldham-based company Bunkabin. 'This kind of accommodation is used across Europe and very similar to that used by workers on London’s Olympic Park. 'Our subcontractors have expressed no dissatisfaction with the standard of accommodation whatsoever. 'However, it has been brought to our attention that the HCA believes the use of these cabins to contravene the terms of our lease and we will act on this immediately and find new accommodation for the six workers affected. 'We would like to add that late night noise on our site is unacceptable to us and all complaints are dealt with immediately.'","The six workers have been living outside Jactin House in Manchester .

"After passing the sign reading 'Danger Falling Aliens,' New Mexico artist Roy Lohr and dog Yoda lead visitors to the 'Spaceport' he has built in his backyard out of wine bottles and cement. It's no wonder the lanky 69-year-old embraces the real Spaceport America in his town's backyard, the world's first space base built expressly for commercial launches and soon-to-be site of the first space flights with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. 'It is hard for locals to realize the impact it is going to have, but it is slow coming and this is a tiny little town,' said Lohr. But he has no doubt 'things are happening.' Final preparations: Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, is preparing to welcome the world's first space tourists after a decade of construction work at the $212 million Spaceport America comes to an end . The inaugural flight of the six-passenger SpaceShipTwo should take place this year, carrying Branson from the 12,000-foot  runway to suborbital space about 65 miles from Earth. 'As always, safety will ultimately call the shots, but right now, I’m planning to go to space in 2014!' Branson wrote in an e-mail this week. The first of some 700 'astronauts,' who have already paid $250,000 for the two-hour-plus flight and some minutes of weightlessness, should follow a month later. Final sight on Earth: A sign for Spaceport America's main runway is seen in front of the Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space Building near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico . Unique design: The roofline of Spaceport America blends into the landscape near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, while one of the bases own firetrucks is parked outside the distinctive structure . Soaring: Virgin Galactic's first generation of commercial space vehicles will take-off into space and land from the New Mexico base by the end of 2014 . Almost there: The world's first purpose-built commercial space base and soon-to-be site of the first space flights with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is near to completion at Truth or Consequences in New Mexico . After 10 years of conception and construction at the state-run, taxpayer-funded, $212-million Spaceport, the people of Truth or Consequences, population 6,500, are sensing a shift in confidence as the countdown nears. While the economic windfall is difficult to estimate for the town that famously renamed itself after a radio quiz show in 1950, most everyone in these parts agrees the Spaceport should inject new energy into the somewhat tattered and totally quirky T or C, as it is known in local parlance. 'There might have been some doubt about how much T or C would be ready for all of this future endeavor,' said Cydney Wilkes, who bought and renovated a motel with wife Val a few years ago and called it, aptly, Rocket Inn. 'I think that in the last few months that shifted ... that maybe we can pull up and measure up,' she added, noting that the Virgin team is helping the hospitality industry spiffy up. Ground control: The main runway mission control is seen at Spaceport America while (right) a picture from 2011 shows a gangway inside the structure from which passengers will be able to see the spaceplane . Protected: A view of the perimeter fence of Spaceport America near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico where the inaugural flight into suborbital space should happen later this year and the first astronauts, who have made reservations and paid $250,000 for the flight, should follow a month later . Welcome: Guests stand outside the new Spaceport America hangar in 2011 as British billionaire Richard Branson dedicated the newly completed terminal Monday where his Virgin Galactic is slated to begin his commercial space tourism venture . There's a new Walmart north of town, next to where a Spaceport visitors center will go up. It is not yet known where Virgin will lodge the astronauts for three days of training. It could choose the bigger town of Las Cruces to the south. But T or C's townspeople are particularly proud that Ted Turner, the media mogul turned conservationist and local rancher, bought the historic Sierra Grande Lodge last year, citing myriad reasons, including Spaceport, his friend Branson and the famous waters of the dusty town once called Hot Springs. The 30-mile drive out to Spaceport America over the sparsely populated high desert plain is a journey through time. Paleo-Indians roamed here some 12,000 years ago, the Spanish built the El Camino Real passage here, a century-old dam across the Rio Grande brought settlement and White Sands Missile Range made it a gigantic area of restricted air space. While Spaceport brings a futuristic vision to the old West, it is meant to blend in. The signature building, designed by the firm of British architect Sir Norman Foster, melds into the distant mountains like a giant portobello mushroom. Preparing for boom times: The town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico is expecting to grow when Spaceport America launches . Primitive form of travel: A man cycles into the town of Truth or Consequences while motels expect to see no more vacancy's by this time next year . Feeding time for astronauts: A man walks past the Happy Belly Deli in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico . I am ready to meet their leadrrs: Artist Roy Lohr, 69, stands by a sign at his home in Truth or Consequences. While it's not clear what the economic impact will be, many agree that Spaceport America should inject new energy into the town . 'It feels much more real, but it also feels like I am looking at something that is a set for a science-fiction movie,' said visitor Doug Sporn while on the Follow The Sun tour to Spaceport after hearing Branson would go to space soon. The fact that the spaceport is more than half an hour's drive from . anywhere complicates matters. The spaceport has to have its own water . supply, fire trucks and resident crew of firefighters, for example. Branson isn't the only famous entrepreneur here. He is joined by Elon Musk's SpaceX, founded in 2002 with the ultimate goal of sending people to inhabit other planets. SpaceX, which already has craft supplying the International Space Station, has chosen Spaceport to test the Falcon 9 reusable rocket, meaning that it will launch vertically and then land intact. 'It really is the democratization of space,' said Spaceport Executive Director Christine Anderson, 'that you and I and our children and grandchildren can think about going to space, about going to Mars.' Edgin closer: Arnold Schwarzenegger (L) and Sir Richard Branson stand next to a model as Virgin Galactic unveils its new SpaceShipTwo spacecraft in 2009 . Spaceport America's Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space Building is seen at the end of the road to the main runway, near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico on May 1, 2014 . She estimates there will be 200,000 visitors per year to Spaceport 'when all our customers are flying.' Those kinds of numbers are feeding the first shoots of space business, from Jeff Dukatt's psychedelic T-shirts sporting a cowboy-on-rocket motif to Follow The Sun's new Spaceplace tour base where freeze-dried ice cream is for sale and there is extra space for start-ups to operate. 'We don't know where the opportunities are going to be, we just know a facility like this will line us up,' said Follow The Sun's Mark Bleth, echoing the kind of wonder around town about where this all could lead. Then there . is that lingering question of whether T or C can preserve the quirky . character and Western ruggedness that has attracted free spirits and . artists for decades. 'My . guess is that the real culture and heritage of Southern New Mexico is . pretty firmly ingrained,' said Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides. 'I . would doubt that just because we start doing our spaceflights the . intrinsic character changes.' Lohr, . the artist, relishes the 'nice mini-culture embedded in a trailer . town,' and said Spaceport shouldn't detract from its charms, but rather . attract more interest in them. If he gets a free ticket, Lohr is game to go to space, but only 'if Yoda would come with me.' Ticket cost: The starting price for flights is $250,000 - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by Richard Branson and his family= . Training: Passengers are required to go through a 'Pre-Flight Experience Program', including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly . Once aboard: SpaceShipTwo will carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead. The space ship is 60ft long with a 90in diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity . Flight path: A climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, at which point SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II. The spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness, with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours. The spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound . Flight frequency: Initially one per week, eventually to have two flights per day .","In the New Mexico town of Truth or Consequences, the multi-million dollar Spaceport America is preparing to open and welcome the first commercial launches .

"Actor James Wilby’s home  is clearly one people don’t like to leave. James, best known for his aristocratic roles in Maurice, Gosford Park and  A Handful Of Dust, has lived here for 18 years. He and his wife Shana brought up their four children in the one-time rectory set in five acres at the foot of the South Downs in East Sussex. And they are not the only long-term residents in the Grade II listed house’s history. They bought it from Camilla Parker Bowles’s father Major Bruce Shand, then a widower, whose home it was for 45 years. Fit for a Duchess: Actor James Wilby and his wife Shana are selling The Laines, near Lewes, East Sussex, previously owned by the Duchess of Cornwall's father, Major Bruce Shand . Camilla has described her childhood here  as ‘perfect in every way’. It’s easy to imagine a perfect childhood here. The Laines, on the edge of Plumpton village near Lewes, has a paddock, wide lawns for playing games, a secret garden, a swimming pool and tennis court. It is a rambling, quirky home built on a slope and spread over  three floors. Partly 18th Century and partly 19th, it manages to look different from all four sides. The main rooms have high ceilings and large Georgian windows with wonderful views of the garden and Downs. Now that all but the youngest of their children – three boys and a girl aged between 25 and 13 – are flying the nest, James, 56, and Shana, 55, have decided it’s time to downsize. Stage presence: James Wilby with Anjelica Huston in 1988 film Handful of Dust . The seven-bedroom house, which also has a three/four-bedroom cottage, is on the market for £3.25 million. The only alterations the Wilbys made . since the Major’s day were to the kitchen and the room above, the oldest . part of the house. Although the kitchen is on the lower . ground floor, it’s still light, with a row of windows on one side. It’s a . lovely, long, farmhouse-style family kitchen with an Aga, a table in . the middle and a cosy  sitting area. Perfect childhood: Camilla, seen aged four, grew up in The Laines with sister Annabel . This is a large house, with seven . bedrooms, three bathrooms and a shower room. On the ground floor it’s a . bit like Cluedo, with a drawing room, billiard room, Gothic-style . conservatory, dining room, sitting room, James’s study and a playroom. Every . room has its own character. ‘They’re all full of light, with gorgeous . views. Even the downstairs loo has a view,’ says Shana. It was a case of one extreme to another when James and Shana moved here from London with three small children, looking for more space. Neither had particular connections with Sussex but Shana knew someone in the area who gave them the brochure for The Laines. They fell for it straight away. ‘We went from a flat in Notting Hill to this,’ says James. ‘We didn’t know much about gardening when we arrived.’ The gardens are fabulous, a series of  ‘rooms’ divided by yew hedges with clipped doorways leading from one to the other. ‘As an actor you get time between jobs so I’ve been able to do quite  a lot in the garden,’  says James. He also built a little wooden house at the bottom of the garden. ‘I made it for the kids but they didn’t use it much when they were younger,’ he says. ‘Once they became teenagers they disappeared down there to drink beer.’ Laines Cottage, once lived in by staff, has been let by James and Shana as a useful source of income. There’s no doubt they will miss both house and garden, but there’s no shortage of happy memories. ‘We’ve had some great parties here,’ says James. savills.co.uk, 01444 446000 .","Actor James Wilby is selling Camilla Parker-Bowles' childhood home .

"A pensioner has sparked anger among his neighbours after piling a huge collection of broken bicycles outside his home. David Watts, 73, has been running a repair business from his house in Maidstone, Kent since 1971 but now admits his hoard has got out of hand. He collects bikes quicker than he can mend or sell them and scores of them are heaped in his garden which some neighbours say has become an eyesore. Pensioner David Watts has sparked anger among his neighbours after piling hundreds of rusting bicycles outside his home in Maidstone, Kent. He admits his collection has got out of hand . Fed-up neighbours have complained to the council but the authority has told them there is nothing they can do as Mr Watts (pictured) is officially licensed as a second-hand trader . Eyesore: Maidstone Borough Council's parking department said they were powerless to act as the trailers full of bicycles are not attached to vehicles .

But officials have promised to look again at the case after more complaints from people living nearby. One resident said: 'When David ran the scrap business from the same address I had no problem with it, but this has escalated now.

'I repair neighbours' bikes - if they bring one round I'll fix it for them,' he said. 'It's a bit untidy but I can't help that, I'm an untidy person. I need something to do in my old age.' Despite being dubbed 'Scrap Metal Dave' by some neighbours, Mr Watts said he does not sell the bikes for scrap metal. He claims he makes 'around £50-a-week' selling them to locals which helps provide extra income for him and his disabled wife Maureen. He said: 'People have a problem because they don't like my trailers being parked in the public parking bays but I'm not breaking the law. 'My wife isn't happy about the whole thing and she has banned me from keeping them indoors. 'But it is a little bit of extra money that helps us to tick by.'

"House prices hit a new record high this month after jumping 11 per cent over the past year, the Nationwide said this morning. The average house price across the UK is now £189,306 – up £357, or 0.8 per cent, in just a month. This is up from the 0.2 per cent rise in July, and marks the sixteenth monthly increase in a row. House price growth is still below the one per cent month-on-month increase recorded in June, but ‘continues to outpace earnings by a wide margin’, said Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner. House prices in Britain have soared over the past two decades, according to figures released by Nationwide this morning . House prices in London soared by just under 20 per cent in the past 12 months – the fastest growth in more than a decade, Land Registry figures show. At £457,072, the average house price in London is more than two-and-a-half times the typical property across England and Wales. The last time that prices in London saw such a large increase was in March 2003. A total of 1,032 properties were sold in England and Wales for more than £1 million in May, which is a third higher than in May 2013. Around seven in 10 of these sales took place in London. Wages have been inching up by less than one per cent a year on average, Mr Gardner said. But because of historically low interest rates houses are still affordable. He said: ‘At a national level, housing affordability does not appear stretched by historic standards, in part due to the low level of mortgage rates.’ Mr Gardner added: ‘The cost of servicing a typical mortgage remains close to the long run average as a share of take home pay.’ Typical UK house prices first surpassed their 2007 peak in cash terms in May this year and they have been hitting new records every month since. Year-on-year house price growth has been in double digits since April, according to the building society's study. Despite property values reaching record highs over the summer, there have also been signs of a cool down in the market in recent months. Mortgage approvals generally dipped after stricter lending rules, which force lenders to ask for more detail about a mortgage applicant's spending habits, came into force at the end of April but approvals have since rebounded slightly. Nationwide said it is still unclear how much of the cooling in activity was due to the introduction of the new ‘Mortgage Market Review’ rules as opposed to an underlying loss of momentum in the market. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's Chief Economist, said: ‘The outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain. ‘The number of mortgage approvals fell by almost 20 per cent between January and May, suggesting that activity was cooling.’ House prices were rising at more than 25 per cent a year under Tony Blair, before crashing by more than 15 per cent after the 2007 crash . Once inflation is taken into account the 'real' cost of houses in Britain has remained relatively stable over the last decade . House prices increased in London by 3.3 per cent in July, but fell by 0.6 per cent in Yorkshire and Humberside . He said the prospect of an increase in interest rates and the squeeze on wages was beginning to hold back soaring house prices. Nationwide’s report this morning also revealed the ‘train station premium’ in Britain’s biggest cities. It found that being close to an Underground or train station in London added £40,000 to a property’s value. In Glasgow and Manchester people are willing to pay around £10,000 extra to be near good transport links. Mr Gardner said: ‘We recently examined how the proximity to a tube or railway station impacted property prices in three major cities (London, Manchester and Glasgow) after taking account of other property characteristics, such as property type, size and local neighbourhood type. ‘Our research suggests that people are willing to pay a significant premium to be close to a station. ‘The impact is most marked in London, where being located 500m from a station attracts a 10.5 per cent price premium over an otherwise identical property 1,500m from a station. ‘This is equivalent to approximately £42,000 based on the value of the typical London home. In Manchester, the premium on a typical property for being 500m from station is 4.6 per cent (£12,000), while in Glasgow the premium is 6 per cent (£9,400). ‘London homebuyers’ willingness to pay a greater premium for being close to a station compared with those in Greater Manchester and Glasgow probably reflects the greater reliance on public transport in the capital, with residents less likely to drive. ‘London also has the densest network of stations and services, with 94 per cent of properties within 1.5km of a station, compared with 72 per cent in Greater Glasgow and 69 per cent in Greater Manchester.’","House prices rose £357, or 0.8%, in August according to a Nationwide report .

"Unite's Len McCluskey who told comrades they must 'consider the incredible offer' made by state-owned Bank of China for the Grade II listed property . Labour's union paymasters have held talks to sell a historic mansion to communist China for an ‘incredible’ £21 million – more than three times the asking price. Left-wing Unite, which gives £3.5 million a year to Ed Miliband’s party, owns Esher Place in Surrey. Set in eight acres of grounds and once visited by Edward VII, the grand country house lies on the site of a building where Sir Francis Drake’s family lived. An earlier building on the site was owned by the Church and Cardinal Wolsey was kept under house arrest in its gatehouse after falling out with Henry VIII. Britain’s biggest trade union uses the mansion’s ornate rooms for conferences and training and Labour leader Miliband has visited it on a party away-day. But although Unite thinks the Grade II listed property is worth only £6.5 million, and is running it at a loss, the state-controlled Bank of China has offered three times over the odds, raising questions as to the deal between them. Secret papers seen by The Mail on Sunday reveal staff of the world’s fifth-biggest financial institution have visited Esher Place a dozen times and made a series of increasingly generous offers to buy it. The move would improve Unite’s accounts and also give the Chinese an impressive base as they expand their investments in the UK. ‘Red’ Len McCluskey, the hardliner who runs the union behind some of the country’s most disruptive strikes, told comrades at last month’s policy conference in Liverpool that they must consider the ‘incredible’ offer to ease their financial pressures. But delegates warned it would be ‘ludicrous’ to sell Unite’s ‘jewel in the crown’, and have raised questions about their leaders’ links with Communist China. The final decision had been due to be  taken in a vote by the union’s ruling Executive Council next month but last night the Bank of China claimed it had pulled out of the deal. Ed Sabisky, Unite’s executive director of finance, pensions and property, wrote in a recent letter to ‘address the queries, issues and concerns’ raised about the proposed sale that ‘the Bank of China’s extraordinary offer’ is far higher than any others received. He said Unite’s ‘financial situation remains tight’ and added: ‘If the union sold Esher Place to Bank of China for £21 million it would have more financial flexibility to meet the challenges of the coming years without having to increase member subscriptions beyond that otherwise deemed reasonable or to cut front-line services to members. Historic Esher Place in Surrey, which is owned by left-wing Unite. Set in eight acres of grounds and once visited by Edward VII, the grand country house lies on the site of a building where Sir Francis Drake's family lived . ‘Unite’s communications department has analysed the situation and cannot see any negative connotations for Unite by selling Esher Place to what is effectively the state of China (although doubtless we would be attacked by the Right-wing press because they attack us for everything we do).’ Critics said the sale’s boost to union coffers would increase Unite’s control over Labour and Mr Miliband, who has unsuccessfully tried to limit the power of the union barons who helped him become party leader. It comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed that Unite chief of staff Andrew Murray, representing the Communist Party of Britain, spoke at a rally in support of pro-Russian separatists fighting in Ukraine. An earlier building on the site of Esher Place was owned by the Church and Cardinal Wolsey, pictured, was kept under house arrest in its gatehouse after falling out with Henry VIII . David Morris, Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said last night: ‘What a tidy food chain! Communist China swelling the  coffers of militant Len McCluskey, which will give him even more power over weak Ed Miliband. ‘The unions are already almost  single-handedly funding Labour and practically writing their policies. It will only get worse now.’ A union insider said: ‘Why are the Chinese offering so much money, that’s the big question that’s being asked. The union isn’t short of cash but all of a sudden there appears to be a big rush to sell this place.’ Esher Place’s latest valuation is £6.5 million but the Bank of China has made six offers this year, topping £21 million, as well as promising to let Unite use the facilities until 2016. Bank of China is a commercial bank with a branch in the City of London, but is wholly owned and controlled by the Chinese state. Chinese banks and firms have invested billions in British industry, taking stakes in nuclear power stations and airports as well as companies such as drinks giant Diageo. A Unite spokesman claimed last night: ‘There is no offer from the Bank of China or anyone else.’ A spokesman for Bank of China’s property adviser CBRE said: ‘The bank will not be buying Unite’s property under any circumstances.’","Unite, which gives £3.5million a year to Labour, owns Esher Place in Surrey .

"Christopher Lee, 38, appeared in court last year after repeatedly lashing out at contractors who came to upgrade his kitchen and bathroom . A 29-stone 'martial arts expert' who refused an electrician access to his housing association home 'because his snake was scared' could now face eviction. Christopher Lee appeared in court last year after behaving aggressively towards contractors who came to upgrade the kitchen and bathroom at his home in Allerton, Liverpool. The court heard how one occasion he refused to let an electrician in to his home because he said that his pet snake was becoming unsettled. He was banned from being at home while further work was carried out on his property following the hearing at Liverpool Civil Court last February. But it is claimed that the 38-year-old has since refused entry to gas safety experts who needed to take annual meter readings at his home, which is owned by Liverpool Mutual Homes. Lee is also alleged to have intimidated several of his neighbours - and a change to his injunction order means that he could now face arrest if he acts in a threatening manner towards them. The court heard that his dog Matrix, a Belgian Shepherd, was a nuisance and would often bark and bare his teeth, as well as being off its lead in communal areas. Lee, who is unemployed, did not appear at the committal hearing at Liverpool Civil Court on Thursday when changes were made to the injunction order placed against him. The order already grants landlord Liverpool Mutual Homes the power to evict him from the property with just 48 hours notice. During the hearing at Liverpool Civil Court last year, it was heard how Lee kicked workers out of his house or refused them entry on a number of occasions. The court heard how the workmen had to form a human chain to stop Lee, a trained fighter, attacking them. One man said that he was too scared of Lee to appear in court last year. It was heard how, along with barring gas contractors, he has also continued abusing Liverpool Mutual Homes staff. The case was adjourned for a month while experts assess if he has any mental health problems. He has previously complained of having gout. Judge Graham Wood QC ruled that his capacity will now be independently assessed by a psychiatrist. A case management hearing will be scheduled in four weeks. Judge Wood said: 'The great concern I have is that the question of Mr Lee's capacity has been raised. Lee, who is unemployed, did not appear at the committal hearing at Liverpool Civil Court on Thursday this week where changes were made to the injunction order placed against him . 'If he is unable to understand the order or the conduct of court proceedings then that weighs heavily on my decision to limit the power of arrest. 'I will grant power of arrest for paragraph three of the order for threatening violence to the four neighbours who are witnesses and their family members. 'They must be able to proceed confidently and should not in any way feel threatened of intimidated - they are entitled to that amount of protection.'","Christopher Lee refused workmen entry to his Liverpool home .

"Millions of young women  aspire to be like Kate Moss. The Croydon-born supermodel's wardrobe has long been the envy of almost every girl in the UK. But after 20 years in the spotlight, the 40-year-old has now provided a glimpse into another aspect of her life for the fairer sex to salivate over - her beautiful north London home, during an interview with British Vogue. But while you can emulate Mossy's wardrobe with an afternoon dash around Topshop - her soft furnishings tastes will set you back much further. Scroll down for video . Kate, 40, showed off part of her home in interview with Vogue's Kate Phelan (left).  Femail enlisted MailOnline interior design expert Celia Sawyer to value the room and it came in at just under £100,000 . We used an interior design expert to decipher how much Kate had spent on her tastefully decorated living room. MailOnline property blogger Celia Sawyer also runs a west London interior design company called Cool 10 Luxury Interiors and is also one of the four art dealers on the TV programme Four Rooms. She has been looking at the items pictured in Kate's home and estimating their worth, as well as sourcing similar pieces for those interested in acquiring The Kate Look. Celia has estimated the Kate's living room alone cost in the region of £100,000 when decorating, soft furnishings and furniture are all included. She said: 'Looking into Kate's living room, I notice that her vintage style really shows throughout her room. The glimpse into Kate's private life showed off the model's good taste in decor . Celia said: 'Due to the period of the property, there is a mix of modern and traditional furniture, with contemporary velvet grey cushions, mixed with more funky retro cushions. 'Kate seems to have opted for a neutral palate which does surprise me as I would’ve seen her going for more colour and perhaps using more of a mixture of textures. 'If I were to cost up the entire room with a stylish solid dining table and chairs included I would say the total amount spent in this room is just a touch under £100,000.' Vase: . Kate likes her flowers, and roses give off the softest perfume.A similar vase is this vintage silver vase (below left), which is around £600. According to design expert Celia Sawyer, Kate Moss fans keen to imitate her style could buy a similar vase at an antique store for around £600 (left) and Kate's green cup is a typical  stem mug (above centre) and costs between £8-10. Embroidered cushions like the one on her sofa can be purchased from shopping website Etsy for £35 . Mug: . Kate has a very similar coffee mug to a 60s stem mug (pictured above centre), probably costing no more than £8-10. Sofa: . The sofa looks like it is vintage and re covered, I would think with a price of around £4,000-£6,000. The black and white zigzag cushion in the background of Kate's living room is from Day Birger Et Mikkelsen and costs £80 . Sofa cushions: . The cushions are a mix of velvet grey cushions which could be bought at Habitat for £25 and more decorative pillows. I would imagine that with Kate's image and her love of retro, vintage, she would have no problem at all at shopping in places like Ebay for these small pieces. Similar funky cushions like Kate's are these handmade decorative paisley cushions at Etsy £35 (top right). The black and white zigzag cushion in the background is from Day Birger Et Mikkelsen and costs £80 (right). Coffee table: . The coffee table looks retro 60s steel and glass, probably purchased at around about £12,000. Curtains: . The curtains in her living room look very good quality, and are thick lined and velvet and the fabric would be something like a velvet from Evitavone around £120 per metre. Kate has always been a big fan of George Michael and his latest album Symphonica is on her coffee table . George Michael DVD: . Kate has always been a big fan of George Michael and wrote a review of his latest album Symphonica in Vogue earlier this year. Her first ever record was by Wham! when she was just eight years old and her love of his music style has clearly never disappeared. On her coffee table lies a CD of the album. She said of the piece of work in March: 'George's ability to communicate as a performer and make you feel part of a journey is a rare gift. 'It's an ability that defines the musical greats and, for me, it also defines what makes such a beautiful album. 'Everyone should experience this.' Armchair near fireplace: . The armchair next to the fireplace looks like a modern take on a vintage chair, and the price tag of around £1200. Table next to windows: . This is a regency console table. It is mahogany and would cost approximately £9,000.","Kate, 40, showed off part of her north London home in interview with Vogue .

"Britain's first superyacht hotel has sailed into London. The 394ft, four star, five storey Sunborn Yacht was pulled along the Thames in April and opened to guests on Wednesday.

Situated in Royal Victoria Dock, the 394ft, four star, five storey Sunborn Yacht is London's only floating hotel . Jenny Coad aboard the Sunborn Yacht in London. The interiors of the ship reflects traditional cruise-liners . Room prices start from £160 per night, which isn't bad for a superyacht. By comparison: chartering a luxury yacht for a week costs tens of thousands of pounds, and a London hotel room is an average £127 a night. It certainly looks every inch the ship of dreams - though it isn't actually sea-worthy – and the interiors reflect traditional cruise-liners – shiny brass railings, teak wood panelling, spiral staircase, centre piece chandelier, art-deco wall lights, slightly off-putting swirly carpeting, plus very heavy doors that won't budge in a squall. It's popular, according to the General Manager, Andreas Stys, for special occasions. George R R Martin, author of Game of Thrones, extended his visit during the World Science Fiction Convention held at the ExCel centre, (which the yacht is parked next to), in August. The bar, restaurant and top deck Sky Bar (all open to non-staying guests) are in the stern of the ship, and gaze towards the city framed by the steely grey cranes lining the dock . All aboard!

It's become a popular hotspot for marriage proposals too. Those popping the question might consider booking into the Executive Suite at the bow of the ship – with its own balcony, plus sun loungers – as well as a Jacuzzi, sauna and double shower. The view from the bedroom looks out onto the converted warehouses on the other side of the dock. The ship even has a wedding license – so you could go the whole hog and come back to celebrate anniversaries (as many people do, apparently). Rooms are said to offer five metres square more space than equivalent hotels in London. They feel spacious, even at entry level, though the bathrooms are small. All rooms have tablets rather than a traditional hotel menu and free wifi. All rooms have tablets rather than a traditional hotel menu and free wifi .

"A landlord has been fined for letting a £420-a-month flat whose tenants had to crawl up a tiny staircase to get inside. Yaakov Marom continued charging for the flat in Hendon, north London, for more than a year after council officers banned him from doing so - saying the 2ft 4ins of headroom was a fire risk. Now Marom has been made to pay more than £3,000 in fines and costs after he pleaded guilty in court to breaching planning regulations. Scroll down for video . Room for a tiny tenant: A landlord has been made to pay more than £3,000 by the courts after letting out this flat in Hendon, north London, for £420 a month - despite there being as little as 2ft 4ins headroom on the staircase . Tenants . could only reach the second-floor flat by slithering up a staircase . which became increasingly cramped before hauling their bodies through a . hatch. The . staircase's headroom ranged from 3ft 11ins down to 2ft 4ins, not even . high enough for a toddler to negotiate standing upright. The door to the loft room was also reduced in size, a Barnet Council spokesman said. Council officers served Marom, 60, with a prohibition order in February 2012 which stopped him using the room for accommodation. Leave your shoes at the door: Council officers said the flat could be a death trap if a fire were to break out . But he was hauled before the courts after officials visited the house with police in September last year and found the room was still being rented by a couple for £420 a month. Marom, who lives in the same street in Hendon, pleaded guilty on August 5 to failing to comply with an order served by the council prohibiting occupation of the loft room. Willesden magistrates ordered him to pay a £1,500 fine, £1,420 in costs and a £120 victim surcharge. Barnet Council's housing committee chairman Tom Davey said: 'At the very least tenants have the right to expect that the accommodation they are renting is safe. 'Barnet Council is keen to work with landlords and help them to provide safe accommodation. 'However, those who exploit tenants for financial gain will not be tolerated and the appropriate action will be taken.'

Council officers in the upmarket borough of Islington, north London, found the flat breached planning regulations because it was too cramped. The wider squeeze on property demand in London has sent prices soaring, with areas like Hackney experiencing a 14 per cent jump in just a year to April 2014, according to Rightmove. A Barnet Council spokesman added: 'The council works closely with landlords to improve the conditions of their properties, but when this is not possible, legal action can be taken which may lead to prosecution or work being completed and costs being passed on to the landlord.'","Yaakov Marom let flat in Hendon, north London, to a couple for £420 a month .

"A ferry built in Germany before the start of the war has been put up for sale as a houseboat moored on the River Thames.

"It’s a year out of your life that’s supposed to provide the chance to experience new cultures, learn the rigors of travel and expand your mind and horizons. More often than not though, gap year returnees pick up crippling debt, tropical diseases, questionable hairstyles and STIs. Now new research commissioned by student shipping specialists 1StopShip reveals what we’ve long suspected – that gap years and travelling is not always the ‘enriching’ experience we hope for. Scroll down for video . Worth leaving home for? 62 per cent of people questioned admitted travelling didn't enrich them as a person . 1,000 backpackers across the UK were questioned on their attitudes to travelling in hindsight. The study  coincides with the start of the university term where thousands return from a year abroad – or defer studying in favour of a gap year. More than 60 per cent of people admitted it didn't enrich them as a person, while 28 per cent who originally thought they had changed for the better, revised that opinion after returning to the UK and realising they were exactly the same. Tell someone who cares: 29 per cent admitted to growing sick of their backpacking friends’ stories . A lonely road: 34 per cent admitted they struggled to get back into a work routine after being overseas . Nearly 30 per cent admitted to growing sick of their backpacking friends’ stories - and 12 per cent claimed that their friends returned with a false sense of superiority. The general consensus was that travelling can harm your employment prospects and actually lose you friends. 19 per cent said that their current boss viewed their time travelling negatively and more than a third (34 per cent) admitted they struggled to make the transition to work after returning from time abroad. Happy camper: 14 per cent said they struggled to get a job on their return compared to non-travelling friends . Not all bad: 39 per cent of backpackers saw traveling as something that reflected well on their CV . Some 14 per cent claimed their stint overseas left them dreading work and feeling unprepared and the same number had trouble getting a job because they lacked experience compared to their non-travelling fellow candidates of a similar age. Despite this, a 39 per cent of backpackers saw traveling as a positive and something that reflected well on their CV. Ian Brown, from 1StopShip, said, ‘While the research may seem a little damning when it comes to taking a gap year, we know from our customers – a good proportion of whom are young people, recent school leavers or graduates – that there can be huge benefits too. 'We would advise anyone looking to genuinely enrich themselves, or make a positive impression on prospective employers to consider incorporating both work and travel, such as teaching or temping overseas; this can ensure you acquire new skills, whilst also experiencing a new culture and seeing new places.’","Research   finds time away didn't 'enrich' 62% of backpackers .

"Street artist John Dolan's dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier named George, is more than just a pet -  he's a lifesaver. The East Londoner credits the pooch with turning his life around after he hit rock bottom as a depressed drug addict sleeping rough. Today, John, 43, is completely unrecognisable from the description he gives of his former self - 'a proper homeless rough tramp'. Scroll down for video . Street artist: John Dolan shows off an example of his work alongside his beloved dog George . He's now an accomplished artist with a forthcoming exhibition in L.A and creates work that can fetch thousands. And he's also turned his hand to writing, penning his memoirs which is now to be published as John and George: The Dog Who Changed My Life. He told MailOnline: 'I have to pinch myself sometimes. It all . happened so quickly: two years ago I was sat on the street with my paper . cup and now look at me.' His change in fortunes is all thanks to the arrival in his life of George - who not only became his pet but also his muse and his saviour. All change: John used to wrap George in a coat to keep him warm during their time living rough together . Man's best friend: John credits his Staffordshire Bull Terrier George with saving his life . John . explains how he had ended up on the streets following a spell in prison . for stealing. 'It all started when I was 19,' he remembers. 'I . was bought up by my grandparents and I was getting into trouble. I was . rebelling from a young age, the amount of times we had the police . through our door was ridiculous. 'I just kept getting into more and more trouble and eventually I went to jail. When I came out of jail, I was homeless. I would stay in hostels and bed and breakfasts three nights here and there.' It was at one shelter in 2010 that another homeless couple asked John if he would look after George, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier they had found abandoned who was fearful of humans. 'They already had a dog so they asked me if I would mind taking care of him, and it was completely spur of the moment but I said yes,' John recalls. It was the best decision he ever made, as taking on George - and thinking about the needs of someone other than himself - lifted him out of depression and drug addiction. He said: 'I was suffering from a wave of drug addiction, I would take heroin to deal with my depression because I just didn't know how else to cope with it. I could barely look after myself. 'That dog is like an angel, he turned my . life around. I've had relationships before when I've said to myself ""I . will change for this girl"" but it never happens. But having George was . like having a child and I had to keep a roof over our heads, not for me . but for him. He really made me pull my jeans up.' He added: 'I would sit out on the street in Shoreditch and sit George in front of a paper cup so it looked like he was begging or if it was cold I would wrap him up. In demand: Since meeting George, John has turned his life around and is now a successful artist . Heartwarming tale: John has written a book of his experience . 'If it hadn't been for George I would have either been dead or in jail - I owe everything to that dog.' During his time on the streets, John began sketching the scenes around him as well as George and it wasn't long before his artistic talent was noticed. 'It all happened really quickly,' he says. 'I used to sketch builders from over the road but then once I had George I would sketch him. Word started to get about and I was invited on local radio stations and people used to come and see me. 'I started selling my drawings and they went down quite well in Shoreditch. An agent heard about me and came to see me and that's when I had my first exhibition. I collaborated with 46 other artists and the exhibition was a sell-out. I sold one of my originals for £2,500 which is more than what Banksy was getting when he started out.' No longer homeless but still based in Shoreditch, John now does a lot of work for charities including UNICEF, the Big Issue and Battersea Dogs Home as well as staging exhibitions. Last month, his work was displayed at the Howard Griffin Gallery in Shoreditch while he was also involved with the Museum of London's The City We Live in Festival . He hopes his story can inspire others and remind them that there's always hope, no matter how bleak life seems. 'I was at a point in my life where I was the least likely person to turn my life around,' he explains. 'I would be sat out on the street with my fingers blue to the bone and now look at me. If I can do it, anybody can.' John and George: The Dog Who Changed My Life is published by Century .","John Dolan, 43, became homeless after time in prison .

"A historic property that is home to one of the most important Japanese gardens in the UK has gone on the market for £2 million. Garden House in the east Hertfordshire village of Cottered is famous for its Oriental outdoor space that was created 100 years ago by a wealthy British china and glassware merchant. Herbert Goode was taken with Japanese-styled gardens during a visit to the Asian country in 1905 and upon his return to the UK imported masses of plants from the Far East, such as bamboo, bonsai, wisteria, Acer trees, azaleas and dwarf conifers. The £2 million price tag for the house in east Hertfordshire boasts a Japanese garden once called 'one of the best and most sympathetically kept gardens in the country' Part of the Oriental-style gardens, which sit on some 2.5 acres of ground, include a Tea House on the property that was featured on a BBC Gardeners' World show . He then hired Japanese landscape designer Seyomon Kusumoto, who created over 200 such gardens in Britain in the early 20th century, with Garden House being recognised as his finest work. Kusumoto incorporated an Oriental lake filled with koi carp, streams, bridges, water cascades, stone work, pagodas and archways into the 2.5 acre grounds. After the property left the Goode family in the 1960s, a member of the family of the Tetley Tea empire bought it and built the two-storey, six-bed house that exists today. The exotic gardens were then bought by a German family who turned the property into something of a tourist attraction by opening the gardens up to visitors. Japanese landscape designer Seyomon Kusumoto included an Oriental lake filled with koi carp, streams, bridges, water cascades, stone work, pagodas and archways . A member of the Tetley Tea empire bought the gardens in the 60s and built the two-storey, six-bedroom house that sits on the grounds on the Oriental-style  property . Heritage specialist Richard Bisgrove in his 1970s book The Gardens of Britain said the property had 'one of the best and most sympathetically kept Japanese gardens in the country'. It has been compared in date and character with the Japanese gardens at Bitchet Green, in Kent, and at Fanhams Hall, in Ware, Hertfordshire. English Heritage described the east Hertfordshire property as having 'one of the most important early 20th century examples' of a Japanese garden in the UK. The unique home is currently owned by British couple Simon and Portia Rowlands who fell in love with it when they saw TV designer Laurence Llewlleyn Bowen present a programme from there in 1998. The pair still open the grounds up to the public once a year, with the last event attracting 2,000 people in five hours. Part of the gardens, which also feature a Tea House, are Grade II listed with English Heritage and were last year featured on the BBC's Gardeners' World show. The current owners of the exotic Garden House opened the grounds up to the public once a year and said the last event attracted some 2,000 people in just five hours . The property has now gone on the market for an asking price of £1.95 million, with the option of retaining a full-time gardener who presently lives in a self-contained cottage being sold with the main residence. Nuela Easter, of estate agents Hamptons International, said: 'This is the most famous Japanese garden outside of Japan. 'It quite astonishing to be in, it is like being transported to Japan. 'It is very private and secluded with all these little hidden areas to explore and surrounded by beautiful plants and trees of different shapes and sizes. 'It's funny because Cottered is a quintessentially-English village yet you could be in another world sat in this garden. 'There is an area of the garden that replicates Mount Sumo. 'The house was built to blend in with the landscape rather than detract from it.' TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen presented an episode of his show Changing Rooms from Garden Home which inspired a couple to buy the property . It is a piece of Japan in rural Britain that has passed through the hands of the wealthy and elite and later ended up as a tourist attraction. Herbert Goode, a merchant who traded in china and glassware, brought the Oriental touch of Japan to the Garden House in the village of Cottered in east Hertfordshire over a 100 years ago. He had taken to the beauties of Japanese Gardens during trips to the Far East in 1905 and brought back masses of plants and shrubs from the Asian country. The trader hired landscape designer Seyomon Kusumoto, who created over 200 such gardens in Britain, to bring about his vision of the Oriental grounds to the property. After the house and grounds left the Goode family in the 1960s, a member of the family of the Tetley Tea empire bought it and built the two-storey, six-bed house that exists today. The stately property and its oriental gardens later came on the radar of English Heritage – and in 1987 it listed Garden House in Cottered village as important to Britain's heritage. The property was then bought by a German family who turned it into something of a tourist attraction by opening the gardens up to visitors. It is now in the hands of British couple Simon and Portia Rowlands. The pair fell in love with the house when they saw it featured on TV – on a BBC’s 'Changing Rooms' show presented by Laurence Llewlleyn Bowen from the home in 1998. Now the soon-to-be new owners, be they wealthy elite or commoners like the rest of us, have the choice of taking on the garden duties themselves or keeping on the staff who tend to the grounds full-time.","Wealthy British merchant Herbert Goode brought plants from Japan in 1905 .

"After successfully cycling 3000 miles across America, Pippa Middleton has barely had time to catch her breath before embarking on her next challenge - a four mile swim across a tidal shipping strait in Turkey. The 30-year-old was joined by her brother, James, and some of their other cycling teammates, to take part in the Bosphorus Cross Continental Swimming Race. The event is organised by the Turkish Olympic Committee and attracts thousands of fit adventure-seekers from around the world, keen to taken on the challenging open water swim. Scroll down for video . Looks the part: Pippa Middleton in her Baywatch-style red swimming costume at the Bosphorus Cross Continental Swimming Race . Sporting prowess: Pippa Middleton completed a triathlon in 2011, left, a bike ride across America in June, right, and has now finished a four mile open water swim . Participants have to negotiate the tidal waters to plot the fastest route, avoid jellyfish and beat the clock - the busy shipping canal can only be closed for two hours so anyone not finished in that time is pulled out of the race. Pippa told Hello! magazine that the 'fear of being plucked out of the water' motivated her to train hard to guarantee success as she aimed to complete the swim for charity last month. In a first-person account of her experience, Pippa told the magazine how she started training for the event in June by doing lengths in a 40ft pool and practising open water swimming in Majorca, Brighton and the TRI20 Swim Centre at Reading Lake Hotel. Smile of achievement: Pippa being interviewed after the swimming race which she finished in one hour and five minutes . Blame it on the beard: James joined his sister for the bike ride and the swim but when she beat him at the latter, he joked it was because he hadn't streamlined by shaving . From Asia to Europe: The route Pippa and James swam in the race . The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge said she had to learn about stroke and breathing techniques to prepare herself for the swim from Asia to Europe, where competitors do not wear wetsuits. She was already in good shape having just completed her epic bike ride but she added that she supplemented her swimming training with Pilates and jogging and had regular sports massages to prevent injury. But she explained: 'Nothing could have prepared me for the experience of the race itself in Istanbul... The swim requires not only speed and athleticism but also the nous to navigate yourself on the right course.' Eating well was also essential and Pippa told the magazine she stuck to a diet of 'wholesome carbs' like brown rice, lentils and quinoa and lots of protein - which aids muscle repair. She said: 'To maintain energy I try to eat more protein, particularly fish or chicken... a lot of people swear by carb-loading in the run-up to an event but it doesn't really work for me, so I just up my protein intake.' The night before the race they feasted on seafood and then she tucked into a bowl of porridge with honey, banana and nuts in the morning to give her body plenty of fuel for the swim. Fundraising: Pippa's challenges were to raise money for the British Heart Foundation and the Michael Matthews Foundation. She's now auctioning her bike to boost funds . Protein princess: Pippa revealed how she tucked to a diet rich in chicken and fish to prepare for the swim in her write-up for Hello! magazine . Her hard training and healthy eating paid off as, watched by her parents Carole and Michael Middleton, she completed the gruelling race in one hour and 5 minutes, beating her bushy bearded brother in the process. He finished in one hour 18 minutes. Pippa joked: 'He said if he'd shaved, he would have beaten me. But of course!' Pippa said she was delighted to finish the race, coming 577th out of 1,600 participants, 29th female in the 30-34 age category and raising money for charity in the process. The causes Pippa and her teammates are raising money for are the British Heart Foundation - for whom Pippa is an ambassador - and the Michael Matthews Foundation, a charity set up in memory of a friend of Pippa's who died descending from the summit of Mount Everest at the age of 22. So far, Pippa and her team have raised more than £20,000 through their epic cycling and swimming challenges, while Pippa has also auctioned her bike on eBay to boost funds. And rather than putting her feet up, Pippa weekend took to the water again today - this time in a sail boat - to take part in Cowes week. Read Pippa's full account of her swim in the latest edition of Hello! Non-stop action: Fresh from her swim, Pippa today took part in a sailing event at Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week . A glass of milk or a protein shake can aid recovery from a hard workout . Pippa Middleton isn't the only sportswoman who has discovered the benefits of a protein-rich diet to aid her athletic performance. Sales of protein supplements are on the up and they are no longer just favoured by muscular, gym-obsessed men. Protein consumption by women is up by 57 per cent, and the market is set to be worth close to £8bn globally, as more women are downing protein shakes after a hard workout. The supplements are often made from whey - a by-product of cheese production - which can be sold as a powder that can be easily mixed with water for a convenient recovery drink. Gareth Nicholas from MaxiNutrition, who sell protein supplements, explains: 'Protein is a vital nutrient that your body needs every day as part of a healthy balanced diet, however when you participate in intense physical activity your requirement for protein increases. Consuming protein will support the growth and maintenance of muscle tissue, helping you to support your training goals.' Aside from such supplements, protein intake can also be upped by incorporating more protein-rich foods into a daily diet. Foods high in protein include fish, chicken, eggs and milk. Protein is important to aid recovery from exercise as the body uses it to help repair muscles which have been worked hard. Recovering quickly from exercise is a key aspect of any training plan as it means the body is then prepared for its next work out, lessening the danger of becoming worn-out.","Pippa and James finished Bosphorus Cross Continental Swimming Race .

When they aren't building the holes, they're driving across the country with their young kids to install the homes and just finished up a 45-day trip from Georgia to Wisconsin. The Hobbit holes range in price from a $995 small chicken coop to a large playhouse that's $2,225. Wooden Wonders ships the homes in kit form, allowing the new owner to construct the hole themselves.

"The Beverly Hills mansion that featured in The Godfather and The Bodyguard, and provided a romantic retreat for John F Kennedy and his new bride Jackie on their honeymoon, is being listed for $135 million. The historic mansion, set on six acres of land close to Sunset Boulevard, has had only four owners since it was built in the 1920s, but countless A-list celebrities, royalty and high-profile figures have been guests there. From the honeymooning Kennedys, to parties for Rihanna and Prince Albert of Monaco, the legendary Beverly House had become nearly as famous as those who have graced its rooms. Scroll down for video . Starring role: Beverly House has appeared in several films, including The Godfather and The Bodyguard . Romantic retreat: The lavish estate was used by the Kennedys on their honeymoon . The sprawling estate, which includes a 50,000sq ft house, cascading waterfalls leading to a swimming pool, and a two-story library, is a mix of period features and luxurious flourishes. A spa, 22ft tall hand-painted arched ceiling, billiards room complete with a carved fireplace from Hearst Castle in California, and parquet flooring are just some of the features in the 30-bedroom, 40-bathroom estate. Current owner Leonard Ross, who bought the mansion in 1976 when he was just 31, said it takes two hours to show prospective buyers around. He paid $2 million for the house, but told ABC News that despite its current $135 million price tag the property was an 'investment that could only go up in value'. He admitted that when he bought the property it was 'much larger than I needed'. New chapter: The two-story library comes with an open fireplace, wood paneling and carved ceiling . Original features: The parquet floor and stone fireplace in the billiards room were installed when the house was built in the 1920s .

In a statement to the Free Press on Tuesday, a representative for Breathe Life Healing Centers said the Fisher mansion is being renovated to serve as both the company's newest spiritual retreat center and Lamm's primary residence.

A Breathe Life spokesman said the center, which could open as early as this winter, won't provide medical care onsite, reports CBS Detroit. A separate facility on 7 Mile Road near Livernois would treat clients' medical needs. Palmer Woods Association board member Rochelle Lento says neighbors are 'very concerned' about the center. She says it doesn't fit zoning guidelines for the residential community. Craig Vanderburg, president of the Palmer Woods Association, told Detroit Free Press said residents would like more information regarding the house's role in the rehab business.

Palmer Woods Association board member Rochelle Lento says neighbors are 'very concerned' about the center. She says it doesn't fit zoning guidelines for the residential community . 'I don't know. Something that we're looking to do is contact them ourselves, if they're willing to talk to us.' According to its website, Breathe Life Healing Center specializes in treating a wide variety of addictions, underlying psychological issues and trauma. It deals with issues including 'Pain Pill Addiction, Binge Eating Disorder Substance Abuse Obesity Treatment Trauma Treatment Co-Occurring Disorders.' It has two kitchens, a 200 square foot basement, a grand ballroom, a marble stage, a billiard's room and a hidden prohibition-style bar . The two acre lot is filled with gardens, ponds and a tea house . Palmer Woods was home to many of history's auto industry giants, including the top brass at GM and Ford as well as the Fisher family . Few photos exist of all seven of the Fisher brothers together.  This one was taken on August 22, 1927 . Architect Richard Marr, interior designer Wallace Newton and landscape architect Bryant Fleming built the home for Alfred J. Fisher and his wife Alma. He was one of the seven Fisher brothers who owned the Fisher Body Company, making car bodies for the booming auto industry. Their company began the early 1900 when, two of the brothers went from Ohio to Detroit,  to work in the first 'horseless carriage' body shops. In 1908 they decided to go into business for themselves as the Fisher Body Company and developed a new chassis. By 1913, the Fisher Body Company had the capacity to produce 100,000 cars per year and customers included: Ford, Krit, Chalmers, Cadillac, Oldsmobile and Studebaker. By 1926 was one of the world's largest manufacturing companies and was sold to General Motors. The brothers resigned from General Motors to devote their time to other interests in 1944 and in 1972, the last of the Fisher brothers died.

"Embattled Cabinet minister Maria Miller today insisted she will pay capital gains tax on the sale of the £1.4million house part-funded by the taxpayer. The Culture Secretary faced fresh questions about her finances as it emerged she stopped claiming expenses on the south London home just as parliamentary officials were demanding MPs sign a declaration that they would pay any capital gains tax incurred on future sales. Mrs Miller bought the house almost 20 years ago, claimed expenses on it for four years and sold it for a profit of more than £1million in February this year. Culture Secretary Maria Miller has vowed to pay capital gains tax on her house sale as the row over he expenses refuses to go away . Mrs Miller’s position in the Cabinet has become increasingly precarious after she was forced to apologise to the Commons and pay back £5,800. David Cameron has refused to sack her, despite a poll showing 78 per cent of people think Mrs Miller should be fired. Last week the independent standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson said Mrs Miller had overclaimed for expenses on her mortgage by £45,000. But in a dispute about the rules at the time, Miss Hudson was overruled by MPs on the Commons Standards Committee which said she need repay only £5,800. Mrs Miller caused further outrage with a 32-second apology to the comments, after she was criticised for her attitude to the year-long inquiry into her claims. 1996: Bought double-fronted Victorian terrace house in Wimbledon, south-west London, for £234,000 . 2005: Elected Conservative MP for Basingstoke . 2005-2009: Claimed £90,718 in expenses on the property . 2007: Increased the mortgage for a second time to £575,000, with taxpayers meeting the cost . 2009 April: Stopped claiming expenses . 2009 May: Commons officials wrote to MPs demanding they sign a declaration agreeing to pay capital gains tax on second homes . 2010: Became minister for Disabled People . 2011: Started claiming expenses on renting a property in her Basingstoke constituency . 2012: Joined Cabinet as Culture Secretary . 2014: Sold London home for £1.47million, a profit of £1.236million . When the expenses scandal broke in 2009, several MPs were accused of ‘flipping’ the declaration of their second home in order to avoid capital gains tax. Sales of a main home do not carry capital gains tax, but it is levied at 28 per cent on profits made on second homes. It was legal for MPs to declare one property as a second home for expenses, but as a main home for tax purposes. In May 2009 Parliamentary officials wrote to MPs asking them to sign a declaration that they would pay any capital gains tax due. But weeks before Mrs Miller instead stopped claiming for any expenses on the Wimbledon property she shared with her parents. She later designated the London house as her main home and from 2011 claimed expenses on a property in her Basingstoke constituency. A spokesman for the Culture Secretary said: ‘This is nonsense. It is well documented that Maria stopped claiming any accommodation allowance at all in April 2009. The sale of the Wimbledon property in February, falls in a tax year that has not yet been assessed. She will of course deal with the matter in accordance with HMRC rules and pay any tax that is due.' Aides deny Mrs Miller ‘flipped’ her designation in order to avoid capital gains tax, noting that she stopped claiming expenses on the London house five years ago. However, the row has reignited public anger over the expenses scandal and fuelled calls for her to be sacked. Former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit became the most senior Conservative to call for her to go, writing on the Telegraph website that her ‘arrogant’ handling of the scandal had revived voter anger over MPs' expenses and adding: ‘The best way out of this is for Mrs Miller to resign.’ A poll by Survation for the Mail on Sunday found that large majorities of voters believe she should forfeit her Cabinet post (78 per cent) or be sacked as MP for Basingstoke (68 per cent). This is the house in Wimbledon, south London, which Mrs Miller owned for 19 years, claiming expenses to pay the mortgage for four years, before selling it for £1.4million . Dream home: This is Maria Miller's new £1.2million converted Tudor barn in Hampshire, bought after selling her family home in Wimbledon for £1.4million . Mrs Miller's husband Iain was seen outside the couple's home in Hook, Hampshire today, but there was no sign of the minister . Expenses watchdog Sir Ian Kennedy, chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said it was time for MPs to stop ‘marking their own homework’ and give Ms Hudson the final say in standards investigations. And Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle promised a shake-up if the party wins next year's election: ‘We need a system which commands public confidence, and what we have at the moment clearly doesn't do that. Prime Minister David Cameron had vowed to stand by Mrs Miller and refused to sack her but his judgment was came into question from other Tories . ‘We need reform so that people have faith that MPs are properly held to account. David Cameron has failed to act but Labour won't let this failing system go unreformed.’ But Standards Committee member Geoffrey Cox warned that handing the right to sanction MPs to an external regulator could raise constitutional issues, as the watchdog could have the power to change the shape of a government - particularly in times of a narrow majority - by handing down a lengthy suspension or even expulsion from the Commons. Mr Cox told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ‘Anybody who has the power to expel a Member of Parliament from the House of Commons has an enormous power to alter governments, to change the shape of political history. ‘I think what the critics of the current system have to answer is if external regulation is going to be introduced, who is to do it, and to whom is that person or regulator to be accountable?’ While MPs are accountable to the electorate through the ballot box, in the case of an independent regulator ‘the only conceivable possibility would be to hand it to a court’, said Mr Cox. ‘That would involve real problems, constitutional problems, of the separation of powers. I'm not at all sure the judiciary would want to have the powers,’ he said. And the Torridge & West Devon MP added: ‘Nowhere in the world - certainly in no major democracy - has there been complete external regulation.’","Culture Secretary is facing calls to quit over her expenses claims .

"A real-life Transformer has been created by scientists inspired by the Japanese paper-folding art of origami. In tests, the small shape-changing robot folded itself into a functional machine that could walk and turn without human help. But unlike the popular Transformers toys - robots that disguise themselves as cars and trucks - the device is not aimed at children but rather for other applications like search and rescue operations. Scroll down for video . In tests a small shape-changing robot, created by scientists inspired by the Japanese paper-folding art of origami, folded itself into a functional machine (shown) that could walk and turn without human help. Experts believe the assembly system could provide a cheap way to mass-produce robots with multiple applications . The robot is built from five layers of materials, all cut according to digital specifications by a laser cutter. The middle layer is copper, etched into an intricate network of electrical leads. It's sandwiched between two structural layers of paper; the outer layers are composed of a shape-memory polymer that folds when heated. After the laser-cut materials are layered together, a microprocessor and one or more small motors are attached to the top surface. In the prototype, that attachment was done manually, but it could instead be performed by a robotic 'pick and place' system. Experts believe the assembly system could provide a cheap way to mass-produce robots with multiple applications. They may be especially useful for accessing confined spaces, for instance when searching for survivors in collapsed buildings. A 'flat pack' robot could be posted through a narrow gap or tunnel before expanding itself to full-size. Origami is a traditional Japanese art that involves folding sheets of paper in cunning ways to form 3D shapes shapes resembling flowers, animals or decorative figures. Drawing on the same principles, the scientists built a self-assembling four-legged robot from sheets of shape-memory plastic containing embedded electronics. The team was from Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Once connected to a battery power supply, the flat composite heated up, folded, and transformed into a mobile robot in about four minutes. The five-inch (12.7 cm) long device crawled away at a speed of more than two inches (five cm) per second and was also able to turn without assistance. The flat composite (shown) heated up, folded, and transformed into a mobile . robot in about four minutes . The robot (left) is built from five layers of materials, all cut according to digital specifications by a laser cutter and bears similar characteristics to the popular franchise Transformers (Optimus Prime from 2007 film, right) 'Folding allows you to avoid the ""nuts and bolts"" assembly approaches typically used for robots or other complex electromechanical devices and it allows you to integrate components,' said Professor Rob Wood, who led the Harvard University team. Colleague and doctoral student Sam Felton pointed out that traditional manufacturing required costly machinery and 3D printing was too slow for mass production. But the components of folding robots could be produced rapidly and cheaply using standard tools such as laser cutters and printed circuit etching technology. 'Such manufacturing methods would be ideal for producing 100-1000 units,' said Mr Felton. 'These robots are inexpensive and their layered composites can be built faster than equivalent 3D printed structures.' A software programme called 'Origamizer' was used to generate the crease patterns at the heart of the automated folding process, the researchers reported in the journal Science. Other potential applications for the technology included its use in space exploration, self-folding shelters, and Ikea-style furniture that can assemble itself.","Scientists at Harvard University in Massachusetts create 'origami' robot .

"Downing Street was last night facing a chorus of demands to bar MPs from policing their own affairs and sack minister Maria Miller . Downing Street was last night facing a chorus of demands to bar MPs from policing their own affairs and sack minister Maria Miller. Senior figures from all main parties backed a call from the watchdog in charge of Commons expenses for MPs to be prevented from ‘marking their own homework’ when complaints are made. Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit and a grassroots party organisation said Mrs Miller, who was made to repay £5,800 in excess mortgage claims last week, should resign or be dismissed. Anger over the Culture Secretary’s case has been compounded by the decision of the standards committee, made up of ten MPs and three lay members with no voting rights, to water down her punishment. Kathryn Hudson, the independent parliamentary standards commissioner, initially suggested she should repay some £44,000 and said her designation of what had been her main home was incorrect. No 10 said that David Cameron, who once suggested MPs’ expenses should meet a ‘smell test’ even if they were strictly within the rules, was not backing reform of the standards committee. A spokesman said: ‘He is happy with the system as it stands.’ But Sir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said the Commons must ‘give away powers in regulating itself’, insisting: ‘MPs marking their own homework always ends in scandal.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he was ‘very open’ to ‘independent people’ being in charge of the process, saying: ‘This goes on and on and on, eating away at the credibility of Parliament. Whatever it takes to restore that credibility is vital.’ Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, said: ‘We need a system which commands public confidence, and what we have at the moment clearly doesn’t do that.’ John Mann, the Labour MP whose complaint prompted the investigation into Mrs Miller, said: ‘Everyone who was in the last parliament was embroiled one way or other in the expenses scandal and therefore they can’t possibly sit in judgment on other MPs.’ The former anti-sleaze MP for Tatton, Martin Bell, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme that he agreed the committee on standards should be abolished. He said: ‘The House of Commons ... is incapable of regulating itself and that’s been proven yet again.’ The investigation into Mrs Miller was prompted after she claimed £90,000 in mortgage interest and other housing costs for her taxpayer-funded second home in Wimbledon, south-west London, which was also home to her parents. She rented a smaller property in Basingstoke which she designated as her main home. The central allegation against her – that she cheated taxpayers in order to subsidise the living costs of relatives – was dismissed. But during the course of the investigation, it emerged that she had increased the size of her mortgage at least twice since becoming an MP and made a series of ‘overclaims’ which she blamed on administrative errors. Correspondence released by the committee reveals she made repeated attempts to browbeat the commissioner into dropping inquiries into the broader question of her mortgage charges. Mrs Miller won only lukewarm support from colleagues after issuing a curt 30-second apology in the Commons last week, and some ministers privately indicate they believe she should have offered to resign. Lord Tebbit said: ‘Having staked his authority and reputation on defending his Culture Secretary against calls for her to be fired, the Prime Minister will be damned if he now fires her and damned if he doesn’t. The best way out of this is for Mrs Miller to resign.’ Ben Harris-Quinney, director of Conservative Grassroots, called for her to ‘go with immediate effect’. He said: ‘Maria Miller is a totemic example of the modern political class who hold no discernible character, talent  or integrity. ‘The grassroots of the Conservative Party have no time for careerist politicians who not only do not support, but flagrantly oppose, conservative values once they are comfortably settled in Parliament and Cabinet. The longer she remains in her position the greater the damage.’ Digby Jones, former head of the CBI, said: ‘In a company environment, in a business environment, you’d be asking for a resignation.’ Commenting on suggestions that Mr Cameron wanted to keep Mrs Miller on because he did not want to lose one of only four women in his Cabinet, Lord Jones told BBC Radio 5’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘I think it’s an absolute legitimate motive to say “I need more women in my Cabinet”. But I’m sure he could have found another one, if you know what  I mean.’ Maria Miller’s allies yesterday claimed she was being treated more harshly by Tory supporters and the Press because she had been in charge of controversial reforms on media regulation and gay marriage. Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘I think she has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances with the Leveson Inquiry, which has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her, I know, and also the gay marriage stuff.’ The Work and Pensions Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘There’s a lot of Conservatives out there who perhaps weren’t necessarily in support of it all so feel rather bitter about that.’ MP John Mann, who made the original complaint about her expenses, said the suggestion she was being demonised because of her policy responsibilities was ‘absurd’. He added: ‘It’s desperate stuff and it’s wholly inaccurate. If that’s the best they can do it shows the problems they are in.’ A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found almost three-quarters of voters thought Mrs Miller’s apology was inadequate, and similar numbers felt Mr Cameron was wrong to offer her his support. Some 78 per cent thought she should lose her Cabinet seat. Former Tory culture secretary David Mellor said: ‘I don’t think it matters if she resigns or not. Bless her heart, she won’t be missed if she goes and she won’t be noticed if she stays. ‘What this is all about is, first of all, the judgment of David Cameron; secondly the integrity of Parliament. ‘I mean, the 30-second apology to the House, allowing a bunch of dim-witted backbenchers to roll her out of what an independent adjudicator had said. Who is behind this? David Cameron needs to take a long, hard look about what kind of administration he’s trying to run.’","Lord Tebbit said Mrs Miller should resign or be dismissed .

"Bungling council workers have created a challenger for the world’s shortest cycle lane which measures just 8ft-long. The bike lane on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon is just 8ft 2ins - barely longer than a bike - and has left cyclists wondering what the point of it is. It is not the first time ridiculously short bike lanes have been marked out on British roads with another in Devon measuring just 8ft long earlier this year, and in 2006 a 5ft-long lane made headlines  in Shrewsbury. Barely longer than a bike: A cyclist uses the 8ft-long cycle lane in Devon which has left bike riders baffled by the logic of putting in a bike lane so small . Council workers in Cardiff were criticised for building an 8ft bike lane in 2010 at the estimated cost of £2,000. Welsh cyclists were left baffled with the logic behind the lane when an official told them it was to 'highlight the interface between the eastbound carriageway and the beginning of a new contraflow facility'. For clarity a council spokesman added that it was to alert cyclists to the left hand turn into a new facility. A Plymouth council spokesman said their latest path did not cost the council anything. 'Planning obligations': A council spokesman said the bike lane indicated where cyclists join the general traffic, giving them 'space' to do so safely . No cost: Plymouth council did not pay for the bike lane (pictured) but council workers in Cardiff were criticised in 2010 for creating an 8ft bike lane which cost an estimated £2,000 . She said: ‘It was paid for by the developer of a power station as part of its planning obligations. ‘The red area marks where the off-road pedestrian and cycle route ends and cyclists join with general traffic. ‘It is designed to alert motorists to cyclists joining the road, as well as give cyclists the space to do safely.’ But cyclists have been left scratching their heads on how best to use the new ‘lane’. One cyclist said: ‘It’s ridiculous. Is it really worth having such a small cycle path? ‘You couldn’t cycle in it because it’s so small. You just have time to get in the saddle before getting off again.’ Short in Birmingham too: Cyclist Tom Gaffney noticed last year that there was three 20ft-long bike lanes marked out out just a quarter of a mile apart . In Birmingham last year, three 20ft-long bike lanes were marked out just a quarter of a mile apart in the Sutton Coldfield area of the city.

But a spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'The cycle lanes make it clear where cyclists should go. 'The lanes clearly guide cyclists to the dropped kerb where they can leave the road and ride on the footway to a safe crossing of the busy Eachelhurst Road.’ Even across the North Sea, the Dutch . city of Epe made their own ridiculous bike path, 8ft 8ins, with ‘Bike .

"Living in a suburb could be putting you at risk of obesity and even heart disease. Contradictory to the view that living in rural spaces makes you fitter and healthier, researchers have discovered it can actually increase the rates of these diseases. They found that the more compact an area is, and the lower the number of intersections or road junctions it has, the lower the chances of diabetes and heart disease. Researchers from University of Colorado Denver examined street network density in areas across California (stock image). They compared these networks to data in the California Health Interview Survey. The results revealed that the more compact a city is, the lower the levels of obesity, diabetes and heart disease it has . Women who live in urban areas are more likely to develop postnatal depression than those who live in the countryside, recent research has claimed. Women who live in large cities are three per cent more likely to develop the condition five to 14 months after giving birth. The researchers believe this could be because city living is more stressful and is associated with less supportive communities. Dr Simone Vigod, at Women’s College Hospital, in Toronto, said: ‘Living in an urban area is a marker of more stress, less support and a potentially higher risk of postpartum depression for women. ‘Our study suggests we need to better target our supports and services towards women based on their geographic location to improve their outcomes and reduce their risk of postpartum depression.’ The researchers do not explain why this is the case, but suggest it may be due to the tendency of people in rural spaces to use their car more, and walk less, because of poor public transport options. ‘Previously we had found that people drive less and walk more in more compact cities with more intersections per square mile,’ said study co-author Dr Wesley Marshall, assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado Denver. ‘Now we’ve been able to link these city design qualities to better health.’ The study, co-authored by Dr Norman Garrick, associate professor of engineering at the University of Connecticut, was published in the Journal of Transport & Health. It looked at 24 medium-sized California cities with populations between 30,000 and 100,000. ‘We built these dense, connected street networks for thousands of years, but only over the last century or so did we switch to designing sparse, tree-like networks with cars in mind,’ Garrick said. The researchers examined street network density, connectivity and configuration. They then studied data collected by the California Health Interview Survey for the years 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 - sampling between 42,000 and 51,000 adults. The results revealed that increased intersection density was significantly linked to a reduction in obesity at the neighbourhood level, and of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease at the city level. The more intersections, the lower the disease rates. The study additionally found a correlation between wider streets with more lanes and increased obesity and diabetes rates. This graph reveals the types of networks the researchers discovered. They include the tight grid-like systems and the more linear, 'tree' systems. The study additionally found a correlation between wider streets with more lanes and increased obesity and diabetes rates . The reason, the researchers said, was that wider streets may suggest smaller, or ‘inferior’ pavements. The presence of a superstore also tends to be indicative of poor walkability in a neighbourhood, and this was associated with almost a 14 per cent rise in obesity rates, and a 25 per cent increase in diabetes rates. Unsurprisingly, cities with more fast food restaurants were associated with higher diabetes rates, and additional convenience-type stores across a city also correlated with higher rates of obesity and diabetes. These images plot the typical evolution of community design and street networks in the US. It began with the grid (pictured left), but gradually developed into the 'tree' system (right) as planners tried to incorporate more green and open spaces, explained the researchers . ‘While it is possible to lead an active, healthy lifestyle in almost any type of neighbourhood,’ Dr Marshall said. ‘Our findings suggest that people living in more compact cities do tend to have better health.' Dr Garrick point continued that in a earlier study, they had found these more compact cities also had much lower levels of traffic fatalities. ‘Taken together these findings suggest a need to radically re-think how we design and build the streets and street networks that form the backbone of our cities, towns and villages,’ Garrick said. ‘This research is one more in a long line that demonstrates the myriad advantages of fostering walkable places.’","Researchers examined street network density and configuration .

"An Indiana anesthesiologist shot dead his wife minutes after the last guest left their wedding party early on Sunday morning after an alleged alcohol fueled argument over a pre-nuptial agreement turned tragic. Dr. George 'Scott' Samson, 54, is said to have told his new wife, Kelly Ecker, 50, that she would 'never get her hands on his money' during the wedding reception at the Ohio Building in Terre Haute on Saturday evening. According to witnesses, the argument became increasingly bitter when the wedding after-party moved to Samson and Ecker's mansion, with guests deciding to leave at 1.17am on Sunday morning as the fighting escalated. Scroll Down for Video . Tragedy: George 'Scott' Samson and Kelly Ecker married on Saturday evening and returned to Samson's Terre Haute home for their wedding party . Shock: Kelly Ecker with her friend's Charlene Bloodworth (left) and Britany Wright (right). The pictures are believed to show Kelly in her wedding dress on Saturday eveninf . Three minutes after the final guest departed, Ecker, who is a nurse at the same hospital as Samson, made the first of three terrified 911 calls claiming her husband was going to kill her. The first two frantic calls to the dispatcher ended abruptly, but moments later Ecker phoned back, her trembling voice pleading for help, before a volley of gunshots rang out and the phone line cut. Less than half-an-hour later, officers who who responded to the couple's Terre Haute home discovered the body of Ecker, fatally shot in the head and neck and in the basement the body of Samson, who had taken his own life with a 45-caliber semi automatic pistol. According to Advance Indiana, the reception had been changed from the newlywed's home to the Ohio Building at the last minute and the marquee tent set up in their garden still hauntingly sits outside their home. Police said that Samson shot his wife multiple times with a 40-caliber handgun and records show that the Terre Haute doctor held a Federal Firearms License, which effectively enabled him to trade and sell weapons from his property - in a manner similar to a gun store owner. Indeed, according to Advance Indiana, police recovered a literal arsenal of weapons from the home, including assault rifles, hand guns and several hundred rounds of ammunition. 'They had just gotten married and something went terribly wrong,' said Vigo County Coroner, Dr. Susan Amos. 'He shot her and then shot himself. We are still in a second autopsy to confirm that.' Witnesses told the IndyStar that the couple had argued at the end of their reception and the final guest left anesthesiologist Samson's home at 1.17am.

The 10-year-old was unharmed . Ecker, a nurse at Union Hospital, phoned 911 at 1.20am after witnesses said their argument about money spiraled out of control. 'The investigation has revealed that there was an verbal argument between the couple toward the end of the reception, which carried over to the after party at the couples' home,' said Vigo County Chief Deputy Sheriff Clark Cottom in an email to the IndyStar. 'Shortly after the last guest left at around 1:17 a.m., Kelly Ecker Samson called 911 reporting that her husband had threatened to kill her. 'There were a total of three very brief 911 calls, which in the first two the caller disconnected.' Cottom said that Ekcer was found in the bedroom her 10-year-old son from a previous relationship slept in, while Samson shot himself once in the head with a registered gun. Haunting: The marquee tent erected in the garden of Samson's home still stands the day after the tragic murder suicide . 'Deputies did find the female victim inside the child's bedroom deceased,' said Cottom to WISHTV. Cottom said that Ekcer's son and an elderly couple believed to be Samson's parents were inside the home at the time of the shooting, but were not harmed and escorted out by police when they arrived. 'We received information from the elderly male that the female's husband Scott Samson had retreated to the basement,' said Cottom to WISHTV. 1st CALL .

"Christmas is Crusoe the celebrity dachshund's favourite time of year, and unwrapping presents is what really makes this camera-loving diva dog most happy. That and getting together with his extended family including brother Oakley, says owner Ryan Beauchesne, who's made a star of his dog with an award-winning blog. The festive period plays right into the hands of Crusoe, who celebrated the signing of his first book deal while on a trip to New York, sealing the deal with his pawtograph. Crusoe and Oakley approve of the Christmas turkey before it gets unwrapped and put in the oven . No mistaking what time of year it is as Crusoe dons his Christmas hat and jumper in front of the tree . Crusoe the dachshund is all decked out in his cold weather gear and ready to take on the snow . With plenty to celebrate, Crusoe, who has over 82,000 likes on Facebook, also has a chance to parade in his extensive collection of winter outfits and frolic in the snow, as seen in the below video. In addition to the book deal Crusoe has a host of merchandise available online, including mugs, T-shirts, bumper stickers and even a calendar that can be 'autographed'. And he definitely knows what time of year it is, says Ryan, 27, who lives with Crusoe and his girlfriend Laurence Dionne, 27, in Ottawa, Canada. Showing great restraint, Crusoe enjoys the smell of another Christmas creation in custom oven mitts . Crusoe is a dog who is happy to talk turkey, as long as by talk you mean eat turkey . While a busy dog, Crusoe knows how to relax - in a fleece, on the sofa, by the fire will do just fine . 'He's seen us wrap presents already and we already have a Christmas tree with a few gifts under there,' Ryan told MailOnline. 'Now he's just waiting for the day we give him the ""OK"" to start opening them. Plus he's been seeing a lot of family members lately so I'm sure he knows there's the big day coming.' Thoughtful sausage dog Crusoe looks especially studious as he reads a cookbook . Family happy snaps from last year show Crusoe trying his hand in the kitchen and supervising the cooking of the turkey, for which the end result is quite important to him. Of course, being a dog and all, knives and hot plates aren't for him. But eating sure is with is favourites being turkey and ham. 'They're pretty good bets,' says Ryan. 'He enjoys a nice sautéed carrot as well. All in all, he's not too picky as long as it's not too healthy.' When it comes to the time for presents the dog that seems so well-behaved on camera unleashes fury - in a cute, happy way - on anything covered with wrapping paper, including his presents from Santa, his mum and dad, and those intended for everyone else. 'Santa sends him some of course. He has a big long wishlist we have to send to Santa on his behalf every year,' says Ryan. 'He definitely opens all his own presents. It's his favourite part of the holidays. 'He'll even start opening random presents under the tree, even when they're not for him. He seems to think every present is for him - which I guess is a reasonable assumption on his part being a celebrity and all.' Check all the pieces are there: Crusoe (right) looks a little guilty at the chess board with brother Oakley . Crusoe (left) in his Santa outfit, which unfortunately for Oakley means he's relegated to elf colours . Believe it or not, Crusoe's owner Ryan says the dachshund quite likes carrots, but not as much as ham . For this year's Christmas, Crusoe is hanging out with Oakley, who lives just outside Toronto, about 300 miles from Ottawa. 'We have all the family coming together, including his brother Oakley, who he really doesn't get to see very often. 'Crusoe loves when all the family's together. In fact, I think that's when he's most content in life.'","Crusoe is a four-year-old dachshund who lives in Ottawa, Canada .

"The confusion over whether we should carry an umbrella with us when we leave the home is about to clear up - with the Bureau of Meteorology dumping well-worn rain forecast terms in favour of predicting the chance of rain in your area as a percentage. When you hear a weather forecast, can you tell the difference between isolated showers, scattered showers and patchy rain? What does the term 'a chance of rain' really mean? From this week, you won't have to know, thanks to a planned overhaul of descriptors used by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Scroll down for video . 'Chance of rain?' The old weather terminologies are on the way out to be replaced by the bureau of meteorology with a much easier to understand range of descriptions like slight, medium or high . After decades, the BOM is revolutionising its rainfall forecasts to make them more simple and clear. 0-10 per cent - there will be no mention of rain in the forecast . 20-30 per cent - slight chance of rain . 40-60 per cent - medium chance . 70-80 per cent - high change of rain . 90-100 per cent - very high chance . Under the new system, adjectives such as patchy, scattered, widespread and isolated will be replaced with the more straightforward terms of slight, medium, high or very high to describe the chances of rainfall. The chance of rain will also be expressed in percentage terms, along with a forecast of how many millimetres of rain is expected. The change has become possible because of the bureau's new Meteye Autographic information system, which divides the nation into six square kilometre grids and allows for highly localised meteorological observations and forecasting within each square. National public weather manager Vernon Carr said the old system has had its day. The bureau of meteorology admits its system has reached its 'use-by date' to be replaced by a more user friendly list of descriptions . 'Basically, we're in a position that we can give people a bit more detail about when it's going to rain and how much rain they're likely to get, whereas in the past it was just words,' he said. Mr Carr said the bureau had undertaken research which found that 'some of the terms we used weren't specific enough'. 'Now we're changing to what we hope will be a more meaningful presentation,' he added. The new rain forecasts began in Tasmania and Western Australia on Monday.Victoria, NSW, the ACT and Queensland will begin in the new format on Tuesday, followed by the Northern Territory on Wednesday and South Australia on Thursday .

"It is one of the most adnaved surveillance systems ever created - and could already be flying above you. Researchers have revealed a plane-mounted camera system called Hawkeye that can survey a 25 square mile patch of a city for up to six hours. It allows police to zoom in to crimes, and even 'rewind' the video to see them being instigated. Scroll down for video . The system allows police to zoom in on crimes in real time, such as this car chase where police could see suspects driving in real time. The Hawkeye system kits out planes with an array of high-resolution cameras. The cameras are angled to capture the largest area, and can capture a 25-square-mile patch of Earth constantly for up to six hours. They fly at around 10,000 feet. Footage is beamed back to a police control room, where officer can zoom in, and even rewind the footage. The system was developed by Ross McNutt, a retired Air Force veteran who owns a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems. McNutt told the Center for Investigative Reporting his product as 'a live version of Google Earth, only with TiVo capabilities.' The firm  kits out planes with an array of high-resolution cameras that allow a pilot to record a 25-square-mile patch of Earth constantly—for up to six hours. The planes fly at around 10,000 feet. The PSS system has been tested in cities including Baltimore and Dayton, and last year police officers in Compton used it to track crimes, including a necklace snatching. In one case, they could track a criminal as he approached a woman, grabbed her jewelry, and then ran to a getaway car. The plane used in Compton: Live footage was beamed back to operators . Operators in a police control room are able to zoom and even rewind to footage is they spot a crime in progress . 'We literally watched all of Compton during the time that we were flying, so we could zoom in anywhere within the city of Compton and follow cars and see people,” McNutt said. 'Our goal was to basically jump to where reported crimes occurred and see what information we could generate that would help investigators solve the crimes.' The firm boasts it has worked with forces across the US to develop the system. 'Persistent Surveillance Systems has assisted law enforcement organizations throughout the United States with over 30 murder investigations since 2007. 'The hawkeye system and image analysis have directly led to the apprehension of violent offenders.' The system is also relatively cheap, and PSS says each unit cost less than a fully equipped police helicopter - but can cover 10,000 times the area. The firm behind the Hawkeye system says officers have used imagery to:1. Backtrack murder suspects to their homes/places of origin . 2. Track suspects to every location they went to before, during, and after the crime . 3. Identify potential accomplices of the suspect . 4. Track each accomplice to every location they went to before, during and after the crime . 5. Identify EXACTLY what time and location a suspect or accomplice drove by a ground-based security camera. 6. Dissect entire criminal networks in 3 - 4 days.","System being trialled in Baltimore, Dayton and Compton .

"More and more employees are giving thanks after a wave of stores including Costco and Nordstrom - once open on Thanksgiving - are now closing so that staff can enjoy the holiday with family. Macy's and Kohl’s have previously led the way for sales to start early - opening on Thanksgiving rather than Black Friday.

"The nation's major supermarket chains and shopping centres are being urged to help stamp out the exploitation of vulnerable workers after it was found that some of its trolley collectors are paid as little as $5 an hour. Workers in the physically demanding job are arguably among Australia's most exploited - a union advocate saying employees were being 'used and abused' by the system. Investigating the industry, the Fair Work Ombudsman has recouped more than $400,000 in unpaid wages in the past six years at supermarket sites across the country. The shocking findings comes as food retail giant, Coles, publicly admitted it has an 'ethical and moral responsibility' to stamp out exploitation of trolley collectors. Scroll down for video . Trolley collectors are arguably among Australia's most exploited workers . Supermarket giant, Coles, allegedly knew that its workers were being underpaid and has signed an agreement which means they will need to back pay workers more than $200,000 . Jason White from Trolley union in Brisbane says it's a physically demanding job and workers can be used and abused by the system . According to the 2011 Census, over a third of the 1500 strong national trolley collecting workforce is under 20 years old and 40 per cent do not have an education beyond year 10. About 29 per cent were born outside of Australia, in non English speaking countries, and some have physical or other disabilities. Jason White, of the Brisbane-based Trolley Union, said the job is physically demanding with no perks at all. 'Everyone is going non stop, especially on Christmas Eve and Easter Saturday,' he said. 'There are no time for breaks and the other downside is there is no overtime, no one will pay overtime, or penalty rates either.' The former trolley collector turned trolley advocate said workers are often used and abused. 'It's not fair on them, if they stand and fight they get sacked and some have limited language so they don't know how the system works. 'Trolley collection is a multi million dollar industry. In Brisbane, contractors are pulling in about $250,000 a week in the metro areas but the worker doesn't see that,' he said. In regards to Coles' pledge to improve conditions and pay, Mr White said it was good to hear, but believes there's still a long way to go. A big day : A trolley collectors look on at what he has to do. It's been found that some workers are being paid as little as $5 a day . A number of (29 per cent) trolley collectors were born outside of Australia, in non English speaking backgrounds, and evidence suggests many have physical or other disabilities . The nation's major supermarket chains and shopping centres are being urged to help stamp out the exploitation of vulnerable workers after it was found that some of its trolley collectors are paid as little as $5 an hour . After its alleged admission of knowing about vulnerable workers, Coles said it has transformed its contracted trolley collection service across Australia to eradicate the underpayment of workers . 'Coles is a little more bearable to work with but this is a step in the right direction but it's still going on,' he said. Supermarket giant Coles has signed an Enforceable Undertaking and agreed to uphold the workplace rights of trolley collectors at all its supermarket sites . 'There needs to be a national approach on the job to protect workers.' In the past six years, the Fair Work Ombudsman and its predecessor have recouped more than $433,241 for 528 underpaid trolley collectors at supermarket sites across Australia. Fair Work has four separate matters before the courts alleging that collectively, 71 trolley collectors have been underpaid almost $485,000. Following its admission of turning a 'blind eye' towards workers, Coles has given an undertaking to the Ombudsman that it will revamp its trolley collection services. The supermarket giant has admitted its former practises were highly vulnerable to exploitation and poor employment practices which included the underpayment of wages. Deputy Fair Work Ombudsman (Operations) Michael Campbell has welcomed the company's decision to sign an Enforceable Undertaking and uphold the workplace rights of trolley collectors at all its supermarket sites. He hopes others would follow Coles’ lead, after Fair Work inspectors had found some trolley collectors being paid as little as $5 an hour for their physically demanding and often dangerous work. The Fair Work Ombudsman formally raised concerns with Coles late in 2011 about the exploitation and underpayment of trolley collectors employed by some of its sub-contractors at its sites. In 2012, they commenced legal proceedings against two sub-contractors operating at several Coles sites, alleging they had underpaid 10 trolley collectors over $200,000. the legal battle against Coles has been dropped and it has agreed to back pay the 10 trolley collectors almost $221,000 . It's believed that Coles knew that trolley collection employees at its sites were not being paid the correct minimum wages and conditions and that the company failed to take effective action to require its trolley service providers to comply with workplace laws. But due to Coles' co-operation, the legal battle against them was dropped and it has agreed to back pay the 10 trolley collectors almost $221,000. 'Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for ensuring compliance by major companies like Coles, so it is pleasing that the company has agreed to accept this responsibility and take immediate action,' Mr Campbell said. As part of the agreement, Coles will also establish a $500,000 fund that will be used to back-pay any other trolley collectors at its supermarkets who are subsequently found to have been underpaid. In a statement from Coles, it said with the help of the Fair Work Ombudsman, it has transformed its contracted trolley collection service across Australia to eradicate the underpayment of workers. *It is responsible for compliance with all aspects of the law across its business operations . *It has ethical and moral responsibility to ensure all entities and individuals directly involved in the conduct of its business comply with the law . *Coles also needs to make sure contractors are meeting social and community expectations to provide fair, equal and safe work opportunities . The supermarket company has also implemented fundamental permanent change to its trolley collection arrangements. 'Coles previously had more than 30 contractors but improved its operations in late 2012 by contracting to one national trolley collection provider, administered under a single external payroll.' 'Coles has also established a hotline for external complaints to be escalated to senior management while bank guarantee arrangements are in place with the sole contractor to secure against any risk of underpayments,' it said. 'Coles direct employees now collect trolleys at more than 400 of its stores and the aim is to have employees collecting trolleys at all stores by the end of 2016.' 'This year, Coles has also established an internal division, Coles Services, with approximately 700 employees and will move to more than 3000 by the end of 2016.' 'The enforceable undertaking agreed to by Coles will ensure that all trolley collection services are brought in-house by the end of 2016 and all affected workers are not out-of-pocket.' United Trolley Collections has already entered into its own Pro-active Compliance Deed with the Fair Work Ombudsman and is committed to taking all 'reasonable steps' to ensure its sub-contractors are compliant with workplace laws.

"Dangerous mindset: A senior figure close to Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi (pictured) provoked outrage after claiming the Holocaust was a myth invented by the United States . A senior figure close to Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi provoked outrage today after claiming the Holocaust was a myth invented by the United States. Fathi Shibab-Eddim, who is responsible for appointing editors of all the state-run newspapers, claimed the six million Jews killed by Hitler had actually been moved to America. His comments came as the world marked Holocaust Remembrance day on Sunday and little more than a week after it emerged that President Morsi himself had once described Jews as 'descendants of apes and pigs'. Shibab-Eddim said: 'The myth of the Holocaust is an industry that America invented. 'U.S. intelligence agencies in co-operation with their counterparts in allied nations during World War II created it [the Holocaust] to destroy the image of their opponents in Germany and to justify war and massive destruction against military and civilian facilities of the Axis powers, and especially to hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the atomic bomb.' His views have sparked fears that the Egyptian Government, like Iran's, has significant elements that refuse to acknowledge one of the best-documented genocides in history. The bizarre claims will also be especially concerning for Israel, which had fostered good relations with President Morsi's predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in 2011 following days of violent protests. Efraim Zuroff, Israel Director of the Jerusalem-based Simon Weisenthal Center, whose mission is to defend against anti-Semitism and teach the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations, told FoxNews.com that Shibab-Eddim's views showed a dangerous mindset. He said: 'Obviously, if a person in that position makes that ridiculous claim it is of concern. 'The sad truth is that these views are relatively common in the Arab world and are the result of ignorance on one hand and of government-sponsored Holocaust denial on the other hand.' Disturbing: His comments came as the world marked Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, being respected here by a member of Romania's Jewish community in a cemetery in Bucharest . Earlier this month, the White House . condemned President Morsi after it was revealed he had described Jews as . ‘descendants of apes and pigs’. The Muslim Brotherhood leader is also reported to have asked Egyptians to ‘nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred’. In other comments, he said Zionists are bloodsuckers who attack Palestinians and are related to apes. The remarks were made three years ago, but have only recently emerged. Threat to peace? Shibab-Eddim's views also come just days after the White House condemned Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi (pictured) for describing Jews as 'descendants of apes and pigs' President Barack Obama’s White House spokesman Jay Carney said: ‘The language that we have seen is deeply offensive. ‘We completely reject these statements, as we do any language that espouses religious hatred. ‘This kind of discourse has been acceptable in the region for far too long, and is counter to the goal of peace.’ Morsi’s remarks and the Obama administration’s rebuke marked a new point of tension in the complex relationship between the U.S. and Egypt’s fledgling democracy. Since being elected in June of 2012 in the aftermath of the revolution that ousted former President Mubarak, Morsi has promised to abide by Egypt’s decades-old peace treaty with Israel. Morsi was also instrumental in facilitating a ceasefire in November between Israel and Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip, despite his refusal to speak directly with Israeli officials. But despite this, there are fears that Morsi may prove to be a radical Islamist. He has already provoked a war with more democratic elements within Egypt over a new constitution which grants him far-reaching powers.","Fathi Shibab-Eddim claims U.S. used myth to destroy image of the Nazis .

"European Union migrants could be refused entry to France if their ‘personal behaviour’ is considered a threat to ‘security or public order’. The vaguely worded measure could be used to stop all kinds of undesirables entering the country, from those with criminal records to communities considered unable to integrate. Critics also believe it could be manipulated to stop almost any foreigner entering France, even those with EU passports. It comes after the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, warned Britain that a cap on migrants arriving from neighbouring countries would be illegal. French president Francois Hollande (left) and his Prime Minister Manuel Valls (right) have pledged new laws to ban foreigners from France . France’s increasingly reactionary Socialist government has introduced legislation clearly aimed at stopping undesirables, whether Roma gypsies or known eastern European gangsters. Clauses on new immigration and anti-terrorism measures are aimed at ‘any national of an EU member-state or any member of the family of such an individual’ who is likely to cause trouble. The proposed legislation reads that all should ‘be banned from entering French territory if their presence would constitute a real, current and sufficiently serious threat’. It is all aimed at protecting the ‘fundamental interest of society, in terms of public order or security’ against their ‘personal behaviour’. Despite the EU principle of freedom of movement, Prime Minister Manuel Valls has made it clear that he wants to keep undesirables out. Mr Valls said he stands by remarks calling for the expulsion of France’s Roma communities, despite the fact that most are from the EU countries of Bulgaria and Romania. David Cameron today hit back at EU claims that he could not reform immigration rules - insisting that the British people were his 'boss', not Brussels . Outgoing European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso warned Britain it would not be able to introduce immigration caps . He said few could ever integrate into French society and ‘the majority’ should be ‘sent back to the borders’ because of their association with crimes ranging from robbery to muggings and aggressive begging. France has move increasingly to the far right this year, with the anti-immigration and anti-EU National Front party riding high in opinion polls. Meanwhile, Mr Valls has been criticised by human rights campaigners, the European Commission and and left-wing cabinet colleagues. Similar groups have attacked the new legal measures, one of which was approved as a clause as part of an anti-terrorism bill in the Senate last week. The EU executive has not yet commented on the proposed French laws, but human rights groups say it will be used to keep legitimate immigrants out. Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy have seen the biggest increases in NINOs in the last six years, according to official government figures . A spokesman for the Paris-based Immigrants' Information and Support Group said: . ‘We are particularly worried about the possible use of this measure against Roma from Romania and Bulgaria.’ The broad definition of terms such as ‘security threat’ and ‘personal behaviour’ could all be used to refuse entry, such groups believe. But a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Paris said that each case would be considered ‘on its own merits’, and the legislation was ‘by no means’ aimed at specific EU communities like the Roma. Amnesty International are among groups who have called for a ban on forced evictions which saw more than 10,000 Roma evicted from temporary camps in the first half of this year. Their caravans and illegal shelters are regularly razed to the ground, with Mr Valls saying : ‘The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.’ Last week, EC president Mr Barrosa said David Cameron’s attempt to control EU migration was doomed to failure because freedom of movement is ‘an essential principle’.","New law could stop criminals or communities considered unable to integrate .

"Kobe Bryant's NBA season effectively ended on Wednesday after he had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder that will sideline him for nine months. The five-time National Basketball Association champion, who injured his shoulder last week in a loss to the Pelicans in New Orleans, underwent a procedure lasting two hours. Kobe Bryant had surgery on  a torn rotator cuff on Wednesday and will miss the rest of the season . LA Lakers superstar (right) sustained the injury during his team's 96-80 defeat by the New Orleans Pelicans . 36-year-old holds his right shoulder in pain after suffering the injury against New Orleans . 'I expect Kobe to make a full recovery and if all goes as expected, he should be ready for the start of the season,' said Dr Neal ElAttrache, who performed the surgery. Bryant was averaging 22.3 points in 35 games this season for a struggling Lakers team that is last in the Pacific Division with a 12-34 record. The Lakers formally declared Bryant out for the year by acknowledging the expected recovery time from his injury, but also effectively confirmed he won't retire and will attempt to play his 20th season in the fall. Bryant, who will be 37 years old this summer, is the NBA's highest-paid player at $23.5 million this season, and he is under contract for $25 million next year. Bryant was averaging 22.3 points from 35 games this season for a struggling Lakers team . 'In my mind right now, he's coming back next year, unless he tells me something different,' said coach Byron Scott. The 36-year-old guard, who earned his 17th All-Star selection last week, had sat out eight of the Lakers' previous 16 games for 'rest' reasons. Fourth on the NBA's all-time scoring list, he played in only six games last season due to knee and Achilles tendon injuries as Los Angeles posted a 27-55 record. The former league most valuable player, who joined the Lakers as a first-round pick out of high school as an 18-year-old in 1996, is signed through next season after agreeing to a two-year extension in 2013 for $48.5 million.","Kobe Bryant injured himself during the defeat to New Orleans Pelicans .

"Papiss Cisse may get his desired move away from Newcastle this window, after a mystery Middle East club offered £8million for the Senegalese striker. Turkish outfits Trabzonspor and Besiktas are also keen on Cisse, who wants to leave St James’ Park. Despite the mysterious £8m from the Middle-Eastern suitors, Newcastle are hoping for a fee closer to £10m for the 28-year-old. Outbound? Papiss Cisse is the subject of a £8m bid from a mystery Middle East club . Trazbonspor, who saw a £4million offer rejected last week, and Besiktas want to take Cisse on loan but now look set to miss out.

"When Yohan Cabaye called his childhood friend Mathieu Debuchy a year ago to sell Newcastle United to him, he knew the fans would help seal the deal. An ardent follower of the Barclays Premier League, Debuchy knew all about the club when they came calling in Lille. Ginola, Robert, Ben Arfa and Shearer all resonated with the defender, but the inside track from his trusted ally helped make his mind up. ‘I already knew about Newcastle and that many French players had played for them,’ Debuchy recalled. ‘And other great players like Alan Shearer. I knew Newcastle were one of the best teams in this country. Body art fan: Newcastle United's Mathieu Debuchy says the team will miss his good friend Yohan Cabaye, who has signed for Paris Saint-Germain . Cab faring well: Former Newcastle midfielder Cabaye goes for the ball in action for his new club Paris Saint-Germain . Prior knowledge: Debuchy knew all about Newcastle legend Alan Shearer before he signed for the club from Lille . ‘Yohan told me the club were fantastic but above all he talked about the fans and that convinced me to come straight away.’ Only from Saturday, when Newcastle welcome Sunderland for the 149th Tyne-Wear derby, Cabaye is no longer there after sealing his own January transfer to Paris Saint-Germain this week. Newcastle will miss the midfielder but Debuchy, whose family shared meals and days off with the Cabaye clan, will feel his absence most. Those same fans will also feel aggrieved at the sale, no matter what the financial benefits. Friends celebrate: Debuchy, centre, celebrates scoring Newcastle's goal in the 2-1 loss to Sunderland with Cabaye in the background . Cabaye’s £20million fee was not touched before the transfer window closed on Friday night. ‘He will be a miss for the team,’ Debuchy said. ‘He was an extraordinary player and we were friends but we have other talented players. He will miss the Newcastle supporters, I know that.’ Debuchy started in goal when he began kicking a ball at the age of four in Fretin, his small village near Lille. French star: Debuchy spent 10 years at Lille before joining Newcastle . It did not take long before he played outfield with his older brother Gregoire — who also became a Lille junior  — and their friends on a makeshift pitch or in the street. ‘I was a good keeper but I wanted to get on the ball more,’ he said. ‘I wanted to play in every position but Patrick Vieira was my favourite so I usually played as a defensive midfielder.’ Union Sportive Fretin signed him and he joined Lille’s academy at the age of eight. Good times: Cabaye, second right, and Debuchy, far right, celebrates winning the French league title with Lille in 2011 . He didn’t leave until Newcastle paid £5.5m for him a year ago. Things could have been very  different. Three years before his Lille debut, Debuchy suffered a cruciate- ligament injury in training at the age of 15. It was a life-changing episode which required the support of his  parents Jean-Pascal and Dominique, as well as his older brother. Debuchy said: ‘I was young, I wasn’t a professional footballer and I had nothing to fall back on. I hadn’t achieved anything but to become a professional footballer, that is what I wanted more than anything. ‘Fortunately, the club looked after me and I had the support of my parents and my brother and my future wife Ludivine. I worked hard to get back over six months. Going for goal: Debuchy has been in good form for Newcastle this season . 'It was a serious injury and it was hard work. When I did my other knee I was in Ligue One and 22. I was prepared.’ His parents may not have approved at the time, and Debuchy’s wife has her own reservations now, but it was during that lay-off as a teenager that Debuchy had his first tattoo. He has lost count of them all now but his entire left arm and most of his back are covered. He has the names of his children Lalou, Lukas and Manon on each leg and the bottom of his back. It is all the work of a friend from Lille. Debuchy said: ‘Everyone has their own desires on what they want on their body. I just feel a real need to be able to express what I feel — and on my body it is tattoos. Part of his character: Debuchy says he feels a real need to express himself and that is the reason for his tattoos . ‘There is the fashion side to it but the majority are about my religion and my family. They have meaning. I am going to continue getting more but my wife may not like it. She has a few of her own but thinks I have enough. Softly spoken and still lacking the confidence to conduct this interview in English, Debuchy is far removed from the man who went wild when he scored in the Stadium of Light derby in October. There have been grumblings about the dearth of Geordies coming through at Newcastle but Debuchy insists the academy, part-funded by club sponsors Wonga, is vital. He said: ‘It is important they help local players become professionals. The fans want to see local players in their team.’ In pole position: Debuchy is currently keeping Arsenal Bacary Sagna out of the France national team and looks a good bet to keep his place for the World Cup . Debuchy, who is keeping Bacary Sagna out of France’s starting XI, plans to be reunited with Cabaye for the World Cup in Brazil. ‘It would be wonderful but nothing is certain,’ he said. ‘I will do everything I can to be there but Sagna is a fantastic player. The most important thing is France has a good World Cup.’ But before that is the derby. ‘I’ve had two (derby) defeats since I came and even scoring in one can’t make up for that. I want to put that right.’ As a proud partner of Newcastle United, Wonga are investing over £1.5m in the club’s academy.

"The Government has spent £80,000 of taxpayers' cash flying Eastern Europeans back to their homelands. Picture shows a policeman escorting a Romanian away from Park Lane . The Government has spent £80,000 of taxpayers’ cash flying Eastern European vagrants back to their homelands – only for many to return weeks later. More than 200 people were flown back to Romania and Bulgaria in the first three months of this year – using tickets paid for by the Home Office, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The migrants returned to Eastern Europe after a crackdown ordered by David Cameron on foreign EU nationals begging or sleeping rough in the UK. London landmarks such as Marble Arch and Park Lane have been blighted by gangs of Romanian beggars setting up makeshift camps, dumping rubbish and urinating in the street. There have also been increases in the levels of aggressive begging, pickpocketing and prostitution. But now it has emerged that Romanian beggars who have been deported are returning using different names. A police officer based in the Marble Arch area, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘We’ve been informed that they are getting an identity card but changing the name, although the number stays the same. So now we check the number as well as the name.’ Jack Gordon, chairman of the Hyde Park safer neighbourhood panel, said he too was aware of deported Romanians returning just weeks later. He said: ‘Some of them have been banned from this country and they come back using false identities. It’s a waste of money. We need to have a border regime that is efficient and effective and doesn’t let these people come sliding back in.’ Last month it emerged that the number of Romanian migrants sleeping rough in some of London’s most exclusive districts had tripled since the EU restrictions on their movements were lifted. The problem became so extreme that Westminster council held talks with Home Office officials last month. Last night, critics of the free flights accused the Government of wasting taxpayers’ money. Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‘This strikes me as a colossal waste of money because there’s no control over who comes back. ‘There’s only a very light check in . respect of those coming from the EU into this country. So it doesn’t . surprise me that there’s anecdotal evidence of Romanians coming back . when they know they’ll get a free ride again back to their own country.’ Scroll down for video . London landmarks such as Marble Arch and Park Lane have been blighted by gangs of Romanian beggars setting up makeshift camps, dumping rubbish and urinating in the street . Conservative MP Mark Reckless, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which deals with immigration issues as well as other areas of Home Office policy, said providing free flights was far from ideal but the best option in the circumstances. He added: ‘Taxpayers would be better served if we didn’t spend their money on this.’ New powers came into force in the New Year allowing the British authorities to remove and ban EU migrants from the country for 12 months if they are found to be vagrants or don’t have a job. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘No EU national has unrestricted access to the UK. Those who are found to be abusing their free movement rights are given every opportunity to leave voluntarily. ‘However, if they consistently refuse this support, are destitute and cannot demonstrate that they have a right to reside in the UK, our only option is to enforce their removal.’","More than 200 people flown back to Romania and Bulgaria in first three months of this year .

"Steffon Armitage’s chances of making the England World Cup squad look slimmer than ever after the flanker was given a court date following an alleged assault at a beachfront restaurant in Toulon. The European Player of the Year spent Wednesday night in custody and was released on bail on Thursday morning on condition that he returns for a hearing on February 10. According to reports in France, Armitage was ordered to pay £3,750 in bail fees and eye-witnesses claimed that his actions left a local man with a facial injury that has kept him out of work since December 13, when the incident took place after Toulon’s Champions Cup victory over Leicester Tigers. Steffon Armitage will appear in court on February 10 accused of an alleged assault . Armitage's Toulon team-mate Xavier Chiocci was also held in custody for several hours . Several Toulon players (pictured Delon Armitage and Mathieu Bastareaud) were celebrating their victory over Leicester on December 13 in a Mourillon beach-side bar-restaurant when a fight is alleged to have broke out . Toulon have threatened to impose internal sanctions on the 29-year-old, having confirmed that he was taken into custody along with team-mate Xavier Chiocci, who was freed without charge. The club said in a statement: ‘Xavier Chiocci’s custody ended on Wednesday night and no charges were brought against him. Steffon Armitage’s custody lasted through the night. If need be, RC Toulon will impose the necessary sanctions to preserve their core values.’ Even if Armitage is found not guilty, the negative publicity surrounding the hearing is likely to severely damage any hopes of an international call-up. Although the RFU have a policy of not picking overseas players, there have been popular calls to select the forward under the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause. The former London Irish star is a versatile option in the back row and was seen as the ideal candidate to help ease England’s injury problems, which were  worsened on Thursday by the news that tight-head prop David Wilson is suffering from a nerve problem in his neck. Armitage has won five caps for England but hasn't played for his country since moving to France in 2011 . The flanker celebrates scoring a try during a Champions Cup match against Llanelli Scarlets last October . Armitage celebrates with brother Delon during a London Irish Challenge Cup match in 2009 . Wilson, who has started England’s last 10 Tests, will sit out training on Friday and Newcastle Falcons youngster Kieran Brookes has been called in to provide cover. England’s injury list is already alarmingly long - it includes Tom Wood, Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes, Ed Slater and Joe Launchbury - and head coach Stuart Lancaster hopes Wilson will recover in time for the opening RBS 6 Nations Test against Wales next Friday. ‘We have brought Kieran in as cover at tighthead as a precaution because Davy has a small nerve impingement which should settle down,’ said Lancaster. Newcastle tight-head Kieran Brookes has been called into England’s training squad . David Wilson became the latest player to join Stuart Lancaster’s lengthy casualty list . Leicester second row Geoff Parling has also been ruled out of next week’s fixture at the Millennium Stadium. The 31-year-old has been sidelined with a knee injury but Exeter Chiefs coach Rob Baxter, who on Thursday announced that he has signed the lock for next season, said he has no concerns over the veteran’s fitness. ‘As with most players, we’ve done a full medical and we don’t have any concerns about his physical state,’ said Baxter. ‘He’s just like a lot of guys who get to just over 30 and have played a fair bit of rugby - there’s a few miles on the clock but physically he’s in very good condition really. ‘Geoff is a proven international performer. He adds great experience in running things like the line-out, he has good leadership experience as well and all those things add up to it being a very good signing for us.’ Geoff Parling (top) is to leave Leicester Tigers after six years to join the Exeter Chiefs on a two-year deal .

"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's tenure at City Hall is set to end this November but the billionaire is not yet ready to climb down from his bully pulpit. The business mogul turned politician has launched a gun safety crusade in the U.S. and is bankrolling his very own super PAC to support candidates across the nation championing his pet issue. The Democrat turned RINO, Republican in Name Only, turned Independent has taken on the gun lobby after the tragedies in Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. by pouring more than $10 million so far into his Independence USA PAC. Though he insists he does support the constitutional right to bear arms, with an estimated fortune of $25 billion at his disposal, the 71-year-old appears to be gearing up to take on the National Rifle Association. Scroll down for video . Call to arms: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (center in October) holds an AR-15 assault rifle retrieved in a weapons bust. Bloomberg is calling for an assault weapons ban and universal background checks . Campaign: Bloomberg (left in 2007) co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006 to mobilize city leaders to fight gun violence . Bloomberg's campaign for gun control began in 2006, when he joined forces with Boston Mayor Tom Menino to establish Mayor's Against Illegal Guns or MAIG. The executive has donated more than $3 million to the advocacy group and hosted numerous summits on what cities can do to curb gun violence. Under his leadership the group has grown from a core of 15 members to a movement of over 900 mayors from major U.S. cities. The group's platform includes calls to . ban assault-style weapons, execute universal background checks on gun . buyers and push for increased law enforcement resources to fight gun . trafficking. In October 2012, Bloomberg decided to add to the organization's arsenal with the creation of a political action committee that could offer financial support to candidates across the U.S. who support stricter gun control measures. Grassroots: Bloomberg's group brought out the star power in December (left to right: Beyonce, Jessica Alba and Reese Witherspoon) to star in a TV commercial advocating for tighter gun control measures . In November, Bloomberg's PAC provided funding for a total of seven races across the country for candidates running for both House and Senate seats and even one contender for the Attorney General in Pennsylvania. Following the tragic shooting in December at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that left 26 dead, Bloomberg stepped up his campaign to mobilize a grassroots effort. He gathered a bevy of Hollywood A-Listers to star in a one minute TV commercial to 'Demand a Plan,' sponsored by MAIG, and advocate for Congress to move quickly on tighter gun regulation. Bloomberg's group also produced a 30 second TV spot that aired during the Super Bowl. This February, thanks to more than $2 million in funding from Bloomberg's PAC, anti-NRA candidate Robin Kelly was elected to fill Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s Congressional seat in Illinois. Kelly, who made gun regulation a top issue on her agenda, successfully beat her five contenders namely Debbie Halvorson, a Democrat who earned an 'A' score from the NRA from her past term in Congress, who was targeted by Bloomberg's PAC. Gun lobby: David Keene, president of the National Rifle Association, has downplayed the effectiveness of Bloomberg's campaign for increased gun regulation . 'The mayor has been clear he will used . his resources to support common sense reforms,' a spokesman for . Independence USA, Stefan Friedman, told the MailOnline. Maintaining that the group does support the Second Amendment of the U.S. constitution, Mr Friedman said the mayor's campaign for gun safety is not a 'zero sum proposition.' 'You can be for the second amendment and not for assault weapons. You can be for the second amendment and not for background checks.' But the NRA is crying foul and has labeled the New Yorker a 'fanatic, anti-gun activist.' Speaking at a Salt Lake City hunting expo on February 23, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre warned about the 'secret agenda' behind universal background checks. 'This is not universal background checks. This is universal registration of your firearms,' he said, claiming registration is the government's first step before they seek to confiscate weapons. NRA President David Keene has also spoken critically about Bloomberg's effort and has suggested the mayor's effort won't have a long lasting impact. In regards to Kelly's election after the influx of cash from Bloomberg's PAC, he said, 'this . proves nothing other than that in a four or five person primary, if you . spend $2 million you outta be able to get enough votes for your . candidate to win,' he said on February 27, speaking on the NRA's Cam & Co. news show. 'It's only meaningful . in that you have a fanatic, anti-gun activist who happens to be the . mayor of New York and happens to have billions of . dollars who has indicated his willingness to spend up to a billion . dollars to get his way.' 'This is indicative of nothing more than the depth of this man's wealth and his willingness to spend it.' But the mayor has no plans of stopping anytime soon. Without elaborating on the PAC's next move, Mr Friedman said 'geography is not really an issue' as they survey the landscape for like minded candidates pushing for common sense reforms.","Bloomberg's third term as NYC Mayor ends in November .

"Arsenal's new Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista has all the qualities needed to be a big hit in the Barclays Premier League, according to manager Arsene Wenger. The permanent transfer of the 24-year-old from Villarreal was confirmed on Wednesday night after all the formalities of international clearance on a work permit were completed. Part of the deal, reported to be worth around £15million, sees Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell move in the other direction on loan for the rest of the season. Gabriel Paulista completed his £11.2million switch from Villarreal to Arsenal on  Wednesday . Wenger admitted Arsenal were short on defensive cover, but although he believes it will take Gabriel time to settle, the Gunners boss insists the player has what it takes to become an integral part of the squad. 'He is a promising Brazilian defender. Just 24 years old and we got the work permit. He has good pace, is good in the challenge and is tall, so he can adapt to English football,' Wenger told Arsenal Player. 'Maybe it will take some time to adapt completely, but overall it is very good to have him. 'This season he has played every game for Villarreal and we have seen him many times. We are convinced about his quality. The 24-year-old defender was granted a work permit despite earlier fears it would be rejected . 'He is very ambitious, focused and serious. That is important at a club like ours - you need to have a complete focus on your job. He has that. 'I like the players who come from nowhere and show they can adapt. From Brazil, he has (then) adapted to Spain. That means he has already made it and adapted in another country, and so that is another important quality.' Arsenal's preferred central defensive partnership has been Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. However, Wenger accepts given the wretched run of injury misfortune, to head into the defining period of the campaign with not enough strength in depth at the back would have been folly. 'We needed some cover, or we would not be responsible,' added Wenger, who could put Gabriel straight into the squad for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game at home to Aston Villa. The 24-year-old will wear the No 5 shirt, the north London club confirmed on Thursday . 'We needed another centre-back because we have lost (Mathieu) Debuchy. (Nacho) Monreal can play centre-back and we are a bit short there if something happens, especially with the Achilles (problem) of Koscielny since the start of the season. '(Gabriel) can (also) play right-back and left-back, and that is of course a good quality as well.' Campbell, meanwhile, is hoping to make the most of his second loan spell in Spain, having spent a season at Real Betis as he awaited international clearance to join up with the Gunners' first-team squad. The 22-year-old said at a news conference ahead of Thursday night's Copa del Rey tie against Getafe: 'I am very eager to get started on this new stage in my career. 'A lot of people spoke very well about the club, the first of those being (Arsenal midfielder) Santi Cazorla, who, when it was time, helped me decide to come here. The Brazilian will be competing with Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker for a place in central defence . Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell signed for Villarreal on loan for the rest of the season as part of the deal . 'I know La Liga and I feel like that is an advantage working for me as I adapt my style to the club's. 'I am going to give 200 per cent and I hope my football can bring joy to the fans.' Arsenal, who went through to the FA Cup fifth round with victory at Brighton last weekend, will look to continue their Premier League revival with victory over Villa. Wenger, however, revealed Chile forward Alexis Sanchez could miss out because of a hamstring problem. England international Danny Welbeck has not played since December 28 because of a thigh injury, but is expected back early next week ahead of the north London derby at Tottenham. Elsewhere, midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (groin) is still not fully match fit, while Wenger said Jack Wilshere 'should join in normal training in 10 days' following his recovery from ankle surgery. Alexis Sanchez, against Brighton last weekend, could miss the Aston Villa clash with a hamstring problem .","Arsenal signed Brazil defender Gabriel Paulista for £11.2m from Villarreal .

"Created: . 15:59 GMT, 15 May 2014 . A city’s first openly gay councillor has been been accused of keeping a ‘gimp’ sex slave. Labour member Stephen Poulson allegedly took aim at Liberal Cllr Stephen Radford, who represents Tuebrook in Liverpool, and made the bizarre remarks on Facebook. A string of comments are said to have been posted in a group called Tuebrook Uncovered apparently by Poulson accusing Radford, 57, of having a masked, leather-clad sex slave. Tirade: Cllr Stephen Radford (left), a gay Liberal Party member, has been accused of keeping a 'gimp' sex slave in his cellar by Labour Party member Stephen Poulson . It said: 'Was not on to the fact we had a fancy dress yesterday. Cllr Radford and his candidate (the gimp from the cellar) came dressed as tramps and ate all our butties like they had been living in the bus stop.' Liberal leader Radford, who became Liverpool’s first openly gay councillor, claims Poulson has been abusing him and his other party members for two years. The politician branded Poulson an ‘abusive troll’ and claimed he was forced to contact a solicitor to have the comments removed from the closed group Facebook page. Councillor Radford said: 'His comments have been blatantly abusive and purely out of malice, there’s no two ways about that. Abuse: The offensive comments posted by Stephen Poulson . 'He posted a string of attacks on the Tuebrook Uncovered Facebook page which we asked to be removed. 'It wasn’t until we contacted solicitors that comments were eventually removed which shows a level of complete shallowness. 'The comment about the gimp in the cellar was clearly a sexual comment. He’s just an abusive troll who thinks he can say anything he wants on the internet - he’s totally gutless. 'When we did complain he responded by saying it was an attack on his freedom of speech which is completely ludicrous.' Cllr Radford vented his frustration at the length of time it took Labour to address his complaints about Poulson. He said: 'It’s not like he’s just made a schoolboy comment on the playground. This has been going on for two years and he’s still out there dishing out leaflets. 'How can any responsible political party have someone behaving like this for such a long period of time without doing anything about it? 'I’m appalled it has been able to go on for such a long time without being dealt with.' Mr Radford campaigning on the streets of Tuebrook in Liverpool. He has expressed frustration with Labour's handling of the situation . Tuebrook is a ward in the West Derby Parliamentary constituency held by Labour MP Stephen Twigg, the first openly gay man at the time of his election to the House of Commons in the 1997 general election. A spokesperson for the Labour Party in Liverpool said Poulson had been spoken to about the comments, which did not form any of the party’s political campaigning. The spokesperson said: 'Stephen Twigg has a long-established track record of clean campaigning and is about taking a positive approach to politics. 'It’s true we are concerned about the reports we have received and are trying to take steps to deal with it. 'We have a duty of care to each individual member but equally we have a long-standing and positive relationship with Steve Radford. 'He is an active local councillor in the constituency and it’s a relationship that has been built on respect. 'While we are enthusiastic to take the Labour message to Tuebrook, where Stephen Twigg is MP, it’s a positive message, not personally critical of Cllr Radford and his team and this is not the sort of campaigning that Stephen Twigg or the West Derby CLP are engaged in, or ever will be.' Poulson has admitted comments about Radford having a ‘sexual bias’ towards Scouts in his capacity as chair of poverty charity Tuebrook Hope Group, on Facebook. He posted a retraction saying they were 'untrue and unfounded'.","Labour member Stephen Poulson made remarks to Stephen Radford .

"It was the first major naval battle of the Second World War, and led to the sinking of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee. The Battle of the River Plate, which took place 75 years ago, was described by Winston Churchill as a 'brilliant sea fight' which took its place in Royal Navy annals. Tomorrow, four of the handful of survivors will meet at the National Memorial Arboretum, where people remember Britain's war sacrifices, to unveil a monument to the famous victory. The German battleship Admiral  Graf Spee is seen in flames outside the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, on December 17, 1939, during the Battle of the River Plate . Tomorrow, four of the handful of survivors will meet at the National Memorial Arboretum, where people remember Britain's war sacrifices, to unveil a monument to the famous victory. Above, crew members of HMS Exeter celebrate their homecoming in Plymouth in 1940 after taking part in the battle against the Graf Spee . The new memorial is a lasting tribute to the selfless courage of those who fought and lost their lives in the battle and the ships which fought it - heavy cruiser HMS Exeter, light cruisers HMS Ajax (above) and Achilles and the Graf Spee . The new memorial is a lasting tribute to the selfless courage of those who fought and lost their lives in the battle and the ships which fought it - heavy cruiser HMS Exeter, light cruisers HMS Ajax and Achilles and the Graf Spee. Peter Danks, chairman of the HMS Ajax and River Plate Veterans Association, said: 'We are very proud to be unveiling our memorial which will ensure that all who took part in the Battle of the River Plate will be remembered always.' The Battle of the River Plate occurred on December 13, 1939, when ships from the Royal Navy's South American Division took on the 12,000 tonne might of the German warship, which had been attacking British merchant vessels in the South Atlantic. The Graf Spee was fast and heavily armoured and German commanders boasted 'anything it couldn't sink it could run away from'. Peter Danks, chairman of the HMS Ajax and River Plate Veterans Association, said: 'We are very proud to be unveiling our memorial which will ensure that all who took part in the Battle of the River Plate will be remembered always.' Above, a mock-up of part of the monument . The memorial dedication at the arboretum, at Alrewas, Staffordshire will be attended by four River Plate veterans - John Garrard and Ted Wicks from HMS Ajax and Jim London and Basil Trott from HMS Exeter - families of those who served, as well Captain Stephen and Commander Henry Harwood - the sons of Commodore Henry Harwood. Above is Exeter . Commodore Henry Harwood, commanding Hunting Group G, ordered the Ajax, Achilles and Exeter - all around half the size of the towering German vessel - to an area east of the River Plate, an estuary between Argentina and Uruguay. On the morning of the battle, Exeter investigated a plume of smoke and signalled, 'I think it is a Pocket Battleship'. At 6.18am, Graf Spee opened fire on Exeter, scoring a direct hit, but Ajax and Achilles closed in causing significant damage to the German vessel.

Knowing that escape was no longer an option Graf Spee was scuttled in the River Plate on December 17. The battle - in which 72 British sailors died - brought the first Royal Navy victory of the Second World War and gave a much-needed lift to the country's morale. In a radio broadcast to the nation, Churchill said: 'This brilliant sea fight takes its place in our naval annals and in a long, cold, dark winter it warmed the cockles of the British hearts.' Captain Stephen Harwood, the son of Commodore Harwood, who is also patron of the Memorial Dedication, said that the new monument would continue 'to fulfil Winston Churchill's prediction that this battle will long be told in song and story.'

The £15,000 black granite monument stands around 6ft tall and weighs 2 tonnes. The front of the memorial is engraved with the crests of the three Royal Navy vessels, a description of the battle and includes the words: 'It is dedicated to those who served in the ships at the battle and in subsequent action especially those who gave their lives.' On the back is the Graf Spee's crest, an engraving of the battle area and the Churchill quote: 'This great battle will long be told in song and story.' First major WWII naval engagement... and a captain's suicide . The Battle of the River Plate, which took place on December 13, 1939 was the first major naval battle of World War Two. At . dawn on that day, the Admiral Graf Spee - a German armored ship . ('pocket battleship') commanded by Captain Hans Langsdorff - made its way . to the Rio De la Plata (River Plate) in South America as it hunted for . enemy ships. For . several months, the Graf Spee had been carrying out commerce raiding in . the region - a tactical move whereby it attacked enemy merchant . ships. The Graf Spee is seen arriving at the port of Montevideo before sinking . In a few short weeks, nine merchantmen totalling 450,000 tons . had been destroyed. Among the Allied . ships on the lookout for her were the Ajax, Exeter and Achilles - under the command of Henry Harwood. And, on the fateful morning, they spotted her. The . British cruisers landed 20 hits on Graf Spee, killing 36 crew and . wounding 60 more. Graf Spee's official Fritz ter Hardt on board in front of the port of Montevideo shortly before the battleship was scuttled . Although the . ship could still fight, a shell had destroyed the kitchen and bakery . and there was water in the oil tanks. Following the heavy engagement, she . fled to the neutral port of Montevideo in Uruguay for vital repairs. It . was then that Langsdorff took one of the most surprising and . controversial decisions of the war. Instead . of leading his crew to certain death, he left most of the 350 men . ashore and used a skeleton crew to sail the Graf Spee out of . harbour and scuttle her. Langsdorff's . decision saved hundreds of men but it cost him his reputation among the . Nazi high command and, ultimately, his life. Hitler never forgave . Langsdorff for what he considered cowardice: Nazi philosophy dictated . that commandants died in their boots. Though a hero to his men, . Langsdorff was branded a traitor and his name excised from Nazi history. Within days, he committed suicide with a revolver in a Buenos Aires . hotel room.

"This is the moment a gun-wielding robber demanded 'money, money!' as he brandished an AK47 assault rifle at his terrified victims. Mohammed Ali, 26, used the terrifying weapon to carry out two raids in east London - one in which he stole £400 from William Hill and another in which he threatened staff in Barclays, but failed to get anything. Ali, of Bow, east London, was jailed for . seven years today at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm - because the gun was deactivated. Shocking crime: Mohammed Ali was captured on CCTV threatening frightened staff AK47 assault rifle . Small gain: Ali pleaded guilty to two robberies on betting shop William Hill - when he got away with £400 - and on Barclays - when he escaped with nothing . He was identified as the gunman after an investigation of more than two years by the Flying Squad at Barking. Police tracked him down using mobile phone records, arrested him in November 2011 and he was charged on 23 February 2012. Last month Ali admitted involvement in two out of six raids investigated by the Flying Squad. Ali and an accomplice approached cashiers in a Stepney branch of William Hill on Tuesday 9 June, 2009, just after 9.30am. Ali brandished the AK47 and shouted 'Money, money!', before fleeing with £400. On Saturday 25 July, 2009, at 4.30pm, Ali and an accomplice ran up to the counter in Barclays in Bethnal Green, demanding money. Aggressive: It took police more than two years to . track down 26-year-old Ali, pictured, using phone records. He has now . been jailed for seven years . Ali smashed the gun against the glass, cracking it with the force he had used. The staff hid and the robbers were forced to flee empty-handed. Enquiries revealed Ali had bought a deactivated AK47 from a company in Wales and had it delivered to his work address in Aldgate. This gun has never been recovered. He was jailed for four years for the . first robbery and three years consecutive for the second, with two years . concurrent for the firearms charge. The Recorder of London, Peter Beaumont QC, said: ‘You used an imitation AK-47 to intimidate staff into handing over money. Casual threat: Ali had bought a deactivated AK47  (file picture) from a company in Wales and had it delivered to his work address in Aldgate . ‘The total sentence is seven years imprisonment.’ Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Neil Turner said: 'We are pleased at today’s sentencing, which means a very dangerous man is now behind bars. 'Ali used a military weapon on the streets of London to commit armed robberies, terrifying his victims who were just trying to carry out their everyday business. 'His conviction comes after a lengthy investigation by the Flying Squad, which demonstrates our tenacity and commitment to tackling these types of crime.' Ali’s accomplice, Mohammed Ghaoui, 22, of Wembley, was jailed for four years in December 2009 after pleading guilty to robbery and possession of a firearm in relation to the William Hill robbery.","Mohammed Ali was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey today .

"New York Senator Chuck Schumer is asking  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a health alert nationwide on Sunday regarding an illness carried by mosquitoes in Brazil, where this year's World Cup is being played. According to Schumer, he is concerned about a virus called the chikungunya virus, often referred to as the 'chik-v' virus. The chik-v virus is not fatal, but causes victims to experience fevers, joint and muscle pain, swelling, headaches, and rashes. 'We have to prevent the spread of the virus' said Chuck Schumer is regards to warning Americans about the possibility of travelers to Brazil for the World Cup bringing back the Chik-V virus . The virus is often carried by mosquitoes, who are the prevalent carriers of the sickness in Brazil. 'We have to prevent the spread of this virus before it reaches the United States in large numbers,' Schumer told reporters, including 1010 WINS’ Glenn Schuck, on Sunday. 'The problem here is the World Cup gives the unfortunate opportunity for the virus to spread among people from all nations of the world who are together,' Schumer said. According to Schumer, there has already been three cases of chik-v reported in New York this year, as well as another 25 in Florida. Schumer fears that these numbers will rise once fans return to the United States following the conclusion of the World Cup. Schumer is also calling on U.S. Department of Homeland Security to increase border safeguards, citing the developing threat in the Caribbean, where more than 100,000 people have been affected. Prior instances of outbreaks of chik-v have occurred in Africa, Asia, and Europe. It was discovered in Tanganyika, modern-day Rwanda, Africa in 1952. Experts describe the virus as not fatal, but unpleasant. 'This is not a fatal infection; it’s just a miserable infection,' Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of Vanderbilt University’s Department of Preventive Medicine, told CBS2 earlier this month. Schumer is warning travelers that transmission of the chik-v virus by mosquito is prevalent in Brazil . The chik-v virus was first discovered in Africa in 1952. It has since migrated worldwide to places in South America, Asia, and Europe . Last week, multiple states reported their first-ever encounters with the virus. On June 11, a person who had just returned from the Caribbean was diagnosed with the virus in Forsyth County, North Carolina. Also in June 2014, a Mississippi person who had recently traveled from Haiti was diagnosed with the virus. There are currently no cures or vaccinations for the disease. However, it generally heals on it's own. The fever is noted to last approximately two days, but the amount of time the muscle and joint pain can last varies by age. Over 100,000 have been infected with the virus in the Caribbean. The World Cup is scheduled to continue until July 13. The United States is scheduled to play Portugal at 6pm Sunday.","Virus, called the chikungunya virus, or 'chik-v' virus for short, is starting to appear in America .

"Findings: Around one in ten senior teachers said children at their school aged between five and seven were still not toilet trained . Hundreds of children aged five and older are still wearing nappies in primary schools, a survey suggests. It found around one in ten senior teachers said children at their school aged between five and seven were still not  toilet trained. There were even perfectly healthy pupils in their teens – without medical conditions or developmental problems – who were  unable to go to the bathroom on their own, it was reported. The worrying findings came in a Sky News survey of schools in England, which is the first to show the problem extends past the first year of school. Teachers also warned that growing numbers of young children were starting school without other basic skills, such as being able to hold a knife and fork properly or use a paintbrush. The survey was carried out by the National Foundation for Educational Research, which asked head teachers and staff in England about their experiences of children coming to schools still having to wear nappies. Nine per cent – almost one in ten – of heads and senior staff said that in the past year a child aged between five and seven had worn a nappy to their school. If representative of schools across England, it would mean up to 1,600 of England’s 16,000 primary schools had at least one pupil aged over five still wearing nappies in the  past year. The survey found a lower figure, however, for classroom teachers, 5 per cent of whom said they had children still in nappies at that age. Four per cent – almost one in 20 – of heads and senior staff said that in the last year a child aged seven to 11 had worn a nappy to school. One per cent of classroom teachers surveyed had experience of older children with the problem. There has been growing evidence in recent years that increasing numbers of children are starting school without being fully toilet trained. Experts say it is not just pupils from . deprived backgrounds who are having problems but those who have working . parents too busy to address the issue. Worrying: Nine per cent - almost one in ten - of heads and senior staff said that in the past year a child aged between five and seven had worn a nappy to their school . Anne-Marie Middleton runs a programme at a Kent school to help pupils go to the bathroom on their own. She says many pupils are too embarrassed to admit they still wear nappies. She said: ‘We’re seeing more and more children wearing nappies. ‘We find that more and more  children have an issue with toilet training further up the school. I know of one 11-year-old who has to wear pull-ups at night. It can really place a strain on teachers. It stops lessons.’ Life Skills: Teachers also warned that growing numbers of young children were starting school without other basic skills, such as being able to hold a knife and fork properly or use a paintbrush . Miss Middleton says parents’ busy lives are often at the root of the problem with pupils arriving at school without many basic life skills. As well as being unable to go to the bathroom without help, they have no idea of table manners or even how to hold a paintbrush. Janet Marsh, a teacher from Dover, said she knew of some 15-year olds without medical problems who still had toilet training problems. ‘It’s an incredibly serious situation,’ she said. ‘There are children who miss 25 per cent of their education in reception because they’re being taken out to be changed. How are they going to catch up?’","Survey shows some teenagers unable to go to the bathroom alone .

"Iran claims to have successfully copied a U.S. drone it captured in December 2011, with state television broadcasting - and even the country's supreme leader tweeting - images of the replicated aircraft. Tehran captured the US RQ-170 Sentinel in 2011 while it was in its airspace, reportedly on a mission to spy on the country's nuclear sites. At the time, U.S. military officials . tried to play down the incident, saying Iran did not have the technology . to decipher its secrets, and President Barack Obama asked the Islamic . republic to return the Sentinel to no avail. But a military officer said in footage, released Sunday, that they had cracked the code. Scroll down for video . Tweet: Iran said on Sunday it has succeeded in copying a U.S. drone it captured in December 2011, with state television broadcasting - and even the country's supreme leader tweeting - images apparently showing the replicated aircraft . 'Our . engineers succeeded in breaking the drone's secrets and copying them. It . will soon take a test flight,' the officer said in a move that will . likely appear threatening to Washington. The . broadcast showed supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's visit to an . exhibition organized by the powerful Revolutionary Guards air wing about . Iran's military advances, particularly regarding ballistic missiles and . drones. The leader later tweeted a photo of the drone. Footage showed two nearly identical drones. 'This drone is very important for reconnaissance missions,' Khamenei said, standing in front of the Iranian copy of the American unmanned aircraft. Original: An undated picture received December 8, 2011 shows a member of Iran's revolutionary guard pointing at the U.S. RQ-170 unmanned spy plane . Iran said it had taken control of the ultra hi-tech drone and forced it down in the desert where it was recovered nearly intact. Washington said it had lost control of the aircraft. Iran has been working to develop a significant drone programme of its own, and some of its unmanned aircraft have a range of hundreds of miles and are armed with missiles. The state broadcaster also showed images that the commentary said had been recorded by an Iranian drone above a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Gulf. In the pictures, which were relatively clear, it was possible to see American personnel working on planes and helicopters aboard the vessel. Leader: A handout picture released by the office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on May 11, 2014 shows him, center, being surrounded by military commanders while visiting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force exhibition in Tehran . Success: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, left, sitting next to the captured US RQ-170 sentinel high-altitude reconnaissance that crashed in Iran on December 2011 and its locally made replica . Meanwhile, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Western expectations for the Islamic Republic to limit its missile program were 'stupid and idiotic.' The Supreme Leader also called on the country's Revolutionary Guards to mass-produce missiles. The United States and its allies have said they are worried about Iran's missile program as they fear the weapons could carry nuclear warheads. Iran has long denied having any plans to develop atomic weapons. 'They expect us to limit our missile program while they constantly threaten Iran with military action. So this is a stupid, idiotic expectation,' Khamenei was quoted as telling the IRNA news agency while on a visit to an aeronautics fair by the Revolutionary Guards. 'The revolutionary guards should definitely carry out their program and not be satisfied with the present level. They should mass produce. This is a main duty of all military officials,' Khamenei said.","Tehran reportedly captured the US RQ-170 Sentinel in 2011 while it was in its airspace, apparently on a mission to spy on the country's nuclear sites .

"Dozens of Tory MPs are threatening to defy David Cameron by voting against plans for plain cigarette packets . Dozens of Tory MPs are threatening to defy David Cameron by voting against plans for plain cigarette packets. Priti Patel, a member of the Prime Minister’s own policy advisory board, is leading the charge - warning it will be the ‘final nail in the coffin’ of hundreds of newsagents. Rebels say around 40 Conservative backbenchers may vote against what they regard as a nanny state measure. If that happens, it would dwarf this week’s rebellion against the controversial HS2 rail line. Public health minister Jane Ellison announced last month (April) that shops would be forced to sell cigarettes in plan packaging within a year. Fifty MPs, most of them Tory, have signed a Commons motion against plain packaging - an indication of the scale of backbench anger. A large rebellion would be another sign of Mr Cameron’s poor grip on party discipline. Most famously, House of Lords reform - part of the Coalition agreement with a Liberal Democrats - had to be dropped when backbenchers refused to back it. As well as being one of the Prime Minister’s advisers on the Number 10 Policy Unit, Miss Patel is chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on small shops. Last night she said: ‘This is a very, very anti-Conservative thing to do. ‘It is completely mad. Plain packaging is a blunt instrument which will have a disproportionate impact on independent retailers. ‘All this will do is that it will boost the number of illicit cigarettes, meaning it will actually be easier for children to purchase them.’ Rob Halfon, another Tory backbencher, said: ‘Fifteen thousand people die of alcohol abuse every year, but are we going to have brown paper bags over alcohol bottles? Priti Patel, a member of the Prime Minister's own policy advisory board, is leading the charge - warning it will be the 'final nail in the coffin' of hundreds of newsagents . ‘This decision will simply increase the black market and create a new business in fancy cigarette cases, rather than dealing with the problem.’ Miss Ellison went for plain packaging after commissioning a report from former paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler, which said there was ‘very strong evidence’ from Australia that plain packaging protects youngsters. No date has yet been set for a Commons vote on the policy. Rebels hope their pressure will force the government into a U-turn before a vote is held. As well as being one of the Prime Minister's Policy Unit, Miss Patel is chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on small shops . In a letter to Asian Trader magazine two weeks ago, Miss Patel accused ministers of wishing to ‘steamroll stricter tobacco controls and plain packaging through with no further debate or consideration, under the pretence that this will in some way prevent young people from taking up smoking’. She said: ‘Plain packaging will serve to harm the very businesses that are best-placed to prevent underage sales and fight back against illegal and illicit supplies. ‘Independent retailers are already being clobbered by the burdens of tobacco regulation. ‘Next year, the point of sale display ban comes into effect for small shops, while over the next couple of years the provisions of the European Union’s tobacco products directive will be felt by them. ‘Packs of 10 and small pouches of roll-your-own tobacco under 20 grams are to be banned. These products already make up a sizeable share of newsagents’ trade. ‘On top of this, the EU is also demanding that at least 65 per cent of a cigarette packet contains picture and health warnings. ‘With so much of a cigarette packet already set to effectively become standardised with health warnings, the likelihood of the removal of remaining branding making a significant difference to reducing the prevalence of smoking is highly unlikely.’ She added: ‘New plain packaging rules that go further than this would only serve to be another nail in the coffin for many newsagents. ‘We are a proud nation of shopkeepers, with newsagents forming the backbone of many local communities. ‘Many are already struggling for survival, and unnecessary additional tobacco regulation should be avoided to help these businesses continue to serve their communities and create local jobs.’ On Monday, 35 Tory MPs voted against the government’s plans for a high speed rail link from London to Birmingham.","Rebels warn move could be 'final nail in the coffin' for newsagents .

"A new app, dubbed Good2Go, allows users to give 'affirmative consent' prior to sexual activity . Nowadays, there is an app for just about everything - including consensual sex. A new app, dubbed Good2Go, allows users to give 'affirmative consent' prior to sexual activity. But to do so, they must tell the app a) who they are sleeping with, b) when they are doing it and c) how drunk or sober they are. They are then advised as to whether they can consent to sex. Lee Ann Allman created the app, which is free on iTunes and Google Play to over 18s, after speaking to her teenage children about sexual assault on American college campuses. She told Slate Magazine that students 'are very aware of what's happening, and they're worried about it, but they're confused about what to do.' She added: 'They don't know how they should be approaching somebody they're interested in.' Ms Allman, who also runs Sandton Technologies, hopes her technology will help facilitate necessary conversations between sexual partners and encourage them to reflect on their sobriety. To use Good2Go, users must launch the app, before handing the phone to their potential partner. Using a euphemism for sex, the app then asks the person: 'Are we Good2Go?', before offering them three choices: 'No, thanks', 'Yes, but... we need to talk', and 'I'm Good2Go'. If the individual chooses 'No, thanks', a black screen pops up reading: 'Remember! No means No! Only Yes means Yes. BUT can be changed to NO at anytime!.' Meanwhile, the 'Yes, but... we need to talk' option leads to a pause, during which the couple are given time to discuss their mutual interest in sex. The final choice, 'I'm Good2Go', sends the user to a second screen, which asks them how intoxicated they are: a) 'Sober', b) 'Mildly Intoxicated', c) 'Intoxicated but Good2Go' or d) 'Pretty Wasted'. If the individual picks 'Pretty Wasted', they are then informed that they 'cannot consent' to sexual activity and are instructed to hand the phone back to their potential partner. The app asks users 'Are we Good2Go?', before offering them three choices: 'No, thanks', 'Yes, but... we need to talk', and 'I'm Good2Go'. If the individual chooses 'No, thanks', a screen reads: 'Remember! No means No! The final choice, 'I'm Good2Go', sends the user to a second screen, which asks them how intoxicated they are: a) 'Sober', b) 'Mildly Intoxicated', c) 'Intoxicated but Good2Go' or d) 'Pretty Wasted' Before sex, all users are required to tell the app if they are an existing Good2Go user, before typing in their phone number and password. If are a new user, they are asked to enter their phone number, a password, confirm they are 18 and press 'submit'. They are then required to input a six-digit code that has been sent to their own mobile phone to verify their identify. Finally, the person is told to hand the phone back to its owner, who can then view their partner's level of consent (such as, partner is mildly intoxicated, but is Good2Go). In accordance with its privacy policy, Good2Go can share users' information, including their name and phone number, with law enforcement, 'third-party service providers' and email marketers . In accordance with its privacy policy, Good2Go can share users' information, including their name and phone number, with law enforcement, 'third-party service providers' and email marketers. 'To be clear, it is not our policy to disclose these records to just anyone,' Ms Allman told the Washington Post. Two days ago, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law requiring all state colleges to adopt a policy of unambiguous, affirmative consent by students engaged in sexual activity. The so-called 'yes means yes' law will be the first in the nation to make affirmative consent language a central tenet of school sexual assault policies, proponents said. Two days ago, California Governor Jerry Brown (pictured) signed a law requiring all state colleges to adopt a policy of unambiguous, affirmative consent by students engaged in sexual activity . The legislation, passed by the California State Senate last month as part of a nationwide effort to curb sexual assaults on U.S. campuses, defines consent as 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.' It also states that silence and a lack of resistance do not signify consent and that drugs or alcohol do not excuse unwanted sexual activity. The White House has declared sex crimes to be 'epidemic' on U.S. college campuses, with one in five students falling victim to sex assault during their college years.","New app, Good2Go, allows users to give 'consent' prior to sexual activity .

"These vicious scenes show a 17-year-old boy wildly attacking strangers at random in the street - just days before he murdered a man with a single punch. Eden Lomax, of Bolton, was caught on CCTV dealing one-punch knockouts to two innocent men during what he boasted were his personalised ‘bomb’ attacks. As one victim collapsed unconscious into the entrance of the nearby bus, Lomax was overheard joking: ‘I think he wants an adult day saver’. Scroll down for video . First attack: CCTV footage shows people gathering at the scene where Lomax punched a 31-year-old man with learning difficulties in the face as stood at a bus stop . Second attack: A 41-year-old man lies on the floor of a bus after he was punched by Eden Lomax without warning. The victim was hit so hard he was forcing through the bus doors . Just three days after the assaults in Bolton town centre the teenager fatally set about Simon Mitchell after laughing and telling friends: 'I’m going to bomb him.' Mr Mitchell, 43, was thumped in the face and sent crashing to the ground after trying to shake Lomax’s hand saying: 'What’s a bomb?' Then as the victim laying dying on the floor with a fractured skull caused when his head hit the pavement, Lomax retorted: 'That’s a f******* bomb.' A 16-year-old boy attempted to tend to the victim but Lomax told him to leave it because 'the piece of s***deserved it,' it was claimed. Lomax fled the scene to drink and play computer games at a friend’s house as fork lift truck driver Mr Mitchell lay in the street. He was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from serious head and brain injuries. Pictures from the horrifying CCTV footage emerged as Lomax was convicted of murder following a two week trial. Killer: 17-year-old Eden Lomax admitted to the manslaughter of Simon Mitchell, who died after Lomax punched him. Mr Mitchell was taken by ambulance to Royal Bolton Hospital where he was later pronounced dead . Manchester Crown Court was told in the days before the tragedy on June 14 Lomax attacked ‘men he didn’t know from Adam’, leaving them prone in the street. CCTV footage was shown in court of Lomax unleashing a vicious blow to the face of 30-year-old Stephen Swanton at a bus stop on Blackhorse Street, Bolton - because he had put his arm around Lomax and a female friend. A few seconds pass before Mr Swanton is knocked off his feet by the punch, hitting his head on a nearby wall leaving him unconscious. Lomax can be then seen walking calmly away while a number of youths run quickly across the road. Further video evidence was served of the incident on June 11 at Bolton bus station, where Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance. CCTV footage of the first attack: The victim was knocked to the floor and remained unconscious for some minutes but was lucky to escape without serious injury . CCTV of the second attack, shows Lomax approaching the 41-year-old man before him punched him so hard he was forced through the doors of a waiting bus . The tragedy occurred after Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O’Donnell. He bumped into Lomax who had been watching movies with friends on an Ipad at around 8pm. Mr Mitchell made innocuous remarks expressing his sadness that two of his friends had recently committed suicide. But Lomax then ‘snapped’, as his own stepfather had also taken his own life, and started saying to friends who tried to calm him down: 'I’m going to bomb him. Leave me alone or I’ll fall out with you.' Mr Mitchell, sensing trouble, offered his hand for Lomax to shake and apologised but the teenager laughed and said: 'If you don’t f***off I will bomb you’.' One eyewitness told the jury: 'Eden asked the man to stop talking about suicide, but he wouldn’t listen. Eden was getting annoyed, his face dropped. Victoria Square in Bolton town centre, near to the scene where Simon Mitchell was found suffering from fatal head injuries . 'He was getting aggressive. He was bouncing up and down on his toes. We could tell he was angry by the fact his face went red and serious and he was smiling before. 'The man asked Eden what he meant by his threat to ""bomb"" him and I was shocked when Eden hit him. 'It was horrible, all you could hear was his head thump. The man had turned his head around and asked what a bomb was, he wasn’t aggressive. Eden punched him and said ""that’s a bomb"".' The witness rang 999 when he could see Mr Mitchell was not moving and added: 'He wasn’t breathing properly. He was making choking noises and he had turned purple.' Police attended an address in Little Lever, Bolton, two days after the attack where they arrested Lomax. In interviews he claimed Mr Mitchell was aggressive and he reacted in self-defence. He pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He will be sentenced on December 9. After the case Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Simon lost his life at the hands of a young thug, who was driven by aggression and pent-up violence and revelled in the fact that he could knock vulnerable people unconscious with a single punch, which he referred to as his ""bomb"". A tribute left at the scene. After the attack Lomax fled the scene in Bolton, Greater Manchester to drink and play computer games at a friend's house as fork lift truck driver Mr Mitchell lay in the street . 'Like all cowards and bullies he targeted people who he knew could not defend themselves or fight back. Twice in the previous week he had knocked vulnerable men to the ground with a single punch for no reason whatsoever. 'It is was tragic way for Simon’s evening to end. It has left his father and family devastated. My thoughts are with them and I hope that the justice delivered today will provide some comfort to them. 'I hope this incident serves as a timely reminder of the real dangers to life involved when people throw a punch. Too many people have lost their lives in such incidents. 'I would urge people to think before they ever contemplate throwing a punch, you could cost someone their life and spend the rest of your own in a prison cell.' Prosecutor Robert Hall said: 'Mr Mitchell had the misfortune to come across Lomax and what followed was a tragic, unprovoked and thoroughly unnecessary attack by Lomax when instead he could simply have walked away. 'CCTV footage was shown at the trial as bad character evidence, this depicted the escalating pattern of violence that Lomax demonstrated in the week leading up to this fateful night should act as a severe warning to those who may be inclined to follow Lomax’s bad example. 'Whilst today’s conviction of Eden Lomax is a successful outcome in terms of justice, it does not bring back Mr. Mitchell or remove the grief and distress felt by his family and friends. Our thoughts are with them.'","Eden Lomax knocked out two random men, each with a single savage blow .

"With their doors dented and their paintwork badly scratched, this was how £30million-worth of Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porches emerged from a carrier ship today after it ran around just off the English coast three weeks ago. The Hoegh Osaka, carrying 1,400 luxury cars including a £260,000 Rolls Royce Wraith, was deliberately grounded on Bramble Bank in the Solent to stop it capsizing on January 3. While a spokesman for the shipping company today described the damage to the cars as 'limited', there are fears the entire fleet could have to be scrapped after a similar accident in  2006 lead to 4,700 Mazdas being destroyed. The cars were sent to the crusher after transporter MV Cougar Ace partially capsized in the North Pacific while carrying a load of Mazdas away from the factory. It was left resting for just over three weeks, a similar length of time to the Hoegh Osaka, at an angle of 60 degrees. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porches began to be unloaded fromtransporter Hoegh Osaka today, three weeks after it was deliberately run aground off the English coast when it started to list . It is not yet known what will become of the fleet of luxury cars, worth up to £30million, but there are fears the whole lot could have to be crushed after a similar transporter accident in 2006 lead to 4,700 Mazdas being destroyed . Authorities are carrying out a full examination of all the cars on board to see how extensively they have been damaged after the accident. This Porsche Boxter was left with large scratches and dents to its bodywork . A spokesman for the shipping line described the damage today as 'limited', but in 2006 a shipment of Mazdas in a similar condition were destroyed after resting at sea for three weeks at an angle of 60 degrees - almost identical conditions to the Osaka . Initially a Mazda spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash, either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles, but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed. Engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars, especially on the electrolyte in the batteries. Rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults, the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot. The Osaka was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees, a similar angle to the Cougar Ace, just after leaving Southampton port. A spokesman for Hoegh Autoliners said that each car was being inspected after being removed from the ship, and that a decision about their fate would not be made until that task was complete. It is not yet known what, if any, damaged was sustained by the Rolls Royce. If it is decided that all the vehicles need to be disposed of then the total bill will run into the tens of millions of pounds. Even if the cars are deemed road worthy, some of the new owners will still be left disappointed after the vehicles were pictured arriving on shore today with dents and scratches to the bodywork. Back ashore: A red Jaguar F-type is driven back on to dry land after spending three weeks stranded on board the Hoegh Osaka . Valuable: The ship's cargo is thought to be worth £30million, leaving a huge bill for the accident if the cars have to be written off . Dozens of Range Rovers are on board, as well as Jaguars, and the incident could run into costs of tens of millions of pounds of damage . Mazda engineers were concerned about what effect resting at such a severe angle would have on the cars, particularly on the electrolytes in the batteries. If inspectors take the same decision over the Osaka (pictured), then the bill for the accident could run into tens of millions . The transporter was also carrying up to 80 agricultural or building plant machines, including a large stone-cutter machine weighing more than 30 tonnes. High winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the Osaka as it was being towed. It was brought back to land last week so that its precious cargo could be unloaded. All of the cargo, which includes the cars and other equipment, will be taken off the ship by the end of this week or early next week, according to Hoegh Autoliners. A spokesman for Hoegh Autoliners' Navigate Response said: 'There is only limited damage to the cargo. 'Most of the lashings held, and only a couple of pieces - large machinery - shifted. Saved from the sea: Dock workers in Southampton help to drive a fleet of Range Rovers back on to shore after the ship they were on was run aground to stop it capsizing . Safe: These Range Rovers were just one part of a valuable cargo that included Jaguars, Porches, and a Rolls Royce Wraith thought to be worth £260,000 on its own . Line 'em up: The cars are moved into position at Southampton docks today after the craft they were being carried on, the Hoegh Osaka, was towed back to dry land after three weeks stranded in the English channel . The ship arrived at Southampton on January 22 and crews today began removing cars stowed on board, including Jaguars and Range Rovers . Officials said a full assessment of the damage would need to be carried out before it was decided what would happen to the large fleet of cars . 'Water damage only occured on the lowest deck and on the one side the ship was listing.' It is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by 'a variety of parties' - including dealers and private owners. Cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship. The spokesman said only preliminary checks had been carried out at this stage and a full assessment would be completed once every car was back on dry land, so they could make a decision about what to do with damaged vehicles. The Singapore-registered Hoegh Osaka was heading to the Middle East was deliberately grounded when it started to list just 45 minutes after leaving the port of Southampton. Vehicles, many seemingly undamaged, were seen rolling off the ship, and it could take up to a week for all the cars to be removed from it . The Hoegh Osaka was stranded in the Solent from January 3 after it started listing at about 9.20pm, 45 minutes into a journey to Germany . Salvage firm Svitzer managed to complete ballast management to reduce the list of the ship to five degrees and it was towed back to shore . The 25 person crew had to be rescued by RNLI lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter with two people suffering non-life threatening injuries during the incident. The cargo ship, which is 180 metres long and 32 metres wide, finally arrived back in Southampton on January 22. A spokeswoman from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) confirmed they were investigating what had caused the large vessel to list so dramatically. January 3, 8.30pm - The Hoegh Osaka, a Singapore-registered ship, left the port of Southampton  bound for Bremerhaven in Germany.The 180 metre long ship was bound for Germany, and loaded with 1,400 cars including Land Rovers, Jaguars and a £260,000 Rolls Royce. January 3, 9.20pm - About 45 minutes after it left the port the 15 year old ship started to list badly at 52 degrees. It was deliberately grounded by the crew, near the Isle of Wight in Hampshire, to prevent it capsizing. A rescue operation was then launched to rescue the captain and 25 crew members. It is understood the cargo ship, which has a nine-metre draught, turned sharply to the left as it passed the notorious Bramble Bank sandbank near Cowes and ran aground. Following the incident a 200 metre exclusion zone was set up around the ship, to prevent other vessels interfering with the tugs. January 5 - Salvage experts unsuccessfully tried to re-float the huge ship by using four tugs to pull it off the sandbank. The Hoegh Osaka was deliberately grounded in the Solent, around 20 minutes into its journey, after it started listing at 52 degrees . January 7 - The ship was floated from Bramble Bank on the high tide and tugs were used to tow it to Alpha Anchorage near Lee-on-the-Solent. January 10 - One of the tugs crashed into the ship during a period of high winds.An excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull, which was quickly repaired. But some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel. January 17 - The 3,000 tonnes of water was pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board. January 22 - Salvage firm Svitzer was able to complete ballast management and reduce the ship's list to five degrees. It was then towed to Southampton Docks by four tugs.During its journey, an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place, set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side. Airspace was also restricted to one mile around the route as a precaution. Hundreds of people gathered at Southampton Water to watch the ship complete its three hour journey back to the port. January 27 - luxury cars, including Range Rovers and a Porsche, started to be driven off the ship. Around 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel when a hole was punched in its side and this had to be pumped out from the car carrier .","Dozens of luxury Range Rovers and a Porsche have started to be driven off an ill-fated large car transporter ship .

"Chelsea may be without star men Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas against Manchester City on Saturday, but Manuel Pellegrini's side have been struggling with a loss of their own. The Premier League champions are yet to win a game since Yaya Toure left for the African Cup of Nations earlier this month and they will have to do without him again at Stamford Bridge. With Toure in the side, City have won 14 of their 18 Premier League fixtures, losing one and drawing three of the four games the 31-year-old has missed. Manchester City are yet to win a game since Yaya Toure's departure for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations . Toure's Ivory Coast are through to the AFCON quarter-finals and will face Algeria . Despite constant rumours of a move away from the Etihad, Toure remains a crucial part of City's midfield, often driving his team forward and scoring important goals - he already has nine for the season. But with Toure's Ivory Coast through to the AFCON quarter-finals, there's little chance that the former Barcelona man will be back in action for City before mid-February should the Elephants continue to progress to the final. Pellegrini will be hoping Toure and new signing Wilfried Bony return to England sooner rather than later with his side currently five points adrift of league leaders Chelsea. Chelsea are sweating on the fitness of star midfielder Cesc Fabregas ahead of the clash . Chelsea will also be without Diego Costa, who is facing a three-match ban for violent conduct . Without Toure (right) in the side, City have drawn three games and lost one . Since the big midfielder left for Equatorial Guinea in early January, City have crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-0 defeat against Middlesbrough and suffered defeat at the hands of Arsene Wenger's Arsenal. With Toure in the side, City's win ratio comes close to 80 per cent, with an average of 2.2 goals scored compared to an average of 1.8 when he's absent. Pellegrini will know City can ill afford another slip up or Toure will come back to Manchester to find his side further behind in the title race. Manuel Pellegrini's side will fall eight points behind Chelsea if they lose at Stamford Bridge on Saturday .","Manchester City have struggled since Yaya Toure left to represent Ivory Coast in the 2015 Africa Cup on Nations .

"Arsene Wenger has hinted Arsenal's transfer business is finished after the capture of Gabriel Paulista. The transfer window shuts on Monday night, but having signed Gabriel and Krystian Bielik, Wenger - who says Francis Coquelin is '99 per cent' certain to sign a new contract - says his chequebook is now likely to stay closed. 'If I wake up in the morning and somebody’s stood in front of my door who is an exceptional player, I will open the door,' Wenger said. 'It looks very unlikely now. I can give you my address if you want.' Gabriel Paulista completed his £11.2million switch from Villarreal to Arsenal on Wednesday . Alexis Sanchez is unlikely to be risked by Arsenal for their game against Aston Villa on Saturday . Manager Arsene Wenger confirmed that Sanchez is unlikely to play at the Emirates Stadium . Gabriel looks set to make his debut for the club against Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. 'We are in a job where competition exists,' Wenger added. 'The best player of the moment plays. 'He’s ready to go. He’ll be in the squad certainly. He started training on Thursday and he looks fit. 'I saw great quality. His level of concentration, he's quick, has great commitment and he's young.' Wenger said that midfielder Francis Coquelin (left) is '99 per cent' certain to sign a new contract . Sanchez will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness. 'We will test him on Saturday. It is unlikely that I will risk him on Sunday. We’ll see.' And Wenger inferred that he expects Paul Lambert's Villa to start hitting the net on a more regular basis soon. 'There’s a distortion between the quality they have going forward [and their goal record],' he said. 'When you look at the names they have on their team sheet, they have (Christian) Benteke, (Gabriel) Agbonlahor and (Andreas) Weimann who can all score goals. 'They suffered a lot from Agbonlahor’s injury after Benteke was out for a long time.

"Al Qaeda militants have been filmed executing seven men from a rival rebel Syrian faction as part of a campaign to marginalise other moderate groups in the civil war. The amateur video, apparently taken on a mobile phone, shows the men kneeling on the ground before each one is shot in the head and slumps forward onto the ground. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, have taken advantage of a power vacuum in rebel-held areas to assert its authority over more moderate elements of the armed opposition. Members of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant stand over seven kneeling men before shooting them in the head . The video shows the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant declaring the men have been found guilty by a religious court . Hardline Islamists are targeting moderate rebel factions to marginalise them in the joint war effort . The video, posted online by the anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group yesterday, shows armed men in black standing below an ISIL banner. The Observatory said the video was taken in the northern Syrian town of Atarib in Idlib province. Its authenticity could not be independently confirmed. A masked man on the video identifies seven men kneeling as members of the Ghurabaa al-Sham brigade, a moderate Islamist group that was one of the first to fight Assad. A man who appeared to be Commander Hassan Jazera was among them. 'Hassan Jazera is the most corrupt and the biggest thief,' said the man. He spoke into a microphone to a crowd of men, some of whom used their mobile phones to film the killing. The disturbing footage shows each of the seven men being shot in the head and slumping forward onto the ground . The man, reading from a piece of paper, said Jazera's men were also charged with kidnapping and had been tried in a religious court run by ISIL. They were then shot in the head. In May, an alliance of Islamist groups moved against Ghurabaa al-Sham following a disagreement over territory and complaints of looting. Jazera's unit of around 100 fighters was all that was left of Ghurabaa al-Sham's roughly 2,000 men, fighters from that group told Reuters this summer. Jazera and his men were arrested by ISIL a month ago, the UK-based Observatory said. The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group posted the video, that shows this ISIL banner . The rise of Al Qaeda in Syria has forced some in the West to temper calls for Assad's removal from power. In August, ISIL took control of the northern border town of Azaz, expelling western-backed Free Syrian Army units. On Friday, ISIL captured a second border town, ousting a moderate Islamist rebel unit and detaining its leader. The Syrian uprising against four decades of Assad family rule started in 2011 and erupted into a civil war after Assad's forces shot demonstrators and deployed tanks to crush the protest movement. More than 100,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced.","WARNING: Graphic content .

Fallen football star Paul Gascoigne has reportedly been arrested for throwing a brick at a van - days after he was seen in a pub garden wearing fishing gear and holding a chicken. He is pictured being escorted from his Bournemouth home by police to an ambulance two weeks ago . He . was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident, which happened at . the Playgolf course in the south coast resort at 10.30am on Sunday. In a TV documentary shown last . September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start . drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by . Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having been found unconscious after . drinking 32 shots of whisky. Since . then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, . particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade . ago. Last year his friends . DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne . to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona. And . for the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he . is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation . centre. The arrest comes after reports that Gascoigne - 'Gazza' -  had been drinking with locals at the Star Inn, in East Tytherley, Hampshire, while dressed in a fishing waistcoat and holding a chicken . Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it. 'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.' Despite his demons, he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch. He starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration. Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany. The booking making him unable to play in the final.","Removal van arrived outside house of fallen footballer Paul Gascoigne .

"Strong words: David Cameron said said doctors, nurses and hospital bureaucrats will feel 'the full force of the law' if they neglect or abuse patients under new legislation . NHS staff who neglect or abuse patients will face five years in jail under new legislation designed to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. David Cameron said doctors, nurses and hospital bureaucrats will feel ‘the full force of the law’ if they mistreat those in their care. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will announce next week that the Government is to introduce a new criminal offence where someone is ‘guilty of wilful or reckless neglect or mistreatment’. The plan was recommended in August by patient safety expert Professor Don Berwick, an adviser to Barack Obama. He was appointed after two reports by Robert Francis QC into unnecessary deaths at the Mid Staffordshire Hospital Trust. Up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died at Stafford hospital due to poor care between 2005 and 2009. Patients were left lying in their own excrement and so thirsty that they were reduced to drinking water from vases. The Francis report into the scandal found that box ticking bureaucrats prioritised targets over basic levels of care. The Prime Minister said: ‘This offence will make clear that neglect is unacceptable and those who do so will feel the full force of the law. The NHS is full of brilliant doctors, nurses and other health workers who dedicate their lives to caring for our loved ones but Mid Staffordshire hospital showed sometimes the standard of care is not good enough. ‘That is why we have taken a number of different steps that will improve patient care and improve how we spot bad practice. Never again will we allow sub-standard care, cruelty or neglect to go unpunished.’ Current legislation makes individuals criminally responsible if they neglect children or the mentally ill. But under the new law – expected to come into force next year – that sanction will be extended to cover mistreatment of all patients. Problems: Malnutrition was a serious issue at hospitals, including Stafford hospital, caught up in the Mid Staffs Inquiry. The investigation found many older people were unable able to eat or drink properly and that their nutrition was a priority. Ministers will now consult over the scale of the punishments, but the Berwick Report suggested they should mirror those in the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which allows for fines, imprisonment for a maximum of five years, or both. Downing Street officials say the sanction is designed for those guilty of the most extreme types of poor care. Mr Cameron added: ‘This is not about a hospital worker who makes a mistake, but specific cases where a patient has been neglected or ill-treated.’ The proposal is part of a package of measures that will be set out by Mr Hunt that will include better protections for patients, more support for NHS staff and greater transparency so a spotlight is shone on the worst standard of care. Damning: The new Government initiative is part of a response to a report by Robert Francis QC, who led the Mid Staffs Inquiry . The Francis Report, published in February, made 290 recommendations but no-one faced prosecution. Mr Hunt said at the time: ‘It’s outrageous that potentially more than a thousand people lost their lives because of poor care and not a single person has been brought to book. ‘It is absolutely disgraceful with all those things happening, whether it is doctors, nurses or managers, nobody has been held to account.’ Other key proposals from the Berwick Report include improving staff to patient ratios, greater transparency and better complaints procedures for patients. Mr Hunt, who has also called for greater protection for whistleblowers, will reveal which other recommendations he will adopt on Tuesday.","David Cameron said the guilty will feel the 'full force of the law'

"With Frank Lampard set to return to Stamford Bridge with Manchester City, Chelsea season-ticket holder BEN REBUCK explains why his legacy at the Blues is tarnished. Chelsea vs Manchester City is the biggest game of the season by a mile, it could easily decide the destination of the league title. Frank Lampard has won these sort of games for Chelsea countless times - I can’t believe he’ll be lining up against us. On September 21 last year, around 3000 Chelsea fans, including myself, made the trip up north for what was already billed as a title showdown at the Etihad Stadium. When Andre Schurrle opened the scoring for the Blues, and with City then reduced to 10 men, most of us thought we’d see a repeat of the win from last season. Then Frank came on… . Frank Lampard acknowledged the crowd but didn't celebrate after scoring for Man City against Chelsea . It was a typical Lampard goal - arriving in the box at the perfect time to finish things off . Saturday's match will be another reunion for Lampard and his former Chelsea captain John Terry . What an ovation he received after leaving the club after 13 years almost through the back door at the end of last season. But then he scored. Frank had just scored against Chelsea. Our all-time record goalscorer had just dented our title hopes with one felled swoop of his right boot. It went quiet. ‘Who scored? It wasn’t Frank was it?’ That’s all I remember. On a personal level, this was up there with JT’s slip in Moscow and Iniesta’s last minute winner at the Bridge. Granted that will be met with some ridicule, but this is my childhood hero. The goading began. The long walk back to Manchester Piccadilly was met with cries and jeers of ‘super Frankie Lampard’ from the City faithful. That’s when it started to turn a bit sour. The weeks went on and with that came the goals. A crucial strike against Southampton with City down to 10 and a New Year’s Day winner at Sunderland spring to mind. Lampard had certainly split the opinion of the Chelsea fans. With time passing, surely it was about time Frank left to New York? He’d done his bit for City but we’d been told that was that. Not to be. He’s staying to the end of the season and the news of the deal had come out. We’d been sold a dud and that really hurt. Frank, who supposedly said he’d never play for another English team, had not only gone against his word, but had joined our main title rivals. Lampard will again line up for Manchester City against the side he played for most of his career for . Lampard's last goal for Chelsea came against Stoke in April last year - but he wasn't offered a new contract . That’s the key here-title rivals. No, Chelsea and City don’t have much of a traditional rivalry; Lampard hadn’t joined Spurs or Liverpool, even Arsenal or West Ham, but he had gone to the one team who have a genuine chance of scuppering what could be our first title in five years. All this leaves one hell of a bitter taste in the mouth for someone who should have left on an almighty high as the greatest ever to wear the Royal Blue. With that in mind, it doesn’t change what Frank has done for Chelsea; three Premier League titles, captaining the side to their first Champions League trophy, four FA Cups, two League Cups, a Europa League crown - the honours of a true legend, a legend who should, in theory, be receiving the same reception that Didier Drogba got on his return with Galatasary last season. But, unfortunately, the issue has divided the support like no other and no-one quite knows what tomorrow will bring. I certainly will not be singing his name. I won’t boo him either, but we all know Frank is the model professional and will be out to beat us in the biggest game of the season. If the unfathomable happens and he scores the winner, I cannot imagine what will transpire. It’s an inconceivable outcome that would possibly tarnish his reputation with even the most ardent of supporters. I think we’d all like to see this debacle over and done with as soon as possible. Once Frank spends a few years lifting titles in the USA - another continent on which he’ll win more than ‘Stevie G’ - he’d be more than welcome back to the Bridge as a member of staff, a club ambassador or even a ball boy. But please, Frank, don’t make this harder than it already is.","Frank Lampard scored for Manchester City against Chelsea this season .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is predicting Daniel Sturridge’s return to fitness will transform his side’s season - as the Anfield club set their sights on a move for Danny Ings. England striker Sturridge last kicked a ball for Liverpool 152 days ago but, having recovered from a serious thigh problem, he will be included in the squad for Saturdays Barclays Premier League home clash with West Ham. Rodgers has suffered without having a striker who can intensely press defenders, but Sturridge will give him that presence and Liverpool are looking to supplement that by moving for Burnley’s Ings. Liverpool are also keen to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings during this January transfer window . Ings (right) is also attracting interest from Tottenham and La Liga outfit Real Sociedad . Spurs and Real Sociedad are among a number of clubs to express an interest in 22-year-old Ings, who will be a free agent at the end of the current campaign, but Liverpool are looking to trump their rivals and secure a deal for him now. If they are successful, Ings would be immediately loaned back to Burnley to help them in their fight to stay in the top flight before moving to Anfield in the summer, like Divock Origi, who is on loan back at Lille. Rodgers said there were ‘one or two things’ he would like to do if possible before the window closes but a more immediate concern is the return of Sturridge. ‘He will bring something really creative and quality to the team,’ said Rodgers. ‘Daniel not playing has had a huge impact. Over the last number of months we have nailed down a way of working and when Daniel is put in that it shines a different light on it. ‘He has been fast, dynamic, sharp. But we have to be careful. We can’t expect him to be the saving grace straight away.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) is relishing the return of striker Daniel Sturridge . Sturridge (right) has missed the majority of the season through injury, but is back training with the Reds . Sturridge spent three weeks over Christmas in Los Angeles and Boston, where he worked with specialists to bolster his left thigh muscle. The time away from Melwood gave him a sense of perspective. ‘It has been a learning curve,’ said Sturridge. ‘They have allowed me to learn something, (being on the sidelines) has been great for the mental side of the game. ‘I have improved that and now I am very, very anxious to get out there and play. I don’t know what people’s expectations are. I can only speak for my expectations, which are to work hard, score goals and create chances. If the team plays well it is enough for me.’ Sturridge is expected to be included in the squad for Saturdays  Premier League home clash with West Ham .

"Chelsea will be without the talismanic Diego Costa for Saturday's title showdown with Manchester City after he was slapped with a three-match ban for violent conduct. The Spain striker was found guilty of stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can during the Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stamford Bridge earlier in the week. Costa was charged by the FA on Wednesday evening and unsuccessfully contested that decision, with Chelsea claiming that he wasn’t looking where he planted his feet and caught Can completely by accident. VIDEO Scroll down to view Sportsmail's preview of Chelsea vs Manchester City . Diego Costa, training with Chelsea on Thursday, contested his FA charge for stamping on Emre Can . Costa has scored 17 goals this season but looks set to miss out on the game against Manchester City . Chelsea striker Costa (right) moves towards the ball after  Can takes a tumble off the pitch . Costa appears to stamp on Can's right leg during a feisty opening period at Stamford Bridge . Jan 31: Manchester City (h) Feb 7: Aston Villa (a) Feb 11: Everton (h) Jose Mourinho will have to make-do without Costa for the Premier League games against Aston Villa and Everton following Manchester City. It was not a surprise but it is still a bitter blow for Jose Mourinho to lose the case and be without his 17-goal top-scorer for three big games. His absence is magnified by the fact he also has midfielder Cesc Fabregas struggling with a hamstring injury. Fabregas came off when he detected the problem during the Liverpool game. The Blues boss is insistent that there is a 'campaign' against his club, cancelling the weekly pre-match press conference scheduled for Friday morning. Mourinho claimed the incident, which occurred in front of the dugouts but was missed by the match officials, was 'absolutely accidental'. Can was left writhing on the ground in pain but Costa was not punished my referee Michael Oliver . Costa and Can clash after the incident, which occurred close to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . German midfielder Can has to be held back from Costa by his Liverpool team-mate Martin Skrtel . Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Redknapp both agreed that Costa should've been shown a red card . It was subsequently reviewed on video by referee Michael Oliver, with the charge following on Wednesday as part of the FA's fast-tracked procedures. Costa contested the charge on Thursday, but on Friday was found guilty and immediately banned. A FA statement read: 'Diego Costa will serve a three-match suspension with immediate effect after a charge of violent conduct against him was found proven by an independent regulatory commission today (Friday, January 30, 2015). 'The Chelsea forward had denied the charge in relation to an on-field incident involving Liverpool's Emre Can which occurred in the 12th minute of the League Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, January 27, 2015. 'The incident was not seen by the match officials but caught on video.' Jose Mourinho has fiercely defended Costa, insisting the stamping incident was 'accidental' Costa took part in full training but Cesc Fabregas was a notably absentee for the Blues . Costa lands on Skrtel's left foot as he runs after the ball during the second period at Stamford Bridge .

The pair go head-to-head late in the game as tempers flare in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg . Gerrard grabs Costa's shirt as Eden Hazard plays peacemaker by pulling the Liverpool captain away . Mourinho is in full siege mode ahead of the title clash with champions City at Stamford Bridge, on Saturday, claiming there is an anti-Chelsea agenda fuelled by Sky. The club is standing firm in support of Costa because they feel the aggressive elements of his game have been unfairly high-lighted and scrutinised through the season. These erupted during the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool, a game broadcast live on Sky Sports, with Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp on duty in the analysis team. Chelsea were not impressed to see 'Costa's Crimes' listed on Sky Sports, referring to flashpoints from the game. Mourinho seems convinced Redknapp, a former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder, has it in for Chelsea, and that Sky, who also happen to pump millions into the sport, pushed the FA towards the charge by looping repeats of Costa's challenge on Can, and other clashes with Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard. Ramires (centre) was sent off for a jump tackle on Aston Villa's Karim El Ahmadi last season . Mourinho was fined £8,000 for going on the pitch during the stormy defeat at Villa Park . Michael Essien (left) got a retrospective two-match ban from UEFA for a tackle on Didi Hamann in 2005 . Mourinho blamed Essien's ban on Sky for UEFA's intervention because they replayed the footage so much . There are parallels to a storm which erupted in October 2005, after a tackle by Michael Essien on Didi Hamann during a Champions League game at the Bridge, which was not punished by the referee but later the subject of a two-match ban from UEFA. Hamann claimed it was the worst tackle he'd suffered in his career, but Mourinho blamed Sky for UEFA's intervention because they replayed the footage so much and refused to do interviews with them for a while. Chelsea were without Essien for both legs of their tie against Barcelona and were beaten on aggregate. It is not the first time Mourinho has mentioned the 'campaign'. He was fined £25,000 for public comments after a game at Southampton claiming officials were being influenced by it. He was also warned about comments made regarding the need for a 'strong referee' before a game at Stoke. During last season, his first back in England, he was in trouble with the FA. He was fined £8,000 for going on the pitch during a stormy defeat at Aston Villa, when Ramires and Willian were sent off and was fined £10,000 for sarcastic remarks about referees' boss Mike Riley after a defeat at home to Sunderland during which his assistant Rui Faria was sent off and banned for six games. Mourinho was also fined £8,000 after he was ordered from the touchline during a home win against Cardiff for an outburst about time-wasting by the visitors.","Chelsea beat Liverpool to reach the Capital One Cup final on Tuesday night .

"The pattern is set, the trend well established. The world, in the complex mind of Jose Mourinho, has turned against Chelsea’s manager and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Why would he, when this was the plan all along? Just as winning has been a theme of his career, so has the carefully-crafted tantrum. He will moan, defend the indefensible and attack the likes of Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp who, in the case of Diego Costa this week, say what the rest are thinking. Some will call it a character flaw; others will recognise that it is a staple of his management. A master tactician he may be, but he is also a master of manipulation, of finding a way into the minds of his players and giving them extra incentives to fight. In football, siege mentality is the cliche that best sums it up. Diego Costa and Steven Gerrard square up to one another during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final . Martin Skrtel raises a finger to Diego Costa - the striker has been banned for stamping on Emre Can . Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho came to blows on the Stamford Bridge touchline earlier this season . The Arsenal manager and his Chelsea counterpart squared up during the Blues' 2-0 victory in October . Mourinho (right) prepares his team to face Man City during Chelsea training on Thursday . It is a ploy used throughout his career, often at critical points in the season. In this campaign he has spoken of ‘campaigns’ against Chelsea. He has reacted furiously against suggestions that his players dive – anyone who watched their recent win against Hull might see through the argument – and now, he's incredulous at the criticisms aimed at Costa for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can. Costa has been charged and banned by the Football Association for three games for the incident. As a man equipped with two functioning eyes, Mourinho will not be blind to what Costa did. As a man whose side face Manchester City in a huge game this weekend, he will also not be blind to the benefits of a dressing room that feels it’s ‘us against the world’. It’s not a new trick, but it works. Frank Sinclair, who played for Chelsea between 1990 and 1998, said this week: ‘Jose is a master of mind games, and the one thing he likes to have within his group is a siege mentality. He has always been like that and gets his group of players behind him, and makes sure they are all pushing in the right direction. Chelsea striker Costa (right) appears to stamp on Emre Can - an act that landed him a three-game ban . 'When he has a press conference, he protects his players and that shows he is 100 per cent behind them and wants the players to be the same with him. When you speak to the players, that is the spirit they have got.' It is something that has recurred throughout Mourinho’s career, and here are a select few instances: . CHELSEA - PART ONE . It is part of the Mourinho method to claim his side face unfair obstacles, usually with the subsequent support of a prominent player. In 2005, after a goalless first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United, Mourinho said: ‘Sir Alex (Ferguson) was very clever, if you can say that, at half-time by putting some pressure on the ref. In the second half it was whistle and whistle, fault and fault, cheat and cheat.’ Eidur Gudjohnsen and Mikael Silvestre contend for the ball during Chelsea's 0-0 tie with Manchester United . Mourinho accused Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson of putting the officials under pressure . John Terry backed up his point of view, before Chelsea went on to win the tie and then the trophy. Later that year, Mourinho would accuse referee Anders Frisk of inviting Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard into his room at half-time of their Champions League last-16 tie. Chelsea lost the first leg before winning the second and progressing, but in the bitter fallout, which included death threats, Frisk quit the game. Didier Drogba and Victor Valdes exchange words during Chelsea's ill-tempered tie against Barcelona . Anders Frisk quit the game following the bitter fallout of Chelsea's first-leg defeat in Barcelona . The Sporting Mind's Andy Barton, a mental performance coach, said last month: ‘Whether it's consciously calculated, which is a strong possibility, or whether it's an emotional response, which is also a strong possibility, Mourinho has, time and time again, shown a siege mentality with his teams, by creating common enemies . ‘If you make yourself out to be a victim in a situation, if you've got loyalty in your team, which he does, it just creates a stronger bond.’ INTER MILAN . Mourinho enjoyed great success at Inter and most notably won his second Champions League trophy. Despite enjoying huge resources while he was in Italy, he would identify his side’s relative lack of media support as an unfair disadvantage in Inter’s battles with AC Milan and Juventus. In April 2009, with Inter seven points clear of Juventus and nine matches remaining, he said: ‘We have the Inter Channel with its 45,000 subscribers, Juve have Tuttosport and Milan have three TV stations and the newspapers. I feel a bit like Robin Hood.’ Not surprisingly, the claims came at a time when Inter were in the middle of a defensive crisis. While Mourinho has certainly never been afraid to draw battle lines between himself and a rival manager or officials, the media appears to be a favoured target, particularly when making the point that his sides are treated unfairly. Mourinho, pictured giving Samuel Eto'o instructions, enjoyed great success during his spell at Inter Milan . The Portuguese holds the European Cup aloft after his Inter side beat Bayern Munich in the 2010 final . Take these comments from 2009: ‘There has been the greatest amount of intellectual manipulation. There was a concerted, organised effort to manipulate public opinion. ‘It was fantastic work but it is unrelated to my world – I work in football. I don’t like intellectual prostitution, I like honesty. ‘Over the last few days nobody has mentioned that Roma have great players but will end the season without a title. Nobody has mentioned that Milan have 11 fewer points than us and will end the season without a title. ‘Nobody has spoken about Juventus, who have won so many points thanks to refereeing mistakes. ‘Every time I turn on the TV I see Luciano Spalletti (the then Roma manager), who is everyone’s friend, but I don’t like prime-time television. I don’t know whether these people pay to be interviewed. I know that they offer me money for interviews and I refuse because I don’t manipulate reality.’ REAL MADRID . Perhaps at no other point in his career has Mourinho made bigger claims of unfair treatment. At one stage he suggested there was a plot to get Barcelona and Unicef to the Champions League final ahead of Real Madrid. That flashpoint came after a bad-tempered 2-0 win for Barca in the first leg of the 2011 semi-final. Mourinho said: ‘I don't know if it is the Unicef sponsorship or if it is because they are nice guys. I don't understand. ‘Congratulations to Barcelona on being a great team and congratulations for all the other stuff you have which must be very hard to achieve. They have power and we have no chance.’ Barcelona players surround referee Wolfgang Stark during an ill-tempered semi-final against Real Madrid . Lionel Messi pictured celebrating against Real Madrid after scoring for Barcelona at the Bernabeu in 2011 . Mourinho tries to confront Barcelona players following his side's second-leg Super Cup match against Madrid . Mourinho also said: ‘Guardiola is a fantastic coach but I have won two Champions Leagues. He has won one Champions League and that is one that would embarrass me. ‘I would be ashamed to have won it with the scandal of Stamford Bridge and if he wins it this year it will be with the scandal of the Bernabeu. I hope one day Guardiola has the chance of winning a proper Champions League, a brilliant, clean championship with no scandal.’ Barcelona went on to win the Champions League and Emmanuel Adebayor supported his manager by calling the Catalans ‘cry babies’. CHELSEA - PART TWO . The Happy One has slowly reverted to type. Last season he claimed Chelsea were shown a lack of respect in the scheduling of their match with Liverpool, when a Champions league semi-final was in close proximity. He said: ‘In the last 10 years, Chelsea was the most important club in this country, defending this country in European competitions. It's the last club to be European champion, it's the last club to win the Europa League, it's the club with the record of presence in semi-finals and Chelsea fans think Chelsea deserves more respect than Chelsea is getting.’ Mourinho holds the ball as Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard attempts to retrieve it . This season he has claimed there was a ‘conspiracy’ against his side after Cesc Fabregas was booked - incorrectly – for diving against Southampton. He has also claimed more recently of a campaign against Chelsea and defended a striker who apparently stamped on another professional. He has since cancelled Friday’s press conference. Great theatre, but it’s the same old story.","Chelsea axed Jose Mourinho's pre-match Manchester City media session .

"Burnley have warned Liverpool off Danny Ings and said they would be breaking Premier League rules by trying to set up a loan deal. Liverpool wanted to explore the prospect of signing the England Under 21 striker and allowing him to stay at Turf Moor until the end of the season. Such a move, however, would be in breach of Premier League guidelines, as clubs are only allowed to loan out new signings to teams in the Championship or abroad, as Liverpool did with striker Divock Origi and Lille. Liverpool are keen to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings during this January transfer window . Ings (right) is also attracting interest from Tottenham but Burnley have denied the deal . Ings celebrates scoring away at Stoke in November, but looks likely to leave Burnley this year . Ings is out of contract this summer and is not close to signing a new deal. Burnley chief executive Lee Hoos took the unusual step of issuing a statement on Friday in an attempt to end speculation about the 22-year-old’s future. ‘This type of move would violate Premier League rule V7 regarding transfers, so simply cannot happen,’ said Hoos. ‘This is the last time we will be making any comment regarding the player’s future.’ If Ings, who is also attracting interest from Real Sociedad and Tottenham, leaves in June, Burnley will be entitled to a small amount of compensation. Sportsmail understands the player is receptive to a move abroad and would welcome approaches from the Bundesliga in Germany. Under FIFA rules regarding young players, Burnley would be entitled to compensation in that instance, but it is understood Sociedad would only be liable to pay £300,000 - leaving them plenty of room to offer a huge salary - while fellow English clubs could end up paying a fee 10 times that amount.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger feels the signing of  Gabriel Paulista now gives his squad enough strength in depth, but admitted the Brazilian defender does not speak 'a word of English'. Gabriel completed a permanent transfer from Villarreal earlier this week following international clearance, with Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell heading in the other direction on loan for the rest of the season as part of a deal said to be worth £11.5million. Wenger hopes the arrival of the promising 24-year-old will provide some much needed cover at the back and looks set to put Gabriel straight into the squad for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against Aston Villa. Gabriel Paulista trained with Arsenal for the first time on Friday following his £11.5m move from Villarreal . The 24-year-old, who does not speak English, will be thrust straight into the Arsenal squad for Sunday's game . Wenger hopes the defender will be able to adapt to the comabtive demands of the Premier League . 'He is a specialist at centre-back and with the fixtures we have in from of us, that is needed,' said Wenger, who confirmed he saw Campbell's long-term future at Arsenal after the player's recent new deal. 'What I saw was a great quality for a defender, his level of concentration. 'He is physically able to adapt to the Premier League because he is quite a good size and is quick as well, has great commitment in the challenges and is a good age for a central defender as well.' Wenger added: 'You always need time to adapt, especially in a defensive position because you need to know your partners. Arsenal starlet Dan Crowley trained alongside Aaron Ramsey and Co at the club's Hertfordshire headquarters . Arsenal legend Robert Pires trained with alongside Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck on Friday . Mesut Ozil, who has recently returned from injury, competes for the ball with team-mate Kieran Gibbs . 'At the moment he does not speak a word of English and that can cost you goals, if you mix going forwards with going backwards, so you need to you need to communicate. 'We try to teach the important words, for example - offside or look at the linesman!' Wenger, though, accepts the signing of one player will not necessarily eradicate all of Arsenal's defensive shortcomings. He said: 'First and above all, it is a collective effort to defend well. 'We have shown recently that we can defend well when everybody is focused on it, that is what you want to continue to do. Calum Chambers shares a joke with Arsene Wenger, with the Arsenal boss seemingly in relaxed spirits . Danny Welbeck was pictured in training for the Gunners on Friday - he hasn't played since December 28 . Theo Walcott and Nacho Monreal are both pictured in training for Arsenal ahead of their clash against Villa . 'But as well we needed one (extra) player, because we had the achilles (problem) of (Laurent) Koscielny, (where) there are no guarantees yet, while Per Mertesacker has played all the games since the start of the season, so we needed somebody.' Chile forward Alexis Sanchez faces a fitness test on a hamstring problem, and could be rested. Leaders Chelsea host second-placed Manchester City on Saturday, but Wenger does not believe the championship will be settled by that result alone. 'There is still a long way to go with five points (behind), they (Man City) are not out of it. With eight it would be much more difficult, maybe,' he said. Arsenal beat City away in their last Premier League match to continue their own recovery. 'We know we have some ground to make up and the fight around the top four is very difficult, the target is consistency now,' Wenger said. Wenger, meanwhile, added there was 'nothing to announce' on the contract extension of Mikel Arteta, but that midfielder Francis Coquelin was '99 per cent sure' to stay on next season.","Gabriel Paulista will be in Arsenal squad for visit of Aston Villa on Sunday .

"There was only one realistic bidder - the BBC - for Premier League highlights but there could be a four-way fight for the live rights from 2016-17 when the mega offers are tabled next Friday. There are encouraging signs for the Premier League that beIN Sport are seriously considering joining the Discovery Channel, BT Sport and Sky in a super heavyweight TV contest for the next three-year contracts. BT Sport and Sky are certain bidders, while Discovery, who own Eurosport, are making the right noises since Sports Agenda revealed their interest in the rights a fortnight ago. Now it has emerged that beIN have been using London sports rights specialist Mark Oliver as a consultant on the PL possibilities. The BBC will keep Premier League highlights on its Match of the Day programme after ITV failed to bid . Although that is not a firm indication that the Qatar-based station will bid, it does suggest they are thinking about it. Having the world’s richest TV network involved would take the price of the 168 matches bundled in seven packages — already mooted to fetch £10million a game — further into the stratosphere. If beIN bid, it is likely to be on their own rather than in partnership with BT Sport. That combination seemed possible when beIN let their pundit Andy Gray work as a co-commentator on BT FA Cup matches last season, an experiment that has not been repeated this campaign. Gary Lineker is pictured presenting an episode of the BBC's Match of the Day . Gary Lineker delivers the news to his Twitter followers on Thursday afternoon . The fact ITV did not come to the table for Premier League highlights makes it all the more odd that they chose to sack lead football presenter Adrian Chiles with immediate effect last week and replace him with Premier League-friendly Mark Pougatch. The timing suggested a link with the highlights, yet ITV say Pougatch’s appointment was unconnected. Meanwhile, the BBC’s retention of Match of the Day is not expected to stop Gary Lineker hosting BT Sport’s Champions League coverage next season, although an exclusivity clause in Lineker’s BBC contract related to the British market will have to be renegotiated. Broadcaster Mark Pougatch was named as ITV Sport's new lead football presenter last Friday . Adrian Chiles, who has been replaced as ITV's lead football host, pictured in west London last Friday . No wonder Chelsea have been struggling to find a new shirt sponsor prepared to pay the sky-high price owner Roman Abramovich believes that his team command. The classless club reacted to the FA charging Diego Costa for his blatant stamping offences by not holding a press conference before Saturday's pivotal Premier League game against Manchester City. Pathetic. The decision was supported by chairman Bruce Buck and the club board as well as communications chief Steve Atkins.

Costa appears to stamp on Can's right leg during a feisty opening period at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday . Can was left writhing on the ground in pain but Costa was not punished my referee Michael Oliver . Keeping the Premier League highlights in their traditional 10.30pm slot on the BBC is good news for the Football League, who have an agreement with Channel 5 for a 9pm start for their highlights next season. Had ITV won the rights, there was a fear their highlights might have been scheduled to clash with C5. Swimming in hot water . Sport England could have celebrated the success of football and cricket - both national sports - highlighted by their Active People Survey but instead chose to hammer swimming’s falling participation levels in their press release. Overall annual sports participation numbers are down from 15.7million to 15.6m in the year ending October 2014, for which Sport England chief executive Jennie Price blamed swimming, whose numbers dropped by 245,000. The poor figures meant Sport England’s promises to return swimming to multi-year funding after improved governance had to be put on hold. Sport England trust their Active People Survey data implicitly, although that confidence is not shared by every sport. British Gas, who sponsor swimming, found participation in decline but not nearly as drastically as the APS suggests. The survey also had cricket up when their own research showed a seven per cent fall. Crowdfunding certainly hasn’t worked for the Paddy Power-backed FIFA presidential candidate David Ginola, whose stunt campaign folded on Thursday night with the failure to find one nomination - let alone five. However, Wasps fan Edward Marno has used the online money-raising method to gather the £800 needed for a billboard poster in Leicester in response to the Tigers’ advert outside Wasps’ new home at the Ricoh Arena.

Drogba's last goal against City came during a brilliant 6-0 home win for Chelsea in October, 2007 when he bagged a brace against a defence which consisted of Micah Richards, Richard Dunne, Javier Garrido and Vedran Corluka. Michael Essien, Joe Cole and Andriy Shevchenko were the other names on the scoresheet as a powerful Chelsea side looked to deal with Mourinho's 2007 departure from the club with a third successive league victory under Avram Grant. Frank Lampard, who will be lining up against his old club on Saturday, was at his very best for Chelsea on the day, laying on two goals and providing a memorable assist for Drogba with the outside of his right boot. Drogba hasn't scored against City since October 2007, when he bagged a brace during a 6-0 win for Chelsea . The Ivorian striker stoops to meet a Wayne Bridge cross, putting his side into a 3-0 up in 2007 . Drogba celebrates with Bridge (left) after the pair combined at Stamford Bridge . Upon Drogba's return to west London last summer, many believed a second spell at Chelsea would see the striker struggle to make an impact. In fact, the 36-year-old has managed to prove his worth, scoring six goals so far this season and providing valuable experience in the dressing room. Speaking of Drogba's impact on the first team, Mourinho said in December: 'You know ... first of all he’s a team player. After that, he’s one of these 'old-days mentality’: not selfish, not vain, a humble guy who plays and fights for the team. 'Fantastic. When he is on the bench and comes on for the last few minutes because the team needs someone to hold the ball or defend set pieces, he does that with the same enthusiasm and spirit as he does when he starts a game.' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will choose between Drogba and Loic Remy in the absence of Costa . The 36-year-old has scored six goals during his second spell at Chelsea, including one a Old Trafford .

"Manchester United have completed the signing of Salford City trialist and ex-Manchester City teenager Sadiq El Fitouri. Sportsmail revealed last week how the 20-year-old right back, who only joined Salford in December, had impressed United staff during a game between United's Under 21s and first-team fringe players. Adnan Januzaj, Darren Fletcher and Victor Valdes were among the stars to feature in that match, with El Fitouri standing out. Sadiq El Fitouri has earned himself an 18-month deal after impressing during his week trial with United . The former Manchester City youngster has joined Manchester United . El Fitouri in action for Salford City in his only game for the club - a 2-1 win against Kendall Town on January 3 . Neville (second left) and Scholes (second right) watch on from the touchline at a Salford game . He has continued to impress in training, so much so the Red Devils have offered an 18-month deal. El Fitouri is understood to have been initially recommended to United by Salford City joint owners Paul Scholes and Phil Neville, after the duo gave him his debut for the Evo Stick Northern Premier League side in a 2-1 win against Kendall Town on January 3. Gary Neville, also a co-owner at Salford, hailed brother Phil and Scholes on Twitter for giving the youngster the opportunity to showcase his talent when he made his Salford debut a little over three weeks ago. He said: 'Incredible story on @salfordcityfc on Sadiq El Fitouri. Well done to Phil and Scholesy for showing belief in a lad who was out of the game!' On the move a delighted El Fitouri told www.manutd.com: 'This is honestly a dream come true for me and I have to thank Salford City for the chance, as well as the faith they have shown in me. Paul Scholes (left) and Phil Neville (middle) are understood to have recommended El Fitouri to United . Former City youngster (far right) El Fitouri takes part in a Community schools event during his time at the club . El Fitouri will link up with Warren Joyce's Under-21 side set-up after completing a move to United . 'I am really looking forward to what happens next and to be given the opportunity to do so at Manchester United is unbelievable.' It caps a remarkable turnaround for the youngster, who apparently fell out of love with the game when his chances of breaking through into the professional game looked unlikely. Although he won't necessarily jump straight into Louis van Gaal's first-team squad, El Fitouri will help boost numbers and quality in Warren Joyce's Under-21 set-up. The Libya-born defender has connections in the game, with his brother Hamam on the books at fellow Premier League outfit Burnley. United boss Louis van Gaal  has bloodied various youngsters into the United team this season and El Fitouri could be another one in the near future .

"Manchester City star Fernandinho has been banned from driving for six months after he was caught speeding twice in three days. The Brazil international was snapped in his Mercedes doing 50mph in a 30mph zone on Pottery Lane in Ardwick on May 7 last year - the same day City thumped Aston Villa 4-0 on their way to the Premier League title at the nearby Etihad Stadium. Two days later, on May 9, he triggered another speed camera on Chester Road, close to United’s Old Trafford home, travelling at 40mph in a 30mph area. Manchester City's Fernandinho has been banned from driving for six months for speeding twice in two days . The Brazilian midfielder was also fined £580 and ordered to pay £170 costs and a £58 victim surcharge . The 29-year-old, whose full name is Fernando Luiz Roza, accepted the charges through his lawyer at Manchester Magistrates Court. Magistrates were told that there had been a delay in responding to requests for information from police as the player was at the World Cup in his homeland when they landed on the door of his home in the leafy, footballer-filled Cheshire village of Prestbury. The footballer, who already had six points on his licence from two other speeding offences, did not attend court. He was banned for six months, fined £580 and ordered to pay £170 costs and a £58 victim surcharge.

"David Ginola has withdrawn from the FIFA presidential race after failing to gain the minimum five nominations. The former France and Tottenham Hotspur winger's withdrawal was widely expected, and uncertainty continues over whether another prospective candidate Jerome Champagne, a former FIFA deputy general secretary, has secured the nominations. Ginola, who was paid £250,000 by a bookmaker for his two-week campaign, said: 'Having not obtained required five nominations by deadline I will not be able to continue with FIFA presidential candidacy. Just as I did as a player, I gave everything until the final whistle.' David Ginola confirmed his intention to stand for FIFA presidency at a previous press conference . Ginola's campaign was being backed by bookmaker Paddy Power, known for their PR stunts . Ginola nas now ended his campaign to become the next FIFA president instead of Sepp Blatter . Former Tottenham winger Ginola had no known football administration experience . The message on www.teamginola.com on January 29 as the deadline passed for him to meet strict rules . The idea to back a candidate originated from Paddy Power and David Ginola, being paid £250,000 by the bookmakers to run, apparently topped their shortlist. Paddy Power were inviting people to become members on www.teamginola.com to pledge support and cash. Paid-for memberships range from £5 to £40,000. Paddy Power were aiming to raise £2.3million by the end of February to fund the campaign. FIFA will not publish the list of people who have put themselves forward as candidates for the presidency until next week despite the deadline having passed. Current president Sepp Blatter, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, Dutch federation president Michael van Praag, and former Portugal international Luis Figo have all secured the necessary number of nominations. Blatter fired his opening salvo in his campaign for re-election by saying Australia deserves to host the World Cup and that it is an 'unfortunate omission' the country has not done so before. Australia gained only one vote when bidding for the 2022 World Cup, which was won by Qatar, and some FIFA observers believe Blatter was the one member of the world governing body's executive committee who did vote for them. A breakdown of what the £2.3million budget would pay for as Paddy Power appealed for donations . In his first column in FIFA Weekly magazine since confirming he will be a candidate for May's election, Blatter said: 'Australia is the only continent never to have hosted the World Cup finals, although the 1981 and 1993 Under-20 World Cups took place there. 'That is basically an unfortunate omission in sporting history because very few countries boast such a rich sporting culture and long list of champions. 'Sport, with football in a central role, is a defining element in day-to-day life in Australia, not least for women and youths. The 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne and the 2000 edition in Sydney set new benchmarks for their eras. 'So we can say with confidence that it would be more than deserved if Australia were to stage the World Cup at some point,' added Blatter, who is Down Under for the climax of the Asian Cup. The Football Association announced on Thursday it was nominating Prince Ali, while the Scottish FA confirmed it had nominated Van Praag. Figo confirmed he had submitted his candidacy and revealed six countries who had nominated him. Ginola entered the race to become president of world football's governing body FIFA . Ginola tweeted this after the announcement was posted on the official Team Ginola website . He said: 'I am very happy to confirm that my six nominations were delivered to FIFA this week ahead of the deadline. I would like to thank my colleagues and friends from the nominating FAs and across the global football family who have already given their backing to my campaign and sent messages encouraging me in this mission. It has been a great start - my thanks to everyone concerned.' The FAs nominating Figo are: Portugal, Denmark, Montenegro, Macedonia, Luxembourg and Poland. Prince Ali issued a statement saying his campaign had three main goals: Restoring FIFA's credibility; protecting the game and neutralising threats; and developing the game globally. He said: 'The campaign for the presidency of FIFA has entered a new phase, and the number of candidates signals a strong desire for change. 'It is vital that a genuine debate is held and a consensus is established on key issues - enabling everyone, especially fans, to trust FIFA again as we embark on a new era where world football is governed with integrity and credibility.' Prince Ali added: 'I want to make FIFA a first-class organisation that is worthy of a sport that unites billions of people around the globe and is rightly declared the world's game. 'FIFA should function to promote football and work in a real partnership to support all national associations in their mission to develop the game - we must get back to focusing on those goals.'

"Chelsea will line up in their Premier League title showdown with Manchester City on Saturday night without two of their key players in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas. In a double blow for Jose Mourinho, Costa has been banned for three games for his stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can in Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final, while Fabregas is struggling with the hamstring injury that forced his early withdrawal from the same match. Their absence will undoubtedly be a major boost to City as they attempt to close the gap from five to two points - but just how important have the pair been for Chelsea this season? Chelsea will be without star men Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa (in grey) for the Man City match . Diego Costa has been banned for three games for this stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can on Tuesday night .

Chelsea currently have a five-point advantage over Manchester City ahead of Saturday's match . Chelsea player involvement in goals 2014-2015 . They have been involved in Chelsea's goals on a frequent basis - Costa has contributed 17 goals and two assists in the Premier League, while Fabregas has scored twice and registered an astonishing 15 assists. It means the Spain striker has been involved in 37 per cent of Chelsea's league goals this term, while the Spanish midfielder has played a hand in 33 per cent. Fabregas remains well on course to eclipse Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists in a Premier League campaign, set during the 2002-03 season, and a good proportion of them have been to Costa's benefit. There is a noticeable slump in Chelsea's form when Costa is not in the side - although it is not dramatic enough to suggest they are over-reliant on him. He has only been absent from three of Chelsea's 22 league matches but their win percentage does dip from 73.7 per cent to 66.7 per cent in his absence and the average number of goals drops from 2.4 to 2.

"Tiger Woods’ much-heralded return to action ended in abject failure yesterday as he shot his worst round as a professional to miss the cut by a country mile at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. While Woods’ attendance at the event came with a fanfare and a record crowd, his 11-over-par round of 82 matched the miserable wet weather at TPC Scottsdale. It was just the 13th time in his career that Woods had missed the cut in a professional event and it left him last on the early second-round leaderboard — exactly where he finished at his own World Challenge event in December on his comeback from injury. Woods searches for his stray ball in a cactus at the Phoenix Open as his dismal start to 2015 continues . Tiger Woods looks on pensively during the second round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open . The 14-time major winner struggled in Phoenix on the back-nine, shooting his equal worst nine-hole 44 . Woods, who struggled last year after having back surgery in March and took four months off from August to fully recover, expected to be a little rusty. But he had not planned on propping up the 132-man field, especially after comments before the tournament about feeling as good as ever under the direction of new swing consultant Chris Como. The 39-year-old hit a triple bogey, two double bogeys, six bogeys and just two birdies to close on 13-over-par. It was so bad that all he could do was try to laugh it off. ‘I’m just doing this so I don’t get fined,’ Woods joked in reference to Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch’s infamous line at a Super Bowl media day this week. ‘We all have days like this. Unfortunately mine was in a public setting. But even on bad days like this you just have to keep fighting.’ Woods plays a difficult shot on his knee (left) and reacts after playing a stray shot (right) in Phoenix . Woods put most of the blame on adapting to changes in his swing. He said: ‘I was caught between patterns, old pattern, new pattern. 'I got it better on my back nine and hit some better shots, but I’ve still got a lot of work to do on it.’ So much so that Woods suggested he may skip tomorrow’s Super Bowl in Phoenix and instead practice at home in Florida. Here is the scorecard (He started on the back-nine) from Woods' second round in Phoenix: . The 39-year-old takes time to consider his shot having shot a nightmare 44 back-nine at the Phoenix Open . Woods fails to hide his frustration during the worst round of his professional career, shooting an 82 . The American had a disastrous start to his second round, shooting an equal worst 44 on the back-nine . He said: ‘I’m going home right now. I’ve got to practice each and every day. Just work on it. Hitting golf balls is one thing and playing golf at home is another. Playing tournament golf is entirely another. I have to continue with the process. ‘I have been here before. It wasn’t that long ago that I changed my swing with Sean Foley and I was Player of the Year only a year ago. You’ve got to keep things in perspective, and sometimes it’s difficult to do that.’ Tiger Woods keeps his eye on a shot during the second round of the rain hit Phoenix Open .

"A four-year-old girl has died following an E. coli infection and her five-year-old friend has suffered kidney failure after they shared a turkey sandwich. Serena Faith Profitt passed away in Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Oregon on Monday and doctors have since confirmed that she tested positive for E. coli. Brad Sutton, who remains hospitalized at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, suffered kidney failure, which is also associated with E. coli, Q13Fox reported. Their devastated families said they believe they fell ill after sharing a turkey sandwich at Roadhouse 18 Bar and Grill in Otis - because it was the only thing the children ate and no one else tasted it. Tragedy: Serena Faith Profitt, four, passed away on Monday after becoming infected with E. coli last week . Battle: Brad Sutton also became infected after they shared a sandwich and remains in hospital, right . The restaurant's owner told KGW that county health inspectors are investigating the restaurant. Oregon Public Health Division are also investigating the cause. The children shared the snack at the start of Labor Day weekend and two days later, both started complaining of abdominal pains and fevers, The Oregonian reported. They then started passing bloody diarrhea. On Wednesday, Serena's parents took her to the ER, but doctors found nothing alarming so sent her home and told her parents to keep her hydrated - but she got worse. On Saturday, her parents took her to hospital and physicians sent her to Doernbecher Children's Hospital, where she was immediately put on dialysis. Scene: The children had shared a turkey sandwich at the Roadhouse 18 Bar and Grill in Otis, Oregon on Labor Day weekend and both fell ill two days later. Authorities are now investigating the restaurant . Questions: Brad's mother Elizabeth, pictured with him in hospital, believes the food was to blame . Just as she showed signs of improving, she suffered a stroke on Sunday, her uncle told The Oregonian. An MRI scan revealed she had suffered brain damage. 'It attacked her nervous system,' the uncle, Travis Hargitt, said. 'Then it moved to her brain.' Doctors declared her brain dead on Monday morning, and she passed away at 9pm. Serena's parents also lost their first child at birth. They have one other child, a two-year-old daughter. Their relatives, who described Serena as a book lover and a great singer, have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay the hospital bills. Loved: Four-year-old Serena was remembered as a smart, joyful little girl who loved books and singing . 'She's the most vibrant young girl ever; she’s just sweet, loving and so amazing, so smart, just a heart that is of gold,' her aunt, Aleahsa Hargitt, told KPTV. Brad Sutton is stable but doctors have said there is a risk of a stroke or seizures. Now the families are hoping to find what inflicted such terror on their children's bodies. 'I know in my heart it's what they ate because everyone else is just fine,' Brad's mother Elizabeth Sutton told The Oregonian. E. coli normally lives in the intestines of healthy people and animals and most varieties are harmless or cause brief diarrhea. But a few particularly nasty strains, including E. coli O157:H7, can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting, according to the Mayo Clinic. Foods at high risk of carrying E. coli include under-cooked meat - especially beef - spinach, lettuce, sprouts, raw milk and unpasteurized cider. It can also be passed on contact and some major cases have occurred among children who visited petting zoos. In other incidents, it has been passed in rural waters tainted by human or animal feces. If the water has no disinfecting system and children swim in it, they can become infected. A few days after exposure to the bacteria, the patient may suffer from diarrhea - which is sometimes bloody - abdominal cramping and vomiting. Healthy adults usually recover within a week after being infected by E. coli O157:H7, but children and older adults can develop a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. There is no treatment to cure the symptoms and doctors mostly recommend rest and for the patient to fight against dehydration and fatigue. A serious E. coli infection that leads to hospitalization may require IV fluids, blood transfusions and dialysis. Complications from E. coli O157:H7 have killed 20 people in Oregon - where Serena passed away - since 1992, The Oregonian reported. The last child killed by the strain was in 2010.","Serena Faith Profitt died in hospital in Portland, Oregon on Monday and tests found she tested positive for E. coli .

"The family of a former Taliban fighter convicted of attempting to recruit two undercover police officers for jihad in Afghanistan face losing their £200,000 home under anti-terrorism laws. Munir Farooqi, 56, was given four life sentences in September 2011 for running a 'recruitment centre' for home-grown extremists to go to Afghanistan to kill British troops. His family have now spoken of how it is 'sickening' that they face being made homeless if Farooqi loses his High Court appeal next month against his conviction. Munir Farooqi's family face being thrown out of their home in Longsight, Manchester, if the grandfather fails in his High Court appeal against his conviction . The house in Longsight, Manchester, is home to three generations of the Farooqi family, including two children, according to The Independent. The Crown Prosecution Service's Proceeds of Crime Unit served the family with a notice at the end of Farooqi's trial for soliciting to murder and disseminating terrorist literature. The notice informed the Farooqis that they intended to seize the house under Section 23a of the Terrorism Act. But the judge in the case ordered it could not go ahead until Farooqi's appeal against the terror conviction had been heard. The family's supporters who oppose the seizure say they are being punished even though they have done nothing wrong. Munir Farooqi's son Harris, 29, a market . trader who was cleared of terror charges at the 2011 trial, said eight . people lived at the home, owned by his sister and mother. He told The Independent: 'How can they demonise a whole family? It is sickening. 'You have to be insane deliberately to make a family go through such torture and to claim they are all terrorists.' Jailed: Munir Farooqi, 56, attempted to recruit two undercover police officers for jihad. His family have now spoken of their 'torture' as they face being made homeless . Supporters of the family, who have committed no offence in their own right, say they are being punished for the actions of another . The . property could be seized under anti-terrorism laws because the court . found attempts took place there to radicalise men and persuade them to . take part in jihad. The . family told the paper they are confident their father, who was ordered . to serve a minimum of nine years, will win his appeal and that the . undercover police investigation was unlawful. Under Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act 2000 a convicted terrorist can have their assets seized by the state under a forfeiture order. The Farooqi family were informed of the Crown Prosecution Service's Proceeds of Crime Unit's intention to seize the house at the end of Munir Farooqi's trial. The courts found Farooqi attempted to radicalise men and recruit them for jihad at the house. But the judge ordered the seizure proceedings to take place after the outcome of Farooqi's appeal. His outraged family say they are entitled to a private and family life and will use the Human Rights Act to fight the move. Their solicitor Simon Pook said the act had been misinterpreted and would be in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights if it created case law. The CPS has said the power to forfeit residential premises in these circumstances is a new power under the Counter Terrorism Act 2008. The family's solicitor Simon Pook said the act had been misinterpreted. He said it could be in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights if it created case law. Nearly 20,000 people have signed a petition opposing the seizure of the house. During his trial, Manchester Crown Court heard how Farooqi was at the centre of a plot to radicalise and persuade vulnerable young men to 'fight, kill and die'. Over a two year period Farooqi - who boasted of being a jihadist and was detained in Afghanistan in 2001- tried to persuade people visiting his stall to travel to training camps in Afghanistan. He was arrested in November 2009 after two white undercover policemen infiltrated the recruiting school and underwent radicalisation ceremonies in the basement of his terraced home. During the undercover investigation one of the detectives taped Farooqi boasting: ‘If we die, we win. You have Allah on your side, how can we lose? ‘You know Jihad is not about you giving your life away. If we’re going to go there you make sure you take at least 40 or 50 people with us so we’ve done something.’ In September 2011 Farooqi was convicted of three charges of soliciting murder, preparing for acts of terrorism and distributing terrorist publications after a four month trial. He was jailed for a minimum of nine years. A CPS spokesman said: 'The Crown Prosecution Service is making an application under S23a of the Terrorism Act 2000 for the forfeiture of Munir Farooqi’s home... on the basis that it has been used for the purposes of terrorism. 'The power to forfeit residential premises in these circumstances is a new power under the Counter Terrorism Act 2008, and before any decision is made, the forfeiture application is considered by the court and the family will be given an opportunity to be heard. 'The court will consider the effect of any order on the family members.'","Family face being evicted of Manchester home under anti-terrorism laws .

"An Islamic Society at one of Britain's largest universities has promoted a video claiming the execution of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich was a hoax cooked up by the state, it was revealed today. Hours after the death of the soldier, 25, a Muslim student group at London Metropolitan University (LMU) circulated a YouTube film arguing the crime was manufactured using 'fake blood'. The six minute video called 'Woolwich false flag b*******. Masses are in a state-sponsored trance', has been viewed by 300,000 people, and says that Scotland Yard detectives investigating the murder were Freemasons who were in on an anti-Muslim conspiracy. The film even claims that traumatised . witnesses were in on a hoax, taunting those who tried to comfort Drummer . Rigby as he lay dying by saying: 'These women look very traumatised lol . (laugh out loud).' London Metropolitan University has previously admitted it would consider ending the sale of alcohol on campus in case it offended Muslim students. See an edited extract of the video below . Message: This video promoted by members of the London Metropolitan University Islamic Society claims that the death of Lee Rigby was a state conspiracy using 'fake blood' Problems: The Islamic Society is run by students from London Metropolitan University (pictured), which has distanced itself from the film . Last year border officials also stripped . the institution of its right to sponsor non-EU students, leaving . thousands at risk of deportation, amid fears many were on courses there . just to get a British visa. Members of its LMU Islamic Society, who also posted the video on its Facebook page, have previously called non-Muslims 'evil' and heaped praise on the Taliban. The video shows news coverage on the day of Lee Rigby's death, including his alleged killers covered in blood and holding weapons. Over the pictures are subtitles, arguing his death was a conspiracy, including one asking: 'Where is the blood on his hands that is seen on most of the other videos?'. As a reporter describes the scene in Woolwich the film says: 'Now add some fake blood and a fake media whore (reporter) talking s***, stating the obvious just in case you don’t get it and we got the made up news lol.' It later says: 'I need proof and not fabricated ‘bs’ (b*******).' It then cuts to a police officer telling the public to 'move back'. The subtitles then say: 'Yes listen to . the masonic copper, move back before you film anything incriminating . against their false flag charade.' Conspiracy: The film has been seen by more than 300,000 people and argues the killing was 'fabricated' Hoax: The film, that appeared on the LMU Islamic Society Facebook page,  pinpoints several moments they say proves the terror attack was bogus . A witness then describes what he saw, and the subtitles say: 'Makes sense to you? Sounds staged to me!!!... are you buying this?'. The film's maker then goes on to pinpoint areas where fake blood was smeared by conspirators. It raises more questions about whether Britain's universities are being targeted by religious extremists bent on radicalising students. Tragic: Drummer Lee Rigby died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, but Choudary says the Koran teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-Muslims . Poignant: A woman looks at floral tributes left for British soldier Lee Rigby where he died almost a fortnight ago . 'That a video like this was shared by students the day after a soldier was killed like that on London’s streets is deeply concerning, and highlights the ease with which social media allows material like this to be accessed,' Rupert Sutton, of anti-extremism think-tank Student Rights, told the Evening Standard. 'We’ve seen in the past how students can be led towards violence by online material, and for this reason university authorities should be increasingly aware of this kind of activity.' The University today tried to distance itself from the video. 'The University is committed to ensuring all its students are free to study in a safe and secure environment,' a spokesman said. 'The views expressed by individual students or student societies, including on social media, do not represent those of the University.' Today the university added: 'London Metropolitan Students' Union, and its Islamic Society, would like to make it clear that the views represented on the YouTube videos referred to in the media do not represent the views of the Union or its Islamic Society. 'The SU and Islamic Society understand that these videos were not produced, edited or posted to YouTube by members of the Islamic Society. Links to these videos were, however, posted on the ISOC Facebook site by an individual user and we apologise for the offence this has caused. 'The links were removed from the Facebook site on Friday May 31. The Union and its Islamic Society condemn the events in Woolwich in the strongest possible terms.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Video posted on YouTube by London Metropolitan University group .

"Target: Asadullah Khalid is still recovering from injuries to his abdomen. He was the victim of an assassination attempt by the Taliban in 2007 . A Taliban suicide bomber tried to assassinate Afghan politician Asadullah Khalid by hiding an explosive inside his body, it has been revealed. According to the New York Times, security officials were stumped as to how the attacker managed to blow himself up after he was put through rigorous security checks including a strip search. The body-cavity suicide bomb injured Mr Khalid, who is being treated for serious wounds to his hands, arms and abdomen six months on from the blast. The bomber, who posed as a peace messenger, crossed into Afghanistan from Pakistan to deliver information to Mr Khalid in person last December. He was screened in the armoured room of a guesthouse in Kabul by security guards - a measure that is used to reduce the risk of attack. Mr Khalid's aides questioned the agent and forced him to strip naked to make sure he was not concealing a weapon before he was taken to see the Intelligence Chief, said the New York Times. Officials had previously said the bomb was hidden in the attacker's underwear, but a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, Shafiqullah Tahiri, has confirmed a body-cavity bomb was used in the blast. Rectal bombs are said to be limited in their impact because the force of their blast is cushioned by the bomber's body. The attempted assassination last December came just three months after Mr Khlaid was appointed as Head of National Directorate of Security. The politician is a close ally of President Karzai and is known as being fiercely anti-Taliban. Mr Khalid has survived attempts on his life in the past. He was attacked by a suicide car bomber in 2007, who drove into his car. Right hand man: Asadullah Khalid is a close ally of Afghan President Hamid Karzai . Researcher Robert Bunker told the New York Times that body-cavity bombs are limited in their impact on targets. He said: 'There are some really practical limitations to what you can do with the . basic physics. 'You can only get so much in the body, and . there is no shrapnel effect. It’s good news that these things have very limited lethality,' he said. A rectal bomb was most famously used in August 2009, when Abdullah Asiri tried to blow up the Saudi prince Muhammad bin Nayef. The suicide bomber, who was linked to Al Qaida exploded the bomb, injuring the Prince and killing himself.","Blast baffled security officials who had stripped and searched the agent .

"BMW is recalling more than 1.6million cars worldwide - amid fears over the safety of airbags in the vehicles. The German car maker wants to replace passenger-side front airbags made by Takata Corp after warning the inflators could break apart during deployment and end up injuring passengers. The recall affects 3 Series vehicles produced between May 1999 and August 2006 with some 189,000 having been sold in Britain alone. BMW says it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the airbag issue (file picture) BMW is still taking part in a regional recall requested by safety regulators in the US. But the firm's spokesman Dave Buchko said it has now decided to recall all of the models from 2000 through to 2006 that are potentially affected by the issue. The regional recall, requested in June by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covered both passenger- and driver-side front air bags. The recall is an extension of last year's recall of 240,000 cars globally for the same issue and overlaps with the regional recall. Mr Buchko said: 'As a precaution, we just feel now that the right thing to do is just to bring them all in and replace the passenger-side air bag.' BMW has recalled 1.6million of its 3 Series vehicles produced between May 1999 and August 2006 (file picture) The air bags were supplied by Japan's Takata, which has seen more than 12million vehicles recalled over the past five years for related issues.

"An Islamic centre was burned to the ground in a suspected arson attack yesterday.

Jim Dooley, who led the fundraising effort for the monument, said veterans would be ‘disgusted’ by the vandalism. He said: ‘The freedom that the heroes . of Bomber Command secured included freedom of speech. It is terrible . that this monument is being defaced in a warped mutation of that. ‘The memorial is nothing to do with the current tensions but whoever is vandalising it is too mindless to realise that.’ A war memorial that was attacked by vandals in central London last week has been targeted for a second time. The RAF Bomber Command War Memorial in Green Park has 'once again been subjected to vandalism', the RAF Benevolent Fund said. A blog post on the fund's website said: 'We are extremely disappointed and saddened that the Bomber Command Memorial has once again been subjected to vandalism.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: “At 4.43 this morning officers came across graffiti on the Bomber Command War Memorial in Green Park.” Although the spokesman would not confirm what the graffiti said, it is not thought to be of a similar nature to the graffiti daubed on the memorial last week. The RAF Bomber Command War Memorial - and the Animals in War Memorial on Park Lane - were daubed with graffiti on May 27. Although the words written on the two memorials were covered up quickly after police made the discovery at around 5am, it is thought 'Islam' was written on each of them. The Bomber Command Memorial remembers the sacrifice and bravery of the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives in the Second World War and was unveiled by the Queen last summer. A couple of weeks ago Dame Judi Dench described herself as being “very proud” to be the first patron of a new campaign to preserve it for generations to come.","Fire broke out in Muswell Hill, north London, at around 3am yesterday .

"Doctors have determined that the serious eye injuries sustained by a 17-year-old girl in a car crash were actually from the airbag. The teen, from Michigan, was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended. She was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident and did not suffer any injuries. However, after being taken to hospital as a precaution, she complained of having blurry vision. Doctors reviewed her eyesight, according to a study in The New England Journal of Medicine, and found she was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. A 17-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with blurred vision and the sensation of a foreign body in both eyes immediately after being in a motor vehicle accident in which airbags were deployed . The patient, a passenger, was wearing a seatbelt when the vehicle she was in rear-ended a rapidly decelerating car on a freeway. She sustained no other injuries, and no other occupants of the vehicle were injured . They then put a fluorescent dye into her cornea in order to view the eyes through a blue filter. It was then found that the mesh pattern from the airbag had been imprinted on both of her eyes. The girl's left eye also suffered a corneal abrasion.

"A mother and her youngest child were discharged on Wednesday from a Nevada hospital a day after being rescued with four other family members who were stranded for two days in a bitter cold mountain wilderness when their Jeep rolled over. The father of the girl and three other young members of the couple's families were also doing 'remarkably well' but will remain a bit longer for observation at the hospital in Lovelock, Dr Douglas Vacek said.

Glanton, 34, his girlfriend Christina McIntee, 25, and four children - a . 10-year-old, two four-year-olds and a three-year-old - were discovered . on Tuesday afternoon in a canyon having miraculously survived the . dangerous days-long ordeal. The . family headed to Seven Troughs, near their home of Lovelock, to play in . the snow on Sunday but failed to return sparking a massive aerial and . ground search. Finally, rescue crews, guided in part . by cellphone signals and footprints in the now, spotted them through . binoculars in nearby Trinity Canyon near the overturned vehicle. 'They stayed together and that was the key that allowed them to live through this experience. You don't see that that often in search and rescue,' said Paul Burke, search-and-rescue coordinator for the state. 'They did some pretty unusual things, heating up rocks and things. Staying together, that was a big deal.' The 34-year-old mine worker and hunter built a fire just minutes after the Jeep rolled down a snowy embankment on Sunday and kept the flames going until rescuers found them on Tuesday, Vacek said. 'I think that really prevented any serious medical problems,' said Dr Vacek, who also praised the group for staying together.

"Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff, 36, pictured at a separate speeding hearing in June, escaped a driving ban after being caught doing 87mph on a motorway . Cricketer Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff yesterday escaped a driving ban for speeding at 87mph by claiming it would cause ‘exceptional hardship’. The former England captain argued that disqualification would hurt those who rely on his charity work – and damage his TV career. Flintoff, 36, was clocked speeding in his £150,000 Bentley in January and already had nine points on his driving licence for three other offences. Another three would have led to an automatic driving ban – usually six months – under the totting-up process. But magistrates accepted that keeping him off the roads would affect the recipients of his extensive fundraising work as well as the privacy of his three children. Instead the former England all-rounder, who has now been caught speeding four times in the past three years, was fined £330 and handed three penalty points but was told he could continue to drive. Last night road safety campaigners condemned the leniency shown by magistrates and called for ‘irresponsible driving’ to be properly punished. Flintoff was doing 87mph when he was clocked by a speed camera on the M6 near Linstock, Cumbria, the court heard. He was previously caught speeding in August 2011, June 2012 and June this year. Michael Neofytou, defending, told magistrates in Carlisle of his client’s ‘illustrious’ cricket career for Lancashire and England and his MBE after the Ashes win in 2005. But he also described how a ban would harm Flintoff’s charity and TV work – as the cricketer is due to be in Northern Ireland today filming a show in which he goes on a road trip with a fish and chip van powered by its own cooking fat. Mr Neofytou added: ‘What’s much less publicised about him and less well known is what he does off the pitch. This is really one of the stronger arguments for exceptional hardship, what he does off the radar, for those less fortunate than himself.’ The court heard he and his wife Rachael, 36, run the AF Foundation, a children’s charity the star set up in 2007. JPs were told he helped to raise £800,000 for Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool and was attempting to increase the amount to £1million. ‘He’s constantly raising money, or trying to when not in his professional role,’ said Mr Neofytou. ‘He’s very much a Lancashire lad – he’s never got above himself.’ Flintoff also drives himself to charity speaking events, matches and auctions of cricket memorabilia and ‘never takes a fee’, he added. He and his wife juggle the running of their charity while looking after their three children – two boys and a girl aged nine, eight and six, the court heard. The 36-year-old millionaire, who is now a panellist on Sky One show League Of Their Own, was already on nine points for speeding and in danger of an automatic ban after he was caught doing 87mph in his Bentley on the M6, near Linstock, Cumbria on January 28 this year . Freddie Flintoff pictured with his wife Rachael at the Children's Champions Awards . The cricketer often drove them to school and various activities and sports meetings with their ‘games kits and hockey sticks’. Mr Neofytou added: ‘We invite you to consider the hardship on them if he was disqualified from driving.’ Chairman . of the bench David Johnson accepted the argument and also ordered . Flintoff to pay £85 court costs and £30 victim impact surcharge. He . added: ‘Because of your position, the fact that you are well known, . clearly the impact has to be on others, more than you yourself.’ He . said there would be a ‘potential question mark over the privacy’ of his . children if he was not able to drive them and it would affect his . ability to make personal appearances at charity events across the . country. But Flintoff was warned not to use the same reasons in court if . he is caught speeding again in the next three years. Last night the sportsman, who came out of retirement from cricket this year, was invited to work with road safety campaigners. Gary . Rae of Brake said: ‘Mr Flintoff now joins thousands of others who have . 12 points or more on their licence, but who are still allowed to get . behind the wheel. ‘We’re very clear about this: if you have 12 points or more on your licence, you should lose that licence for a period of time.’ Flintoff . made a return to professional cricket last week, appearing for . Lancashire at the Natwest T20 Blast final against Birmingham Bears at . Edgbaston last Saturday . Carlisle Crown Court heard Flintoff and his wife Rachel (right) 'juggle' running a charity while looking after their three children, two boys and a girl aged nine, eight and six . During his career, Andrew Flintoff was consistently regarded as one of the world's best players. He played 79 tests for England  is the country's third-highest wicket taker in One Day Internationals, with 168, and is only one of 17 players to be on both the batting and bowling honours boards at Lords Cricket Ground. The 36-year-old made his debut in 1998 against South Africa, but in the early stages, the management said they weren't happy with his fitness and weight. Flintoff at a press conference in St Lucia with coach Duncan Fletcher the day after the 'Fredalo' incident . He responded in 2000 by scoring 42 not out in a one day game against Zimbabwe at Old Trafford. As he collected his Man of the Match award, he told an interviewer: 'Not bad for a fat lad.' The all-rounder was crucial to England victories in the Ashes series in 2005 - in which he was named 'man of the series' - and 2009. During the Second Test of the 2005 series he broke Ian Botham's 1981 record of six sixes in an Ashes Test Match with five in the first innings, and a further four in the second innings. In 2007 the father-of-three's off-the-field antics caught national media attention following the infamous 'Fredalo' incident. He was forced into an apology after he drunkenly tried to board a pedalo in the early hours of the morning in St Lucia during the World Cup. He fell into the surrounding water and had to be rescued. He was suspended for one game and stripped of the vice-captaincy. In 2009, he announced he would be stepping down from international cricket after being 'plagued' with injuries. His finale was beating Australia at the Oval to win an Ashes series.","The 36-year-old was caught doing 87mph on the M6 in Cumbria in January .

"A drink-driver who was being chased by police tried to give them the slip - by fleeing his car and hiding in a pile of manure. Jake Hart, 22, mounted the pavement and reached speeds of 90mph as he attempted to evade officers in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. At one point, he was travelling so fast over speed bumps that the car left the ground and 'flew through the air'. Hiding place: Jake Hart tried to give police the slip - by fleeing his car and hiding in a pile of manure (file image) But after crashing into a parked car, he abandoned the vehicle - and was later found hiding in a pile of manure in a nearby park. Now, Hart has been jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving while over the limit at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. The court heard that Hart and his friend had bought a Peugeot car for £300 with the intention of doing it up and selling it on. But when police spotted the vehicle being driven . in Blurton on April 12, they decided to stop it because its brake . lights were not working. Chase: Hart, 22, reached speeds of 90mph as he travelled down Trentham Road (pictured) in Stoke-on-Trent. At one point, he was travelling so fast over speed bumps that the car left the ground and 'flew through the air' Discovery: But after crashing into a parked car, he and his passenger abandoned the vehicle. Seconds later, Hart was found by officers hiding in a pile of manure in Longton Park (pictured), telling them: 'I nearly had you' However, when officers switched on their lights and siren, . Hart started speeding off. David Bennett, prosecuting, said the Peugeot mounted the pavement to overtake a vehicle, before starting to gain speed. 'It reached up to 45mph in a 30mph limit,' he said. 'It reached 80mph and went the wrong way around keep left bollards and reached a roundabout on the wrong side of the road.' The car sped through Beaconsfield Drive and Blurton Road, before reaching 90mph as it travelled down Trentham Road toward Longton. At this point, the officers abandoned the chase - and another police car took over the pursuit. However, Hart refused to slow down and drove his car 'over speed bumps at such a speed it left the ground'. Seconds later, he crashed into a parked car on the street - and he and his passenger abandoned the vehicle. However, Hart was shortly discovered by officers hiding in the pile manure in Longton Park, telling them: 'I have got to try and get away. I nearly had you.' During an interview with police, Hart claimed the car was not stolen, but admitted he had no licence and should not have been driving. He said he had tried to evade officers because he had just paid for the car and knew they would take it away. He added that he had had his last drink about half an hour before getting into the vehicle. Case: Now, Hart, from Blurton, has been jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving while over the limit at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured). The defendant has also been handed a one-year driving ban . However, when breathalysed, Hart gave a reading of 47 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - 12 micrograms above the limit of 35. Hart, from Blurton, pleaded guilty to drink driving, dangerous driving, driving with no insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. Andrew Bennett, mitigating, admitted the defendant had exceeded the speed limit by up to three times in a built-up area. Sentencing Hart, Judge David Fletcher told him: 'If you had just been stopped for no brake lights you would have been over the limit with no insurance, but would not have been facing a prison sentence. 'This was a chase over a comparatively lengthy period.' Hart has also been handed a one-year driving ban, and must take an extended test before he can drive again.","Jake Hart, 22, reached 90mph as he tried to evade police in Stoke-on-Trent .

"A British man has broken the record for speeding on a French motorway hitting at least 160mph. French transport police said the UK registered Audi R8 was travelling so fast their speed gun went off the scale and stopped working. As a result it is impossible to know if the car was in fact being driven at a faster speed, police confirmed. Astonished traffic officers said it took them four miles to catch up with the driver after he roared past them on the A28 motorway in Normandy on Monday. Speed demon: A British driver was clocked by a French police speed gun travelling at almost 160mph on a French motorway on Monday in an Audi R8 (File photo) The driver was identified only as a businessman from London in a company car. French police have so far refused to name him. The . vehicle was impounded on orders from the prosecutor at Evreux and the . driver's license was confiscated. He was immediately banned from driving . on all French roads. He has also been summoned to appear in court where he faces a fine of up to £1,300. A . traffic police spokesman said: ‘This is the fastest speed we have ever . recorded on the entire Normandy motorway network that we patrol. ‘In fact we couldn't get the exact speed because the radar stopped working.’ The . man was one of seven UK drivers clocked at more than 120mph in on the . same stretch of road over the weekend, amid police claims British . motorists treat French roads like a racetrack. Police in northern . France frequently complain that British drivers ignore their speed . limits because they cannot be given points on their licence in France.

Thousands . of British racing fans make the annual pilgrimage to the Le Mans . racetrack at this time of year for the famous 24-hour endurance race. It . is not known whether any of the British drivers pulled over by the . police for speeding at the weekend had attended the race. But the A28 is . the main route from Calais to the Le Mans . It comes just days after Danish driver Allan Simonsen died after crashing his car during the race last weekend. Race . officials said the 34-year-old spun off after about 10 minutes of the . race in his Aston Martin and hit the safety barriers at the Tertre Rouge . bend. He was taken to the medical centre at the premises but later died of his injuries, the organisers said.

Professional racer: Danish racing driver Allan Simonsen, 34, died after crashing his car early in the 81st 24-hours Le Mans race (File photo) Britons en route to the south of France this summer should beware if they spot an innocent-looking Renault Megane on the road. It it may not be so innocent after all and could in fact be the latest Gallic weapon in the war against speeding drivers. French police have chosen the holiday months of July and August to test a fleet of 40 anonymous Renault Meganes packed with radar, which will cruise the motorways in disguise hoping to catch speedsters unaware. Dubbed the 'Beasts with the Kodak' by the traffic officers the cars look harmless but they have radar equipment concealed behind the front number plate and a camera is hidden in a small, black box perched discreetly on the dashboard. Police officers must wear uniforms when on duty by law, but they aren't obliged to wear their caps. Exceeding the speed limit by less than 20 kilometres per hour will land motorists with a fine of €68 (£58), rising to a whopping €1,500 (£1271) for excessive speed (more than 50 kph too fast). The French have plans to equip an extra fleet of Peugeot 208s which will hit the roads in September in time to catch the last homeward bound tourists heading for the channel ports. The speed limit on a French motorway is 81mph in the dry and 69mph in the wet unless special restrictions apply. Calais . police said in an average summer month, eight out of ten motorists . pulled over for speeding on the A26 motorway between Calais and Paris are British. Illuminated . panels warning drivers to cut their speed on the 70-mile stretch of . road are now flashed up in English as well as French. A motorway . police spokesman said: ‘Some British drivers are often oblivious to the . speed limits, and treat the road like they are out for a day's motor . racing.’ ‘They seem to think that because they are in a foreign country, the rules do not apply to them.’ But . Rosie Sanderson, a spokesperson for the AA, rejected the stereotype of . British drivers travelling at break-neck speeds in France. However, she . admitted it was easy to become complacent about speed limits when . driving abroad. ‘As soon as you get in the car, you get in holiday . mode, and as soon as you get on foreign soil, it can be easy to lose . track of speed limits,’ she said. Two other Britons have previously broken speed records on French motorways. A British lawyer hit 148mph in an Aston Martin on the A4 motorway two years ago. Another . Briton, Sean Barlow from Surrey, still holds the record for the highest . speed ever recorded on the A26 motorway from Calais to Paris. He was jailed for five days in November 2003 for dangerous driving after being clocked doing 153mph.","Seven Britons caught driving over 120mph on French roads at the weekend .

"A man who played one of the dancing hamsters in the Kia car commercials and was a backing dancer for Madonna has been charged with disability fraud. The California Department of Insurance says 27-year-old Leroy Barnes of Los Angeles collected $51,000 in workers compensation benefits between 2010 and 2011. He was arrested last month and is currently freed on bail. Leroy Barnes, who has been charged with California disability fraud after police say he fraudulently claimed $51,000 in workers compensation benefit . Barnes played one of the hamsters in at least one Kia commercial during the time he was claiming the benefit . In June 2010, the 27-year-old was struck by a piece of ceiling that fell on him during a sound check, when employed as a dancer for John Cossette Productions. He received state disability insurance benefits from September 2010 to September 2011, amounting to more than $51,000. Barnes told doctors that he was not employed during the time he was receiving the benefits, however, detectives discovered evidence that he was actually working while receiving the money. According to the Californian Department for Insurance during this time he made at least one commercial for Kia, as one of the dancing hamsters.

"A car fanatic gave his pet dog away after he was left distraught when she chewed a hole through the wheel arch of his prized £80,000 Aston Martin. Builder Royston Grimstead, 42, was devastated when he came home to find his border collie spaniel cross Luce had chewed through the fibreglass panel of his luxury car - causing £3,000 of damage. Mr Grimstead, from Chedzoy, Somerset, said he had already been considering re-homing the dog, which he said did not get along with his other dog, but the damage to the car was the final straw. Royston Grimstead was left distraught after he found his car had been chewed by his pet dog . Border collie spaniel cross Luce (left) has now been give away following the incident last Wednesday . A dog behaviour expert has suggested it . was likely Luce, who Mr Grimstead claimed had never chewed any of his . possessions before, went for the car after she became stressed while her . owner was away. Mr Grimstead said: 'I came home and saw her covered in white stuff and I thought she had got a bird and it was feathers - but it was the fibreglass from the car. 'She had chewed out a huge chunk. I just laughed. I mean, what else could I do? I'm not a crier and she knew she had done something wrong because she had this guilty look on her face.' Mr Grimstead said the dog, who he has had for three years, had never gone for any of his possessions before she chewed her way through the car last Wednesday. The dog is understood to have had access to the outside of his home where the car is kept. He said: 'She avoided me after she did it and she was gone the next day. I didn't tell the new owners what she had done - I expect when they hear I'll find Luce back on my doorstep.' Luckily the insurance company paid the £3,000 worth of damage caused by the animal . Mr Grimstead, who bought his beloved Aston Martin DB9 Volante 15 months ago, added: 'She does not get on with my other dog. 'She must have overheard me talking about re-homing her because she's normally friendly and never really chewed on anything before.' Mr Grimstead's car is insured against the £3,000 damage and is set to be repaired next week. Dog behaviour expert Helen Stone said she was surprised to see the damage done to the exterior of the car. Ms Stone, who works as a canine welfare trainer at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, said: 'It's quite an extensive amount of damage. It's very severe the damage that has been done there, I think however it looks a lot worse because it is the wheel arch of a car. Mr Grimstead's car is insured against the £3,000 damage and is set to be repaired next week . 'A lot of the time, dogs that have issues being left alone will chew door frames and cabinets and things like that - I think we have seen a lot worse damage when people have brought dogs into us, but not a car like that.' Ms Stone said it was an unusual case because Luce had never chewed anything before. She said: 'If she's normally fine to be left alone it seems like something will have happened to her, some stress or something, when he was out. 'We always say it is important that owners give their dogs something that they are happy to chew on when on their own and things to do to keep them busy when their owners are out.'","Royston Grimstead distraught after finding pet had chewed part of car .

The 1,000 corroded vehicles are collectively worth an estimated £100,000 in scrap but efforts to remove the cars from the forest have been thwarted. Mr Nordrum said: 'Some people in Sweden want to remove the cars, but environmentalists keep stopping them. 'Apparently birds and other animals have made nests in the bodywork.' A spokesperson for ASM Auto Recycling, a UK-wide car salvage company, said: 'The standard price for scrap metal is about £100 a ton, so 1000 cars would be worth about £100,000 in scrap. 'The price of metal goes up and down. An average car would be worth around £100 in scrap at the moment, but it changes from time to time.'","The scrapyard was established by two brothers to store cars abandoned by servicemen during the Second World War .

"A Porsche owner was left facing a £15,000 repair bill after she lent her beloved car to her friend who filled it up with the wrong fuel. Businessman Alan Thompson, 64, wanted to thank friend Elizabeth Moulton, 66, by returning her Cayenne 4x4 with a full tank after borrowing it for the weekend - but he pumped petrol into the luxury off-roader unaware it actually ran on diesel. Mrs Moulton . immediately noticed the £50,000 Cayenne had a problem and drove the spluttering . car to her local Porsche dealership - with Mr Thompson offering to pay . for the damage. But . they were left angry when the dealership quoted her £14,600 to fix the car, . before another garage eventually solved the problem for just . £1,000. Alan Thompson and Liz Moulton were left angry when they were given a £15,000 repair bill after Mr Thompson accidentally put the wrong fuel in her Porsche Cayenne . Mr Thompson said: 'I wanted to take it back with a full tank. She drove off and I had no idea there was a problem. 'It is a common and very easy mistake to make when especially when you get to my age, when one frequently makes mistakes. 'We all make mistakes but I do object to being ripped-off to such a ludicrous extent by Porsche who I have found to be unsympathetic, inefficient and unhelpful.' The dealership Mrs Moulton originally took the car to in Stratford, East London, said the Porsche needed new fuel pumps, fuel lines, a fuel distributor, pressure regulator and sensor, six high pressure injectors, a fuel hose and even a replacement fuel tank - quoting her £14,60 for the work. Mr Thompson then got quotes from other official Porsche dealers and found their prices ranging from £5,000 to £10,000. But he eventually found a garage who would solve the problem it for £1,000 - and Mr Thompson has accused Porsche of trying to rip him off. Mr Thompson wanted to say thank you to Ms Moulton by returning the car with a full tank after he borrowed it for a weekend . Mrs Moulton has forgiven her friend the blunder, but is angry at Porsche for trying to charge her nearly £15,000 to solve a problem which eventually cost £1,000 to fix . Mr Thompson, who drives a Mercedes, says a local Mercedes dealer told him they charge £450 when it happens to their cars. The garage he ended up using carried out the work for just over £1,000 - with the 4x4 not needing any of the new parts Porsche had listed. They removed the fuel, fitted a new fuel filter, filled it with a fuel flush detergent to clean out the remainder of the contaminated fuel and then filled it with the diesel. They charged him £1,103 for parts, labour and VAT and the Cayenne is now running as it was before the mix-up. Mr . Thompson said: 'I'm happy as I'm over £12,000 better off than if Liz had . had Porsche Stratford carry out the work as per their estimate of . £13,169.24. 'Porsche should invest another £20 on fitting a fail-safe device to their new vehicles as BMW, Ford and Land Rover do. The fuel cap cover is clearly labelled with the correct type of fuel, but Mr Thompson say Porsche should fit the cars with a device that prevents users filling up with the wrong kind . Mr Thompson is not alone in making the mistake, over 120,000 motorists fill up their car with the wrong fuel each year, prompting some manufacturers to fit safeguards . 'I am pretty sure that every potential buyer of a new Porsche diesel will be delighted to pay £100 for what I would regard as a must have option.' Mr Thompson, from Hadley Wood, North London, said Mrs Moulton was very understanding about his fuel blunder. Mrs Moulton said: 'I was dumbstruck when I was told the cost, I didn't know what to say or do. I couldn't be furious with Alan but I was furious with Porsche. I just thought ""for goodness sake"". 'Now the work has been carried out, the car is running brilliantly. I just think Porsche should be taken to task over this.' Porsche have defended the original quote they gave, insisting other parts of the engine would have become damaged and would have needed replacing . But . Porsche defended itself over the incident, saying the quote was . 'representative of the work that is recommended to be undertaken in this . situation'. A statement from the German manufacturer said: 'By not only filling the tank with petrol but also driving the vehicle with the wrong fuel, it is likely that the engine (in particular the fuel system) suffered considerable damage. 'As diesel fuel acts as both a lubricant and a fuel in a diesel engine, the contrasting solvent-effect of petrol could also have caused longer-term impact on the cylinders, valves, pistons etc. In short, it is highly damaging to the engine.' Porsche added its diesel vehicles are fitted with warning labels on the fuel flap and surrounding area which highlight 'very clearly' the type of fuel the car requires. Over 120,000 motorists fill their car with the wrong fuel each year and a number of manufacturers now having safeguards to prevent it from happening.","Alan Thompson borrowed friend Elizabeth Moulton's Cayenne 4x4 .

"Drivers are being driven around the bend by wonky white lines painted along the centre of a busy road.

"A driver has clocked up more than half a million miles in his second-hand Volvo - and it has never broken down. Simon Marshall, 49, has driven the distance it would take to get to the Moon and back in his silver V70 D5 SE, which he bought six years ago. But despite inheriting 170,000 miles - and clocking up a further 415,000 since - he has never had to call any breakdown services. Astonishing: Simon Marshall, 49, has driven the same distance it would take to get to the Moon and back in his Volvo V70 D5 SE, which he bought for £5,000 in 2008 and has still never once broken down . Mr Marshall, from Sandhurst, Berkshire, said: 'I took a chance on the car, because it was a bargain and I never imagined I would get this many miles out of it. 'I have become very fond of it, and friends refer to it as my Viking Long Boat.' 'It has never left me stranded on the side of the motorway and I have every faith in it getting me from A to B safely.' Mr Marshall racks up around 100,000 miles per year - more than 10 times that of the average motorist. He bought the second hand car for £5,500 and has only spent £3,000 on minor repairs, servicing and tyres. Beaten the odds: Mr Marshall, a driver by trade, scales 100,000 miles a year - 10 times the average motorist. Here, the meter shows he has driven 575,574 miles, and he plans to scale the same again in this car . Pride: The car has the same parts it came with six years ago aside from the gearbox, which is also second-hand . Astonishingly, the 10-year-old Volvo has . most of its original parts including the engine, exhaust, turbo, . alternator and all four brake callipers. The most expensive item he has had to buy for the car is an £800 second-hand gearbox - which has carried him across 400,000 more miles. Mr Marshall uses his Volvo for both business and pleasure, with his job as a private hire driver - but also drives his family around Europe in the car on Summer holidays. He has taken his wife Diane, 44 and his . five teenage children on many holidays in the car to France and Spain . and also up and down the UK. He said: 'One of the things I enjoy is having a good quality car, without paying a fortune for it. Not giving up: Mr Marshall plans to make it to a million miles in his trusty Volvo, which is still going strong . Strong: With just two services in its time, Mr Marshall encourages all drivers to buy a bargain motor . 'I’m not in the business to be buying a Porsche but it doesn’t matter because this car has never let me down and I don’t want anything else. 'If someone wanted a lift to the South of France right now I would have no hesitation in going with this car. It is the most reliable vehicle I have ever known and I have put my complete faith in it. 'Most people have a mental block when they see a car with 100,000 miles on the clock. But I just see it as a way of getting a bargain.' 'I still plan to keep driving the Volvo around as long as I can - it would be such a shame to part with it now.'","Simon Marshall, 49, has only spent £500 on the car since he bought it in 2008 .

"Police have detained a man after Aaron Cook, 16, fell from a bridge over the M6 motorway and was hit by a car . A motorist has been arrested by police investigating the death of a 16-year-old boy who fell from a bridge onto a motorway. The driver was detained after college student Aaron Cook fell about 30 feet into the path of oncoming traffic on the M6 motorway on Saturday morning. Four vehicles swerved to avoid the teenager, but a fifth vehicle ran him over as he lay on the carriageway. The driver then sped away without stopping or reporting the accident. Today Lancashire Police said a 38-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following the death near junction 28 of the motorway at Leyland. The suspect, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was also being questioned on suspicion of failing to notify police of an accident. Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the tragedy to come forward. The southbound carriageway was closed for six hours between junctions 27 and 28 for a scene investigation to be carried out. Sgt Dave Hogarth from the Force Road Policing Unit said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a young man has lost his life and we are doing all we can to identify his next of kin and establish the circumstances of exactly what happened. 'The vehicle that collided with man is described as a dark coloured saloon and I would appeal to anybody that witnessed this collision to contact us.'

"A man suffered thousands of pounds of damage to his car after taking it in to the garage to have a lightbulb replaced. Ben Langley took his Vauxhall Insignia to a dealership's workshop in Beverley, Yorkshire two weeks ago - but during the simple servicing a mechanic started driving it with its bonnet still up. The car crashed into a vehicle which had been elevated above the ground, causing the bonnet to bend back and smash into the windscreen and roof. Smash: Ben Langley's car was crushed by another vehicle when it was being driven around a garage . Smash: The windscreen was shattered in the bizarre accident at a Vauxhall garage in Yorkshire . The father of two now says the garage has refused to restore the vehicle to its original state, and offered to pay just £4,000 to replace the car. Mr Langley, 38, said he was waiting outside the workshop when he heard a loud bang and saw the damage which had been done. 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing,' he said. 'I jumped out of my seat and looked out - I could see my car and there was a car on top of it. 'There were people all over the place but they couldn't give me a decent explanation of what had happened, they said it must have stalled or something. 'The mechanic had driven it across the workshop with the bonnet up. It's obviously common practice, and on this occasion he was caught out.' Collision: The car's bonnet was snapped off while the roof was dented, causing extensive damage . Shock: Mr Langley only took his car in to get a lightbulb changed at a supposed cost of £40 . Mr Langley's car was left with its bonnet ripped off, a smashed windscreen and dents in the roof after the other vehicle seemingly fell from its ramp. The fire brigade had to be called in to remove the Vauxhall Zafira from the bonnet of his car. Mr Langley says he is worried that the vehicle could be unsafe to drive, and criticised the garage's offer to buy it for £4,000 as that would leave him out of pocket when he buys a replacement. 'They have offered to repair the car, but I'm not interested,' he said. 'They want to do a cut and shove job, and take off the damaged parts and weld new ones back on. 'I have got kids and I would not be comfortable driving my car with a welded roof. 'They want to buy it from me for £4,000, do the work and then put it on the forecourt and make a profit. I don't think I should have to suffer any loss. 'This has caused me and my family such huge anxiety and stress, simply because they're not willing to put their hand in their pocket.' Anger: Mr Langley says he would refuse to accept the offer of repairs unless the car is restored to its original state . Dealership: Bosses at the garage in Beverley insist they are planning to repair the car fully . Mr Langley, a project manager from Wawne, said he chose the dealership because he felt it would give him greater peace of mind despite its relatively high prices. He said he would have replaced the bulb himself if he had not been offered a free 'winter health check' as a follow-up from his last servicing. He has now been provided with a courtesy car while his own vehicle is still damaged, and says he plans to keep it until the matter is resolved. A spokesman for the dealership said: 'I can confirm Mr Langley's vehicle was involved in a minor collision during a routine repair in the workshop. 'Nobody was injured. We have apologised to Mr Langley and accepted our responsibility. 'We have given him the use of an Astra while we agree a proper remedy to this situation. The vehicle is easily repairable and we have offered to repair the vehicle at no cost. 'We are sympathetic to Mr Langley and continue to engage with him with a view to finding a mutually agreeable and reasonable solution.'","Ben Langley, 38, took Vauxhall Insignia into garage to replace lightbulb .

"Engineers have had to test Honda cars on a copy of a UK road to see if the Japanese vehicles are robust enough to survive motoring conditions here. The four-mile test track at the Takasu centre in Hokkaido cracks easily and is noisy to drive on. It has sharp turns like those found on many rural highways and can recreate the sub-zero temperatures found in winter, the Exaro website reported. A genuine UK pothole: Japanese car maker Honda has had to build a special test facility to recreate the terrible conditions on British roads, like this one in the Sefton Park area of Liverpool . For added realism, it even has UK road signs and roundabouts. Honda said the track was necessary because British roads absorb more water than the harder surfaces used in continental Europe. When this water freezes, it expands and cracks road surfaces, resulting in the classic English pothole. Paul Watters, from the AA, described the development as a ‘sad indictment’ of the British road system. He said: ‘Unfortunately, it seems potholes are here to stay, so car manufacturers are right to invest in trying to prepare cars for the conditions here.’ A Honda spokesman said: ‘The road surfaces in continental Europe, especially in the North, are paved with hard material that does not absorb water. ‘This is because, in severe winter, absorbed water in the material may freeze, turn into ice and destruct the roads. Round and round: The company's test track in Hokkaido also includes unique features of British roads like roundabouts, which rarely appear along the highways of other countries . ‘England does not tend to suffer with this severe winter, and so the surface is made with softer materials with many pores to absorb rain to prevent a slippery surface. ‘As a result, UK roads have a rougher surface, which creates more road noise than other European roads. ‘What Honda wanted to replicate in Takasu was this type of road surface.’ Poor road surfaces have often been . blamed for hefty repair bills and last year local councils in Britain . had to pay out nearly £23million in compensation to drivers whose cars . have been damaged by potholes. But, . Honda says, the main reason for building their four-and-a-quarter mile . track - which is so realistic it even includes UK road signs - is to . mimic the soft road surfaces of British roads. Ginza, Tokyo: Japanese roads are too good to mimic driving conditions in the UK, Honda has said .","Japanese roads are too good to mimic British driving conditions .

It is not known whether Mr Mandela is on life-support but his daughter, Makaziwe, said the  family will not end his medical treatment and only God can decide when his time has come to die. Scroll down to watch video . South African authorities have announced that former president Nelson Mandela is in a 'critical condition'. He has been in hospital fighting a recurring lung infection . We will not release him: Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe said his family will let God decide when the leader dies and they will not 'release him' She added: ‘In our culture, the Tembu culture, you never release the  person unless the person has told you, “please, my children, my  family – release me”. ‘These people who want to talk about, you know, releasing him, he hasn’t said we should release him and we haven’t come to the end yet. It is only God who knows the end.’ She added: ‘I believe he is at peace. He is at peace with himself. He has given so much to the world I believe he is at peace. ‘This is a sacred time for us, and I would expect the world to really back off and leave us alone.’ Mr Mandela’s granddaughter Ndileka added: ‘His fighting spirit is what amazes me. I don’t know what keeps him fighting and he is stoic and determined that he will end things his way. Not any other person’s way. ‘I strongly feel that whatever covenant he has made with his ancestors and God has not been fulfilled – when that is fulfilled, he will bow out in a way that he chooses.’ Support: Nelson Mandela's daughter Makaziwe Mandela, accompanied by a family friend Bantu Holomisa, arrive at Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, Gauteng, today . Mandela's daughter Makaziwe Mandela pictured center with granddaughters Tukwini Mandela, left, and Ndileka Mandela, right, arrive at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital where Nelson Mandela is being treated earlier this month . Mr Mandela’s deterioration this weekend has caused a perceptible switch in mood from prayers for recovery to preparations for a fond farewell among South Africa’s 53million residents. There is concern about doctors trying to prolong the life of South Africa’s first black president, one of the 20th century’s most influential figures. President Jacob Zuma, who visited Mr Mandela on Sunday, reflected the national mood when he told a news conference that the ex-leader remained critical. He said: ‘All of us in the country must accept that Madiba [Mandela’s clan name] is now old. As he ages, his health will trouble him.’ Pressed . for further details on Nelson Mandela's health, President Jacob Zuma . said: 'I can't tell you what is wrong with him ... I am not a doctor'.

Mandela’s health had been improving after battling a recurring lung . infection, it emerged in the early hours of Saturday that he had become . unresponsive. It was reported that his liver and kidney functions were down to 50 per cent and he had not opened his eyes for days. Mr Mandela recently underwent two . procedures at Pretoria Hospital, one to repair a bleeding ulcer and . another to insert a tube into his body. Legacy: Mandela has been vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting tuberculosis during his 27 years behind bars under apartheid. It followed revelations that the . ambulance which took Mr Mandela to Pretoria hospital earlier this month . broke down en route, leaving him stranded on the roadside for 40 minutes . in winter temperatures. South . African government officials have said ‘great care was taken to ensure . that Mandela’s health was not compromised and that his doctors were . satisfied the former president suffered no harm.’ Mr Mandela, who became South Africa’s first black president after the end of apartheid in 1994, was hospitalised on June 8. He is revered for leading the fight . against white minority rule in South Africa and then preaching . reconciliation despite being imprisoned for 27 years. He left power after five years as President. The illness that has plagued the . Nobel Peace Prize winner in recent years is believed to stem from damage . to his lungs which he suffered while working in a prison quarry. He contracted tuberculosis in the 1980s while being held in jail on the notorious Robben Island. Mandela has been hospitalised four times since December but last night’s . confirmation of his grave condition is by far the most downbeat report . ever given about his health. Mandela has been undergoing hospital . treatment since June 8 although all official statements had until last . night described his condition as stable.

"When the term ‘Mondeo Man’ was coined, it was shorthand for the floating voters of Middle Britain being wooed by Labour before a general election. It conveyed an average man, driving an average car, striving to improve his circumstances. But the boss of Ford, the makers of the best-selling Mondeo, said yesterday that the phrase had ‘not done us too many favours’ and had driven the company’s image down market. The British chairman of Ford has said that the term 'Mondeo Man' has done the company's image no favours . Mark Ovenden, Ford of Britain chairman and chief executive, said ‘Mondeo Man’ – first used in the 1997 general election that made Tony Blair prime minister – did for the firm’s cars what ‘bog-standard comprehensive’, coined by Mr Blair’s adviser Alastair Campbell, did for state schools. Mr Ovenden said too many potential customers believed Fords were ‘average’ cars, when the opposite was true in terms of style, quality and technology. More than 1.4million Mondeos have been sold in Britain since its launch in 1992. Last year, 25,000 were sold, with 22,000 sold so far this year, but manufacturers such as BMW, Audi and Volkswagen have been increasingly targeting Ford’s traditional target audience and the company risks being squeezed between the top German brands and budget marques such as Skoda and Kia. The term was originally coined to describe the floating voters targeted by Tony Blair . Mr Ovenden said: ‘I don’t think “Mondeo Man” did us any favours. Everyone has grown up with Ford of Britain. People often mistake commonplace for average. ‘Volkswagen in Germany is commonplace. But it is not seen as average. Does anyone say the Audi A4 or the BMW 3-series is average because it is commonplace?’ He revealed that the company now planned to ‘stretch’ the brand, with upmarket ‘Vignale’ versions of its cars in 2015, starting with the new Mondeo that will be launched next year. Mr Ovenden, 49, who started with Ford as a graduate trainee 28 years ago, said Vignale Fords would have ‘unique interior and exterior design touches, premium craftsmanship, exclusive specification and technologies’. He said: ‘Since Henry Ford put the world on wheels the Ford brand has been about democratising. I don’t see why we can’t democratise luxury.’","Chairman says the term has done the company's image no favours .

"Taxi drivers have been warned that it is not appropriate to accept sexual favours instead of fares. The bizarre warning was made after a driver had sex with a passenger in the back of his cab when she could not afford the fare. Now dozens of firms in the north east have received a letter telling them not to engage in sexual liasions if they want to keep their job. (File picture) Hartlepool Council have sent out a bizarre warning to taxi drivers that they will lose their licence if they're caught having sex with customers in their cab . One of Hartlepool's major taxi firms told the Mail it was common practice for women to offer sexual favours instead of cash when they were short of change. The taxi driver who sparked the move had his licence revoked after he was caught in an embarrassing position with a passenger. He was discovered having sex with the woman in the back of his taxi last December outside the woman's home in Hartlepool, Cleveland. She could not afford the fare so offered to have sex with him in exchange. He has since been banned from the roads by the town's licensing chiefs. It is understood it is not uncommon in the town for women to offer sexual favours to drivers when they realise they have no change. One worker at a taxi firm said: 'It does not surprise me at all, it is very common for girls to ask if they can perform a sex act when they are short of cash.' Hartlepool Council has confirmed that a taxi driver has had his licence revoked after admitting having sex in his vehicle . Another driver at a different firm said: 'It's not uncommon for some of the lasses to offer the drivers things other than a fare when they make their way home from a night out. 'We have heard a few tales like this one. Normally this type of request gets laughed off by the drivers, but obviously temptation got the better of one of the lads.' All taxi firms in Hartlepool received the letter warning drivers they could be stripped of their badges if they were caught. The letter was sent out after the Vehicle Owners Annual General Meeting, which took place on February 11. It read: 'I would draw your attention to one particular issue which was discussed at the AGM - the issue of what would constitute unacceptable behaviour by a taxi driver. 'A driver had his licence revoked for having sex with a passenger in the back of his vehicle. 'I would ask you to ensure that any driver that works for you fully understands that any sexual contact with a passenger is unacceptable and is likely to result in the revocation of their licence.' The letter finished with: 'Any offers of sexual favours must be politely refused.' A spokesman for Hartlepool Council said: 'We can confirm that a taxi driver has had his licence revoked after admitting having sex in his vehicle. 'Hartlepool Council expects the highest possible standards from taxi drivers and they have a vital role in protecting the public whilst carrying out their work. 'We have written to all taxi drivers in the town to remind them that we will not tolerate such behaviour and any sexual contact with a passenger is likely to result in their licence being revoked.'","Firms in Hartlepool receive letter about engaging in sexual liasions .

"Laura Jane Thomas, 20, was killed when a lorry driver crashed into her as he looked at pornography . A lorry driver who killed a young bride-to-be while looking at pornography on his phone has been jailed for just five years. Ian Glover, 44, was flicking through pictures of women on an explicit dating website when his 44-ton Mercedes ploughed into a parked car. Teaching assistant Laura Jane Thomas, 20, and her fiance Lewis Pagett, 19, had broken down and pulled on to a grass verge with their hazard lights on. The childhood sweethearts, who had . been together since the age of 13, got out and were standing behind a . safety barrier when Glover ploughed into their Vauxhall on the A5 . between Telford and Shrewsbury in Shropshire. As a result of the smash, the car flew over the barrier, killing Miss Thomas while her fiance was on the phone to his father. Glover, . who had worked as a driver for Sainsbury’s for ten years, admitted . causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by . dangerous driving. He was jailed for just five years at Shrewsbury Crown . Court on Friday. Miss . Thomas’s mother, Lisa, spoke last night of her outrage at the short . sentence. She said Glover should have been jailed for 14 years, the . maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving. ‘A five-year sentence for killing our . beautiful daughter is just not enough in our eyes,’ she said. ‘What is . worse is he could get a shorter sentence if he’s well behaved. The crash happened when Miss Thomas and her fiancé Lewis Pagett, pictured above, broke down at the side of the road. They were standing behind a safety barrier when the lorry careered into their parked car . ‘Laura had lived just a quarter of her life and he could be out of prison in two years or so – it’s just not fair.’ The 45-year-old added: ‘I makes me . feel sick that Glover killed my girl while looking  at porn. I keep . getting  flashbacks of seeing her in hospital and the sheer despair of . losing her.’ Speaking after . the court case, Mr Pagett, who was left with a head injury and . fractured vertebrae, said: ‘Laura and I were looking forward to planning . our wedding together – instead, I ended up planning her funeral. ‘We were so excited to spend the rest of our lives together. ‘Laura had so much life to give, she had a heart of gold and aimed to become a teacher for disabled children.’ He said the couple were on their way . to Aberystwyth for a week by the sea. ‘I had to put my hazard lights on . and call my dad,’ he added. Laura and her fiancé Lewis Pagett were standing by their stationary vehicle on the A5, one section pictured, when the driver crashed into it. The vehicle flew over the safety barrier - killing the young teaching assistant . ‘One minute we were standing over the safety barrier on the A5 then the next thing I remember is being on the floor in a heap of rubble.’ Sentencing Glover, Judge Robin Onions said: ‘You were on these sites at the  point of impact. For many miles you were not paying  proper attention. This was  utterly avoidable.’ The court heard Glover, of Birmingham, was travelling at between 50mph and 56mph when he hit the Vauxhall at 8.20am on July 21 last year. He told police that he could not remember what had happened before the crash. But tests on three mobile phones found in his lorry revealed that he was looking at the explicit dating sites. Prosecutor Hugh O’Brien Quinn said: ‘Mr Glover said that the only distraction in his car was the radio. ‘But two of the three phones found showed one site had been used while moving more than ten times, including while on the M54 and the A5. ‘It was a clear day and the Vauxhall would’ve been visible for a quarter of a mile but the defendant did not see it at all and drove straight into it.’ Defending Glover, Paul Rogers said he was ‘deeply ashamed’. Miss Thomas, of Great Haywood in Staffordshire, had become engaged at Christmas in 2012 and dreamed of having her wedding reception at the same venue where her school prom was staged. She was a teaching assistant at Marshlands Special School and volunteered with the Riding for the Disabled Association.","Ian Glover, 44, was browsing sex websites while driving his lorry .

"A father is fighting for his life today after confronting a thief trying to steal his car from his driveway. The 49-year-old victim, named locally as Dean Armitage, is thought to have disturbed the thief after he heard them breaking into his Land Rover outside his smart detached home and starting the engine. Neighbours say the suspect climbed into Mr Armitage's home and stole the keys from the kitchen - and when they started the car the noise woke him up in bed. Dean Armitage is thought to have spotted someone breaking into his Land Rover and confronted the thief - but was brutally attacked . The haulage company boss confronted the thief but was attacked and left in a critical condition with serious head injuries. Neighbours Gerald and Sylvia Whyke told how they were woken just after 3am. Retired Gerald said: 'It only took me a matter of minutes to get outside but when I got there, the police and ambulance were arriving. 'Dean’s wife Mandy was on the driveway next to the car. She was speaking to her neighbours on the other side over the wall. 'She was distraught. She seemed to be in shock. It was only when the ambulance people swooped in that I realised there was someone lying on the driveway between them all. 'Then the paramedics took Dean off to hospital. It all happened very quickly. The police were taking statements from everyone.' Neighbours say the suspect climbed into Mr Armitage's home and stole the keys from the kitchen . The haulage company boss was left with serious head injuries and was transported to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield . Mrs Whyke, 69, said she saw a man fleeing the scene in Hoyland, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, at 3.15am on Sunday. She said: 'I went over to the bedroom window to see what was going on. I saw someone running off from the direction of the house next door. 'It all happened really quickly, I don’t know what they look like at all. It was very dark. 'Dean is a really hard-working man. We don’t see much of him because he is always at work, working hard for his family. But when we do see him he is lovely and friendly.' Mrs Whyke added the street, a combination of detatched and semi-detatched houses, was a friendly neighbourhood where everyone says hello. She said: 'The family have lived here for about 25 years, we’ve seen their children grow up and that sort of thing. I can’t believe it.' Shelby Etherington, 18, said her uncle is 'a lovely guy'. Speaking today she said: 'He doesn't deserve this. The family are at his side at hospital, we're all just hoping and praying that  he is okay. 'It's been a huge shock for us all.' A South Yorkshire police spokesman said: 'It is thought the unknown male may have been attempting to break into the 49-year-old man’s car. 'Following the confrontation, the 49-year-old man was left with serious head injuries and was transported to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield. 'His condition is described as life threatening.' Neighbours Valerie, 73, a retired bakery worker and Graham Thompson, 73, who worked at refractory works before retiring, also described Mr Armitage as a friendly neighbour. Valerie said: 'Someone has suggested that someone had sneaked into the kitchen through an open window and taken the car keys and some handbags. They started the car and that’s when Dean heard.' The car, which had been parked in the driveway, has been removed from the scene.","Dean Armitage 'disturbed thief when he heard them starting his Land Rover'

"Remorseless: Latvia-born Marina Usaceva, 31, told police at the scene she had not been using a phone as her crash victim was pronounced dead . A driver who killed a man after she used two mobile phones behind the wheel has been jailed by a judge who branded her 'a plague on society'. Mother-of-one Marina Usaceva was driving a green Jaguar X-Type when she crashed into the back of a Peugeot 206, killing its 27-year-old driver. Usaceva, originally from Latvia, told police at the scene she had not been using a phone. But examinations later found she had sent and received texts and calls on two separate mobiles shortly before the crash. She was jailed for six years and disqualified from driving for eight. Prosecutor . Georgina Gibbs told Peterborough Crown Court: 'When she was told that . two mobile phones had been found to be used on this occasion, she . continued to deny it.' She added that the case was aggravated by the fact Usaceva, 31, was using 'not one but two phones'. The crash happened on the A47 near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, at about 4.30pm on March 15 last year. Sukhdeep . Singh Johal, 27, who had recently graduated with a biomedical sciences . degree at De Monfort University, died at the scene. Speaking . after she was jailed for six years at Peterborough Crown Court, . Sukhdeep’s father Buhupinder Johal said no sentence would be enough to . console the family. Tragic: Sukhdeep Singh Johal, 27, had recently graduated from De Monfort University when he was killed . He added: 'Even 60 years wouldn’t be enough, but this is some kind of justice. The only thing we can hope is that others will learn from this. People think nothing of it, but using a mobile phone while driving can kill.' Currently a driver is given three points is caught using a mobile phone at the wheel. However, after research revealed it was a contributory factor in 17 fatal accidents and 67 serious crashes in 2012, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has vowed to change the law. Under the new rules, drivers would be hit with a six-point penalty. It is rare for offenders to be jailed unless in 'extreme circumstances'. In the case of Usaceva, her use of two phones impacted the case. Usaceva, of  Peterborough, admitted causing death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing. She had previously been caught twice using her phone behind the wheel and her licence was endorsed in 2009 and 2012, the court heard. Usaceva wept in the dock as Judge Sean Enright jailed her for six years and disqualified her from driving for eight years. The judge said: 'If you were not sending texts at the time, then you were fiddling with your phone and that is what caused this collision. 'In my opinion there is not a scrap of remorse. 'Mobile phone use while driving is a plague on our society.' Inspector Bob Turner, who oversaw the investigation for Cambridgeshire Police, said Usaceva had behaved 'incredibly foolishly'. He added: 'I have never seen anything like it before - it was crass stupidity.' The . prosecutor said a police examination found Usaceva had used a Sony phone . to send a text message at 4.15pm and receive a message at 4.17pm. A . Samsung phone sent one message, made one phone call and receive three . incoming calls in the 20 minutes leading up to the crash. Appeal: Mr Johal's family, based in Leicester, appealed for people to take the mobile phone ban seriously . Daily Mail July 16, left and on Saturday, right . The prosecutor added her car was travelling at at least 70mph in a 60mph zone but witnesses said it was travelling significantly faster because it braked sharply for a speed camera, hitting Mr Johal and causing a three-vehicle pile-up. Ian Brownhill, mitigating, said: 'There is a gap of six minutes - I would say clear water - between using the phones and the accident itself.' He added that Usaceva was the sole carer of her eight-year-old son, whose father lives in Latvia, and called for the judge to consider his welfare in passing sentence.","Marina Usaceva received texts and calls on 2 phones while driving a Jaguar .

"Over-zealous transport chiefs have been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after putting up 63 'no parking' signs along a one-mile country lane. Officials have installed one of the bright yellow warnings every 84ft along the rural West Pentire Road in Newquay, Cornwall. The narrow lane already has double yellow lines, however Cornwall . Council decided motorists needed more signage to keep the hedge-lined . thoroughfare free of obstructions. Over-zealous: transport chiefs have been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after putting up 60 'no parking' signs along the mile-long Rural West Pentire Road in Newquay, Cornwall . Sign of the times: The narrow lane already has double yellow lines, however Cornwall Council decided motorists needed more signage to keep the hedge-lined thoroughfare free of obstructions . Baffled locals have counted 63 of the metal poles bearing the signs, and say they can not understand why so many are needed as people very rarely attempt to park there anyway. 'During the summer there can be a bit of trouble with . people parking on the grass verges and that's what they're trying to . stop' said one neighbour, who asked not to be named. 'But nothing so bad as to warrant so many signs in one mile. They are lining the road, even opposite each other - it seems like a . crazy and unnecessary expense.' The Campaign to Protect Rural England says around two thirds of signs in rural areas are unnecessary. The . group has been lobbying since 1996 for local authorities, including . Cornwall Council, to ditch pointless roadside clutter and their campaign . led to 170 of 900 signs being pulled down last year in another Cornish . village, Feock. Spokesman Orlando Kimber said it was disappointing to hear the same authority had decided to erect 63 signs in a single lane. He said: 'We have been running a campaign since 1996 to de-clutter the countryside in terms of unnecessary road signs. 'So it's disappointing to hear about just how many signs have been erected along this road. 'It sounds like utter nonsense, but someone, somewhere has come up with the rationale for this.' Local councillor Lisa Shuttleworth said locals were shocked by the number of signs that suddenly sprang up before Christmas. 'A letter has been signed to see if we can rectify this,' she said. 'I think many residents are concerned with just how many signs have been erected. 'There have been talks going on and the parish council is trying to see if they can change the amount of signs.' Ms . Shuttlewood said she had asked the council's portfolio holder for . Transport and Waste, Bert Biscoe, to come and take a look at the signs. 'He was of the same opinion as me and couldn't understand why so many are needed,' she said. Cornwall Council said the notices were essential to enforce seasonal parking restrictions that run from June 1 to Sept 30. In some places the road runs just a few hundred metres from the beach, and is also close to popular rambling route the South West Coast Path. However, the unitary authority has . agreed to consider 'alternative parking management options' that could . eventually see some of them removed. A . spokesman said: 'This is likely to require changes to the operational . times of the parking restrictions in the village, and a statutory . consultation process will be required and must be satisfactorily . completed before any changes to signing can take place. 'The . operation of parking restrictions at the same time in the village is . likely to result in the need for fewer signs which will look better and . will not impact on enforcement operations.'

"Shaken: Billie Piper had her two young sons in the back of her VW Golf at the time of the collision . Billie Piper is being investigated by police after she was involved in a road accident with a 16-year-old cyclist who was taken to hospital with serious injuries, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The actress, best known for her starring roles in Doctor Who and The Secret Diary Of A Call Girl, was questioned by officers after colliding with the oncoming cycle, which slammed into her car at high speed. The collision left Ms Piper, 31, so traumatised that she was forced to pull out of her leading part in a West End play. In dramatic circumstances she was apparently replaced by her understudy just 15 minutes before the curtain was due to go up that evening. Scotland Yard confirmed an investigation is ongoing into the incident, which happened just before 4pm on Tuesday. Ms Piper’s sons Winston, five, and Eugene, two, were in the back of her black Volkswagen Golf as she attempted a U-turn on a steep section of road behind King’s Cross station in the London borough of Camden. She is understood to have been driving at under five miles per hour as she crossed Goods Way into the path of the teenage cyclist who was travelling downhill at a significant speed. The bike slammed into the back of the car and the boy was thrown to the ground. An eyewitness dialled 999. Police quizzed Miss Piper at the roadside, while the teenager received treatment from the London Ambulance Service for a severe shoulder injury. He was then driven to nearby University College Hospital for further treatment. The Mail on Sunday understands that the cyclist was not wearing a helmet. Ms Piper was not arrested and soon after went to the National Theatre on London’s South Bank, where she was due to appear that evening. Backstage, she attempted to prepare for her performance in Great Britain – a critically acclaimed new satire on the media in which she stars as Paige Britain, editor of fictitious newspaper The Free Press. But she was still so shaken by the crash that it was decided her understudy, Jo Dockery, should replace her for that evening’s performance. Theatregoers were told Ms Piper was ‘indisposed’ although no further explanation was given for her sudden absence, leading to much discussion on social media. Scroll down for video . Drama: Billie Piper, left, in a scene from the play, Great Britain . Ms Dockery, herself an award-winning actress, took to the stage and received rave reviews for her performance on Twitter. One audience member tweeted: ‘Jo Dockery currently smashing it as Billie Piper in 3hr epic. She had 15 minutes notice.’ Ms Piper returned to the stage the following evening, while police continued their enquiries into the crash. Officers must decide whether the actress’s driving was dangerous. The Crown Prosecution Service defines driving as dangerous when it falls below the ‘minimum acceptable standard expected of a competent and careful driver and when it would be obvious to a careful and competent driver that driving in that way would be dangerous.’ There is a fierce debate raging about the threat to cyclists on Britain’s roads. Scene: The VW Golf and cyclist collided on this road in Central London, outside the office of the Guardian newspaper . This year, eight cyclists have lost their lives in accidents in London. The capital’s mayor Boris Johnson has recently pledged £1 billion to improve cycle safety. But there were also calls last night for cyclists to take greater responsibility for their actions and to ensure they wear helmets. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police were called to Goods Way, King’s Cross, by the London Ambulance Service at 15.56hrs on Tuesday, July 29 to reports of a road traffic collision between a motor vehicle and a cyclist. The driver of the vehicle was female. Enquiries continue. No further details at this stage.’ Charlie Lloyd of the London Cycling Campaign said: ‘When doing a U-turn you are expected to give way to everyone. 'Every crash highlights the need for all road users to take care. Wearing a cycle helmet is a personal choice – the evidence is mixed as to the protection they provide.’ A spokesman for Billie Piper declined to comment.

"A rusty wreck of a Mercedes left gathering dust in a British lock-up for more than 30 years has sold for a staggering £445,000 - almost seven times its estimate. The Mercedes 600 six-door Landaulet was the car of choice for 20th century despots with Saddam Hussein, Pol Pot and Idi Amin among notorious owners. This 1971 model, is regarded as the 'holy grail' of Mercedes but was previously owned by an African head of state who treated the German limousine appallingly. 'Holy grail': The Mercedes 600 six-door Landaulet was the car of choice for 20th century despots with Saddam Hussein, Pol Pot and Idi Amin among notorious owners . Rot: This 1971 model, is regarded as the 'holy grail' of Mercedes but was previously owned by an African head of state who treated the German limousine appallingly . The Mercedes is powered by a huge 6.3-litre V8 engine which develops 245bhp. This particular engine, however, has certainly seen better days . The Mercedes later left Africa and has spent more than 30 years decaying in a lock-up until recently resurfacing to go under the hammer at RM Auctions' Paris sale. The car was offered without reserve and with a modest estimate of £60,000 to £100,000, but bidding soon rose into the hundreds of thousands. Offers came in from the auction room and over the phone as interested parties battled it out to get their hands on the 20-foot long limousine. The hammer eventually went down on Wednesday night, with the car being sold for €480,000 euros (£395,000), rising to £442,400 when an anonymous buyers' premium is included. The owner will now be left with a costly restoration which could cost in excess of £800,000. The Mercedes 600 was the luxury car of the 1960s and 70s thanks to its high levels of comfort and state-of-the-art technology. The classic Mercedes 600, in its various editions, remains popular today with the likes of Jeremy Clarkson and singer Jay Kay among well-known owners . Believe it or not, the Mercedes 600 was the luxury car of the 1960s and 70s thanks to its high levels of comfort and state-of-the-art technology . At the top of the range were the 26 special 'Landaulet' models where the rear of the car would open and transform it into the world's ultimate convertible. This made it perfect for parades and the 600 Landaulet became a favourite of some the world's most notorious leaders including Saddam Hussein and Pol Pot. When it was delivered in 1971, it was fitted with a nine-inch Sony TV, Becker Grand Prix radio with eight speakers. It also had the comfort of optional armrests, the security of seatbelts, and the privacy of curtained windows. The Mercedes is powered by a huge 6.3-litre V8 engine which develops 245bhp. This accelerates the 20-foot long limousine from 0-60mph in around ten seconds and top speed of more than 125mph.

It also had the comfort of optional armrests and the privacy of curtained windows . Stuart Haynes, service director at Mercedes specialist John Haynes Auto Technics, said the £450,000 paid for the car could turn out to be a good investment. He said: 'It was the car of the moment, anyone who was anyone had a Mercedes 600. John Lennon owned one, so did Coco Chanel and many heads of state.' 'The Mercedes 600 was the best car in the world when it was made and some people still argue it is. It is silent, smooth and quick. The presence shouts style and 'you've made it',' he added. Mr Haynes said the 600 was 'the best of the best' and showcased the true extent of Mercedes' quality as a car manufacturer. He believes the restoration will be particularly because of the hydraulics involved. 'You'd probably be looking at in excess of 1m euros for Mercedes to restore it. They are few and far between... Fully restored it is a difficult car to value but you are getting a brand new Mercedes 600 and it will probably be a wise investment', he said.","Mercedes 600 sold for £445,000 despite rotting in a lock-up for last 30 years .

"Ray Lee, 65, says his life was saved by an ambulance driving over a pothole as it slowed his heart rate . They are an everyday hazard which leave most of us cursing. But the pothole that punctuated Ray Lee’s journey may well have saved his life. The grandfather was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance being taken to hospital after collapsing at home while exercising on a cross-trainer. He had suffered a suspected ventricular tachycardia attack – a potentially fatal heart rhythm. His heart rate soared to 190 beats per minute, causing crippling pains in his chest. The medical solution when he reached Salisbury District Hospital would have been to give him an injection to stop his heart before restarting it with a shock. But, thanks to a poorly-maintained road on the five-mile trip from his home in Wilton, Wiltshire, Mr Lee didn’t have to wait. The ambulance hit a pothole, throwing the retired operations manager up off his stretcher. When he landed, his heart had reset itself to a healthy 60bpm. His wife, Christine, called an ambulance when Mr Lee’s heart rate shot up during his exercise routine. ‘The paramedics gave me an injection and strapped me to an ECG machine, which showed my heart was going at 186 beats per minute,’ said Mr Lee, 65. ‘We raced along the roads at high speed, with a medic standing in the back, leaning over me. ‘All of a sudden, there was a massive bang as we smacked into a pothole and the whole ambulance jolted.  Everyone on board jumped and I was lifted off the stretcher, before falling back into place. ‘After a few seconds I readjusted myself, settled back down, and looked over at the monitor to see my heart rate had plummeted to 60bpm. The jolt that the dip in the road caused Mr Lee's heart rate to drop dramatically while he was being rushed to hospital. He said he has complained about the state of his road for years but now doesn't want the potholes to ever be filled in . ‘The paramedic looked at me in a state of disbelief, but nobody said anything because we were so focused on getting to hospital.’ When they arrived, Mr Lee was still in pain and given morphine – and medics decided the jolt had saved him having to have the planned treatment. ‘I felt a bit of a fraud by the time I got to A&E, because my heart rhythm was normal,’ he said. ‘I was told they would have carried out a procedure to stop the spasm in my heart, but driving over the pothole did the trick.’ Potholes may ruin cars and be unsightly but in Mr Lee's case it helped save his life . Mr Lee and his wife, a retired teacher, drive along the same road regularly and have previously cursed its bad state. He said the stretch of road, which has a mixture of 30mph and 60mph speed limits, has numerous potholes, some of which are 2ft wide and a couple of inches deep. Mr Lee said: ‘I’d been cursing the council for months about the state of the roads because I spend my life dodging potholes, but now I never want them to fill in another pothole again. ‘I can’t say the pothole alone saved me – the wonderful paramedics and doctors did that – but bumping over it did make things easier. ‘Without the appalling condition of Wiltshire Council’s roads I might not have had such an easy time. ‘I guess there are some potholes that ruin your car and others that save your life.’ The grandfather-of-three was told that what he suffered had created a form of electrical short circuit in his heart, possibly as a result of a heart attack 21 years ago. Mr Lee, who spent three days in hospital, is now undergoing tests, and has been told to take it easy. But he says he feels well and is thanking his ‘pot luck’. A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said: ‘We can confirm we were carrying a patient to hospital with a heart condition when the ambulance hit a pothole. 'The patient’s heart rate subsequently fell.’","Ray Lee, 65, was exercising when heart rate rose to 190 beats per minute .

"A driver who asked a garage to fix his BMW with faulty brakes was amazed when a mechanic took it on a 92mph drive before it had been repaired. Gary Brown, 40, had fitted a GPS tracking device to his car which clocked every time the vehicle was over the speed limit by the worker. Within minutes of the BMW 6 series leaving his house, the car had been recorded doing 92.4mph on the M4 motorway near Reading, Berkshire. It was later also recorded doing 33mph in a 30mph zone.Scroll down for video . GPS tracker: Gary Brown's BMW Six Series is fitted with this device which recorded the garage worker speeding on the M4 in Berkshire . Mr Brown, 40, had arranged for the vehicle to be collected by Servicing Stop - a company which scooped a £100,000 investment on Dragons' Den. The online company gives customers a quote and then commissions a local garage to pick-up the car and carry out the work. Gary’s car was taken away by a mechanic who didn’t realise he had installed a tracking device in case his vehicle was ever stolen. The £110 small black TrackYour GPS device was set up so it sent him a text message every time the car is recorded breaking the speed limit. Speeding car: Mr Brown, 40, was sending his car to have its brakes repairs when the mechanic was clocked driving at 93mph on the motorway . Speeding: The mechanic who was recorded breaking the speed limit on the M4 worked for Karcare Services . The device can then also beam back the vehicle's coordinates so it is possible to work out exactly where it is. Gary, from Thatcham, Berkshire, said: 'I can’t believe how irresponsibly someone was driving my car - especially because they knew it needed new brakes. 'It was so dangerous - the car might not have been able to stop quickly at such high speeds. 'I’ll never let anyone I don’t know drive one of my cars again, and I definitely won’t be using Servicing Stop again, that’s for sure.' Gary called Service Stop and explained his dashboard brake light alert had come on and said he thought the brake pads probably needed replacing. The car was collected just before 9am on Thursday November 7 by a worker from Karcare Services who drove the vehicle 17 miles to their garage in Reading. Speeding: The car is clocked, left, doing 92.3mph on the M4 motorway in Berkshire, and, right, 33mph in a 30 zone nearby shortly afterwards. The tracking device sends back the speed and the location - which can then be viewed on Google Maps . Gary said: 'My car said the pads needed servicing. I knew it would be safe to go a few more miles, but I didn’t want to put myself in any danger. Tracking record: Gary Brown sends text messages to the tracker to get the recorded speed and location . 'I called Servicing Stop as I had done in the past and told them what was wrong with my car, and they said they’d send someone round to pick it up. 'But about ten minutes after it was collected from my home, I was stunned to receive a text from the device saying that my car had broken the speed limit. 'I then monitored the situation quite closely, and saw the car got up to well over 90mph. I just can’t believe the guy drove in such a reckless way.' The car was returned at 4pm and Gary was billed £450 to cover the cost of fitting new front brake pads. Servicing Stop won a £100,000 investment from businesswoman Deborah Meaden when they pitched their business on BBC2’s Dragons’ Den, in 2009. But after the show, brothers Oly and Toby Richmond, the company founders, were unable to reach an agreement with Deborah, and the deal collapsed. A spokesman for the firm said one of their sub-contractors treated Gary’s car in a 'distressing' manner. He said: 'Servicing Stop are aware of an incident on the November 7 whereby a member of staff from a sub-contracted garage exceeded the relevant speed limit in a clients’ vehicle, such circumstances are unacceptable and after considering our audit teams findings we have undertaken a disciplinary action against the garage in question. 'Alongside this our audit team have presented control recommendations which will be implemented as we look to ensure that Servicing Stop protect our clients and provide them with the quality of service we all expect. 'Whilst we are confident that the scheduled works on the vehicle were completed to the standards expected, this does not detract from the severity of this case and we are sympathetic to the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused our client.' Karcare Services were unwilling to comment. Car garage company win £100,000 investment on Dragons' Den .","Gary Brown, 40, fitted a tracking device to his car which records the speed .

"They probably generate more sheepish looks and furious hand signals than any other part of the road network. But this particular box junction infuriates drivers more than most. Angry motorists have dubbed the cross-hatched area the ‘Moneybox’ after it generated £2.7million in fines for the local council last year. The Moneybox: The Bagley's Lane Junction with New King's Road, Fulham, described as a trap because an average 11 drivers are caught on camera stopping in the yellow grid every single day . A total of 40,634 penalty notices were issued to motorists in 2011-2012 – an average of 111 a day. This is nearly three times the number . of motorists caught out in the previous 12 months and more than five . times the amount two years earlier. Suspicious drivers have accused . Hammersmith and Fulham Council, in West London, of designing the . junction to deliberately catch them out and create a cash cow. And similar traps could spring up . across the country if councils outside London have their way and win the . right to impose fines for a variety of highway offences. Drivers should enter a box junction . only if the exit road or lane is clear. They can wait inside it if they . want to turn right and are stopped from doing so by oncoming traffic or . other vehicles queuing to turn right. But motorists argue that the . Moneybox – at the junction of fashionable but heavily congested New . King’s Road and Bagley’s Lane in Fulham – has two sets of traffic lights . which allow more motorists to enter the controlled area than can leave . it. Trap: How drivers are lured on to the yellow lines . One to avoid: This map shows the location of the junction in Fulham, west London . At the moment only councils in London have the power to issue fines for traffic violations, like the ones at Fulham's Moneybox. However about 20 councils from across the UK have held talks with the government about taking over the enforcement of 26 driving offences from police. At present they can only fine drivers for parking offences and driving in bus lanes, but if they win the new powers their remit will be expanded to include making U-turns and driving in cycle lanes, as well as stopping in a box junction and a range of other offences. Campaigners have said they fear councils will use the fines as a stealth tax to raise revenue. As a result, many are receiving £65 fines, which rise to £130 if they are not paid within two weeks. Victims include Susanne More, who . lives in Twickenham, South-West London, and has been fined twice. She . said: ‘There’s something fundamentally wrong with the number of fines . issued to drivers going into this junction. It seems the council has . decided this is a really good money-making scheme. ‘The yellow box is far too long. It doesn’t give you enough time to get out and the signalling is awful.’ Musician Jonathan Majin added: . ‘Drivers are frequently lured into the yellow box and trapped there by . traffic lights. It is a complex, confusing and unclear junction.’ Fines are being issued to drivers . heading along New King’s Road towards Chelsea. As they enter the . junction, another set of lights 110ft up the road remains red for . between 25 and 40 seconds. Only four cars can wait legally behind . the first lights, leaving the rest at risk of being spotted on CCTV. Tickets are automatically sent to the vehicle owner. Motorists are also getting caught as they wait to turn right into Bagley’s Lane from New King’s Road. A council spokesman said no one would . be penalised if they ‘just stuck to the rules’, but Transport for London . said it would consider improving the junction. About 20 councils have asked to take . over enforcement of 26 road offences from police, including those . involving box junctions, U-turns and cycle lanes. Critics say they will . be used to generate income.","Cameras trained on the yellow box on the junction of Bagley's Lane and New King's Road, West London, catch more than 100 drivers every day .
Observations of the junction found that at least one vehicle gets stuck inside the box every time the lights change .
Many receive £65 fines, which rise to £130 if not paid within two weeks .
Similar traps could spring up across the country if councils have their way ."
"Alexandra O'Shea refused to pay the £75 on-the-spot fine she was given for throwing her cigarette butt out of her car window - and was eventually ordered to pay more than £1,000 . A motorist who threw a cigarette end out of her car window has been ordered to pay more than £1,000 after she refused to pay a £75 on-the-spot fine. Alexandra O’Shea, 20, was spotted by two Police Community Support Officers as she wound down her window and flicked the butt into the street as she drove through Bristol. They flagged her down and issued her with a fine for littering, but when she didn't pay it, Bristol City Council took O'Shea to court. Bristol Magistrates' Court heard that . O’Shea, from Bedminster Down, Bristol, was driving through the Bristol . suburb of Hartcliffe last summer when she wound down her car window and . flicked out the butt. Carol Donovan, a street scene officer for Bristol City Council, said: 'We wrote to her telling her that if she did not pay that we would take her to court. 'She ignored this, and failed to turn up when the case was heard, despite reminders, and then magistrates obviously took her behaviour very seriously.' O'Shea was ordered to pay a fine of £600, costs of £361.08, and a £60 victim surcharge. Jonquil Maudlin, council neighbourhood enforcement manager, said: 'People should be aware that cigarette ends are just as much litter as anything else, and they take a long time to biodegrade, as they are made not of paper, but of plastic filament. 'They are full of toxic chemicals and it has been found that many have been found in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals who mistake them for food.' Andy Walker, from the Keep Britain Tidy Campaign, said: 'People tend to think that littering is a victimless crime but the reality is it affects us all. 'According to research, littering costs the country around £1 billion every single year, and it is a major cost for councils such as Bristol City Council. 'Every time someone drops litter in the street, we are all having to pay to clean it up.  If this person had paid the fine and not ignored the court letters then she would not have got herself in such a mess.'

"Town hall chiefs are defying the government and launching CCTV spy cars even after they were told the 'cash cows' will be made illegal, MailOnline can reveal. Local government secretary Eric Pickles has announced he will ban the controversial vehicles, which film people breaking traffic rules and send them fines of up to £130 in the post. Yet since his pledge in September, 20 authorities - including one of the country's biggest, Manchester City Council - have either introduced a new spy car regime or have firm plans to do so. On the lookout: Last September, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles condemned the use of CCTV against drivers as a 'step too far'. But councils have simply ignored him - with 20 authorities so far buying new spy cars . Another 38 councils have had meetings about the controversial technology in the last year, and have yet to reveal if they will introduce it. About a fifth of authorities in England and Wales now use CCTV cars despite complaints by motorists, ministers and civil liberties groups. Local government secretary Eric Pickles said councils used CCTV on an 'industrial scale' They handed drivers more than 340,000 fines worth at least £30 million in the last year. Yet of the 2,500 drivers who appealed to an independent tribunal, almost half (44 per cent) won their cases. Some 697 won outright while another 379 had their cases dropped by the council once they mounted a formal challenge. Mr Pickles said: 'CCTV spy cars are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale. 'They undermine natural justice, as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal. This is why the government has published proposals to ban CCTV being used for parking purposes. 'We are going to rein in the town hall parking bullies.' MailOnline obtained the figures by sending Freedom of Information requests to 373 councils, of which 296 replied within the legal deadline. We asked about CCTV car use between November 2012 and the end of October 2013, and asked if councils which did not run the technology had held meetings about it or made firm plans to introduce it. Five authorities - Manchester City Council, Derby City Council, Bath and North East Somerset Council, Slough Borough Council and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council – said they had already launched CCTV cars in the time between Mr Pickles' landmark announcement on September 27 and the end of October. Another 15 areas had made firm plans to do so, with many claiming they were inundated with requests for CCTV from the public. We're watching you: CCTV cars were legalised in 2004 and there are now more than 100 in use across Britain . Only one of the 15, Rushmoor Borough . Council in Hampshire, said it was delaying introducing the cars until the . government released firm guidance. Cllr Kate Chappell, Manchester City Council’s cabinet member for the environment, defended the technology. With more than 100 specially adapted cars across Britain, 'mobile CCTV' has become the bane of many motorists' lives. The technology was legalised under Labour in 2004, allowing councils to break from the tradition of always using traffic wardens. Since then more councils have brought in the technology every year - but while a traffic warden can be reasoned with, said critics, a machine cannot. High-profile 'victims' included one driver who pulled over to vomit and another whose windscreen had smashed. Drivers who feel they have been wronged can take their cases to a Traffic Penalty Tribunal, a network of independent adjudicators, or a parallel system for London. Adjudicators often criticise councils and have questioned their definition of the 'difficult or sensitive' circumstances in which CCTV fines should be given out. Richmond Council, south west London, faced having to repay thousands of fines in 2011 after campaigner Nigel Wise discovered its four cars had not been properly registered. She said: 'Parents, teachers and children regularly tell us that illegal parking on roads outside schools is a major problem. 'Despite their efforts to urge people to park more responsibly, a minority of motorists still persist in putting the lives of school children at risk. 'These clearly marked cars have been introduced to improve road safety and protect children and while it is disappointing that Eric Pickles does not share this view, we would be more than happy to meet him and explain why we believe it is important to effectively manage parking outside schools.' The National Association of Head Teachers also attacked Mr Pickles' pledge. Policy adviser Sion Humphreys said: 'Parking outside schools can be a big problem. Many drivers take risks to avoid the rush such as ignoring the hatched areas outside or speeding.' Cllr Peter Box, transport board chairman of the Local Government Association, added: 'CCTV cameras cars account for just two per cent of total council parking income. 'These figures also show that less than one per cent of motorists are appealing fines issued by CCTV enforcement and that when they have grounds for appeal the system works. 'The reality is that the average motorist is paying 30 times more to Whitehall in charges and taxation each year than they do to their town hall through parking.' Among more than 60 councils which already run CCTV cars, the biggest earner was Bristol City Council - which handed out 27,719 fines worth almost £2 million. Nick Pickles, director of the . anti-CCTV pressure group Big Brother Watch, said many councils ignore . strict rules which say CCTV cars must only be used where it is dangerous . for a traffic warden to work. He added: 'The huge numbers of tickets . given out in error and later dropped highlights the risk to innocent . people of these spy cars. 'When people see the multi-million . pound enterprise CCTV cars have become they will rightly be asking if . this is less about public safety and more about revenue raising. A fine mess: CCTV cars are allowed to park on double yellow lines in many areas, leading to claims of double standards. Countless drivers have complained that using a machine doesn't take circumstances into account . Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, has tabled an investigation into councils' use of CCTV with the intention of scrapping the controversial cars. Town halls now issue nine million parking fines a year .

'Equally, the high revenues highlight what a lousy deterrent CCTV is – even when it is a blindingly obvious spy car. 'Councils should be working to solve the underlying problems of congestion around schools and understand why so many children arrive by car.' Just one council in Britain which could introduce CCTV cars has publicly ruled out doing so. A spokesman for West Dorset District Council said it ran 'contrary to the spirit of fair[ness] and common sense of on-street traffic management.' It emerged on December 15 that transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin has tabled an investigation into CCTV cars with a view to banning them. The government's changes will also extend the grace period before motorists receive a fine from five minutes to 15. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: 'We have recently published proposals to ban CCTV for parking. 'Subject to the consultation process, the Government will then amend legislation and associated statutory guidance to deliver on this pledge.'","Ministers say the 100-plus CCTV cars fleece motorists on 'industrial scale'

"A mother of two who was drenched with her children when a passing motorist drove through a puddle has criticised his punishment... as too harsh. Samuel Lees, 22, was banned from the road and fined £500 after he hit the standing water at speed, soaking Debbie Pugh and her children David, eight, and Emma, 11, as they walked to school. A following police car said Lees  created a ‘large wave’ that left a group of schoolchildren screaming after they and their parents were doused with freezing water on January 17. Samuel Lees (left), 22, has been banned from driving and fined £500 after he splashed children in his car. Debbie Pugh, 48, was walking to school with her children, David, eight, and Emma, 11, when they were splashed . The driver was prosecuted after he was seen by a police officer creating a 'large wave' that left children screaming after they got wet . As well as the fine, magistrates gave . the shop worker six points, which means that as a new driver he will . lose his licence. Anyone receiving six points within two years of . passing their test has their licence revoked. However, even Mrs Pugh, 48, said  she was stunned by the severity of  his sentence. The company director, of Colchester, Essex, said: ‘I am very, very shocked by the punishment he has been given. ‘I . don’t think that is fair at all. I think they must have wanted to make . an example of him. But I think a slap on the wrist would have been . sufficient. ‘Perhaps he . could have gone on a driver awareness course, but what he has got from . the court is really quite harsh. I would not wish that fine on anybody.’ PC Mark Hercules, the . traffic policeman who was following Lees in Colchester, said: ‘The . vehicle was driven through the puddle at a relatively fast speed making . no attempt to slow down or avoid it. ‘As . a consequence, a large wave of water absolutely soaked the children and . their parents. We could hear the screams from the children as they got . drenched in the cold, dirty rainwater. ‘The motorist drove off. Fortunately, I was able to witness the whole incident. ‘His actions caused distress to the young children. ‘In . addition, I pointed out the hidden hazards that lie in large puddles . and the fact he could have lost control of his vehicle and caused a . danger to other road users.’ On Mr Lees' punishment, Debbie Pugh said: 'I think they must have wanted to make an example of him but I think a slap on the wrist would have been sufficient' Lees, who has been driving for less than a year, will have to pass both his theory and driving test again to regain his licence. Chelmsford magistrates also ordered him to pay £90 court costs and a £50 victim surcharge on top of his £500. Last . night, he said the loss of his licence meant he faced losing his job . because he uses his red VW Polo to drive to work in Chelmsford, 25 miles . from his home in Colchester. He added: ‘I did not mean to splash the family. ‘I knew there was a police car behind me, so why would I do something like that on purpose when they were following? ‘I turned round a corner and then went through the puddle and was spotted straight away. ‘But . if you ask anyone who knows me, I am not the kind of person to do . something like  that on purpose. That’s not what I am like at all. ‘It . was one lapse of concentration and nothing more than that.  People . drive through puddles and people do get splashed – it’s unavoidable . unfortunately. It really is an everyday occurrence, so, yes, I do feel . hard done by.’ Mr Lees was due to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates Court last Saturday, but he did not attend and was punished in his absence. He had recently moved house and said he did not receive the summons . Although unusual, it is not unheard-of for drivers who splash pedestrians to fall foul of police. In . 2009, a 29-year-old Kerry Callard, from Plymouth, was questioned by . Devon and Cornwall Police after she posted a video clip of herself . online soaking pedestrians in a craze called ‘happy splashing’. She . was reportedly heard howling with laughter in the 30-second film as she . drove through a puddle, soaking children waiting at a bus stop.

The 48-year-old woman also faces the possibility of being paralysed after she suffered ‘traumatic’ head and neck injuries at an indoor arena. It is believed her hair became caught in the engine of the go-kart, snapping her head back and causing horrific wounds to her scalp. The incident happened at The Garage leisure complex in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, and the woman, from Cumnock, was first taken to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock. A 48-year-old mother-of-two is fighting for her life in hospital today after suffering 'traumatic' head injuries while go-karting with her children. Her hair is thought to have become caught in the engine, snapping her head back. Stock image . The horror accident happened at The Garage leisure complex in Kilmarnock, Ayshire on Wednesday . She was later transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, which has a specialist unit for head injuries. A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘We received a call for a 48-year-old female patient at 8.20pm on Wednesday, April 30. She was taken to Crosshouse Hospital at 9pm. 'She suffered traumatic injuries during a go- karting session. An external force caused the injuries, which included a serious head and neck trauma.’ Police were also called and East Ayrshire Council is carrying out an investigation. The Garage, which also has a nightclub and a bowling alley, describes its indoor karting track experience as ‘the ultimate thrill’. It declined to comment on the incident last night, but confirmed that bookings are still being taken for karting sessions. Go-karts intended for the general public are often limited to speeds of around 16mph. Most karts have a petrol engine mounted behind the driver which powers the vehicle’s rear wheels. It is not clear if the woman was wearing a helmet when the accident occurred. Website pictures show people racing karts at The Garage wearing full-face helmets. Paramedics rushed the mother-of-two to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, before she was transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, which has a specialist head injury unit . The woman is currently being treated at the specialist head injury unit at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow . In 2012, a woman in Indiana lost more . than half her scalp in a similar accident after her hair caught in the . axle of a go-kart at Whiteland Raceway Park in Indianapolis. Shelbi . Crouch also suffered a skull fractures and facial paralysis. British schoolgirl Amy Rose Coxall was strangled in February 2010 when her scarf caught in the wheels of a go-kart. The 15-year-old was celebrating the Chinese New Year on holiday in Hong Kong with friends when the accident happened. In 2009, a teenager was strangled by her scarf in a go-karting accident at Peterborough Raceway Ltd in Cambridgeshire. Eighteen-year-old Suzanne Cornwell was fatally injured when the scarf was caught in the engine. Last night, a spokesman for Police .

In December last year it was revealed that the council's overall profit from parking services for 2012/13 was £16.3million - the most of any local authority outside London. The council said it was unable to comment on yesterday's incident. 'We don't provide commentary on individual cases,' said a spokesman. 'The driver is well within their rights to make a case for appeal. That will be considered in time. 'However it would be unfair for us to comment beforehand.'","Wardens put a ticket on the windscreen while the driver went to get help .

"This lane is only 6ft wide and has a sign to warn off larger vehicles, so you  might have thought truck drivers would steer well clear. But to the dismay of resident Caroline Cockman, some just blindly follow their  satnavs – getting themselves stuck and damaging her beautiful Grade II-listed home. She estimates that lorries have so far caused around £50,000 damage to her side and garden walls, and to her neighbour’s wall on the opposite side. Scroll down for video . Caroline Cockman said she has lost count of the number of lorries that have become stuck in her lane or damaged her property . The homeowner, who has lived at the property for 23 years, said drivers of large vehicles ought to know better . Video courtesy of Wells Journal . Yesterday the 54-year-old, who lives . in a former Georgian mill house, said: ‘Their satnavs direct them down . the lane. They ignore the evidence of their own eyes that it’s too . narrow and just carry on until they get stuck . ‘The . worst incident happened in 2008 when a big lorry got stuck then tried . to ram its way down, costing £13,000 in repairs. 'There have been so many . incidents, I can’t remember them all. Several have caused £5,000 . damage. 'I’ve started claiming off my own insurance because it was so . slow claiming third party from the driver’s insurance. ‘It’s heartbreaking because as soon as something is repaired it’s just a matter of time before it gets damaged again.’ In the past week three motorists ran into trouble on the small, narrow lane in Coxley, Somerset . Over the years Ms Cockman said around £50,000 worth of damage has been done to her home and grounds . Sometimes the homeowner does not even have the chance to see the culprit, and they get out of the situation 'scot free' Ms Cockman (left)  is pleading with council officials to make signage before the turn down the lane more obvious (right) There . is a sign at the top of the lane in Coxley, near Wells, Somerset, . warning drivers of the width restriction. But Miss Cockman, who has . lived there for 23 years, wants the council to make it more prominent. Three . trucks have got stuck in the last week alone, she said. One driver had . to get in and out of the cab through a window while they waited four . hours for a rescue vehicle to arrive. Garden . designer Miss Cockman added that she believes the problem is partly . down to some drivers still using domestic satnavs designed for cars, . rather than specialist satnavs for commercial vehicles. ‘I’m told the commercial ones do carry warnings about the lane’s width but the domestic ones don’t,’ she said. 'Sometimes I’ve come home and the damage has been done and the driver has gone and got away scot free. 'Luckily I’ve got a neighbour who works from home who can now get the driver details of most incidents when they happen. 'But I’ve started claiming off my own insurance because it was so slow claiming third party from the driver’s insurance - things would drag on and on because it was lower priority. The homeowner has lived at the property for 23 years and has faced 'countless' problems, she says . Despite hearing from council representatives, little is being done to solve the problem in Coxley, Somerset . Council officials say the road signs are obvious enough despite repeated incidents. Three motorists in just one week have had trouble at the site . Ms Cockman said drivers of lorries and vans should pay more attention to the road than to their sat nav . On one occasion a driver caused £33,000 worth of damage after getting stuck in the lane and damaging the wall . The council said the sign is clearly marked enough though Ms Cockman says more needs to be done . 'Last Monday . we had a big sewage tanker, with an escort to make sure it travelled . safely, and it took him half-an-hour to reverse out. 'Then on Wednesday night someone collided with our low wall which stops vehicles coming off the lane and into our courtyard. 'Another guy was trapped for six hours. If only truck drivers used their common sense as the lane got narrower and narrower. 'You would think they ought to know better.' 'There needs to be more prominent signage at the top of the lane. 'I’ve had visits from council representatives who are sympathetic and make all the right noises but nothing ever gets done. 'It’s heartbreaking because as soon as something is repaired it’s just a matter of time before it gets damaged again.' A spokesman for Somerset County council said there were enough warnings in place to avoid lorries getting stuck in the lane. 'There are already signs in place at this location and we recommend drivers pay attention to these.'","Caroline Cockman has lived in cottage in Coxley for 23 years .

"A prosecutor who was sacked after attempting to indict Chris Christie's political cronies for corruption told MailOnline today about his ordeal at the hands of the New Jersey Governor's 'mafia.' Bennett Barlyn, a prosecutor for 18 years in New Jersey’s Hunterdon County, has spoken out following the revelations over the Bridgegate scandal to reveal his firsthand account of being fired and shamed at the hands of Christie and his political henchmen. He said there were parallels between a . criminal case he tried to prosecute –  before, he says, it was . unlawfully dismissed – and the Bridgegate scandal, where Christie’s staff closed off travel lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge, in order to retaliate against a Democratic mayor who had declined to endorse him for re-election. Scroll down for video . Bennett Barlyn . 'It's the same modus operandi,' he said Tuesday in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'It's the governor's office again using a state agency in an improper way for political purposes'. Barlyn . is suing the state of New Jersey for records that he says will prove . the case's dismissal was the product of political corruption. He . secured indictments against Deborah Trout, a county sheriff loyal to . Republicans. She was accused of gross violations that included hiring . staff without vetting them, supplying a Christie donor with a false law . enforcement ID and forcing underlings to sign loyalty oaths. According . to Barlyn, the criminal case against Trout was moving along smoothly . until the grand jury voted to indict her in March 2010. When . the charges became public, an indicted undersheriff, Michael Russo, . allegedly told an aide that Christie will 'have this whole thing thrown . out', according to The Hunterdon County Democrat. Another Sheriff's Officer Joseph Falat Jr, was also accused. The . day a judge unsealed the indictments, Dermot O'Grady, Christie's deputy . attorney general, arrived suddenly to take over the prosecutor's office . personally. Barlyn was shown the door. He was stripped of his job and ushered out of the courthouse by armed guards. Mafia Don? Barlyn is in no doubt Christie was pulling the puppet strings, saying he he governs like a gangster . Protected: Hunterdon Sheriff Deborah Trout, a Republican loyalist, saw corruption charges against her dropped suddenly . It was surprise to all involved. A woman on the jury told The New York Times in October that 'we had no real disagreements. It was cut and dried.' Barlyn is in no doubt Christie was pulling the puppet strings. According to Barlyn, he governed like a gangster. 'It . was mafia-esque,' Barlyn told MailOnline. 'I was given no due process, I . was fired without explanation and other people were intimidated in the . office to remain silent. 'I . was called into the office and told to surrender my credentials, my . phone and my badge to get into the building. I asked what was happening . and they said I wasn't entitled to an explanation.' He . watched helplessly as the criminal case his office worked so hard lock . down was tossed out just days after Christie's appointee got his hands . on the reins.  Charges were dropped against all three accused. Then the Christie machine flexed its muscles, he claims. ‘The . day the indictments were unsealed the Attorney General’s office kicked . out a prosecutor and took over our office,’ Barlyn said, claiming all . the evidence in the case was removed from his county and locked up in . Trenton, the capital city of New Jersey. Barlyn claims Attorney General Paula . Dow, who served with the governor when he was the state's top federal . prosecutor, acted on Christie's orders to install O'Grady in his place. 'The Attorney General works directly for the governor,' he explained. 'It's not an elected position. The governor is the Attorney General’s boss. What this reflects is [Christie's] complete disregard to the law. Brought low: Barlyn was a $100,000 prosecutor before he crossed Christie's administration. Now he is suing to try and get his hands on the case files which have been locked away in Trenton . 'It . shows his willingness to hurt people who are principled and who do take . their oaths of office really seriously. If you're in the way of his . political ambitions you're a target, or at least a potential target.' A . spokesman for the Attorney General today told MailOnline: ‘The Barlyn case is a . matter of pending litigation. We do not comment on matters of pending . litigation.’ Last year, Christie's camp laughed off the accusations in the Times story. Michael Drewniak, the governor's top spokesman, said: 'This truly is some of the most wild-eyed conspiracy theories I’ve heard in a long time.' Barlyn also claims that a 'cover-up' followed the governor's invasion of his turf. 'Governor . Christie wanted nothing more than for me to remain silent and walk away . with my tail between legs,' he said. 'That's the power of retaliation. 'Christie . did what he did by firing me. But he also throws people under the bus . to protect himself and insulate himself from accountability.'There's . inconvenience to people by closing the bridge down,' he told . MailOnline, 'but he's also undermining the rule of law by dismissing . valid criminal charges.' I am the law: Barlyn told MailOnline that Christie, pictured today at his State of his State address, 'throws people under the bus to protect himself and insulate himself from accountability' and others are 'intimidated to remain silent' Christie . and his colleagues, he said, ‘ignored and cut out those who had been . working on the case. They took all the evidence and sent it back to . Trenton.' Baryln . expects a judge to decide on January 28 whether to release transcripts . from the grand jury testimony in the corruption case. He says if those records are made public, his lawsuit will likely succeed. 'That's the smoking gun,' Barlyn said. 'They’re fighting like hell to prevent those transcripts from becoming public.' New Jersey's attorney general sent a cadre of five lawyers into court in August to oppose Barlyn's lawsuit. 'I brought the lawsuits to ensure I was compensated on damages that affected me and my wife and three children,"" he said, ‘'and also to have people know what happened.' Now a schoolteacher living in Pennsylvania, he says he's earning less than half the $100,000 salary he once enjoyed as a prosecutor. Experts his lawyer retained say the damages he sustained are more than $1 million. Barlyn noted a final similarity between his story and the 'Bridgegate' saga enveloping Governor Christie's office. 'The thing that people who engage in misconduct hate most,' he said, ‘is exposure.'","Bennett Barlyn claims he was fired because he was prosecuting political cronies of Chris Christie for corruption .

"It costs more than the UK's average house price, and more than ten times the UK's average annual salary. But if money is no object, and you've already spent quarter of a million on a Roller, then perhaps a £275,000 parking space is the logical next step. An estate agency in Knightsbridge is marketing an underground parking space near the Royal Albert Hall in central London for the mind-boggling six-figure sum. Money well spent? The £275,000 parking space is located close to London's Royal Albert Hall . And in case you were wondering 'Why so cheap?', the answer is that it won't be yours for ever: the space is for sale on an 84-year lease. This exclusive parking space is situated in an underground, gated car park on Prince Consort Road in London's SW7, just a stone's throw from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Agents WA Ellis, whose offices overlook Harrods, describe it as a space that could 'easily accommodate a Rolls Royce or two medium-sized cars'. The firm's Robert Lewis, who is selling it, said the space would cost a lot more if it were nearer Harrods. He said: 'We generally see garages come on the market for between £180,000 and £275,000. 'A lot of people have townhouses and flats that are Victorian and don't have parking, and people don't want to park their Ferraris in the street; this is a secure underground car park. 'Could easily accommodate a Rolls Royce': WA Ellis's website advertises the space . Home to expensive cars: The underground parking complex already boasts some impressive marques . 'It can also be beneficial for people's insurance and if you were selling a house nearby you could sell it ""With parking"". 'The garages and spaces we sell near Harrods can sell for a lot more, you often see Bugatti Veyrons parked in there. 'There isn't a lot of parking in central London so people like to know they have always got a space.' The average house price in the UK at the . moment is £162,638.  In Yorkshire this falls to £157,157 and in the North . West it is £154,678. In Greater London homeowners can expect to fork . out £445,641, but the average house price in the City of Westminster, where this parking space is found, is an eye-watering £1,278,787. The parking space is underneath the Royal Albert Hall off Prince Consort Road in Knightsbridge, central London . Expensive address: You'd be unlikely to afford an actual flat with just £275,000 in Prince Consort Road . Expensive badge: Top-of-the- range Rolls Royces can cost a lot more than even a parking space in Knightsbridge . If you've got £275,000 to spend but don't want a parking space in Knightsbridge, there are plenty of other options for you. At just £17,000 each on the road, you could afford not just one but 15 Ford Focus Zetecs.  Somewhat smaller than a Rolls Royce, these might be easier to park in a tight spot, and the insurance premium will be lower, too. If you are looking for a home for yourself rather than your car, there are plenty of affordable options for sale in the Lancashire town of Burnley. Local agent Frost & Co are putting a two-bedroomed house in Dall Street up for auction next Wednesday with a starting bid of £1,000, which would leave you plenty of change to replace the metal screens with actual windows. In sought-after Fulham, south west London, £275,000 will buy you a one-bedroom flat above a furniture shop on Lillie Road, though it could do with a little decorating. Meanwhile for the same sum you could buy a three-bedroom house in Morden, near New Malden, complete with driveway and double glazing. Alternatively, you could extend your budget by £10,000 and buy another Rolls Royce.  A five-door, eight-speed Rolls Royce Phantom costs from £285,200 on the road while, if you're going for broke, a long wheelbase version will set you back £336,700.  And that's before you've paid to park it.","The space is in an underground car park near London's Royal Albert Hall .
Agent WA Ellis say leasehold space could fit two 'medium-sized' cars ."
"With a name like ‘Scary Spice’, you’d imagine the singer Mel B would drive something a little more challenging than a run-of-the-mill family car. But you might not expect to find her behind the wheel of an armoured fortress bristling with hi-tech anti-personnel gadgets. However, now that the former Spice Girl is carving out a successful TV career in Hollywood, she has decided that what she really, really wants is a £200,000 specially modified attack-proof Cadillac Escalade capable of destroying the tyres of pursuing vehicles. Scroll down for video demo . The £200,000 Escalade is capable of withstanding bullets, bombs and chemical attacks . Melanie Brown has joined the growing band of jittery U.S. celebrities who are driving armoured vehicles which can withstand bullets, bombs and chemical attacks. Her giant, gas-guzzling sports utility vehicle will even give an electric shock — up to 240 volts-worth of ‘non-lethal current’ — to car-jackers, paparazzi or anyone else foolish enough to grab the door handles in a bid to gain entry. At the push of a button, it will belch out dense white smoke to help the driver evade any pursuing vehicle, and pump out small spikes to puncture their tyres. Some customers specify pressurised cabins and on-board oxygen supplies to protect against chemical and gas attacks. Mel B’s specially armoured and fully loaded seven-seater vehicle was delivered to her at her home in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, recently by Jason Forston, vice-president of the Texas Armoring Corporation in San Antonio. His 38-year-old Leeds-born client also has an armoured Range Rover and Mercedes-Benz  S-Class on order, he said. Texas Armoring employs 50 people and customises about 200 vehicles a year, usually for heads of state, politicians, business executives, diplomats and royal families. But more recently, Hollywood celebrities and sport stars have sparked a mini-boom in armoured vehicles as the worsening international climate — from chemical strikes in Syria to terrorist attacks in Boston and Kenya — have made them twitchy about their personal safety and the risk of kidnap or worse. These stars include British actor Sacha Baron Cohen and the rapper Kanye West, who recently ordered two outrageous Latvian-built Prombron Iron Diamonds costing £800,000 each. They are made by Dartz Motorz, the . same company which built Sacha Baron Cohen’s gold-plated presidential . SUV which featured in his film The Dictator. Texas . Armoring’s Mr Forston, 32, said: ‘Five years ago we had no Hollywood . celebrities as customers. Nowadays, we have anywhere between 10 to 15 . orders a year from celebrities and professional athletes.’ Melanie Brown is the latest celebrity to purchase the high-security vehicle after Kanye West (right) reportedly ordered two similar £800,000 cars . They include Steven Seagal and rapper TI, who has a blinged-up version of Mel B’s Cadillac Escalade, including a 32in flat-screen television with satellite TV and mobile Wi-Fi. Love-cheat golfer Tiger Woods is also understood to have one of the firm’s armoured cars, which is presumably more than capable of withstanding a sustained attack from an angry wife wielding a nine-iron. Mel B — who is a judge on America’s Got Talent and has been co-hosting NBC’s Today show — and her producer husband Stephen Belafonte have opted for a traditional family-friendly interior to suit the lifestyles of her daughters Phoenix, Angel, Madison and stepdaughter Giselle. Mr Forston said: ‘I delivered it to their house in Beverly Hills. They are very good people. We all went for a test drive so they knew how to use all the different options. Her husband is a big car guy. She drove it for a while — and on the right side. ‘It’s pretty much the standard leather interior. They’ve got kids so are pretty down to earth about things.’ From the outside, these cars are virtually indistinguishable from the standard models — but have been stripped down to the frame and rebuilt with armour and hi-tech gadgets. In a country where guns are part of the fabric of day-to-day life — ‘I carry a gun in my pocket every day: we’re in Texas,’ says Mr Forston — customers can specify a special gun-port through which to shoot at attackers on the outside. And Texas Armoring clearly has supreme confidence in its product. In an astonishing video on the firm’s website — which comes with a ‘don’t try this at home’ health warning — president and chief executive Trent Kimball is seen crouching behind a sheet of the company’s bullet-proof glass while a young employee shoots at him with an AK-47. He lives to tell the tale as the triple-glazing shows up the spider-web impact of the bullets which nevertheless fail to penetrate the glass. But the American firm draws the line at emulating one South African security company which fitted a flame-thrower to a top-of-the-range BMW. At the push of a dashboard button, it shoots up a wall of fire outside the driver’s car door in order to incinerate any would-be car-jacker. Demand for armoured cars is also on the increase on this side of the Atlantic. In Britain they are popular with Eastern European oligarchs. Luxury car-makers such as Jaguar Land Rover, BMW, Bentley and Mercedes-Benz already have their own ‘in-house’ security arms which build in armouring from scratch. Mr Forston acknowledges their high level of expertise, but says his company — which takes apart existing cars and customises them with armour and gadgets before re-assembling them — can do almost as high a specification but at a fraction of the cost. Among the car makes they tackle are Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Jaguar, Aston Martin, Lotus, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Maserati, Volvo and even the more humble Honda, Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford. The most expensive car Mr Forston has sold to date is a customised and armoured £500,000 ($800,000) stretch Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon for an unnamed client. When he was Prime Minister, Tony Blair took delivery of a fully armoured BMW 7-series — dubbed the ‘Blair Panzer’ after the German word for armour. Ironically, on delivery in London, police found that illegal immigrants had stowed away in the container lorry transporting it to Britain. David Cameron has, as his official car, an armoured, top-of-the-range Jaguar XJ. But trumping them all is U.S. President Barack Obama with his gargantuan armoured Cadillac-style limousine, dubbed ‘The Beast’, which follows him around the globe on official visits. Security expert Robert Siciliano, in New York, says that for the super-rich earning millions, the cost of an armoured vehicle is a drop in the ocean and a sensible investment. ‘What’s your life worth?’ he says. ‘A bullet costs about 25 cents. It will go through a non-armoured vehicle pretty efficiently. So to spend three-quarters of a million dollars on an armoured vehicle isn’t that outrageous.’ No doubt, Scary Spice would agree. The former Spice Girl’s current vehicle certainly brings a whole new meaning to the term ‘girl power’.","The £200,000 Cadillac Escalade is a favourite among celebrities .

"An actor who was caught driving a fake police car with blue flashing lights and siren has been fined £100. Michael Allen, 35, was spotted in the modified Volvo - which was to be used in one of his films - by an off-duty officer in Northampton on May 11 this year. A court heard the vehicle had police markings on the bonnet, rear window and rear bumper that were 'crossed out' with black tape. Left, actor Michael Allen, 35, leaving Northampton Magistrates' Court. Right, he is pictured in full tactical police uniform for an acting role . The vehicle Michael Allen admitted to driving  (pictured) was decorated to be a fake police vehicle for films . A real police officer took down the registration number because he believed 'it was not being driven in a manner that would reflect well on the police force'. Allen was tracked down and when police searched his address they also found two ex-police fleeces, a police baton, a ballistic vest and some handcuffs. In interview, he told officers he had bought the Volvo for £1,700 from the Gumtree website and had got the other equipment off eBay. Allen, of Northampton, admitted a charge of using a vehicle fitted with a blue beacon and one of using the same car fitted with a siren. He was fined £100 and ordered to pay £85, as well as a victim surcharge of £20 by JPs at Northampton Magistrates Court. Prosecutor Julie Costello said Allen used the former South Yorkshire Police vehicle and equipment for films he appeared in - including one called Enemy of England. Through his business CMP Lighting Solutions, he fitted the lights to the car so it could be used in film work . She said: 'Mr Allen also worked as a security dog handler and he purchased the vehicle because it was the right size. 'Through his business CMP Lighting Solutions he provided amber lights and blue lights to get the vehicle used in film work.' Defending, Paul Harkins said his client didn't believe he was breaking the law because the lights could only be controlled from the boot, not the car's dashboard. He said: 'This case is very novel, very unusual. Cases like this don't appear in court very often. 'Mr Allen ran a business called CMP Lighting solutions and one part of the business was to prepare vehicles to be used as props in films. 'He would concede this particular vehicle was prepared as an English police car. 'The 'blues and twos' could not be operated from within the vehicle but only from the boot. The lights on the top of Allen's vehicle (pictured) could only be operated from the boot and not the dashboard. Here it is before it received police-style markings . Allen's car pictured during its transformation into a police vehicle to be used for film work . 'He did not believe he was contravening any laws. 'This vehicle was intended to be used as a prop in a film. He was not trying to be a police officer.' A charge of making a statement suggesting he was a police constable was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. Another two charges of driving without proper insurance and stealing a baton were also discontinued. After the case, Allen slammed the decision to haul him before magistrates. He said: 'It all seemed very petty to me. On the night I didn't want to leave the car on its own on an industrial estate so I drove it home. 'I was told by other people in the industry that it would be compliant if the police markings were covered. They didn't even know it had a siren until they arrested me. 'I was hauled before a court at the cost of thousands to the taxpayer kept in custody for 14 hours and all for what in the end? A minor road traffic offence. 'I would have made the alterations if they would have asked me, I've been done up like a kipper. 'It was a film prop. It wasn't like I was driving around pulling people over or speeding along on blue lights to try and beat the traffic. 'I am not happy about the situation at all.'","Part time actor and company owner fined for driving a fake police car .

Caroline Turner, 79, had her licence taken away in 2011 after leading officers on the low-speed chase for more than an hour through Essex.

Turner, who has six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, was banned from driving for a year  and fined £100 after admitting driving without due care and attention at Colchester Magistrates' Court. During the pursuit, she had never gone above 20mph - and had told the officer jogging alongside her car: 'There's nothing to discuss. I'm going home', the court heard. She had also ignored blue sirens, swerved into oncoming traffic and driven the wrong way around a roundabout - forcing other motorists to take evasive action.

The MP4, also known as the 12C, has a top speed of 204mph and is the first production car designed by McLaren since its famous F1 model from 1998. Last month a Lamborghini Aventador, worth £400,000, was seized and towed away by police after they found that its driver's insurance policy did not cover him to be behind its wheel. After another case last week, it appears that people owning them may be unaware they require extra insurance to drive one. Seized: This Lamborghini Aventador was seized by police in east London last month after it was discovered that the driver was uninsured . Towed away: Police gather round the £400,000 supercar as it is secured to a tow vehicle in Newham, east London . 'Police in Islington seized a McLaren MP4 after it was involved in a collision with a . cyclist,' a Met spokesman said today.

"A controversial police campaign that 'names and shames' hundreds of drink-drivers on Twitter has been condemned as 'totally immoral'. Several UK police forces adopted the new scheme this Christmas and New Year, in order to shame drink-drivers out of re-offending and 'scare' would-be offenders into not getting behind the wheel. Police publish the name, age and sometimes even the address of offenders once they have been charged - either on their website, Facebook or Twitter. (File picture) A motorist is breathalised in Chichester, West Sussex, on New Years Eve as part of the force's crack down on drink driving . But the scheme – so far adopted by Staffordshire, West Midlands, Devon and Sussex police forces -  has been criticised by lawyers and local politicians, for undermining a defendant's right to a fair trial. Nick Freeman, a well-known celebrity lawyer, specialising in traffic and speeding offences, said: 'Naming these people before there is a guilty verdict is at best misguided; at worst it is totally immoral. 'Naming and shaming before conviction, unless it is in the public interest to do, is ridiculous and is potentially designed to encourage vigilante action.' Mr Freeman, who is nicknamed 'Mr Loophole' for his ability to win unlikely high-profile court cases, added: 'I have represented hundreds of clients who have been acquitted for a whole variety of different reasons. This means they have been found not guilty. 'They leave court without a stain on their character. 'If any person has been named and shamed and is ultimately acquitted they may have a substantial claim for damages against the police.' Staffordshire Police, which has published the names of more than 80 drivers on Twitter, has attracted the most controversy. Staffordshire Police is one of the forces publishing names of drink drivers on Twitter . Mr Freeman has even called for the force's commissioner Matthew Ellis to resign over the campaign, accusing him of showing a 'cavalier disregard for the presumption of innocence'. Labour councillor Mike Holder, who sits on the Staffordshire Police and Crime Panel whose job is to scrutinise Mr Ellis' job, also condemned the scheme. 'I think it would cause me concern if everybody that was charged was put on a public forum such as Twitter or Facebook,' he said yesterday. 'What are the consequences going to be? 'It attaches a stigma to an individual where perhaps there might be no reason for it, they might be totally innocent. 'The naming and shaming doesn't protect lives. I think if I was charged I would already by thinking about the consequences.' Nick Freeman, the well-known celebrity lawyer specialising in traffic and speeding offences, has criticised the scheme . Councillor Chris Cooke, leader of the Independent Group on Staffordshire County Council, agreed, saying police have gone 'too far'. However, guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) states that drink drivers can be named in the media following being arrested and charged by the police. And Mr Ellis said he continues to back Staffordshire's campaign. He said: 'A recent survey suggests that the proactive approach being taken in Staffordshire and several other forces is raising the profile and potentially preventing people being killed or seriously injured on the roads. 'Over 60 per cent of people surveyed said that being named after charge would make them think more about the consequences of driving after having a drink,' he said. Meanwhile, Kevin Scott, founder and director of campaigning organisation, Civil Liberty said last night that he saw nothing wrong with naming suspects after they've been charged. 'This is simply a procedural matter,' he said. 'It is a case of a high-flying lawyer getting his knickers in a twist. 'I suspect that Mr Freeman has a celebrity client on the verge of appearing in court following some form of driving offence and that he has been named on Twitter. 'I doubt if it was bin men and lorry drivers he was defending he'd be kicking up such a fuss,' he added. However some say the campaign, by targeting drink drivers after they have committed a crime, is pointless because the crime has already been committed. As part of the West Midlands Police festive crackdown on drink driving, the force also offered rewards to people who reported them with payments of up to £200. Matt Dallaway, from the RAC, said he thought police should instead be focusing on preventing drink driving before it happens. 'I think most responsible motorists will prefer to encourage people not to get their keys out if they are in that condition,' he said.","Several forces adopted new scheme this Christmas and New Year .

"A luxury car saleswoman has been hailed as one of the world's best after it emerged she had sold more than £13million worth of Bugatti Veyrons in a single year. Anita Krizsan has sold 11 of the pricey vehicles in the past year at the exclusive Mayfair dealership where she works. Most Veyron salesmen consider themselves lucky to shift three of the supercars - which have a top speed of 267mph - in 12 months. But Miss Krizsan seems to have the Midas touch - as well as selling ten Veyrons outright from the Jack Barclay dealership, she joined with a European firm to sell an eleventh. Talented: Anita Krizsan has managed to sell 11 Bugatti Veyrons in the past year . Luxury: The Hungarian-born saleswoman is an expert at selling the super-luxury vehicles to wealthy clients . But last night she told the Mailonline, just minutes after clinching her latest deal (a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport sold for an eye-watering £1.7million), that being a woman in a traditional man’s world had not been a problem – indeed it can be a positive advantage. And even when male customers ask her to find a salesmen she says: ’You have to take it as a joke and respond with charm. You can’t blame the customers.’ 'This can be cultural, but once they realise I know about the car it breaks down barriers.' The Hungarian-born sales mastermind's outstanding efforts led to the boss of Bugatti sending her a special Christmas card telling her she was their ‘global benchmark’ in sales. Miss Krizsan works 24 hours a day dealing with VIP customers around the world, and goes to meet the customers in their home countries when the car keys are handed over. Her amazing sales exploits are revealed today in Auto Express magazine. Glamorous: The Veyron Super Sport is the fastest street car in the world with a top speed of 267mph . On the way up: The 39-year-old started working as an administrator at a Honda dealership but has now graduated to working with some of the most exclusive cars in the world . With her £10million a year sales translated into dollars, she has already been nicknamed ‘the $15million woman.’ She told Auto Express: ‘We tend to have two types of customer - collectors and investors. ‘I like to start by talking to them . about what cars they already have and their general interest. I'm trying . to find the car that matches their personalities.’ She . attributes her success to her phenomenal networking skills, which she . exercises by spending time with the super-wealthy at events such as the . Goodwood Festival of Speed. But . the commission on each car has not brought her trappings of great . wealth – her company car is a modest black diesel Volkswagen Golf – and . she lives unostentatiously in West London: ‘I don't drive a Bugatti . unfortunately. I have a diesel Volkswagen Golf which I love. 'It is very understated and suits my lifestyle. But I wouldn’t say no if one were offered.’ The firm was founded 1909 in the French town of Molsheim, Alsace – then a disputed part of the German Empire until 1919 -  by Italian-born designer and engineer  Ettore Bugatti. Business declined after Bugatti’s death on August 21, 1947, with manufacturing operations ending in 1952. Several failed attempts followed over decades to revive the marque. In 1987 Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli acquired the brand and created EB110 sports saloon. Owners included F1 world champion Michael Schumacher, but the firm soon went into liquidation. Volkswagen AG bought the brand in 1998 and VW boss Dr Ferdinand Piech led the drive to create a supercar fit for the 21st century. Critics were equally impressed and astonished by scale of his ambitions. A small ‘boutique’ factory was set up in grounds of Bugatti’s original home in Molsheim, next to his chateau, to hand-assemble the cars. Under Volkswagen in 2005, and after a series of prototypes, Bugatti unveiled the small but immensely powerful two seater 8-litre  W14 Veyron EB 16.4 with four-turbochargers  and a price in excess of £1 million. About 80 cars are built a year – most are collected by their owners from the factory. The Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport 16.4 World Record Edition has a top speed of 258mph, accelerates from rest to 60mph in 2.3 seconds, develops 1,200 brake horse power (about the same as 12 ford Fiestas put together), will average just 16mpg and has massive C02 emissions of 539g/km. She and her bosses declined to talk income – save to say she was on a ‘traditional’ commission-based package. However, leading luxury car dealers suggest that a ‘batting average’ of around £100,000 a year  would not be wide of the mark. This is calculated from the dealer’s profit margin on each Veyron  of around £150,000, and the salesman or saleswoman receiving around five per cent to 10 per cent of that profit. The exclusive hand-built cars are manufactured at a ‘boutique’ factory in the grounds of Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti’s former home at Molsheim in Alsace, France. 'Every customer is invited to the Molsheim factory in France,' she said. 'I like them to feel the history and culture of the car and the story behind it. While we're at the factory they can go for a test drive with Pierre-Henri Raphanel, who will tell them about the car and talk them through it.' Mr Raphanel is Bugatti’s lead test driver and set the record 267mph top speed in a Veyron Super Sport in 2010. She studied languages and speaks . fluent French and Russian – her childhood was spent growing up when . Hungary was still behind the communist Iron Curtain . Most . of Anita's clients are from the Middle-East which sometimes makes . communication between both parties difficult. Russians pose less of a . problem. She moved to the UK 13 years ago to work as an administrator for Honda in Newbury, Berkshire. But . her skill at sealing a deal quickly saw her move from Japanese . hatchbacks to European sports cars before she joined Jack Barclay in . 2011 to sell Bentleys. Her . boss Derek Bennett, general manager of the dealership, part of the giant . HR Owen PLC group,  hand-picked her for the Bugatti job. He . said: 'Customers lover her. It’s a big relationship job. She’s put a . little bit of magic into it. She  understands the customers and puts . them at ease.' She was . quickly moved from Bentleys to Bugattis, which she describes as a ‘piece . of art’, adding: ‘I always say there are two types of cars in this . world - Bugattis and other cars.’ Buyers considering a £1million supercar demand high levels of customer service. Flash: Most of the customers for the Veyron tend to come from places such as the Middle East and Russia . Success: Miss Krizsan has been hailed as one of the world's most successful Bugatti dealers . ‘I have some customers ringing me up at 2am asking about warranties – but they can call me any time,’ she said.

Bugatti prices vary from around £1million to £2million each, depending on model, specification, extras, local taxes, and currency exchange rates. Cars bought for use in the UK, for instance , will carry 20 per cent VAT. Those bought for delivery to a tax haven may carry no tax at all. Under EU law, tax for cars – and luxury yachts - is paid in the country into which the vehicle  is imported – not where it is purchased. She . even goes to every handover - next time, she is heading to Dubai - and . believes that this is as important as the initial sell. But even once the car’s handed over, her job isn’t finished: 'Aftersales is key to ensuring customers keep coming back. 'You should call the next day to see if they’re enjoying it or have any questions.’ She explained: 'A child can sell a car once. We want to see them again. We have a Bentley customer from three years ago and we still call to see if they’re OK.' She’d like to see more female buyers, too. There are currently four female Veyron owners around the world – only one of whom is in the UK. When dealing with a customer she normally talks to them in the Jack Barclay boardroom, with its original walls and archive invoices from as early as 1928 – a 4.5-litre Bentley back then was £1,396. 'We like to show them things like this as they are normally car enthusiasts anyway,' she said. Even once they’ve taken delivery, owners can have their cars transported around the world. 'When our customer in Dubai comes to the UK for the summer, we’ll sort out getting his car here – and service it at the same time,' Miss Krizsan explained. And if any mechanical issues arise, Bugatti’s master technicians take over. ‘We call them the flying doctors,' she said. ‘There are four in the world, and they’ll fly to you if you have a problem.’ Miss Krizsan is hoping to beat her sales record in 2013 by hitting double figures.

"A grandmother used her mother's taxpayer-funded mobility car as a getaway vehicle for a career burglar. Rosemary Pollard used the Seat Leon, which was specially-adapted for her wheelchair-bound mother, to chauffeur career criminal Daryl Kennedy, 51, to 46 raids in villages across Cheshire. The 58-year-old was paid £100 each time she drove Kennedy to a home, where she would wait outside before driving him away. Getaway driver: 58-year-old Rosemary Pollard (left) used the Seat Leon, which was specially-adapted for her wheelchair-bound mother, to drive prolific burglar Daryl Kennedy (right) to and from 46 raids across Cheshire . On Christmas Eve last year, Pollard drove Kennedy to 14 homes, where he forced PVC windows and back doors to steal jewellery, laptops, tablets, watches and cash while she waited in the car outside. On another occasion she drove Kennedy to burgle the house of a family who were out visiting a dying relative in hospital. Pollard, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, leased the Seat Leon using her mother's £60-a-week disability allowance. She was arrested last January after a major investigation into the raids on a number of towns and villages. She was jailed for three and a half years at Chester Crown Court after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle. Judge Elgan Edwards, told her: 'This case fills any right thinking person with disgust. 'You involved yourself in many, many burglaries, sometimes a number in different areas in one day. 'You knew precisely what you were doing, you knew what you were being paid for. 'It is an unsettling feature that you used your mother’s mobility vehicle on these expeditions. Prison is inevitable. 'The fact that someone could recruit willing volunteers to ferry him from Manchester to all parts of Cheshire in order to break into domestic houses is disgusting.' Replacement: Pollard claimed she was only 'recruited as a volunteer' to transport Kennedy to the crime scenes after he  fell out with his two other drivers, Winston Bell, left, and Ajaz Ahmed, right, who were also jailed . Earlier, the court heard how Kennedy, nicknamed the 'Sydney Cat Burglar' due to a criminal past in Australia, was said to be the 'managing director’ of the crime gang which escaped with £250,000-worth of valuables over an eight-month period. He masterminded his 'professional enterprise' from a bail hostel in Salford, Greater Manchester, and meticulously researched properties to ensure they were empty before breaking in - often during the day - between April and December last year. He carried out 140 raids in total, including one in which an engagement ring was stolen from a couple just two weeks before their wedding day. 'It is a hallmark of Kennedy’s . professionalism as a burglar that he targeted unoccupied dwellings . during daylight hours, being careful to select houses where the . occupants were at work or on holiday' - Prosecutor Simon Parry . He was said to have gambled away the proceeds of his crimes away. Pollard was one of three drivers used by Kennedy. Victims were left living in fear as the professional criminal targeted multiple homes in the same street, breaking-into properties in villages close to the A556 main road while residents were at work, out shopping or on holiday. Prosecutor Simon Parry said: 'As well as targeting specific areas, that they would often return to burgle again and again. 'It is a hallmark of Kennedy’s professionalism as a burglar that he targeted unoccupied dwellings during daylight hours, being careful to select houses where the occupants were at work or on holiday.' Kennedy was caught on New Year’s Eve when a member of the public reported a black Audi parked suspiciously in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester. Officers found stolen cash, jewellery and laptops inside the vehicle. Pollard claimed she was only 'recruited as a volunteer' to transport the burglar to the crime scenes, after Kennedy fell out with his two other drivers, Winston Bell and Ajaz Ahmed. Her lawyer David Abbott said Pollard suffered from arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome and depression and recently had a heart bypass. Mr Abbott also said that Pollard was the main carer for her mother and helped her with everyday tasks in the bungalow they shared. Sentence: Rosemary Pollard was jailed for three and a half years at Chester Crown Court, pictured after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle. Kennedy was jailed for 10 years . He added: 'Kennedy didn’t actually tell her what he was intending. She accepts that she guessed and she turned a blind eye to it. She tells me she is disgusted with herself for having got involved in these matters. Kennedy was jailed for 10 years at an earlier hearing after admitting conspiracy to burgle between April and December 2013. Bell, 56, of Failsworth, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to four years, and Ahmed, 46, of Rochdale was sentenced to three years. Both pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to burgle. Supt Paul Williams of Cheshire Police who led the investigation said: 'This is a great result for the victims of these burglaries, to know that the people responsible for violating their homes and their privacy and causing them distress are being held to account.' 'It should also be reassuring for the people of Cheshire to know that that they are no longer free to commit these crimes and cause distress to anyone else. 'These people were responsible for a dramatic increase in the number of burglaries in homes across Cheshire and it was our priority to put a stop to their activities.'","Rosemary Pollard leased specially-adapted car for wheelchair-bound mother .

"A group of schoolboys were caught by police after they were pictured surfing on the back of a bus while wearing rollerskates. The five youngsters, all aged between 12 and 15, were stopped by officers after a shocked bystander took a picture of them hanging on to the back of the bus as it drove up a hill in Dudley, West Midlands. But instead of charging them after they admitted being carried or towed by a motor vehicle, officers thought of a more productive punishment - they made them clean up the local us depot. Dangerous: A group of five youngsters were spotted hitching a ride on the back of a bus on rollerskates . PC Reg Steele, from West Midlands Police, said: 'As this was a minor traffic offence it could have been dealt with in two ways, either through the courts where a fine could have been processed or a community resolution. 'We agreed with National Express West Midlands that a community resolution would be the best solution and would give the youngsters time to think about their reckless actions. As well as cleaning up the depot, the group will also have to clean National Express's fleet of West Midlands buses. Raj Mishra, National Express West Midlands Operations Manager said: 'We hope that by the youngsters working with us to clean our vehicles and spending time on site with us, it will help them understand the dangers of using vehicles to tow them along.' Police guidance suggests officers should use them only for low level offences in which no-one is hurt, or for anti-social behaviour. Punishment: The youngsters, who were filmed by a shocked passer by, were made to clean up a local bus depot and its buses by police . Earlier this year, a schoolboy nicknamed 'the Titch-hiker' was named and shamed by his parents and handed over to police after video footage emerged of him hitching a lift home on the tailbar of a 40-tonne lorry. Sonny Wilson, 12, was captured on film sitting on the back of the truck as it drove through Blackburn, Lancashire. His father David Wilson and mother Karen Brian both saw the footage on Facebook and called the police. Eventually when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind, who were filming him, a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street.","The group, aged between 12 and 15, were spotted in Dudley, West Midlands .

"CCTV images capture the moment a public-spirited van driver pulls over for police motorcyclists - only to face punishment for straying into a bus lane. Daniel Wiggins pulled in to allow five police motorcycle-riders to pass as he drove his Peugeot van through south-west London earlier this year. But he was left stunned when he was later told he would have to pay a fine of more than £500 for driving in a bus lane. CCTV images show the moment van driver Daniel Wiggins pulled in for a cavalcade of five police motorcyclists . The painter and decorator was left furious after his conscientious actions landed him with a huge fine . His shock turned to anger when CCTV images sent to him showed his van only entered the restricted lane as the bikes passed him on his right-hand side. The problem was made all the worse when he failed to receive the letter ordering him to pay the fine, meaning his vehicle was later clamped. He was left facing a £512 fine to prevent bailiffs towing the vehicle, money he had wanted to spend on a holiday. Mr Wiggins, of Surbition, south-west London, told The Sun: 'What was I supposed to do? Not let the police through? It's all a complete joke.' Kingston council originally told Mr Wiggins he was too late to appeal, but finally agreed to refund the fine after the pictures were published yesterday. Earlier this year, it emerged that drivers are now paying £135million a year to offences caught on spy cameras in bus lanes and box junctions. Motoring organisations say the figures - up nearly 20 per cent on the previous year - show councils are targeting drivers to balance their budgets. Mr Wiggins was keeping to the road before he spotted the police riders in his wing-mirror and pulled in . He was originally told he was too late to appeal the fine and even faced having his vehicle towed . The CCTV cameras spot those guilty of straying into bus lanes, blocking box junctions or committing other infringements. Penalties can be as high as £130 and only a tiny fraction are quashed on appeal. Sarah Rice of the RAC said of the figures: 'It really does look as though motorists are being used to raise revenue for cash-strapped councils. ‘Cameras need to be set up fairly and signed clearly so that drivers are not unduly punished for minor errors just to generate more money for the authorities. Motorists are generally law abiding and want to obey the rules.' London drivers bear the brunt of the fines and were penalised 850,000 times in 2012/13 compared with 797,000 the year before. Another blunder saw driver Jonathan Palgrave, of Lincolnshire, fined £60 for driving in a bus lane in Sheffield, a city he has never visited. The 32-year-old's kit car was accidentally mixed up with a council roadsweeper after authorities in the Yorkshire city confused a 'B' with an 'E'.","Daniel Wiggins allowed the cavalcade to pass him in south-west London .

"They were first to see the future king baby George, have their own coat of arms and have been known to travel to Cheltenham in a carriage in procession with the Queen. So perhaps it's no surprise that the Middleton family appears to have been invited to join the royals’ VIP lease scheme with luxury car brand Range Rover. The Duchess of Cambridge’s mother Carole, brother James and sister Pippa are reported to have all been given top-of-the-range 4x4s at heavily discounted lease rates in return for acting as unofficial ambassadors for the company. The news may well re-fuel accusations that the Middleton family is ‘cashing in’ on their daughter’s royal connections. Long-term customers: The Duchess of Cambridge's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, pictured in their Land Rover in 2010 . Soon after it was announced that Kate was pregnant, Carole and Michael Middleton started to promote a range of baby goods on their party supplies website. The ‘Little Prince’ and ‘Little Princess’ packs included paper plates decorated with a pink or blue crown and the words ‘a new little prince’ or ‘a new little princess’. Before this, Party Pieces - which Mrs Middleton started by making party bags around her kitchen table - offered paraphernalia themed around the Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Certain members of the Royal family are known to benefit from similar car lease schemes, where they pay a reduced fee in return for their custom. Last year it emerged that there was such . an arrangement with German car manufacturer Audi, which is understood . to have offered up to 60 per cent discount on their cars. Favourite brand: James Middleton can be seen in a new Range Rover driving his sister Pippa, father Michael and mother Carole to Prince George's Christening at St James's Palace in London last month . However, Range Rover now appear to have replaced their car of choice, with Prince William famously opting for a £140,000 model to drive Kate and their baby son George home from hospital. More recently, the Queen was seen driving around her Balmoral Scottish estate in one and the Duke of Edinburgh on a grouse shoot. Last month, James Middleton was seen driving his family in a brand new model to Prince George’s christening. Car companies fiercely guard the privacy of their customers and what rates they pay, but according to the Mail on Sunday, the Middletons have been leased their very own top models in exchange for reduced rates. VIP deals: The Duchess of Cambridge's sister Pippa and mother Carole are pictured in another Land Rover leaving their family home in Bucklebury in 2011 . A source said: ‘The Middletons’ Range Rovers have been leased to them as part of the VIP scheme. 'The idea is that you pay a small percentage of the usual fee in return for certain services - which can be as little as being seen driving around in the vehicle. Being associated with royalty does wonders for the brand.’ Exclusive lease schemes, which normally include services such as having cars personally delivered, have attracted criticism in the past for signing up celebrities who essentially advertise their cars by tweeting and writing blogs about them. A spokesman for Range Rover said: ‘We do not comment on our relationship with any of our customers.’ The Middleton family was not available for comment. Royal connections: The Middletons have been accused of 'cashing in' on their connection to the royal family through Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with her husband Prince William and son George shortly after his birth .","The Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole, brother James and sister Pippa are all said to have joined Range Rover's VIP lease scheme .

A disabled man used his 4mph electric wheelchair to smash up a Transit van because two workmen had parked it outside his house, a court heard. Kurt Baron, 40, caused £2,000 of damage to the vehicle's bodywork and narrowly missed a mother pushing a pram, forcing her and the baby into the road. He also deliberately crashed into . barriers round a manhole where the two Electricity North West engineers were working before threatening them with a claw hammer, Burnley Crown Court heard. Baron, who is wheelchair bound after breaking his back in a fall from a tree, admitted possessing an offensive weapon and criminal damage, but avoided jail. The prosecution said his wheelchair rampage happened on October 30 last year after he had a row with a blind friend in his house in Nelson, Lancashire. A window was smashed and his disabled companion fled the property complaining he had been attacked. Engineers Paul Jeeves and Brett Schofield were outside working on underground cables and Baron then emerged from his house and rammed the barriers round their manhole, yelling: 'I want that . f****** van moved now.' He was further enraged when the pair explained they were carrying out 'essential works', so he rammed three more barriers into the road, sending them towards oncoming vehicles. A woman pushing a pram had to move into the path of oncoming traffic to avoid being run down. Row: Baron drove into barriers surrounding a manhole on Regent Street in Nelson, Lancashire, forcing a mother and baby into the road . Baron then went back into his . house shouting 'You have got five minutes to move the van.' Upset: Baron had suffered mental health problems after he was left disabled after falling out of a tree, and was spared jail as a result . Mr . Jeeves decided to move the vehicle a . short distance away, but the defendant returned after five minutes and said: 'Right, I'm going to smash windows.' He then flew down the path towards them, wielding a hammer above his head, and rammed the passenger door of the van. Mr . Schofield took hold of him and told him to stop waving the hammer . around. After heading back towards the house he turned back towards the men, shouting: 'You big lad, I'm . going to wrap this hammer around your f****** head.' Lisa Worsley, prosecuting, said: 'He was aggressive, abusive and irate, was told to go . back in the house, headed to his front door, turned the chair to face . the van and threw the hammer at it.' The engineers then called the police and Baron told the engineers when asked to give a statement: ' You better tell the truth or else. Your names will get on the statements and I will find out who you . are, where you live and I will get you all.' The . court heard Baron had stabbed himself in the leg with a 12 inch knife . while in his house and he told the court  'Over the last five months, a . lot has changed. All I want is a normal life.' Sentencing: Baron told the judge at Burnley Crown Court (pictured): 'All I want is a normal life' as he was given a two year community order with supervision . Baron was given a two year community order, with supervision. The . judge Mr Recorder Anthony Cross, QC, told him : ' It's perfectly plain . to me that a significant amount of your problems arise from the fact you . fractured your spine when you fell out of a tree. 'That . has left you not only wheelchair-bound, but has caused you complex . health, social, psychological and mental health problems. I am satisfied . that it would be wholly wrong to jail you.'","Kurt Baron flew into rage after electrical workmen parked outside his home .

"A driver killed a university lecturer when he ploughed into him because he was distracted by the air fresheners and soft toys hanging from his rear view mirror, a court heard. Matthew Campbell, 27, struck Dr Nicholas Musgrove, of Walsall, as he walked to Wolverhampton University with such force he was sent hurtling through the air 'like a rag doll', jurors were told. Despite being rushed to hospital Dr Musgrove, 64, died later of the injuries following the collision which happened at 6.15am on December 20, 2012. Matthew Campbell, pictured outside Wolverhampton Crown Court, has denied one count of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. The case follows the death of university lecturer Dr Nicholas Musgrove in December 2012 . Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that Campbell had eight air fresheners, a pair of glasses, a soft toy and a key ring hanging from the mirror of his black Mazda 2. Campbell has denied one count of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. Nicholas Tatlow, prosecuting, told the court there were a 'number of factors' that could have caused the crash. He said: 'From his rear view mirror the defendant had hanging no fewer than eight car air fresheners, a pair of glasses, a soft toy and a key ring. 'That bundle of objects from his rear view mirror would have formed a partial obstruction when he was looking ahead and to the left. 'Of course, ahead and to the left is where Dr Musgrove was to be found.' He added that Campbell, of Wolverhampton, should have seen Dr Musgrove as he crossed the road at the junction of Stafford Street and the Wolverhampton ring road, but there was no suggestion he was speeding or had run a red light.

"A rugby player has described the 'tackle of his life' as he took down a thief who stole his wife's purse from the back of his car. Richard Kenyon, 33, was dressed in just his pyjamas when he chased after the thief while on holiday at the Low Briery Holiday Village in Keswick, Cumbria. Describing how he chased after the man for about half a mile, the semi-professional player for Fylde and Lancashire rugby club said: 'It was the tackle of my life, perfect technique, perfect timing. And his unlucky day.' Hero: Richard Kenyon managed to catch the thief prowling through his Range Rover at a caravan park by sprinting after him for half a mile without any shoes on . Scene of the crime: The Low Briery Holiday Village in Cumbria where the Kenyon family were on holiday for the weekend . His wife Johanna Kenyon woke up at 6.30am on Sunday to feed their eight-month-old son, Charlie, when she spotted the man rummaging through the family Range Rover. She woke her husband and he leaped from the bed before running uphill, along a disused railway track, along a footpath, by the side of a river, over a fence and into a forest while barefoot. Mission accomplished: Mr Kenyon managed to frogmarch the thief back to the caravan site, where police arrested him . Mr Kenyon, joint managing director at Dewlay Cheesemakers of Garstang in Preston, said: 'The guy had a 120-metre start on me but my instincts were to protect my family and belongings. 'The adrenaline kicked in and I wasn't going to stand by and let this happen.' 'He turned on to a dirt track in a vain attempt to get away but I closed him down, he turned around and I could see the fear in his eyes. 'This was only going to end one way and he knew it. I think he realised I was a bit bigger than him.' 'I executed a textbook rugby tackle and brought him to the ground. It was the best tackle I have ever made. 'I escorted him back to the caravan and the police arrived and arrested him.' Richard, who has played rugby for 14 years, said his wife's purse, which the man had tossed into the river, was recovered. The 14 stone fly-half is now the toast of Fylde Rugby Club where his teammates have nicknamed him 'superhero'.

"It has raked in a staggering £800,000 in fines in just six months and flashes an average of 71 motorists every single day - making this speed camera in Cardiff every driver's worst nightmare. The device, located on Newport Road in the Welsh capital, has become the most lucrative speed camera in the UK and has already caught an astonishing 13,624 drivers this year. The shady title was previously held by a camera at Junction 25 on the M60 in Greater Manchester which caught 26 speeding drivers per day. Scroll down for video . 'Cash cow': The hugely unpopular speed camera, on Newport Road in Cardiff, has raked in a staggering £800,000 in fines in just six months . Catching 71 motorists a day - the device in Wales almost trebles the total achieved by its predecessor. The data comes from research conducted by LV insurance, who have also revealed that in 2013 speed cameras cost British motorists £22million in fines. The new speed trap on a busy junction in Cardiff was at the centre of a storm yesterday - with drivers calling it 'nothing but a cash cow'. Motorists have been left angered by the speed camera after road chiefs hailed it a massive success. Mother-of-three Karen Leyshon, who was caught going at 34mph through the speed trap, said: 'It's is ridiculous - I've been driving on that road every days for years without any problem whatsoever until this camera was put up. 'It is nothing but a cash cow. It's outrageous, the camera does nothing to improve safety of this road. It may be a busy stretch but it's perfectly safe. Driving trap: The device, which catches an average of 71 motorists every day, has been met with outrage by drivers who claim that it does nothing to improve the safety of the road . 'I didn't notice the camera going up, I got caught doing 34mph and I had to pay £85 for a speed awareness course. 'It was a complete waste of my time and money - I'm sure that most of the other 13,000 people would tell you exactly the same thing.' The camera has been in place since 2012 but it has only just became 'fully commissioned' catching thousands of motorists in the first six months of this year. According to the latest statistics, the cameras generated 13,624 penalty notices for speeding and 146 for red-light offences. And in February there were more than 100 tickets issued, on average, each day. UK's worst: The camera has taken the title of 'Britain's most lucrative speed camera' after its activity was monitored for six months - the previous holder was located on junction 25 of the M60 in Greater Manchester . In the first half of the year 5,906 people completed speed awareness courses after being caught speeding at the junction. A further 3,064 people paid speeding fines in the same six months. Figures show that with a minimum fine of £100 and a typical cost of £85 per place on speed awareness courses, the camera could have netted an astonishing £808,410. Research by LV insurance has revealed that a speed camera installed on Newport Road in Cardiff has detected 13, 624 speeding drivers this year and raked in a staggering £800,000 in fines in six months. Here are three other prolific UK speed cameras: . The GoSafe partnership, which operates Wales' road safety cameras, say the area has a high flow of traffic and motorists should always comply with the speed limit. But road safety groups have said the camera is not doing it's job properly and should be there to reduce speeds rather than bring in money. Tim Shallcross, from the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'The whole purpose of speed cameras is to slow people down, because it's felt that excessive speed in that area causes casualties. 'If a camera is issuing a small number of fines, or none at all, it's doing its job. If it's ticketing that many people, it's not having that effect. 'The local authority, which is responsible for road safety, should be looking at those figures and saying, 'We seem to have an issue here - the camera is catching a lot of people. 'Let's make sure that it looks like a 30mph highway, and that the cameras are clearly visible and the signs aren't obscured by vegetation'.' A spokesman for Cardiff council said: 'The speed camera in question does not have advance signs in place alerting drivers, as this is not a legal requirement. Although this camera has been in place for some time, due to maintenance issues it has not been operational. The Council is alarmed at the number of tickets generated since the camera has been working and would urge drivers to reduce their speed for the safety of other road users, or face the consequences. The Council is committed to working with the South Wales Police through the GoSafe Partnership and speed cameras have and will continue to play an important role to improve road safety for those using Cardiff’s highways. A recent example is the 20mph zones which are operational in Cathays and Plasnewydd to improve public safety, encourage walking and alternate forms of transport.'","Device, on city's Newport Road, only became fully operational at start of 2014 .

"The Caterham Formula One team have made 230 staff redundant while still planning to race in next weekend's Abu Dhabi season-ender, an administrator said on Sunday. Finbarr O'Connell told Reuters that the team, who went into administration last month, would take 40 people to the Yas Marina circuit with their expenses paid with money raised through a crowd-funding initiative. Caterham raised £1.92 million of a targeted £2.35 million by last Friday, with the deadline reset to midnight on Sunday week, but still face an uncertain future. The cash-strapped team claim they will now compete at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi . Swedish driver Marcus Ericsson recently terminated his contract with financially stricken Caterham . O'Connell said the redundancies had come at the request of a majority of the staff who had wanted to start a formal claims process that takes at least a month before any payments are made, if the team is not sold. 'We are going to Abu Dhabi, racing and talking to potential buyers with meetings already arranged out there,"" he said. 'The second track is that at the same time the claims forms will be up and running. 'A best outcome could be for staff to get redundancy, arrears of pay and then if someone comes along (and buys the team) they would get paid again,' he said. Cash-strapped Caterham went into administration in October and are fighting to make the Abu Dhabi GP . O'Connell acknowledged he was in a 'race against time' but there were four or five interested parties with the necessary funds, including one that would be a 'phenomenal opportunity' if it happened. The staff at the Leafield factory in central England have not been paid since the end of September and have worked without pay for the past seven weeks in a bid to keep the team alive. Rivals Marussia, who also went into administration last month, have ceased trading with some 200 staff made redundant. Both teams missed the last U.S. and Brazilian Grands Prix, leaving a grid of just nine teams and 18 cars. O'Connell said he had first discussed redundancy with the Caterham staff last month after they were 'effectively abandoned' by entry holders 1MRT, founded by Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes. 'They were very supportive but asked would I agree, if the team was not sold by Friday, to organise them to be made redundant,"" he added. The administrator said only about 17 of the 230 had not wanted to be made redundant and they were not members of the race team.

"Sentencing: Christopher Brassington arriving at Leeds Crown Court yesterday . A father crashed a pick-up truck into an Italian restaurant after finding out the owner was in a  relationship with his former lover, a court heard. Christopher Brassington, 39, was more than twice the drink-drive limit when he drove a friend’s vehicle through the restaurant window at speed, sending tables and chairs flying. He then turned the 4x4 around inside the restaurant and tried to drive back out. When police arrived, Brassington, who was banned from driving at the time, was still behind the wheel and had to be pulled out through the window. His lawyer described it as a scene from a Quentin Tarantino film. Brassington caused £120,000 of damage to the restaurant, which was closed at the time. A former multi-millionaire, he turned to drink after seeing his property empire crash, Leeds Crown Court was told. The defendant had spent the evening of the rampage in January drinking with former business partner Nigel Coxan in a pub in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Matthew Harding, prosecuting, said the two men began discussing Brassington’s former long-term girlfriend and her new relationship with Glyn Margrave, the owner of Rinaldis restaurant in Wakefield. ‘They were speaking about relationships and Mr Coxan said the mother of the defendant’s children was having a relationship with an individual who owned Rinaldis,’ said Mr Harding. ‘He thought he [Brassington] was aware of the relationship but the defendant appeared surprised.’ They left the pub at 11pm and although they had arrived in Mr Coxan’s Toyota pick-up, they had intended to find alternative transport home as both had drunk six pints of lager, the court was told. But Brassington took the keys from his friend and began driving, with Mr Coxan in the passenger seat pleading with him to stop. He drove down the M1 and ended up outside Rinaldis restaurant, which was in darkness. The defendant revved the car five times, said ‘I’m sorry’ and accelerated through the restaurant window. Mr Harding said: ‘Both men were screaming as glass was shattering and tables and chairs were being scattered.’ The property developer flew into a jealous rage after consuming six pints of lager and learning the owner of Rinaldi's is Wakefield was having an affair with his wife . Brassington muttered the words 'I'm sorry' to friend Nigel Coxon, who was sitting in the passenger seat, before accelerating towards the window as both men screamed . The truck went 15ft inside before . coming to rest against a pillar, which supported the ceiling.  An alarm . went off and Brassington stayed in the driver’s seat, hitting the . accelerator and spinning  the wheels. ‘Staff at a nearby supermarket saw him trying to do a three-point turn to get out of the premises,’ said Mr Harding. When . police arrived Brassington was still spinning the wheels, but he turned . off the engine and threw his arms up as if to hand himself over. Mr . Margrave later told police he knew Brassington and recalled an incident . some years previously where the defendant told him: ‘We will sort . matters out man to man.’ But he had not taken the threat seriously, said Mr Harding. The owner of Rinaldi's restaurant in Wakefield, Glyn Margrave estimated the repair bill totalled more than £120,000 - to cover damages and a loss of earnings . Brassington, driving his friend's pick-up truck, reversed at speed embedding the vehicle around five metres inside the building . The truck only came to a stop when it smashed into a pillar supporting the ceiling . Owner of Rinaldi's, Mr Margrave, had to close the restaurant for a week to allow for the repairs to be carried out . When . interviewed by police, Brassington, of Huddersfield, said he could not . remember the incident. He admitted drink-driving, dangerous driving, . criminal damage, driving whilst disqualified and driving without . insurance. Judge Shaun . Spencer deferred sentence for six months to see how Brassington . responded to medical treatment for his personal problems. The judge told Brassington he was clearly ‘upset’ about the other man ‘pursuing a relationship with your former partner’. ‘It . is quite clear to me that the commission of these offences was . motivated by malice,’ said Judge Spencer. ‘It had its roots in your . manic condition at the time and was also fuelled by alcohol.’ Brassington, left, said psychological treatment he was receiving, including electric shock therapy meant he had suffered memory loss. Right, his former home in Huddersfield . Jonathan . Walker, defending, said Brassington built up a property business worth . millions in his 20s and 30s before having a breakdown in 2007. Since . then he has been suffering from bi-polar disorder, depression and has a . drink problem. He was convicted of drink-driving in 2001 and 2011. Commenting on the incident, Mr Walker said it was ‘a moment of madness’. ‘The . couple split up a number of years earlier and hadn’t seen one another . for some considerable time,’ he said. He claimed it was not the . ‘hot-headed actions of someone seeking revenge’. ‘This was a bizarre, freakish scene which seems to have been taken from a Quentin Tarantino movie,’ said Mr Walker.","Christopher Brassington drank six pints with friend before the crash .

It's literally gone on the drive, up the drive and straight through the front door. The only thing it hasn't done is ring the doorbell.’ Fire crews also turned off the house's gas and electricity supplies as a precaution. The circumstances of how the car came to end up crashing into the house are not yet known.

"A short-sighted hunter who allegedly shot a motorist dead and wounded his passenger after mistaking their car for a wild boar could face five years in jail. Zbigniew Kowalski, 60, from Leczyca, in Poland, spotted the car, which was being driven by Josef Kuchar, while out hunting in a nearby forest. Mistaking the vehicle for a wild boar, he let off a number of shots, allegedly hitting Mr Kuchar, 23, in the neck and Lukasz Nowakowski, 21, who survived the incident, in the chest. Police have confirmed Zbigniew Kowalski will be charged with manslaughter after he allegedly shot a driver dead and wounded his passenger when he mistook their car for a wild boar .

Mr Kuchar, who later died from his injuries, managed to drive the pair to his home where his parents called for an ambulance. Prosecutor Krzystof Kopania said: 'The two men were wounded, but the driver Josef Kuchar, who later died, managed to drive them both to his home where his parents immediately called an ambulance. 'But by the time he got to hospital it was too late. 'We identified the hunter, he was immediately detained and he confirmed that he had mistakenly shot at the car. Kowalski later said he had not called police because he had seen the car drive off and assumed he had missed the vehicle. Pictured is the scene of the incident . 'He realised his mistake when the ""wild boar"" started its engine and drove off, but because whoever had driven off had clearly been alive he assumed he had missed the vehicle.'

"A Lotus Formula One car raced by British driver Graham Hill is set to fetch up to £1million at auction. The Lotus 49B Grand Prix car was also raced by fellow world champions Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Emerson Fittipaldi. Designed by Lotus legend Colin Chapman and built in 1968, the iconic car is one of only a handful of 49s still in existence. Classics: The car is expected to fetch as much as £1million at auction . Restored: The car was badly damaged in the 1970s, but was restored by previous owner John Dawson-Damer . Champion: The car was raced by Formula One legend Graham Hill . It is the last Lotus to be sold from the collection of late British racer John Dawson-Damer. Dawson-Damer tragically died when he crashed his 1969 Lotus 63 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2000. The car is expected to draw interest from collectors at the Bonhams’ sale at the same Goodwood festival in June. James Knight, Bonhams group motoring director, said: 'By every standard, Colin Chapman’s Lotus 49 concept is an absolute landmark in Formula One design. 'It simply raised the bar for every rival manufacturer and its Cosworth-Ford V8 engine went on to win a record 155 world championship Grands Prix. Champions: The classic car, seen driven by Hill, back, has also had champions Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Emerson Fittipaldi in the driver's seat . Ahead of the pack: Graham Hill and Jackie Oliver are here shown leading the pack in their Lotuses . 'This car was Graham Hill’s but it was also raced by that wonderful driver Richard Attwood to set the fastest lap at Monaco in 1969. 'And private owner Dave Charlton drove it to become South African national champion. 'Add the excellent provenance of it being offered direct from the famous Dawson-Damer collection and plainly it is an iconic car.' The Lotus 49 was a new high for Formula One performance, winning its debut race at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix with Jim Clark at the wheel. Hill won his second Formula One world championship title in 1968 for Gold Leaf Team Lotus in the improved 49B type. After ending its racing days in South Africa in 1972, the car was badly damaged by the time it was bought by Dawson-Damer. He painstakingly restored it to race-worthy condition. Dawson-Damer’s six other Lotus Formula One cars sold in a Sydney auction for a total of £1.2million in 2008. His 1963 Lotus-Climax 25 driven by Clark went to an Australian collector for a then world record £590,000. And his 1978-79 Lotus-Ford 79 driven by American Formula One world champion Mario Andretti went to a Japanese Lotus enthusiast for £220,000. The auction in Chichester, West Sussex takes place on June 27.","Lotus 49B Grand Prix car will go under the hammer at Goodwood Festival .

"More than 30 years old and with 13,000 miles on the clock this little old Fiat would normally fetch around £6,000. But this pint-sized classic commanded more than three times its market value after sparking a bidding war at auction. The reason for it's more sizeable fee? - it was once owned by David Cameron. Fiat for a king: The pint-sized Fiat 500 was once good enough for the PM, and having him as a famous former owner ensured it went for a large fee at auction . Bought by the PM as a birthday present for his wife Samantha, the pair are believed to have put 1,000 miles on the vintage Italian car. With trips around the idyllic Cotswolds they held onto the 1971 Italian car for the best part of 10 years having acquired it in 1998. Despite its famous former owner it was still only expected to go for around £2,000 more than its usual price when it went up for sale at Silverstone Auctions at the Footman James Classic Motor Show at the NEC on Saturday. But a bidding war broke out with the winner paying £18,150 for the car. Iconic: The Italian classic went for three times its market value as it fetched £18,150 . Birthday present: David Cameron bought the 1971 Fiat for his wife Samantha in 1998 . Will Smith, from Silverstone Auctions, said: 'We’re delighted with the sale and the lady who owned it is over the moon too - it goes to show what a famous owner can do for the price of a classic car. 'There were two main bidders, one in the room and one on the phone and they wouldn’t stop bidding - they both really wanted the car.' Mr Smith revealed the winning bid eventually came over the phone from a Brit who would be adding the little Fiat to his private collection. Fiat built the 500 between 1957 and 1975 with the humble vehicle one the most iconic and unmistakable cars of the 20th century. Surprise present: Mr Cameron bought the car as a surprise birthday present for wife Samantha in 1998 . With a tiny 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the Fiat 500 epitomises chic, working class motoring and is a far cry  from the Jaguar XJ David Cameron is ferried around in on a day-to-day basis. This original right-hand drive Fiat 500 L was first registered on 20th August 1971 in Warwickshire and has covered what is believed to be a genuine 13,000 miles from new. Cotswold taxi driver Tim Ashby wrote a letter to David Cameron in 2008 after he took him home one evening, offering to buy the Fiat. The small Fiat is a far cry from the cars the PM is more used to now with him more likely to be seen in a chauffeur driven Jaguar . The then future MP duly obliged, selling the little car for just £1,000 with Mr Ashby describing Cameron as a 'lovely man to deal with'. It was later restored before its current owner bought it from Mr Ashby after he ran out of space. Nick Whale, managing director, Silverstone Auctions, added: 'No matter what your political persuasion, this is one cool car.'","The Fiat 500 would normally fetch £6,000, but went for more than £18,000 .

"The use of CCTV spy cars that issue parking fines will be severely restricted to stop their widespread abuse, the road safety minister has promised. Robert Goodwill said profits from parking penalties had more than doubled from £223million to £512million between 1998 and 2011 – and are expected to rise to £635million in 2014. During that time many councils have started using mobile CCTV spy cars in addition to traditional parking wardens. Money spinners: Road safety minister Robert Goodwill said a recent Transport Select Committee revealed some councils have been using CCTV cars for parking enforcement as 'a matter of routine' There was now a ‘deeply rooted public perception’ that local authorities view parking enforcement as a cash cow to boost their coffers Mr Goodwill warned. CCTV would in future be limited to areas around schools, in bus lanes, at bus stops and on red ‘no stop’ routes, he said. Speaking at the annual Parkex exhibition in London, Mr Goodwill said a recent Transport Select Committee revealed some councils have been using CCTV for parking enforcement as ‘a matter of routine’. He said: ‘That is not acceptable. The surveillance camera code of practice has long been clear that CCTV should be used sparingly and only where other means of enforcement are unpractical. ‘What is essential is that the public have confidence that where CCTV is being used it is to promote safety and to tackle congestion. Nothing else.’ Mr Goodwill said his aim was to put an end to practices that ‘offend a sense of natural justice’. 'Offence to a sense of natural justice': Robert Goodwill said profits from parking penalties had more than doubled between 1998 and 2011 . Above all there must be fair enforcement, he said: ‘The use of CCTV, in particular, causes public concern. But so does the perception that enforcement officers are waiting to pounce the moment the meter runs out. ‘Motorists should not be fearful about returning to their vehicles a few minutes late. Indeed, in most cases, drivers return with unexpired time left and the council can then re-sell the space and, in effect, be paid double.’ Mr Goodwill noted how the Transport Select committee had concluded  that the current appeals system disadvantaged people who had ‘inadvertently make a mistake.’ He added: ‘Their sense was that the current system discourages people from appealing their tickets. ‘People who have a legitimate reason not to pay are simply giving up and paying the fine. That offends a sense of natural justice.’ Mr Goodwill said he wanted to give parking bosses ‘a flavour of our thinking’ ahead of announcing new rules soon in a new shake-up. But the AA yesterday warned the abuse of CCTV could continue if it was only curtailed rather than banned. AA President Edmund King said : ‘Motorists will still have concerns about CCTV cars, even if their use is curtailed. ‘But we welcome a decent grace period to protect drivers who otherwise get unfairly fined if their watch is two minutes out of synch with the town hall clock.’","CCTV will be limited to schools, bus lanes, bus stops and red routes .

"Keith Baldock has been banned from the roads after clocking up 54 points on his driving licence . A driver who was allowed to stay on the roads despite clocking up 54 penalty points has finally been banned by a judge who admitted he has been 'lucky'. Keith Baldock was believed to be the only driver in the UK to be 'legally' on the road despite having more than 50 penalty points on his licence. The legal limit is 12 points, but a series of court mistakes allowed the 34-year-old, who lost his job as a tyre fitter two years ago, to keep driving. The father-of-two, of Westgate-on-Sea in Kent, has a string of offences to his name, including a one-year ban in 2010 for driving over the limit and and a 12-month supervision order for admitting stealing petrol worth £500 from a string of garages last year. In November last year, Baldock was handed 30 points - six points for five separate offences - after being convicted of driving a car with no insurance and stealing fuel. Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl, however, was unaware at the time of the previous 24 points already on his licence and Baldock was allowed to keep driving after convincing the judge he needed a car to find a job. But yesterday he was finally banned from the roads for three years after appearing at Canterbury Crown Court in front of the same judge. The judge 're-opened sentencing options' on the case and banned Baldock from the road for three years - as well as jailing him for 18 months after he admitted breaching a suspended sentence and possession of a knife. At the hearing in November, the court heard how Baldock was caught five times driving without insurance on July 14, July 20, August 3, August 10, and August 28 last year - charges he admitted. He also admitted filling up with . petrol in garages on four occasions - July 14, July 20, August 3, August . 10 - and speeding off without paying, stealing fuel worth £483. He . was given a 12-month supervision order, put under curfew between 7pm . and 7am and ordered to repay the £483 to the garages he stole petrol . from. The court heard how . Baldock was arrested in February this year for breaching his supervision . order and curfew after being caught with a knife during a spat with a . man at a caravan park. The judge took the opportunity to ban him from the roads. Baldock, was, prior to his ban, thought to be the only driver with more than 50 penalty points, still on the roads. Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl (left) banned Baldock (right) from the roads for three years at Canterbury Crown Court . Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl told the court that Baldock had a 'head in the sand mentality' and that he 'hoped the court order (against him) would be forgotten about'. In February this year, prosecutors tried and failed to get Baldock banned after it was found that Baldock already had 24 points on his licence before his appearance in court in November last year. But because the law states any variation in 'the substance of a sentence' must be made within 56 days, it was 'too late' to change the sentence he received at the time. Prosecutor Francis Lloyd told Canterbury Crown Court in February: 'At the earlier hearing he was not disqualified, but in fact he should have been unless there was exceptional hardship. 'Unfortunately there is not a great deal we can do about it now - he's a lucky fellow.' Judge Van Der Bijl replied: 'A lucky man indeed. Case closed.'","Keith Baldock was banned for three years at Canterbury Crown Court .

"Jailed: Joshua Sadler, 21, was sentenced to 12 months after admitting dangerous driving . The mother of a teenager who was killed when a friend crashed his car just four days after passing his test has spoken of her shock after the driver was jailed for only 12 months.

Sadler had previously been convicted of a . string of serious motoring offences and twice banned from the road . before he even had a licence. He was seen on the night of the fatal crash performing handbrake turns and showing off in a car park. Sadler . pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced . to 12 months in jail and banned him from driving for five years. Afterwards Mr Maguire’s mother Allison Jarman, 43, described the sentence as an ‘insult’. She said: 'When I was in court my head was in my hands and at one point I couldn’t even listen to what was happening. 'I . expected the sentence to be low because I have been doing a lot of . research online but when I heard it was 12 months it felt like a slap in . the face. 'Nothing can . bring Mikey back but 12 months for my son’s life is shocking. I was . absolutely speechless, he will be out in three months.

'He . had always been a bit of a troublemaker and had previous convictions . for driving offences. I always said he would end up hurting someone one . day, I just didn’t expect it to be my son.' The fatal crash happened on Huntick Road, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, Dorset, on February 8 last year. Sadler, from Poole, lost control of his . car on a bend before it ploughed down a grass bank and struck the tree. Mr Maguire was pronounced dead at the scene. Victim: Mikey Maguire pictured on on holiday with his mother Allison, who described the sentence as an 'insult' to her son's memory . Sadler had previously been disqualified from driving after being convicted of two counts of aggravated vehicle taking. He appeared in court for one of the counts and driving without a licence and insurance in July 2010. In both incidents he lost control and caused more than £5,000 damage to one of the vehicles. Les Smith, defending, read out a statement from Sadler to Bournemouth Crown Court in which he expressed ‘regret and sorrow’ for the Mr Maguire’s death. He added: 'The incident haunts me every day and will do for the rest of my life. Nothing that is said or done to me can make me feel any worse.' As well as being jailed Sadler was disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended test at the end of the ban.","Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control on 60mph country road and hit a tree .

"A couple have died from carbon monoxide poisoning after being overcome by the fumes while having sex in a car with the engine running. Keith Payton and Salina Johnson, both 40, of Pennsylvania, were already dead when emergency services found them inside the vehicle in a garage. The ignition was still on but the car had run out of fuel. Extremely high levels of carbon monoxide were detected. Deadly: Police believe the amorous couple were overcome by a toxic build up of fumes from their exhaust (Stock picture) Police believe the couple had pulled over for sex because Ms Johnson was partially clothed when they were found, The Patriot News reported. Marijuana and drug paraphernalia were found in the car, according to Old Lycoming Township police. A kerosene heater also was on but it had also run out of fuel. The couple, of Allenwood and Williamsport, were pronounced dead at 10.45 p.m. Friday, but police said they had died sometime earlier. But it is thought the pair may have driven into the garage the previous evening. Coroner Charles Kiessling was called to the scene inside a garage on Blooming Grove Road. He says blood tests show 'extremely elevated' levels of carbon monoxide in the victims' bodies, according to PA Homepage. The two were discovered by an family friend sent by Payton’s brother, who leased the garage, to look for Payton, police said. It is understood Mr Payton had gone to the garage to drop off something for his brother on Thursday. This tragedy bears similarities with an incident last month in which a young couple are believed to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning after parking their car in a garage for some 'hanky panky'.

Jorge Rodriguez, 24, were found three weeks after they mysteriously . disappeared on their way to a romantic break to celebrate their . anniversary at a Pennsylvania bed and breakfast on December 27. But . they never checked into their hotel. They had vanished. But there was . no reason to suspect they eloped, they were not in trouble and neither . was their any reason why they would be driven to suicide. Detectives descended on garage number 55 inside the Wayne Village Apartment complex in New Jersey. Accident: It is feared Melissa Pereira and Jorge Rodriguez died of carbon monoxide poisoning when parked in a garage with their engine running . Inside the 10-by-12-foot structure were the lovers’ lifeless bodies slumped over the front seats of Rodrigeuz’s white Honda Prelude, the gas tank empty, the battery dead. Pereira’s uncle Sham Bacchus told MailOnline he suspects the couple retreated to the garage for a little fun. ‘They’re kids,’ he said. ‘They might have wanted some quiet time together’, but added that when their bodies were found 'they had their clothes on'. There they they may have become overwhelmed by odorless carbon monoxide fumes after turning on the car to keep warm with the garage door shut.","Keith Payton and Salina Johnson, both 40, were overcome by toxic fumes .

"With its rotting bodywork, rusty wheels and gathering of mould, it may not be a shining example of Ferrari's first ever four-seater.

Rob Hubbard, senior car specialist at . auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'It was brought back from America by the . owners in the late 1980s. It was put away in the garage and it was never . used again. 'This will appeal to somebody who wants to put a bit of work into it. 'If they do it will be worth about three times as much.

Originally Ferraris were designed with two seats only but by the end of the 1950s the market for sports cars which could accommodate families had grown. In response to that demand Ferrari introduced four seats with its 250GTE 2+2 model before bringing out the 330GT with a four-litre V12 engine in 1964. The rusty Ferrari was originally sold in .

But Mr Smith, 46, who has now been described as ‘Britain’s dumbest motorist’, was caught in the act by another camera nearby which led police directly to his door. And that was not the end of the nightclub doorman’s plight. When police arrived at his home, they found he was guilty of a second, equally serious crime. To their amazement they discovered Mr Smith was also keeping a secret cannabis farm in his basement. The bungling motorist had inadvertently alerted police to two crimes in his unsuccessful attempt to destroy evidence of another. And to make matters worse, it later emerged that he in fact would likely not have received any points on his license and therefore wouldn’t have faced a driving ban as he thought. He has now been sentenced to two years in prison at Lincoln Crown Court after admitting arson and producing cannabis and possessing the drug with intent to supply. Mr Smith, from Shireoaks in Nottinghamshire, believed he already had six penalty points on his licence, was caught speeding on the A57 near Dunham Bridge, in Lincolnshire, on 21 February, as he made his way to work. That evening he convinced himself he would receive another six points on his licence and would therefore no longer be able to drive. Around 36 hours after he was caught - 8mph over the 60mph limit - he placed several tyres underneath the camera with an accelerant, set them alight and destroyed the camera. The heat from the burning tyres caused £12,000 worth of damage to the infrastructure of the camera and police spent a further £12,000 on installing a replacement. Smith set fire to the camera because he wrongly feared he would be banned from driving if he took the points . Jonathon Dee, prosecuting, said that Mr Smith only realised the futility of the arson attack during a police interview following his arrest. Mr Dee said: ‘He made full admissions describing it as something he had done in panic. When he was told he would not have lost his licence you can almost audibly hear the sense of self-reproach and the realisation that he had done something stupid.’ Martin Keys, defending, admitted: ‘He has not really got an excuse for damaging the camera other than that he was stupid and acted on the spur of the moment. Police found £35,000 worth of cannabis growing in Smith's basement. File photo . 'He was always going to get caught. He has always been very remorseful. From the start he has always apologised. 'He did something very serious and now he is paying the price.’ Mr Smith’s commercial drug operation was capable of producing 3.5kgs of cannabis worth around £35,000 when sold on the streets. Judge Sean Morris told him: ‘You are not the first person to stand before me for setting fire to a speed camera. People need to know that anyone who does that will go to prison. ‘These speed cameras save lives. They moderate people’s driving. This county has the worst roads in England for death and serious injury. That is why we have so many speed cameras. 'People who set fire to speed cameras must realise the consequences are a hundred times worse than taking the fine. A custodial sentence is inevitable.’ John Siddle of the Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership said: ‘These things are always done in a moment of madness and people think they will not get caught. 'The reality is that when a camera is attacked we will always pursue those responsible and we will catch them.’","Nightclub doorman Adrian Smith caught by speed camera in February .

"A millionaire property developer was killed when the £500,000 Italian supercar he was driving careered off the road and ploughed into a fence. William Baranos, who was in his 50s, is believed to have been driving at high speed in a 30mph zone when he lost control of the Pagani Zonda. The front end of the car was torn off when it hit a metal fence running along the perimeter of a building supplies depot. Wrecked: The remains of the Pagani Zonda William Baranos was driving. He was not thought to have been wearing a seat belt . His body was found 10ft away, after the . car’s doors were ripped off. He was not thought to have been wearing a . seat belt. A passenger in his 20s, believed to be a friend of the . family, walked away from the wreckage, on a main road in Watford, with . minor injuries. Residents described hearing revving, . followed by a screech then a ‘massive bang’ when the accident happened . at around 6pm on Sunday. The fence remained flat on the ground yesterday with fragments of the car’s bodywork scattered around. The 7.3-litre engine car was one of . just a few hundred made between 1999 and 2011 by  Italian firm Pagani in . Modena, and was capable of more than 200mph. Some models sell for up to . £1.3million.

Wife Mirjana McKenzie at their home in Hertfordshire last year . A family friend who answered the door . said: ‘She is absolutely devastated. It’s a terrible thing to have . happened.’ A witness said he had seen the car driving along the same . road at high speed the previous day. ‘It would come up towards the . roundabout at breakneck speeds and brake hard, go round the roundabout . and then fly back the other way,’ he said. ‘Then [on Sunday night] it . was back again but this time it screeched and we heard a massive bang. It seemed to me that the driver had been showing off. ‘The younger person who survived was the driver’s son’s best friend and he must have been showing him the car’s power.’ A local homeowner added: ‘I heard the high revving and then a massive crash. ‘I came out to see the Zonda in bits in the middle of the road. ‘The front of the car had disappeared, the doors were off and there wasn’t much of it left. ‘The car did what it was supposed to because the chassis was still intact. ‘I’m speculating but the driver must not have been wearing a seat belt because the passenger was and he was fine.’ Mr and Mrs Baranos bought their 6,000 . sq ft wing of the 19th century Wall Hall Mansion ‘as a shell’ in 2009 . for £2.3million, and lavished a further £400,000 on it.

"Top Gear presenter James May has blamed social networking sites for ruining surprises on the show - and says they could spell the end for privacy. The host - dubbed Captain Slow by fellow stars Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond - says that any filming the 'three morons' do in a public place is now immediately filmed or photographed by the public and then posted online. The 49-year-old said that fans post the footage on sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube and ruin any surprises for the viewers. Scroll down for video . The Top Gear presenters, pictured here in the Syrian Desert, are constantly having their surprises ruined by people posting 'spoilers' on social networking sites . James May (right) argues that privacy may become a thing of the past as social media means everything can be shared - regardless of whether you want it to be . And he predicted a time when they will no longer even need film crews because there will be so much pooled footage available on the internet that fans will be able to make their own versions of the BBC2 show. Writing in the current Top Gear magazine he says that previously, people would have had to physically pass an image or video around - but now it was possible to let the entire world see a photo through the powers of posting online. He said: 'These days, it's quite . difficult to surprise you on the telly, because everything we do in any . vaguely public place is immediately filmed, photographed or noted and . then exposed on Twitbook and FaceTube.' May predicted a time where members of the public would be so adept with social media and videos, that they would make the show . Top Gear is the product of an army of experts, but the presenter fears that its surprises are scuppered by people eager to share their filming footage on the internet . He said 'spoilers' that people post are . usually grainy and unprofessional, and highlight how much work and . effort goes into turning the presenters' antics into 'a vaguely . watchable TV programme'. He praised directors, cameramen, sound recordists, editors, producers and experts for creating the 'magic' of the car show. But he claimed soon people would learn how to create professional-looking clip and products.

Caravan conkers involved suspending the heavy vehicles from cranes, and then smashing them into each other. The trio crossed the English Channel in boats made out of cars. The crew watched as the presenters bobbed up and down in ramshackle-looking vessels. He wrote: 'So I see a future where we don't need to film and edit Top Gear. You will do it for us. 'We will arrange to drive some £500 cars to France (where the producers have come up with a series of challenges), and you will pool your footage to make an item.' The show, which has run for a total of . 18 series, the latest finishing in March 2012, is believed to have a . massive 350 million viewers per week in 170 different countries. It features a number of regular features including a challenge for the presenters, Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car and power laps, where the show's 'tame racing driver' The Stig completes a lap around the Top Gear test track to gauge the performance of various cars. In September, MailOnline reported how co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson was set for a £5million windfall after the BBC bought out his stake in Bedder 6, which he set up five years ago with Top Gear's executive producer Andy Wilman, to exploit the programme's global brand. Bedder 6 has had huge success making money out of Top Gear merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international sales rights. It was understood the total deal for both men was worth around £8million. The money was to come from the BBC’s commercial division. Clarkson has also signed a lucrative new deal to continue presenting BBC 2's popular motoring show for three more years alongside James May and Richard Hammond, and is likely to be paid a fixed annual £500,000 talent fee by the broadcaster up until 2015. The new series returns on January 27.","James May predicts a future where the public will create the show .

"The Mayor of London Boris Johnson was seen filling up on petrol in his banged-up old Toyota people carrier in East London earlier today. The 49-year-old was pictured filling the dark green car, which boasts an 'I Love Scotland' sticker on the back and a couple of sizeable dents in the boot. A member of the public asked if the car was his and he replied: 'Yes it is. Would you like to buy it?' Mayor of London Boris Johnson was pictured filling his car with petrol in East London this afternoon . Mr Johnson has repeatedly voiced his objection to Scottish independence. In November he told the Daily Telegraph: 'I have a feeling it was stuck there by some fellows from Strathclyde police when they came down to help with the Notting Hill carnival, and I keep it there because it reflects my general feelings. 'After three centuries of union, England and Scotland are not just woven together by sentiment, but by a cat’s cradle of intricate legal and political ties. Fibre by fibre that would have to be sliced apart, and the result will be agony and endless recrimination.' Despite hand-wringing over Scottish independence, Mr Johnson has much to smile about at the moment. Joke: A member of the public asked if the car was his and he replied: 'Yes it is. would you like to buy it?' The Budget pension pot windfall for millions of older people has led to a dramatic ‘grey power’ surge in Tory popularity, reviving David Cameron’s hopes of winning a second term in power. It has seen the Conservatives slash Labour’s poll lead from 11 points less than a year ago to one. The findings come from the first full-scale opinion survey since Wednesday’s Budget, which leaves the outcome of the 2015 General Election on a knife edge. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 35 (up one point on their January rating), the Tories on 34 (up four), UKIP on 15 (down three)and the Lib Dems on nine (down three). Election expert John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said last night that if the poll findings were repeated in a General Election tomorrow, it would be ‘too close to call’ as to whether Labour would be able to form a majority Government.","Mayor of London was seen filling up his battered green Toyota earlier today .

"A super-camera capable of catching up to 50 times as many drivers as conventional speed cameras has been unveiled by councils across Britain as the latest weapon against motorists who break the rules of the road. Some critics are already arguing the new system - known as ZenGrab LaneWatch Mk2 - will simply use motorists as 'cash cows', while fining drivers for every contravention to boost council income would be 'immoral'. The cameras, which each cost £17,000 and feature two lenses and night vision, are being snapped up by councils across the country in expectation of a law change allowing the use of cameras to fine drivers for a greater range of offences. Goodbye Gatsos: Conventional speed cameras, like the one pictured, are set to be replaced by ""super-cameras"" capable of catching 50 times more drivers . In recent months, transport minister Norman Baker said all councils should have the power to fine drivers for passing no-entry signs or making illegal U-turns and right turns. Councils within London already have those powers under the 2004 Traffic Management Act, but the government is now reviewing that situation for across the country. Presently, cameras installed outside London are only used to enforce bus lanes. But the new cameras can also track drivers who wander into yellow box junctions or make prohibited turns. Documents from Westminster Council show that in trials on two similar stretches of road, the ZenGrab system caught more than 1,000 offences in four weeks, compared to just 271 caught on conventional Gatso cameras in an entire year. Like borough councils across the capital, many others have expressed interest in the new system. Manchester installed 15 ZenGrab cameras last month, Nottingham is upgrading to ZenGrab Mk 2 and both Glasgow and Medway in Kent already have the system in operation. Watching: Unlike the Gatso (pictured) the ZenGrab LaneWatch Mk 2 system can track more than just speeding offences, including drivers who make illegal U-turns or wander into bus lanes . Adrian Ford of Zenco, the company behind the ZenGrab system, told The Sunday Times that the past year had seen 'a surge in interest from councils.' But motoring organisations have expressed their concerns. Paul Watters from the AA, said: 'Sticking up cameras to enforce every minor contravention is bordering on the immoral.' Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Central Ayrshire, also found himself at odds with the ZenGrab system when he claims to have mistakenly pulled into a bus lane in Glasgow. 'They [the council] are using motorists as a cash cow. There is no other way of looking at it,' he said. The widespread use of the cameras is also likely to further inflame recent criticism accusing councils of using parking fees as a massive moneyspinner. Last month a survey revealed that  town halls boosted their annual profit from parking tickets, permits and penalties in 2011-12 by more than £500million . The RAC Foundation revealed councils raked in more than £1.4billion, of which nearly £565million was pure profit. That is £54million, 10.5 per cent, more than the ‘surplus’ in the previous year. In August, the High Court declared Barnet Council in North London had acted illegally in setting parking charges for the sole purpose of making profit. The RAC Foundation said councils must now ‘come clean’ about their parking charges and prove to motorists that they are not being used illegally to subsidise other services. Mr Pickles added that the figures showed ‘why we need to review and rein in unfair town hall parking rules’ and urged councils to stop treating drivers as a ‘cash cow’ to subsidise other services. Caught on camera: The conventional Gatso has been at the centre of controversy with motorists . The Gatso that made millions . In 2009, a motorway speed camera on the M11 at the junction with the North Circular A406 near Woodford, Essex, was estimated to catch up to 500 drivers a day - and generated nearly £1million a year in fines for Essex Council. The camera, jointly run by Essex Council, was placed where the road narrowed from three lanes to two and . the speed limit dropped from 70mph to 50mph. But figures showed accidents rose by a quarter and casualties almost doubled after the Gatso camera was installed. Police said crashes happened because motorists slowed down ahead of the camera and then sped up once they were clear of it. A pretty penny for Peterborough . In 2010, two fixed cameras installed to slow cars to 40mph approaching roadworks brought in £54,000 in just 10 days. The cameras were installed to slow drivers on the A1139 Frank Perkins Parkway in Peterborough. No smiles for the camera . In 2011, more than 24,500 drivers were refunded nearly £1.5m in fines after it was found a speed . camera had been operating illegally for 10 years. Thousands were wrongly trapped by the Gatso device positioned along the busy A35 at Chideock, Dorset. When the camera was installed in 1997, a clerical error on the original paperwork meant a road used to mark out the 30mph zone it policed, did not exist. The error, which meant the speed limit was invalid and so could not be enforced by the camera, came to light when a judge spotted it in documents relating to the case of a lorry driver. As a result 24,259 drivers who paid fines of £40 and £60 between 1997 and 2007 were refunded. Some 201 motorists who challenged their fines in court received a total of £22,827 back from extra costs and fines they incurred. And those who incurred three penalty points on their driving licences had them the wiped off. The blunder has also cost the Dorset Road Safe organisation £370,981 in administration costs picked up for sorting out the mess.","The ZenGrab LaneWatch Mk2 cameras cost £17,000 each .

"Driving tests should have a distinction grade to improve road safety, a Tory minister has said. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said it is wrong that would-be drivers can only pass or fail. He said that if there was a higher level to aspire to, insurance firms would be able to offer cheaper premiums to the best drivers – which could make the country’s roads safer. Test: Almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident (file picture) It comes after the Government said it was considering raising the driving age to 18 – from the current 17 – in a attempt to reduce the number of fatal accidents. Youths could be forced to wait until they are 19 before they qualify for a full licence, and all motorists under 30 could be banned from giving their friends a lift or driving at night for 12 months after they pass their test. Almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident. Mr Hancock, who is Conservative MP for West Suffolk, made his suggestion at a car factory in Oxford last week, at an event where apprentices met David Cameron. ‘One of the things that’s in the . implementation platform is that every apprenticeship in the future will . have a pass, fail or distinction,’ he said. Fifteen minors allowed: Currently, learner drivers are given some indication of how they fared by seeing their report card at the end of the test, on which their minor or major faults are marked (file picture) ‘I’m personally very committed to this. People say ... you can be a perfectly good bricklayer or you can be brilliant. Parents who park illegally when dropping off or picking up their children from school could soon find themselves caught on camera. The cameras, which are timed to switch on during the morning and afternoon school run, spot those who stop in restricted zones. The surveillance system records footage of the number plate and no-parking sign and sends it to councils, which can then use it  to issue fines of up to £120. Five councils in London and at least two others outside the capital are testing the system, which costs £16,000. Manufacturer Videalert refused to say which they were. Actor Tom Conti, 71, who drops his grandchild off at school in London, compared the camera system to surveillance by the Stasi. He said: ‘The councils are doing this for revenue. To target parents is frankly disgusting.’ ‘People say the driving test is just pass or fail. But actually if we had a distinction on the driving test, maybe those people could get lower premiums and be safer drivers.’ Currently, learner drivers are given some indication of how they fared by seeing their report card at the end of the test, on which their minor or major faults are marked. Up to 15 minors are allowed before they will be failed. Sources at the Department for Business and Skills said it was not official Government policy to have a distinction level, but that it was an idea Mr Hancock was in favour of. He is particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne, meaning his thoughts are discussed at the highest levels. Last night Edmund King, president of the AA, said the idea was ‘interesting’ and could help make roads safer. He said the distinction pass could be reserved for those who excelled in their tests and completed advanced lessons. ‘Young drivers are not ready for Britain’s roads after passing their tests,’ he said. ‘They are ten times more likely to have an accident in the first year after passing their test. ‘The idea of having a distinction is interesting. If a new driver has completed lessons on motorways and driving at night and excelled at their test they could get a lower insurance premium.’","Matthew Hancock says it's wrong would-be drivers can only pass or fail .

"Fed up with feeling ripped off and patronised by male mechanics? So was mother-of-two Caroline Lake, the brains behind Caroline's Cars - the UK's first all-female garage. Now in its tenth year her business venture has proved so popular that many men - as well as women - flock to her Norwich workshop. Caroline, 42, said: '[Going to] garages can be a terrifying experience for many women – I know women who prefer going to the dentist than going to a garage. Scroll down for video . Female friendly: Caroline Lake (centre) with two of her female mechanics, all of whom wear pink overalls . Tough job: The women get to work underneath one of their many male and female clients' vehicles . 'I know women who have been ripped off, told their cars needed expensive work doing when it didn’t [or] just have men talking to their boobs and being leery. 'Women come here because they know they can trust me, and that I’m not going to rip them off. I want to encourage women to not be afraid and feel safe – it’s engrained in society that women automatically know nothing about cars. 'The success has even led to a strong demand by men to have their cars fixed and looked at by my garage – we’re getting a good reputation and I think people just warm to women.' Caroline was forced to work as an unpaid apprentice for four years before she convinced her male boss to take her on as a paid employee. As a result, she became one of the first women in the country to become a qualified MOT tester. But after hearing countless complaints from women who had suffered harrowing experiences at male-dominated garages Caroline decided it was time to launch her own business. Messy: Caroline (right) and her staff have no qualms about getting covered in oil and grease at work .

'Some women even know they’re being ripped off but are too scared to question the man’s diagnosis so pay extortionate amounts out of fear.' Having launched her business with . help from two friends Viv and Moranda, Caroline has since been forced to . hire some manly helping hands to cope with the workload. But there’s always pink overalls - the shop’s compulsory uniform - for any new additions. Caroline . said: 'Whenever we have workshops we always get the men dressed up in . pink uniforms - I even had my bank manager in them when he came in to my . shop.' With dreams of being able to franchise Caroline’s Cars and have test centres and garages across the UK, the motoring enthusiast also thinks women should learn more about their cars. Caroline launched a series of educational classes for women introducing common faults and how to maintain cars but soon received requests from men to attend the women-only lessons. Caroline said: 'A lot of men complained about my female-only teaching classes so of course I opened my arms to them and now we cater for anybody who wants to learn a bit more about their car and what to look out for. 'It’s not just young women who prefer a female garage; men are exactly the same about big burly mechanics and their ""backstreet"" reputations. 'I hope to expand my business and franchise it so we can have female garages up and down the country.'

"Lucky: Cyclist Claire Pepper who says he life was saved by a group of people who lifted a car from on top of her after a collision . An injured cyclist today hailed a group of passers-by as her 'heroes' after they lifted a car off her, claiming they saved her life. Claire Pepper, 27, escaped with a broken collarbone, as well as cuts and bruises, when she was trapped under the car following a collision in Spitalfields, east London, on Monday night. Up to 10 passers-by physically heaved the VW car off her so paramedics could treat her. And fashion photographer Ms Pepper believes if it were not for the helmet she was wearing, which she bought just two days before, she could have died. Speaking from her hospital bed Miss Pepper, who has no recollection of the crash, said: 'I still can’t figure out how it happened. 'I left work and had been cycling for about 10 minutes. I remember being on my bike on Kingsland Road and the next thing I remember was waking up in hospital at 2am. 'Undoubtedly the people that lifted the car off me saved my life so I could get help quicker. They are my heroes.' Miss Pepper, who has done fashion shoots for Elle and Topshop, may now have to undergo surgery. But she said: 'It could have been a lot worse. 'I’m really lucky to be alive. If anything comes out of this story I want to urge people to wear helmets as they can save lives.

"Four police cars are caught on camera carrying out a carefully co-ordinated breakfast time raid - on a doughnut drive-through. The marked patrol cars were spotted parked outside a Krispy Kreme store in Bristol yesterday morning as officers tucked in to an unhealthy treat. Onlooker Paul Amery said a fifth car was parked outside the store out of view of his camera buying more of the sugary treats on Monday morning. Sweet treat: Shoppers were left wondering if Chief Wiggum in Bristol after these four police cars were spotted parked outside a Krispy Kreme drive-thru . The doughnut division sat in their cars tucking into their food on the Avon Meads Retail Park. The spot is a favourite haunt of local police with patrol cars pictured picking up doughnuts from the same place in July and August. Mr Amery, 42, a freelance IT project manager, said: 'We are all entitled to our breakfasts and lunches but seeing so many police cars together was a bit of a surprise. 'It was like something out of The Simpsons - I was expecting Chief Wiggum or Homer to appear at any moment. 'There was four cars neatly lined up and a fifth coming through the drive through. I think they were all sat in their cars eating their food.' The photo - posted online yesterday - left a bad taste with some. What a doughnut: A police car seen in the drive through queue at Krispy Kreme, Bristol . Police swoop: Another patrol car queues up for a breakfast treat at Krispy Kreme . 'Capt cabbie' commented: '& yet if you ring up if your car is broken into they say they’re on other urgent calls. Not really an effective use of resources is it. 'Whilst I understand we all need a refreshment break why all 4 cars at the same time? No doubt the area commander will say that it was necessary & all we can do is accept this. 'It does however make (Police and Crime Commissioner) Sue Mountstevens & Chief constable Gregan look pretty stupid given that they’re constantly talking about saving money.' Thin blue wasteline: Doughnut-loving police Chief Wiggum, from The Simpsons, who onlookers likened the scene to (left) and a box of Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts (right) Another commentator, Steve059 added: 'Had two cars bumped into each other in the car park? 'That’s usually the only way you get that many police cars together at the same time.' After seeing Paul’s photo Twitter user Joes85 posted one of a police car at the drive-thru window of the same Krispy Kreme store in the summer and said '£keepingbristolsafe'. Avon and Somerset Police admitted their officers had 'decided to begin the week in style with a sweet treat'. Chief Inspector Mark Jackson said: 'Our officers are encouraged to take their breaks out in the community rather than returning to a police station. 'This increases our visibility and means we are out and ready to respond to emergency calls. 'Response officers also have access to mobile data - including our key systems - in their vehicles so can do more work from their cars. 'On this occasion some of our officers on a break must have decided to begin the week in style with a sweet treat.'","Patrol cars spotted parked outside a Krispy Kreme store in Bristol .

"Hidden: The cameras may be a hard-to-spot grey - which critics say will do little to slow drivers down . Speed cameras to catch motorists driving in excess of 70mph are to be installed along motorways for the first time. So-called stealth cameras – which may be grey rather than bright yellow – will be placed on stretches of some of the busiest routes, including the M1, M6 and M25. Previously, motorway speed cameras have been situated mainly on stretches undergoing roadworks, in order to enforce variable speed limits for safety reasons. Some ‘safety camera partnerships’ have also placed them in vans parked on bridges above the carriageway. Speed cameras to catch motorists driving in excess of 70mph are to be installed along hundreds of miles of motorway for the first time. New so-called ‘stealth cameras’ - which may be grey rather than bright yellow - will be placed on stretches of some of the most important motorways including the M1, M6 and M25. Previously, motorway speed cameras have mainly been situated on stretches undergoing roadworks, in order to enforce variable speed limits for safety reasons. Some ‘safety camera partnerships’ have also placed them in vans which are parked on bridges above the motorway. The Highways Agency is looking at the widespread introduction of cameras to target drivers exceeding the maximum allowed speed of 70mph. According to officials, this will prevent jams and allow better traffic flow by controlling speed limits and opening hard shoulders to traffic during busy periods. But motoring groups claim the introduction of cameras is not about road safety but about generating income through fines. 'Traffic flow': The Highways Agency says the plan will allow better traffic flow on busy routes, such as the M25, pictured . A recent poll in Autocar found that 94.6 per cent of motorists admitted driving in excess of 70mph while on the motorway. Critics have pointed out that less visible cameras will have no impact on actually slowing drivers down. It recently emerged that the Highways Agency has launched a consultation over the speed limit on a section on the M1 between Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. It could see its speed reduced to 60mph for 12 hours a day - between 7am and 7pm - because of fears that congestion is reducing air quality and would be policed by cameras and police patrols. Yesterday Roger Lawson, of the Alliance of British Drivers (ABD), said: 'We are opposed to speed cameras in general. 'The evidence of their success in promoting safety is not good and in reality what is happening now is that the police are using speed cameras to fund their other activities through speed awareness courses.' He added: 'If these cameras are grey . rather than yellow they are going to be harder to spot and so will have . no impact in slowing traffic down. If there is a good reason for the . traffic to be slowed down then the cameras need to be as visible as . possible.' Generating income: Motoring groups say the cameras for routes such as the M6, pictured, are an attempt to make money . The ABD has called for an increase in the upper speed limit on motorways to 80mph. This was considered by ministers but appears no nearer to becoming law. The new cameras, dubbed Hadsec3 (Highways Agency digital enforcement camera system) will be and running along more than 100 miles of motorway within two years, with the further roll-out eventually covering at least 400 miles. Since 2010, some police forces have cut back on their use of speed cameras because the tickets can cost too much to process. But digital technology has made it cheaper and easier to install, monitor and collect information from cameras. A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: ‘These are not stealth cameras they are more visible that they were before. These motorways are not about speed limits. 'They are about smoothing the traffic flows and increasing capacity.’ The spokesman said the new cameras would be signposted and added: 'The onus is on the driver to abide by the speed limit.’","Highways Agency plans to coat hundreds of miles of motorway with cameras .

"Kathleen McKechnie Skifjell, 53, had stopped to buy a bottle of water when a man . A mother told how her car was stolen from a petrol station as her eight-year-old son was sound asleep in the back seat. Kathleen McKechnie Skifjell, 53, had stopped to buy a bottle of water and didn't see a man loitering around the site waiting for his chance. The mother-of-four left the car unlocked, and he jumped in and sped off. The incident happened in Norway, where Ms McKechnie Skifjell and her family, originally from Stirling, Scotland, now live. The cook, only became aware her Daewoo had vanished when she emerged from the filling station shop. Terrified, she called the police and spent the next hour - which she described as 'the longest of her life' before discovering her son, Scott, had been found safe. She later learned the thief had woken up Scott before dropping him off at a remote house and telling him his mother was waiting there for him. But when Scott knocked on the door, he discovered it was the home of a family who had no idea who he was. The couple then called the police. Ms McKechnie Skifjell said: 'We're just lucky this thief had a conscience. 'He was obviously an opportunist who just wanted my car and must have got the shock of his life when he found Scott sleeping in the back. 'Scott doesn't remember much until he was woken by the man after he pulled up outside the house. It was about 8pm and getting dark. Scott rang the doorbell and told the couple that a man had taken his mother's car.' The man who took the car dropped Scott off nearby. Ms McKechnie Skifjell said: 'We're just lucky this thief had a conscience' She added: 'The couple quickly realised what was happening and called the police. 'It was the best news I've ever had. I was in shock. I was still down at the petrol station and they brought him there. 'He came out of the police car as if nothing had happened. I gave him the biggest hug ever. I couldn't believe I had him back.' Police later found the car abandoned and undamaged. Her purse had been emptied and her mobile phone SIM card taken. Scott's schoolbag was also stolen. 'He came out of the police car as if nothing had happened. I gave him the biggest hug ever. I couldn't believe I had him back' Ms McKechnie Skifjell moved to Norway 23 years ago after she met her former husband while working as a chef on the North Sea oil rigs. She and her children Johann, 22, Anne, 19, Marie, 16 and Scott moved back to Scotland several years ago to live in Blair Drummond, near Stirling, for two years before moving back to Revetal, 55 miles south of Oslo. Police said they had now arrested a man in connection with the incident. A spokesman said he had told them it was not his intention to kidnap a child, but just to steal a car.","Kathleen McKechnie Skifjell's Daewoo was taken as she went to buy water .

"With just days to go until Scotland goes to the polls in the independence referendum a 'passport control centre' has sprung up on the Scottish border. Motorists driving past the 'checkpoint' at the border at Carter Bar, near Jedburgh, were shocked to see a barrier erected along with signs claiming to be from the 'Scottish Border Agency'. Underneath it read that the checkpoint would be opening on September 19, 2014, the day after the vote, with piper Alan Smith from nearby Hawick, being the first man to pass through the border. Scroll down for video . A man has his passport checked at the spoof 'passport control centre', which sprung up on the Scottish border near Jedburgh today . The pranksters erected the signs and the barrier, which claim to be in operation by September 19, the day after the vote . However, it has transpired that the 'mock' border was the work of pranksters, who were hoping the stunt would lighten what they called the ever-increasing heat of the debate. Organiser of the prank, Jon Parker Lee, a photographer from Manchester said: 'We're not making a point for either side. 'We've staged this together as a group of Scotland and English. We're simply united in having a laugh. The pranksters say they were hoping the stunt would lighten what they called the ever-increasing heat of the debate . Questions remain over whether there would be a need for a border control of any sort if Scotland goes it alone . Under Alex Salmond's plans for independence, he insists there will be no need for border controls with England . 'Come what may, we all love a wind-up, and maybe this will give everyone a laugh and a break from the ever-increasing heat of the debate.' The spoof border comes after both the Yes and No campaigns have clashed on if there should be border controls on the Scottish/England border. Under Alex Salmond's plans for independence, he insists there will be no need for border controls with England, but Labour's Ed Miliband has signalled border guards and passport checks would have to be considered to control immigration. Alex Salmond, pictured posing for selfies with supporters on the campaign trail in Stirling, insists there will be no need for border controls with England in the event of a Yes vote . Mr Salmond also hopes for an independent Scotland to join Common Travel Area (CTA) which allows free movement between the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man . Mr Salmond also hopes for an independent Scotland to join Common Travel Area (CTA) which dates back to the 1920s and allows free movement between the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The official white paper for independence states: 'We plan to remain part of the CTA which means that there will be no border controls, and you will not need a passport to travel to other parts of the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.' However, Mr Miliband said the only way to maintain an open border was to reject independence. But Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured with the No campaign in Edinburgh last week, says the only way to maintain an open border was to reject independence . 'If you don't want borders, vote to stay in the United Kingdom,' the Labour leader said in an interview with the Scottish Mail on Sunday. Asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was Prime Minister, Mr Miliband warned: 'It would have to be looked at.' And Mr Miliband's spokesman added: 'The last time I looked there were two sides to the border - and we would be in charge of one of them. It would be up to us, not Mr Salmond, to secure our northern border.' The spoof border crossing prank came as David Cameron tonight begged Scots not to rip the United Kingdom apart in a 'painful divorce', as he bluntly told his enemies he would not be Prime Minister forever. He appeared teary-eyed as he issued his most emotional plea yet to voters in Thursday's historic referendum: 'Please don't break this family apart.' Making his tenth and final visit to Scotland ahead of Thursday's historic referendum, the Prime Minister's voice cracked as he told an audience in Aberdeen how preserving the Union is 'the best hope for your family in this world'. David Cameron appeared teary-eyed as he made his most emotional plea yet to voters in Thursday's historic referendum . the Prime Minister's voice cracked as he told an audience in Aberdeen how preserving the Union is 'the best hope for your family in this world . Mr Cameron's desperate plea came after an opinion poll suggested a majority of voters in Scotland, and across the UK, think that since agreeing to Alex Salmond's demand for a yes/no vote, Mr Cameron has handled the campaign 'badly'. Making repeated references to 'family' and safety, he said that if voters have any doubts about the impact of independence on their loved ones, they should vote No. The speech came as a trio of celebrities addressed crowds at an anti-independence rally in London this evening. Irish-born Bob Geldof appeared at the Better Together rally in Trafalgar Square, London, this evening to the bemusement of many critics . Comedian Eddie Izzard, born in Yemen, who sported a Union Jack manicure as he told Scots: 'We care' Bob Geldof, Eddie Izzard and Al Murray pleaded with a packed Trafalgar Square tonight to remain part of the 307-year-old union which has given them 'everything'. But critics were quick to question their motives - as none of the three speakers was Scottish. Born in Ireland, Geldof said he had an 'immigrant's gratitude' to the union to which he owed 'everything'. Comedian Al Murray told the crowds which had gathered in London that he liked Britain as it was 'vague' His sentiments were echoed by Yemen-born Eddie Izzard, who said: 'If you care, this is the time to say it, to stand up, and if you care about the future of Scotland this is your time to show it. While English-born comedian Murray added: 'I like being British, it's so vague. The clue is in the name Brit-ish. We're ish'.' Elsewhere the debate seemed to take a lighter turn, as SNP leader Alex Salmond was spotted posing for selfies. The First Minister of Scotland took pictures with a handful of girls on the campaign trail in Stirling this afternoon, after yesterday admitting he considered the 500,000 undecided voters 'deferres Yes-es'.","Pranksters erected passport control signs and a barrier near Jedburgh .

"A short-sighted driver who killed a pensioner crossing the road after leaving the house with the wrong glasses has been jailed. Peter Conroy, 73, who is blind in his right eye and has impaired vision in his left, was wearing reading glasses instead of his long vision spectacles when he hit Audrey Noden, 93, and her 63-year-old daughter. Mrs Noden was rushed to hospital with a fractured pelvis and leg. She died of thrombosis due to a lack of movement a month later. Jailed: Peter Conroy, 73 (left), is blind in his right eye and has impaired vision in his left. He was wearing reading glasses when he hit Audrey Noden, 93 (right), who died a month later from thrombosis caused by her injuries . Her daughter Margaret Elvidge suffered a fractured vertebrae and a broken leg. Today Conroy, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, was sentenced to two years in jail and banned from driving for 10 years. Judge Stuart Rafferty QC: . 'You should not have been driving. 'Although you didn’t intend it to be that way as soon as you got behind the wheel that car became a potentially lethal weapon. 'I . know you will find prison extraordinarily difficult. For you it will be . a very hard punishment but it is a punishment that ends whereas the . loss that the family have is life long.' Conroy, who was recovering from a stroke at the time, had narrowly avoided two other crashes . before the incident on September 4, 2012, but ignored other drivers' warnings to pull over, Lincoln Crown Court heard. He drove his Ford Mondeo at 15mph at he headed to . Sainsbury's to carry out his weekly shop. Mrs Noden was described in court as 'vibrant' and 'active'. Conroy narrowly avoided two crashes before hitting Mrs Noden and her daughter Margaret Elvidge in Lincoln . She walking to the Co-Op from the health centre with Mrs Elvidge, saw he was driving slowly and assumed he was stopping, the court heard. David Allan, prosecuting, said: 'He . was unfit to be driving a car. He simply failed to see these women. It . was a wide and straight road. That morning it was dry and clear. 'At . the pedestrian crossing they paused at the side of the road and a van . stopped. Margaret Elvidge saw the defendant’s car approaching. He was . travelling very slowly and she assumed he had seen them and was slowing . down to let them cross. 'They took two steps into the road and the defendant’s car simply ploughed into both of them.' It . emerged Conroy lied when renewing his licence just months before the . incident, failing to tell the DVLA that he is partially blind and has glaucoma. Testing his sight at the scene, police found he could not read a number . plate further than four metres away. Legally, drivers must be able to . read a number plate at 20 metres. Alison Summers, defending, said Conroy was of limited intellect and did not appreciate how bad his eye sight was. 'It is accepted that his driving was dangerous. He is very sorry for the loss of this lady’s life.' Mrs Noden’s family blasted the sentence, . saying: 'No sentence really alters anything. We have lost our mum.

"Police  in the Lake District are hunting a Benny Hill-style gang who lean out of car windows to slap the bottoms of women riding bikes. The gang of leering, cackling youths are touring the roads around Barrow, Cumbria, on the lookout for ladies cycling in Lycra shorts. Just like a scene from a Benny Hill Show, they wind down the window, reach out and smack the women's bottoms before roaring off. The youths are wreaking havoc in the usually quiet seaport town. Three women have reported their anti-social behaviour . Detectives are following up reports from three furious cyclists and believe many more victims are too embarrassed to come forward. In the latest incident, the youths, in a black car, slowed down before the passenger leaned out and slapped a shocked women cyclist on her bottom, causing her to wobble, lose control of her bike and nearly fall off. The car drove off in the Barrow direction. A police spokesman said 'While fortunately no injuries were caused, it could have led to a serious accident.' The father-in-law of one of the victims, who gave his name only as Brian, said: 'I can imagine the possible consequences if she had lost control as a result of this incident.

"London Mayor Boris Johnson wants the Government to pay Diesel car owners between £1,000 and £2,000 in a national scrappage scheme . Boris Johnson has called for all diesel cars which are more than a year old to be scrapped because their fumes harm our health. The London Mayor wants the Government to pay the owners between £1,000 and £2,000 in a national scrappage scheme. He said millions were unfairly ‘seduced’ into buying diesel by being told it was greener. ‘I feel very sorry for them,’ Mr Johnson told the Commons Environmental Audit Comittee yesterday. ‘This has been a massive failure of public policy. Millions were told they were doing the right thing, the clean thing, the environmentally friendly thing, by buying a diesel.They feel very hacked off now they’re told they are more polluting.’ Mr Johnson said a national diesel scrappage scheme would encourage motorists to switch to cleaner vehicles. Scientists believe diesel produces more of the tiny particles and nitrogen oxides that damage human health. It is now known that diesel fumes create a variety of long-term problems for the heart and lungs, particularly in children. Senior scientists have even blamed diesel for directly causing the deaths of 7,000 people in Britain every year. Mr Johnson, who drives a petrol Toyota people carrier, has already announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital. In July he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £10 to drive into Central London as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020. Other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with EU clean air rules. Around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in Britain. Professor Frank Kelly, a Government adviser, said about a quarter of these – roughly 7,000 deaths a year – could be attributed to diesel emissions. Britain is facing £300million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution. Strict targets should have been met by January 2010 and in February this year the EU launched legal proceedings to force the Government to deal with air pollution. The European Commission says Britain fails to meet air quality targets in 16 areas, including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow. Asked why he was not bringing in the ultra-low emission zone earlier in London, Mr Johnson said: ‘The reason for not going any faster is simply we have got to be fair to the punter, to people buying vehicles now. They will feel very aggrieved that a car on which they have spent a huge sum of money is not going to be compliant.’ Senior scientists have  blamed diesel for directly causing the deaths of 7,000 people in Britain every year. Mr Johnson has already announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital . He also said there would be a rapid expansion of hybrid buses and electric buses. Mr Johnson has also introduced rules banning taxis older than 15 years in London, to the fury of cab drivers. The rule means 3,000 taxis will have to be retired. He has also demanded that by 2018, all taxis in Central London should be either hybrid or full electric models. Nearly half of cars registered in Britain are now diesel – a massive increase since 2000, when they comprised only 14 per cent. However, last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘There are no current plans for a car scrappage scheme. ‘This Government has invested £2billion in a range of measures to help improve air quality.’","London Mayor wants Government to launch national scrappage scheme .

"Court: Ross McDermott (pictured) was convicted of dangerous driving after being caught speeding at 144mph in his BMW X5 . A man was caught by police driving at 144mph after deciding to test his BMW to see how fast it would go. Ross McDermott, a self employed electrician, was recorded by police travelling at more than double the speed limit in his BMW X5. Magistrates heard how the 37-year-old father had taken the vehicle out for a Sunday afternoon spin which turned into a high-speed police chase. He decided to put his foot down on the A189 Spine Road, which links Gateshead to Northumberland, and was spotted by a police officer on a slip road. McDermott was yesterday banned from the road for 15 months after being convicted of dangerous driving and speeding. He was criticised by magistrates and prosecutors while The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) claimed lives could have been lost. Prosecutor James Long told Mid and South East Northumberland court in Bedlington how McDermott had been spotted by a Northumbria Police officer who had been on mobile patrol on a sliproad. The officer first noticed McDermott’s blue BMW X5 travelling on the Northbound carriageway 'at speed.' A short time later, the policeman heard the same vehicle approaching rapidly again and recorded McDermott’s car 'flash by' at 144mph. The officer set off in pursuit of the speeding vehicle and only managed to catch McDermott after he was slowed by other traffic. Mr Long told the court: 'The dangerous driving is in essence the speeding. 'That speed and standard of driving fell far below that what would be expected of a competent and careful driver in the circumstances. 'The danger which arises here from that grossly excessive speed, I think is a fair description of it, (is that) there are other users on that main road at that time of day. 'Excessively speedy': Ross McDermott took his BMW X5 out for a Sunday 'spin' but decided to see how fast it could go. He was chased by a police officer who was only able to catch him after his version of the BMW pictured was slowed by traffic . 'The road may not have been as busy as some other times but there was other traffic on the road and the danger of driving at that grossly excessive speed should be plain to see.' McDermott lives in the village of Seaton Sluice in Northumberland and has a three-and-a-half-year-old daughter. He had already pleaded guilty to speeding but yesterday also admitted dangerous driving, having initially denied the charge and been due to stand trial. Solicitor Richard Copsey told the court his client had decided to take his car out for a 'spin' and had decided to see how fast it could travel. He claimed McDermott had got up to 144mph - as fast as the car could go, then decelerated to within the speed limit immediately. Mr Copsey insisted the defendant had only travelled at the top speed for a 'couple' of seconds and that he had only broken the limit for less than half a minute. 'There is no question of racing or putting someone else in danger,' he said. 'It was just a single burst over a short period of time although it was excessive speed.' Magistrates imposed a 15 month driving disqualification, following which the defendant must sit an extended driving test. He was fined £816, ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £81 and costs of £200. Chairman of the bench David Burn had told McDermott: 'The risk of injury was immense on this occasion.' After the case, Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at RoSPA, added: 'Speeding is dangerous and puts the lives of the driver, their passengers and other people at risk of serious injury or worse. 'Around 400 people a year are killed in crashes in which someone exceeds the speed limit or drives too fast for the conditions. 'Driving at higher speeds also mean that drivers have less time to identify and react to what is happening around them, prolonging the time it takes for the vehicle to stop, and raising the risk of a crash occurring.'","Ross McDermott, 37, was chased by a police car after doing 144mph .

"A seven-year-old girl was flung through a car window during a 70mph motorway crash - but escaped completely unharmed. Ysabelle Amos was in her father's partner's car on Sunday when a tyre blew out on the M55 near Kirkham, Lancashire, hurling the Daewoo Matiz into the central reservation and sending it into a spin. Her father's partner Tracy Jenkinson, 42 - who also had her two children Charlie and Chelsea Piggot in the back - managed to swerve onto the hard shoulder without hitting any other cars. But when she turned around to check on the children, she realised one was missing. Miracle: Ysabelle Amos (pictured with her father Paul Amos and his partner Tracy Jenkinson, who was driving) survived being hurled through a window during a 70mph crash on the M55 - and was completely uninjured . Ysabelle had flown through a rear window after it shattered and landed in the middle of the motorway. Ms Jenkinson said: 'The kids were screaming Ysabelle’s name and really panicking. 'I looked around and just saw her pop up between the barriers of the central reservation. She was standing where she was safe. 'Some of the drivers who had stopped on the motorway brought her across the lanes, and she didn’t have a scratch on her.' Incredibly, none of the children were hurt other than minor cuts and bruises and Ms Jenkinson suffered only a bruised elbow. The motorway was shut in both directions at around 6pm as the North West Air Ambulance landed on the carriageway to take Ysabelle to Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, as a precaution. Charlie, nine, and Chelsea, eight, were taken to Royal Preston Hospital and later transferred to Manchester Children’s Hospital. Danger: The M55 was shut while an air ambulance crew landed on the crash site (circled in red) Lucky to be alive: Ysabelle Amos was hurled onto the central reservation through the shattered rear window . All three were allowed home the next day. Ms Jenkinson, a beauty salon owner from St Annes, Lancashire, said: 'When we set off all three children were in the back and had their seat belts on. 'Ysabelle doesn’t know what happened and how she came to be outside the car, but I think she must have panicked and took her seatbelt off as the car started to shake. 'As we hit the central reservation and the back window came out she went through it. 'After that the car was all over the place. I was trying to slow but the brakes weren’t working as well as they should have. 'I remember thinking ""we’re not going to survive this"". 'I asked the angels to look after the children. I didn’t care if I made it, as long as they were safe.'","Ysabelle Amos was in family car when tyre blew out on M55 on Sunday .

"He is a tireless green campaigner and quick to criticise anything which is harmful to the environment. But it seems millionaire Tory MP Zac Goldsmith is happy to let his own car burn a little extra fuel. For the environmentalist has been banned from driving and ordered to pay £570 after getting three speeding tickets in as many months last winter. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, he son of the billionaire Sir James, has been banned from driving after clocking up three speeding offences . The 39-year-old was caught breaking the  limit in his hybrid Toyota Prius – the green driver’s car of choice – in the same location in Hammersmith, West London, on two consecutive days last December. According to prosecutors he was captured by a speed camera travelling at 38mph in the 30mph zone on December 4, then at 36mph on December 5. He was then caught speeding again in his own constituency of Richmond Park in South West London in February, driving at 39mph in a 30mph zone. As the son of billionaire banker Sir James Goldsmith already had points on his licence, he was last week fined and disqualified from driving for six months, after pleading guilty at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court. Goldsmith, who didn’t appear in court for the judgment, was originally scheduled to be sentenced yesterday but the date was brought forward for an undisclosed reason. Goldsmith was handed a £155 fine and a two month ban for his offence in Hammersmith Road, west London . In February, Goldsmith was flashed by a speed camera breaking the limit in Lower Mortlake Road in Richmond . Court official Nicola Kedney said: ‘Mr Goldsmith had three cases dealt with on July 23.  The first speeding offence heard was committed on February 20 this year in Richmond. He had exceeded 30mph on Lower Mortlake Road, a restricted road, while driving a Toyota. He got a £155 fine and was disqualified for two months. ‘For a speeding offence on December 5 last year on Hammersmith Road again he got another £155 fine and a two-month ban. ‘The third offence was for speeding the day before, December 4, on the same road. He was driving the same Toyota over 30mph in a restricted road. ‘He got a £155 fine, had to pay a £20 victim surcharge and was ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs. His licence was endorsed with three penalty points and he was disqualified for six months. The disqualifications will run concurrently, with the total ban lasting six months.’ Philip Goose, of road safety charity Brake, said: ‘Speed limits exist for one simple reason: they save lives. ‘Regardless of whether you are somebody with responsibility for deciding the laws on our roads or not, drivers should take personal responsibility for their actions and stick well within the limit.’ Yesterday, the housekeeper at Goldsmith’s home by the exclusive Richmond Park said he was on holiday in the countryside and wouldn’t be returning for a few days.","Goldsmith caught breaking the limit in a Toyota twice on the same road .

"Victim: Lacey Gruntorad, 22, was killed after a car backed into her classroom and ran her over . It has been revealed that a 22-year-old student who was killed when an elderly driver backed into their classroom had just switched to that fatal seat moments before the accident. Lacey Gruntorad had moved to different seat closer to the instructor because she knew that the teacher would be talking about massage therapy during the next portion of the class. A police report from the investigators in Gilbert, Arizona has shed new light on the wreckage of the crash at Spa Prima that left Ms Gruntorad dead and two others suffered severe but non-fatal injuries. The 87-year-old driver has not been identified, but she was believed to have accidentally hit the gas pedal rather than the brake, causing the September 27 crash. 'She repeated several times that she was thinking of that poor young person being gone now because of her,' the police report stated according to the Arizona Republic. The woman 'asked God for help' and said 'she did not know how she was going to live since some parents lost a child because of her.' The instructor who was in the classroom, Melinda Keeling, is thought to be the first one to realize that Lacey's last- minute seat switch was a fatal one. Accident: Police determined that there was not enough evidence for the 87-year-old driver to face any criminal charges over the September 27 incident . Young: Friends say that Lacey was excited about the massage therapy course she was taking and had only started it three weeks before the accident . Ms Keeling, who's arm was broken during . the incident, was searching for her students in the aftermath and . realized Lacey was the only one missing. 'It dawned on her where Lacey was sitting was directly in front of where the car came in (to the classroom). (Keeling) said she started to get sick at the time,' the police report stated. The massage therapy program had only been started three weeks before the incident, and Lacey was the only student who did not live to complete the course. 'She's been excited for a while to get into school, to further her life and be ready for the future. She had so many plans,' family friend Brandon Sharp told My Fox Phoenix. Remorse: The elderly driver, who has not been identified, was visibly upset at the scene and said that she did not know how she would be able to live knowing that she had killed the young woman . Investigators ruled that drugs and alcohol were not factors in the accident and as a result, police will not press charges since there was not enough evidence of negligent or intentional motives. According to the Arizona Republic, the driver told police that she had driven to the shopping center in order to take a friend to a nearby bank. The friend had just recently suffered a stroke and was unable to drive themself. The driver also had to pick up her own cholesterol medication before returning back to the retirement community where she lives.","Woman, 87, accidentally backed her car into a classroom in Arizona, killing one student and injuring several others .

"A woman who killed another motorist when she pulled out of a traffic queue without looking later discovered the victim was her sister, a court heard yesterday. Rosie-Ann Stone, 20, has gone on trial at Hull Crown Court in East Yorkshire accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone by careless driving. The incident began as Rosie-Ann’s Vauxhall Astra and Jennie’s Peugeot 206 were in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165, in East Yorkshire, between Hull and Bridlington, the jury was told. Court case: Rosie-Ann Stone's (left) Vauxhall Astra and Jennie Stone's (right) Peugeot 206 were in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165, in East Yorkshire, between Hull and Bridlington, the jury was told . Rosie-Ann allegedly pulled out of the . queue to overtake the truck without looking behind, and did not see that . her sister, who was further back in the line of traffic, had also . pulled out to overtake. The . jury of six men and six women was told how witnesses saw both cars . side-by-side at one point, leaving both vehicles scuffed. Soon after, . Jennie hit a crash barrier and lost control while travelling at 'over 60mph', Mr Sharp said. Jonathan . Sharp, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘Her car veered back to the correct . side of the road, in front of the lorry, and then it went off the road. There it ran into a tree at the roadside. ‘The impact was very great and the car . was badly damaged. Sadly, Jennie sustained multiple injuries and was . killed. The young driver who pulled out without looking is the . defendant, Rosie-Ann Stone. Trial: Rosie-Ann Stone (centre) arrives at Hull Crown Court, where she is accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone by careless driving on the A165, in East Yorkshire, between Hull and Bridlington . ‘It . is right you know at the outset of this case that the other driver who . died was, by tragic coincidence, the defendant’s elder sister, Jennie . Stone.’ Rosie-Ann denies one . charge of causing death by careless driving. She sat in the dock . listening to the prosecution opening today watched by many members of . her family in the public gallery. The . jury was told the incident happened on a single carriageway section of . the A165 near the village of Fraisthorpe at about 9.15am on February 18 . last year. Sisters: Rosie-Ann (left) and Jennie Stone (right). Rosie-Ann allegedly pulled out of a queue to overtake a truck without looking behind . Mr Sharp said it happened on an exceptionally straight section of the road known as a good place to overtake speed-restricted lorries. The prosecutor said the two sisters were travelling on the road in separate cars 'because Jennie had recently moved to Skipsea and Rosie-Ann had been helping her there'. Mr Sharp said: 'The defendant, quite simply, had not looked behind her before she began her manoeuvre. If she had, she would have seen that the blue Peugeot being driven by her sister Jennie had also pulled out and had started an overtaking manoeuvre of her own. 'She was, quite lawfully, herself moving up the queue and intending to pass the lorry.' He told the jury that an accident investigator found Rosie-Ann would have had a clear view of her sister's car if she had looked behind. He said the defendant told police that she 'had pulled out to overtake, into the path of her sister'. Mr Sharp said that in police interviews, Rosie-Ann 'admitted she did not check over her shoulder before pulling out and had not adjusted her door mirrors ever since she bought her car a month before.' Timothy Snowden, who was driving a car in front, saw the collision in his rear view mirror. He told the court: ‘In my mirror I saw the lorry and two cars abreast of each other. The Peugeot and the Astra then collided. I’m pretty sure of that. I could not see exactly which part of the cars struck. 'The collision did cause the car on the outside to hit the barrier. It went in front of the lorry then tried to straighten up and lost control and skidded. ‘It struck a tree. I stopped immediately and called an ambulance from my phone. I went back to the scene and gave assistance. It all happened extremely quickly.’ The case was adjourned until tomorrow morning.

"If practice makes perfect, Harry Kartz should be a flawless driver. After all, the 100-year-old Bomber Command veteran has been on the road since 1927. But, as a TV documentary profiling Britain’s oldest motorists reveals, his skills may alarm some fellow drivers. Scroll down for video . Harry Kartz, 100, hasn't taken a test despite driving for 86 years, and insists that he won't give up his car despite a new documentary showing him mounting a curb and drifting out of lanes while on the road . Mary Walker, another 100-year-old driver to feature on the programme, says what most annoys her about people going too slowly, before refusing to disclose how fast she drives . Video courtesy of ITV . The great-grandfather from Solihull is shown forgetting his indicators, mounting the pavement – shouting ‘b***** the kerb’ as he does so – and even drifting into the wrong lane during the programme. Because compulsory tests were not introduced until 1935, he has never had to take a driving exam in 86 years on the road. Although drivers over 70 need to reapply for their licences every three years, their skills and their eyesight are not automatically reassessed and it is up to them to confirm they are still capable. There are 209 motorists aged 100 and over still on Britain’s roads. Asked if he would ever give up driving, Mr Kartz, a former chairman of Aston Villa football club, replied: ‘When I’ve got to the stage when I’m not ready [to react to] other people’s actions. I don’t want to drive like an old man. ‘I’m not an old man. I’ve got my licence until 2016 – but I don’t think I’ve got a licence for myself until 2016, I think I shall be gone before then.’ Mr Kartz, whose wife Dorothy died in 2012 after 72 years of marriage, admits writing off three cars in his lifetime, but insists he is safer now than he has ever been. Although he has never had his driving formally assessed, he is often put through his paces by his son John, 69. Searson Thompson, 102, lives in Aberdyfi, Wales, and says he would be stranded without his car . There are currently 209 motorists on Britain's roads aged 100 and over including Ken and Edna Medlock. Those aged over 70 have to reapply for a licence every three years, but do not have to have skills reassessed . He told the programme that ‘children of ageing drivers do have a responsibility to check everything is going well’, but gave his father the all clear, despite watching him mount the kerb and drift into the wrong lane. Mr Kartz is one of the motorists starring in ITV’s 100 Year Old Drivers, broadcast tonight at 8pm. Also featured is retired teacher Mary Walker, 100, who admitted flouting speed limits, saying: ‘It’s exhilarating, going fast. People that drive slowly, they frustrate you. How fast do I like to go? I don’t think I ought to answer that.’ Searson Thompson, 102, who lives in Aberdyfi, Wales, said he would be stranded without his car. ‘I drive because I’m completely self-sufficient,’ he said. ‘If I were to stop driving now, I’d vegetate.’ The number of drivers keeping their licence past 70 is rising, up from 3.9million in 2012 to 4.1million this year. Those over 90 still driving has risen from 71,259 in 2012 to 77,423. Though older drivers are viewed as more dangerous, this is not borne out by the figures. In 2012 one out of every 181 licence holders under 30 was the driver in an accident, compared to one out of every 526 motorists over 70. The DVLA said: ‘All drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any conditions which might affect their driving.’","There are currently 209 drivers aged 100 or over on Britain's roads .

"A couple of farmers have built the world's first bed and breakfast out of a 1960s milk float after renovating the inside of the vehicle to create a mobile hotel. Emma Collinson and her partner Stuart Billinghurst have transformed the 50-year-old into a £95-a-night love shack complete with a double bed, shower, toilet and lounge area. The couple hope to welcome guests to float which is kept on their alpaca farm in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, by next Easter. The couple have spent over £1,000 building the world's first b&b built out of a milk float after buying this 1960s vehicle from a milkman . After purchasing the vehicle for just £500 from a milkman in Bath, the couple spent over £1,000 remodelling its interior to even include a cooking area and sink among other mod-cons. The couple, who offer courses in husbandry at the farm, even appeared on Channel 4 to show off their efforts. Ms Collinson, who ran a gym in Plymouth before turning her hand to design said: 'We only have our static park home here on the farm so it would be . impossible for people to stay. 'But when the courses are on for more than one . day it is often good for those doing them to spend longer on the farm . so they get the feel for it. 'Stuart used to own a milk float and even went to work in one. The couple paid £500 for the vehicle when they bought it from a milkman in Bath before beginning renovations . With the help of committed friends, the couple were able to complete work on the float over five weekends . A lounge in the cab area is one of the b&b's more luxurious features. The couple spent £1,051 working on the float . 'This gave us the idea, so we tried to get hold of that one but we weren't able to so we got this one instead. 'We managed to do all the work over just five weekends, it was a really crazy time but we had lots of friends who pitched in. 'I fought with Stuart to have a loo and he wanted a shower so we worked out a way to attach both to the back. 'There is a sink under the bed which folds up. In the cab there are seats and the steering wheel is still there and all the buttons. 'That is my favourite bit - being able to sit in the cab with a cup of tea. The couple run husbandry courses on their alpaca farm in Cornwall and wanted to provide guests somewhere comfortable to stay . A double bed which can be flipped upwards conceals a small cooking area and sink in the float which costs up to £95-a-night to rent . Mr Billinghurst used to work in a milk float himself and had aspirations of owning one when the couple decided to purchase theirs for £500 . The couple are thrilled to have built the world's first b&b from a milk float. Ms Collinson's favourite feature of the vehicle is the cab where 'you can have a cup of tea' (right) 'In total it has cost us £1,051.09 to refit it and it will be only be available during the summer months. 'It is kind of like glamping as the sides around the bed is a canopy which can be rolled down. 'We will provide the breakfast which will be produce from the farm as much as possible. 'It is just something really different, I never imagined I would be doing this. I'm quite proud that we own the world's first, and only milk float B&B. 'It will stay in the field where the alpacas are as it doesn't have a motor and hopefully make people feel like they are away from it all.' To stay in Luna the milk float from Sunday-Thursday it costs £75-per-a-night, while weekend nights will set you back £95.","Emma Collinson and Stuart Billinghurst bought the float for £500 .

"Supermarkets have begun a new fuel price war after Sainsbury's announced it will slash the cost of diesel and petrol by up to 5p a litre from tomorrow. Asda quickly followed suit, announcing it will also cut 1p from the price of petrol and 2p from the price of diesel from tomorrow, putting the pressure on other big retailers such as Tesco and Morrisons. The change in price reflects a drop in the price of wholesale crude oil, and a strengthening of the pound following a no vote in the Scottish referendum. Scroll down for video . Sainsbury's has announced it is cutting the price of petrol and diesel by up to 5p a litre from tomorrow, leading to Asda promising a cut of 1p on petrol and 2p on diesel . RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'The wholesale price of both petrol and diesel has been low for around three months and as a result motorists have been enjoying some the cheapest prices for over three years. 'This cut will take us to a new low, the likes of which we haven’t seen since late 2010, early 2011 when the price of petrol and diesel unfortunately jumped by 10p a litre in just a few months. 'Since the Scottish referendum the pound has rallied against the dollar which has created a much-appreciated downward pressure on fuel prices which are traded in dollars. 'It’s great news for motorists that this is being swiftly passed on by retailers at the pumps.' AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'A 5p cut in the price of petrol, lopping £2.50 off the cost of filling a typical fuel tank, will be particularly welcome as families get back to school runs.' Inflation fell 1.5 per cent on the consumer price index last month, driven largely by cuts to fuel and food prices in the supermarkets, easing the pressure on squeezed household budgets . The fresh round of price cuts will also come as more good news to Chancellor George Osborne. Earlier this month it was revealed that inflation dropped 1.5 per cent to a four and a half year low, thanks in large part to supermarket price wars on food and fuel. It means inflation, measured on the consumer price index (CPI), has been below its target of 2 per cent for eight months in a row - the longest run since before the recession in 2005. As well as being good news for shoppers, the news may also help those with mortgages and other loans, as it eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank has set rates at the historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than five years, and analysis believed they may have increased that to 0.75 in February next year. However, with inflation continuing to fall, that may now be delayed until the second financial quarter of next year, according to IHS Global Insight.","Asda also announces it is cutting petrol by 1p a litre and diesel by 2p a litre .
