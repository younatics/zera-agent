"The number of places where mobile phone users receive a patchy signal is to be halved after the Government struck a deal with networks. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the legally binding agreement would require all four main mobile operators to increase places with full signals from 69 per cent to 85 per cent of geographic areas by 2017. It will mean the firms are required to make a £5billion investment to improve infrastructure – with more masts and sharing between operators. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the deal 'will give the UK the world-class mobile phone coverage it needs' Mr Javid said the agreement, which will be policed by regulator Ofcom, will mean Britain having some of the best coverage of any major European country. He had threatened to change the law to introduce a system of ‘national roaming’ that would allow phone users to hop between different networks unless the companies agreed to end the scandal of signal blackspots. Currently, poor coverage leaves millions unable to make calls or receive data. Campaigners complain that in parts of the country, reception is worse than in India and Malawi. So-called ‘not-spots’, where there is no signal at all, are mostly in remote, rural communities. Partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others do not, are much more widespread – affecting more than a fifth of the country in terms of geography. Prime Minister David Cameron is understood to have become increasingly frustrated by dropped calls in his Witney constituency – and also in Downing Street, which is a notorious mobile phone blackspot even though it is in the heart of the capital. The agreement struck last night by Mr Javid will mean cutting total not-spots, where there is currently no mobile coverage, by two-thirds. The number of partial not-spots will come down by a half, the Government says. No cash payments will be made by Government to the mobile networks as part of the agreement, but officials concede that Ofcom may decide to cut the annual licence fees paid by mobile networks as a result of their new obligations. Ministers have also announced a £150 million programme to help take mobile coverage to the areas of the UK that have no coverage at all. Government buildings will also be offered as sites for new mobile phone masts – potentially opening up hundreds of locations to in areas where is has been previously difficult to roll out network coverage. Downing Street, which is a notorious mobile phone blackspot even though it is in the heart of the capital . Mr Javid said: ‘I am pleased to have secured a legally binding deal with the four mobile networks. Too many parts of the UK regularly suffer from poor mobile coverage leaving them unable to make calls or send texts. ‘Government and businesses have been clear about the importance of mobile connectivity, and improved coverage, so this legally binding agreement will give the UK the world-class mobile phone coverage it needs and deserves. The £5bn investment from the mobile networks in the UK’s infrastructure will help drive this Government’s long-term economic plan.’ EE CEO Olaf Swantee said: ‘EE is focused on bringing the best voice and data service to its customers across the UK, and only last week announced 1,500 unconnected villages will soon benefit from EE coverage. This agreement ensures that our customers are able to stay connected in even more places up and down the country.’ Derek McManus, chief operating officer of O2, said: ‘A partnership between government and the mobile operators is required to maximise coverage across the UK, so this agreement is a good outcome for our customers. It will support investment in our network, while ensuring that strong competition remains between the different networks.’ The Federation of Small Businesses found 71 per cent of firms rated mobile phones as crucial or very important to their business. Some 51 per cent said their staff had a problem with mobile coverage very or quite often.","Mobile operators must make £5bn investment to improve infrastructure .

"The three men charged with the rape and murder of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo showed up to court Wednesday and they brought their smiling mugs along for the cameras. Zach Adams and Jason Autry are the two men charged with Bobo's kidnapping and murder. Dylan Adams, Zach Adams' brother, is charged with rape in the case which dates back to April 2011, when Bobo vanished near her Parsons home. Zach Adams and Autry's laid back attitude may have stemmed from what court observers in Tennessee see as a weak case built by Decatur prosecutors. All smiled: Jason Autry, charged with 20-year-old Hollly Bobo's kidnapping and murder, smiles during a hearing Wednesday . Not a care in the world: Zachary Adams (center) is also charged in Bobo's murder. Here, he smiles as he talks with his attorney after a hearing Wednesdak . Not kidding around: Decatur County Circuit Judge Creed McGinley warned the attorney general to come up with some evidence soon as defense attorneys for the accused men revealed they've still seen none of it . Attorneys defending both men accused of murder revealed the Attorney General has yet to show them even a shred of evidence in their clients' guilt, which angered Judge Charles McGinley. Zachary Adams was indicted in March and Jason Autry in April in the killing of Holly Bobo. In court on Wednesday, Adams' attorney, Jennifer Lynn Thompson told the judge, 'I still have very little understanding of what he's accused of doing.' Autry's attorney, Fletcher Long, was even more direct. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, he said of Autry, 'I'm at a loss as to why he was even charged.' District Attorney General Matt Stowe said after the hearing that the defense attorneys would have their evidence soon. In court, he told the judge the state is waiting on laboratory analysis of evidence stemming from the September discovery of Bobo's remains. Mystery: Bobo vanished in 2011 near her family's home in Parsons, Tennessee. No physical evidence was found until Bobo's skull was discovered in the woods by ginseng hunters in September . Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap . But Decatur County Circuit Judge Creed McGinley said he was losing patience with the delay. He ordered the state to begin turning over evidence in a form the defense attorneys can use. He also ordered Stowe to decide soon whether he intends to seek the death penalty. Also on Wednesday, attorneys for the defendants told the judge they plan to request that the trials be moved out of Decatur County. McGinley said he would likely approve that request, when it comes. 'I don't think there is any way this case could be tried in Decatur County with an impartial jury given the huge amount of publicity,' he said, pointing out the courtroom crammed with interested onlookers, several of whom were wearing 'Justice for Holly' T-shirts. The onlookers included Bobo's family and their pastor, Don Franks. Zachary's brother Dylan Adams was also in the courtroom Wednesday, where authorities posted extra security over fears the suspects could be attacked. Dylan Adams is charged with rape in the case . Jason Autry, center, is escorted to a hearing Wednesday along with extra security . Will they be convicted? Zachary Adams, front, listens during a hearing Wednesday.

Asked about the statements from defense attorneys that the state does not have sufficient evidence against the suspects, Franks said he and the family were very confident in the work that law enforcement has done. No arrests were made in the case until nearly three years after Bobo disappeared from her home in the small West Tennessee community of Parsons in April 2011. Her brother told police he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her into the woods, but despite numerous searches of the area, Bobo's remains were not discovered until September, when ginseng hunters accidentally stumbled across them. 'Just keep the family in your prayers,' Franks said. 'That's the main thing.'

"Social network billionaire Sean Parker has announced that he is donating $24 million to an allergy research center at Stanford University after battling food allergies for much of his life. The 35-year-old former Facebook president and Napster co-founder says his aim is to find a lasting cure for the medical condition. Food sensitivities to nuts, shellfish, avocado and other foods have landed the tech whiz in hospital at least 14 times in the last six years, including once while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos. Finding a cure: Social network billionaire Sean Parker has announced that he is donating $24 million to an allergy research center at Stanford University after battling food allergies for much of his life . He said the problem also meant he missed most of his final year in high school. Now that Parker is the father of two small children, he says he's even more eager to find a solution. As yet, neither his two-year-old daughter or his two-week-old son have allergies but that could change over time. 'Now that I'm a father, I'm sympathetic to what my parents went through,' Parker said Wednesday. 'It's terrifying for parents to see their child go through anaphylactic shock because of an allergic reaction.' It's hoped the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy Research will open within the next two years at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The complex will focus on understanding the dysfunctions of the immune system that result in allergic reactions. Grand plan: It's hoped the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy Research will open within the next two years at the Stanford University School of Medicine (pictured) It will also develop  treatments  through laboratory and data research, clinical trials and community outreach. Dr. Kari Nadeau, an esteemed immunology researcher who focuses on allergies on children and adults, will lead the institute. Nadeau has developed an allergy treatment that involves giving patients micro-doses of the allergen and increasing the amount ingested - over months or years - to build tolerance overtime. 'The goal is to be able to achieve desensitization in a couple of weeks,' Parker said. He concluded: 'We have been applying Band-Aids for decades by using antihistamines to treat symptoms instead of going after the root cause of allergies.'","The 35-year-old former Facebook president and Napster co-founder says his aim is to find a lasting cure for allergies .

"Adam Smith killed himself after he was subjected to insults from internet trolls on a video he posted . A teenager who was bullied by online trolls posted a heartbreaking video on YouTube before killing himself, an inquest heard. Adam Smith, 19, who had learning difficulties, was bombarded with spiteful remarks and accused of plagiarism over a short story he put on a website. In response to the vicious bullying, he posted a video on YouTube entitled ‘I’m sorry’ where he apologised for any misunderstanding. But he was lambasted again by cruel users, who mocked him saying his speech problems were so bad it made them laugh. Days later he was seen crying as he walked to a railway line near his home, where he was hit by a two-carriage train. At the inquest into his death, the coroner condemned YouTube as ‘dangerous in the extreme’ and said vulnerable people who used it were at risk of harm. Alan Walsh said: ‘I do believe that YouTube and some of the exchange of information and communication by comment, without knowing the individual’s reaction to the comment, is dangerous. ‘Adam was very dependent on his computer and the internet, in particular YouTube, for social communication and enjoyment but sadly he would then be susceptible to judgment by people who never met him, did not know him and were not aware of the problems he had during his formative years. I see that as a very dangerous environment.’ Earlier the inquest heard Adam had learning difficulties and problems with his speech and memory. But he attended college and had hoped to one day own a café. In his spare time, he enjoyed writing fantasy stories about the characters from the children’s cartoon My Little Pony on a fiction website. He would spend a lot of time on the internet and had a webcam set up in his room to speak to friends he made online. But in May, he was ‘struck off’ from the website over claims one of his stories had been copied from another user. Scroll down for video . Pain: When the 19-year-old was accused of copying another 'fan fiction' enthusiast's story and threatened with expulsion from a website he posted the upsetting video entitled: 'I'm sorry' on YouTube . Less than two weeks after he uploaded the video, Adam was seen crying as he walked to a railway line . Hounded: The railway bridge  where Adam killed himself. He had learning difficulties and problems with speech and long term memory . His mother Amanda, who lives in Atherton, Greater Manchester, with her husband Joseph, said her son was ‘upset and angry’ and had begun to receive nasty comments. On May 11, he recorded a five-minute video to apologise. Looking forlorn, he said: ‘I know the people out there think I’m a d***. It’s just I don’t want a bad reputation on me. ‘I know I read the comments. I know I’m a coward. I know I deleted the comments. ‘I am scared. I hate getting a bad reputation. I just want to say I’m sorry.’ But he was further targeted by cruel messages about his speech problems, one of which read: ‘I don’t recommend you to make videos with talking ... otherwise I’ll just lol (laugh out loud).’ Another commenter said: ‘I didn’t understand a single f****** thing,’ while a third posted: ‘Umm ... no offence, but you shouldn’t skip English lessons at school dude.’ A screen grab of Adam Smith's tumblr page. Online he called himself a 'Brony', a term for a fan of children's TV show My Little Pony, and wrote fantasy stories about the franchise under the name 'Galaxystar' A 'Brony' (a combination of 'bro' and 'pony') is a male fan, typically aged 18 to 35, of the children's TV show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. The cartoon, about magical talking horses, found an unlikely audience among these men, who are reportedly drawn to the characters, stories, and animation style. Though initially an ironic trend drawing humour from the concept of grown men enjoying a show aimed at young girls, the fans developed an appreciation of the critically-lauded show. They show their appreciation by creating internet memes, writing fan fiction, and creating music, art, and videos based on the show. Grief: Adam Smith's parents Joseph and Mandy Smith. In a statement his father said Adam did not have many friends and would spend all of his time on his own or on his computer . A childhood picture of Adam. He left a note saying he could not carry on any more and that he could not be himself . On May 24, Adam’s parents returned home from a shopping trip to find him missing. His mother then discovered a note in a bundle of papers on his bed. That day, the couple were contacted by police who said that Adam’s body had been found. It emerged that the teenager had posted a last video on May 20 called ‘My mind is made up. What is done is done’. He said: ‘I know there’s certain people, I know who you are, and yes, you can say all those things you want.’ Police believe bullies posted more vile comments in the hours before Adam’s death. They later examined 73 videos uploaded by the teenager, but found that most messages had probably been deleted after news spread of the tragedy. Recording a verdict of suicide at the hearing in Bolton, Mr Walsh said websites such as YouTube do not take into account that those using them may be vulnerable. He added: ‘They do not take account of sensitivity and the reaction of people who have received these comments. The evidence I have heard is that Adam was a sensitive young man.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch – see www.samaritans.org.","Adam Smith, 19, was bullied by internet users over his 'fan fiction'

"Her sense of humour, loyalty and leadership are what friends of Katrina Dawson will remember most about her. She was a wife, mother, sister and colleague, but to her childhood friends she was 'Tree' who was a prefect with a sweet tooth and had a 'wicked sense of humour'. Sisters Harriet and Bee Alexander lived next door to Ms Dawson in Randwick - in Sydney's eastern suburbs - and remembered how she would enter their backyard via a rope ladder thrown over her fence. Scroll down video . Friends of Katrina Dawson - who died on Tuesday following the Martin Place siege - have paid tribute to their loved one . The Alexanders and a friend named Clare recalled how Ms Dawson's responsibility as a school leader did not stop her from indulging in lollies with fellow students after school, despite the fact eating in the Ascham School uniform was forbidden, Harriet wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. 'So it was with sad stomachs that we stepped off the bus on the day that Tree was inevitably made a prefect,' she said. 'Surely now she must observe the school rules. But incredibly, she led us straight back into the corner store. Her commitment to friends and lollies trumped her commitment to the badge.' Her friends also spoke of her 'generosity and loyalty' which was described as 'legendary'. Ms Dawson - who reportedly tried to protect her friend from gunshots during the siege - has been remembered as a 'very funny, loving person, very popular, very caring person' She was one of 17 hostages who were held for almost 17 hours across Monday and Tuesday . This commitment to her loved ones was with her even in the face of death when the barrister and 16 other hostages were detained at Lindt Cafe at Sydney's Martin Place for 17 hours by self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis. In her last act of friendship, there have been reports Ms Dawson tried to protect her colleague Julie Taylor who was pregnant at the time from the rain of gunshots when police finally decided to raid the cafe in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Ms Dawson, 38, was one of two people who died in the siege along with Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34. Friend Clare said Ms Dawson 'would have been the one looking after everyone'. But friends say if she liked coffee she might not have been down to the cafe to get her morning pick me up at 9.15am. Bee said it was Ms Dawson's 'only flaw' and Harriet added the mother-of-three would have 'appreciated the irony, even on the day of her death'. Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson was one of three people killed when police ended the siege . The trio of friends also revealed Ms Dawson tragically died on the same day as her mother's birthday. Senior Counsel Jeremy Stoljar worked closely with Katrina at Eight Selborne chambers and was not only a mentor but a close friend as well. He described her as a 'terrific barrister' with 'first class legal skills'. 'She was a very funny, loving person, very popular, very caring person. I can't believe we're having this conversation,' Mr Stoljar told Fairfax Media. Her ability to juggle her family life and her successful career sparked many aspiring female barristers to seek her guidance on how to do the same. Despite graduating from Edgecliffe's Ascham - in Sydney's east - 10 years ago, Ms Dawson's legal skills were put to good use mentoring young students at her alma mater. She remained a dedicated member of the school community, with her eldest daughter Chloe - who had just finished Year 2 this year - and her younger daughter Sasha set to start at the all-girls institution next year. Their deaths have sparked an outpouring of grief from across Australia and the world. Martin Place has become a shrine of flowers dedicated to the pair . Friend Clare said Ms Dawson - who leaves behind her husband, Paul, and her three children - 'would have been the one looking after everyone'. Ms Dawson's demonstrated leadership earned her respect wherever she went as well as her benevolent nature. 'She was generous in giving of her time and this year Katrina used her skills as a barrister to guide our senior students in preparing for mock trials,' Ascham's Head of School Andrew Powell, who 'knew her well', said in a statement. On social media, school friends posted about their sadness at Ms Dawson's death and their admiration of the 'gorgeous, bright woman'. 'So incredibly sad. My heart is breaking for her children & her family, and send my dearest love to them. Katrina, your poise & clever wit is something I will always remember,' one friend wrote. Another person said: 'So very sad. Such a beautiful woman with astounding intelligence. Thinking of her family, friends and colleagues at this time.' 'Rest in peace to such a gorgeous, bright woman. I will always remember her sitting on stage at assembly in committee [student council]. Such a heavy heart for her family, my thoughts are with them,' a former Ascham student posted. Ms Dawson died on Tuesday morning after she was taken to hospital from the scene. A policewoman told Daily Mail Australia she was unable to confirm the circumstances of how the mother-of-three died as it was up to the coroner to rule on her death.","Friends called the barrister 'Tree' who had 'clever wit' and loved lollies .

"Cheap gas is good news for the American economy, but bad news for Tesla Motors and its electric cars. A top analyst slashed his earnings projections for the California-based auto company - estimating that Tesla will sell 40percent fewer cars in the next five years than he had previously forecast. Tesla's stock has fallen 31percent since hitting a high in September. On Monday is closed below $200 a share fro the first time since May - hitting a seven-month low. Oil prices have plunged more than 40 percent during that time period and gas is down to $2 a gallon in many states. Drop: Tesla's stock has lost 31percent of its value since September - when oil prices began to plummet. It hit a seven-month low this week . Analysts believe that sales of the $35,000 Tesla Model 3, pictured here in an unofficial rendering, will be hurt by the low price of fuel . Investors are betting that cheap gas will make electric cars less attractive to most buyers. Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley auto analyst who has previously been optimistic about Tesla, revised his forecasts of the company's sales today. He said he believes that Tesla will sell only 300,000 cars by 2020 - far fewer than the 500,000 he initially predicted. Most of the revised estimate revolves around the new Tesla Model 3, the much cheaper consumer version of the company's  Tesla S roadster - which can cost up to $105,000. Mr Jonas says he believes fewer people will be interested in buying electric cars when gas is cheap - especially the new Model 3. The price of crude oil has plummeted 40percent in recent months - down to just over $55 a barrel - as the market is flooded with oil from Saudi Arabia and the shale fracking boom in the US . Tesla says the Model 3, which is due out in 2017, will cost $35,000 - making it affordable to a much wider segment of the car market. 'While nobody buying a Model S today (for nearly $105,000) is doing so to save on their monthly expenses, the longer-term story is far more dependent on the volume success of the Model 3. Oil price is a factor for Model 3,' Mr Jonas wrote, according to CNN Money. Mr Jonas also predicts that the Model 3 will cost closer to $60,000 by the time it is released - making it affordable for a much smaller segment of the market. Mr Jonas said he believes that the long-term success of the company relies on it successfully selling high volumes of cheaper electric cars - rather than cornering the market on high-end electrics. However, he still believes Tesla is a good investment - though he cut his price projections to $290 a share from $320. Shares of Tesla, started by billionaire PayPal founder Elon Musk, rose slightly on Wednesday morning, hitting $202.85 before noon.","Tesla's stock has fallen 31percent since September as investors bet low oil prices will make electric cars less attractive .

"Hamas should be removed from the EU's 'terrorist list', the organisation's second highest court has ruled, leading to widespread outrage. The court defended the ruling, saying the process which saw Hamas put on the list in the first place was flawed, as the decision was based on media reports and not analysis of facts. The EU has said it still considers Hamas to be a terrorist group, despite the court's verdict, and may appeal. Not terrorists: The General Court of the EU has ruled that Hamas can no longer be included on the EU's terrorist list as the process which saw it put on the list in 2001 was flawed . Palestinian members of al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, descend while being harnessed to zip lines as smoke engulfs a building during a military parade marking the 27th anniversary of Hamas' founding, in Gaza City on Sunday . Deputy Hamas chief Moussa Abu Marzouk said the EU court's ruling is is a correction of a historical mistake the European Union had made . 'The EU continues to consider Hamas a terrorist organisation,' European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said today, adding that the EU will consider its response to the ruling. The General Court of the European Union, the bloc's second highest tribunal located in Luxembourg , said EU member states could maintain their freeze on Hamas's assets for three months, to give time for further review or to appeal the verdict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke shortly after the ruling was announced, demanding the EU immediately restore Hamas to its terrorism blacklist. 'We are not satisfied with the European Union's explanation that the removal of Hamas from its list of terrorist organisations is a 'technical matter',' Netanyahu said in a statement from Jerusalem today. 'We expect it (the EU) to put Hamas back on the list forthwith given that it is understood by all that Hamas -- a murderous terrorist organisation, the covenant of which specifies the destruction of Israel as its goal -- is an inseparable part of this list,' he said. Conflict: The EU has said it still considers Hamas (pictured) to be a terrorist group, despite the court's verdict, and may appeal to have it put back on the list . Not in the clear: EU member states can maintain their freeze on Hamas's assets for three months, to give time for further review or to appeal the verdict, the court ruled . Celebration: Members of al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, take part in a military parade marking the 27th anniversary of Hamas founding on Sunday . Israel's protests were unsurprisingly followed by cheers from Hamas in the Gaza strip, as representatives welcomed the verdict. 'The decision is a correction of a historical mistake the . European Union had made,' Deputy Hamas chief Moussa Abu Marzouk said. Anger: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured on Monday, has demanded the EU immediately restore Hamas to its terrorism blacklist . 'Hamas is a resistance movement and it has a . natural right according to all international laws and standards . to resist the occupation,' Marzouk said. The EU court did not consider the merits of whether Hamas . should be classified as a terror group, but reviewed the . original decision-making process. This, it said, did not include . the considered opinion of competent authorities, but rather . relied on media and Internet reports. 'The court stresses that those annulments, on fundamental . procedural grounds, do not imply any substantive assessment of . the question of the classification of Hamas as a terrorist . group,' the court said in a statement. It added that if an appeal was brought before the EU's top . court, the European Court of Justice, the freeze of Hamas funds . should continue until the legal process was complete. Appeals, which can only be based on points of law, may be . brought within two months. The appeal itself would typically . last about a year and a half. The ruling comes just days after Hamas celebrated its 27th anniversary with an elaborate military parade through Gaza City. Hundreds of masked and armed members of al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, marched through the city on Sunday, holding rifles and mortar shells. Hamas holds sway in the Gaza Strip and its founding charter . calls for the destruction of Israel. It has regularly clashed . with Israel, most recently in a 50-day war this summer. Most Western countries, including the United States, agree . with Israel that it is a terror organisation, pointing to . indiscriminate rocket strikes out of Gaza and waves of suicide . attacks, primarily between 1993 and 2005. Hamas says it is a legitimate resistance movement and . contested the European Union's decision in 2001 to include it on . the EU terrorist list.","European Court rules Hamas should be removed from EU terrorist list .

"Hundreds of Russian oligarchs are preparing to buy swathes of ultra-expensive property in London to protect their wealth against the country's crumbling economy, experts have said. In the past few days six buyers have contacted luxury London agents Beauchamp Estates and requested £100million homes in upmarket Mayfair, Belgravia and Kensington in order to get their money out of Moscow. In the past week Beauchamp has also seen a 10 per cent spike in requests from Russian buyers as panic about an economic collapse spread ahead of yesterday's currency plunge. The new wave of investors will further tighten Russia's grip on London's super-prime market, as they already buy one in five of the capital's most expensive properties. Scroll down for video . Ultra-wealthy Russians are buying up swathes of prime London real estate in the wake of the Russian financial crash yesterday. Flats in One Hyde Park (pictured) are among their target addresses . Two days after the first Russian sanctions came into effect in April, Penthouse D was bought for £140million by an Eastern European, sparking speculation it was a Russian trying to secure their cash . The rouble went into free-fall yesterday as its value dropped by up to 20 per cent against the dollar, an all-time low, causing tech company Apple to suspend sales of its products online today. While ordinary Russian citizens flocked to Ikea today as the budget store warned of price rises, the country's super-elite trained their sights on the London property market. Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said: 'The rouble has seen a massive collapse in value. 'Wealthy Russians are desperate to get their money out of Moscow at present, and we have seen a 10 per cent upturn in Russian clients since the decline in value and the international sanctions biting into the Russian economy. 'I currently have half a dozen Russian clients urgently looking to spend over £20million each on buying a new home in prime Central London. One London estate agent has been called by six Russians in the last few days demanding £100million properties in Belgravia, Mayfair and Knightsbridge (pictured, file image) Yesterday saw 20 per cent wiped off the value of the rouble, leading to a financial exodus from Moscow as oligarchs look to stash their wealth in safe havens such as London (pictured, One Hyde Park) 'For them the address must be Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Regents Park, its got to be a prestigious postcode and ideally a park side or leafy address. 'There has also been a rise in Russians looking at investment properties. Previously it was all end use real estate, but now they are starting to purchase rental investment property and commercial assets in large numbers, which has not been seen from them before.' Alisher Usmanov, Britain's richest man who is worth an estimated £13.3billion, owns a £48million mansion in North London, bought with the profits from his vast steel and telecoms empire. He also owns a 30 per cent stake in Arsenal footaball club, though he has previously complained about not having a seat on the board. Len Blavanik, who amassed an estimated fortune of £11billion through Warner Music Group, owns a house on Kensington's billionaire's row. The mansion, which has a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema and wine cellar underneath it, could be worth  £200million after it was refurbished last year. Across the road from Blavanik lives Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, worth £9.3billion because of his interests in steel and oil. He paid £90million for the home, which includes up to 14 bedrooms. According to Adam Challis, head of residential at JLL,  between 200 and 300 Russian investors could flock to the capital in the next six months looking for an investment. That number could have been far higher, but the British government's stance over Ukraine has driven buyers to Dubai and Cyprus instead, he added. In May this year an Eastern European buyer was said to be behind the purchase of Penthouse D in Hyde Park which sold for record-breaking £140million, despite having no floors, walls or furniture . The timing of the purchase, which went through two days after first round of European and U.S. sanctions against Russia were announced, sparked speculation that the buyer was looking to secure assets abroad. Katya Zenkovich, from the Russian desk at Knight Frank, said that Russians began moving money to London early this summer as word spread of an impending financial collapse. She added: 'For those that have started their search there is no indication they are abandoning their plans. Knight Frank web traffic shows the number of Russians looking at London property was 13 per cent higher in November 2014 than the same month last year. 'The figure was 9.5 per cent up from October, a monthly rise that bucks a trend of previous years when traffic has slowed over the final quarter of the year.' Figures released earlier this year showed that one in five of London's £10million-plus properties are bought by Russians, making them the largest group of foreign buyers, and only just behind Britons, who snap up one in three high-end homes. According to agents Beauchamp Estates the customers are asking for apartments in large, hotel-style developments such as this one in Mayfair . Between 200 and 300 billionaire Russian buyers are expected to come to London in the next six months, according to property experts at JLL . Russians are already buying one in five of London's £10million-plus properties (pictured, file image), with a spike in demand expected in the coming months . In 2011, billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, bought a £90million mansion on the country's most expensive street, a stone's throw from Kensington Palace. His home in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London – known as Billionaires Row – has more than 15 bedrooms and extensive gardens. While the Russian economy has been steadily declining since the start of the year, the current meltdown began yesterday after the country's central bank suddenly hiked interest rates. The dramatic rise, from 10.7 per cent to 17 per cent, was supposed to help shore up the rouble but instead caused investors to panic, sending its value tumbling. Officials at the bank said they have spent $2billion since Monday in an attempt to prop the currency up, which will add to the $78billion they have spent since the beginning of the year. St John's Wood is among the other addresses being sought by Russians looking to get their wealth out of Moscow and into the safe haven of London . Along with a prestigious postcode, such as Knightsbridge (pictured) or Belgravia, the investors are demanding a park side or leafy address . As well as looking to store their cash in residential properties, large numbers of Russians are now looking for investment properties, which is unusual according to property experts .","One estate agent has six buyers who each offered £100million for a house .

"Emergency call handlers   at the largest control centre in Britain are being followed to the toilet - to ensure they do not spend too much time away from their desks, it has been claimed. Workers handling 999 calls to the Metropolitan Police in London have told bosses that they work to a 'five minute' rule when going to the toilet - and that the time they take is sometimes monitored. Those found to be taking longer than the 'allotted time' on a regular basis claim they are sometimes followed to the toilet, where supervisors wait outside until the worker comes out - before 'logging' the time taken. Workers handling 999 calls to the Metropolitan Police in London have told bosses that they work to a 'five minute' rule when going to the toilet - and that the time they take is regularly monitored . The control rooms, staffed by 2,000 police staff and police officers, are based at three locations in London, in Lambeth, Hendon and Bow. Workers have complained to the Police Federation - which represents the UK's 130,000 officers - and the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents 7,500 police staff working for the Met, about the monitored breaks. Staff at the command centres - collectively called the MetCC - handle 999 calls and 101 calls from the public, taking around 4.5million calls each year. Given the huge volume of calls, supervisors at the MetCC are cracking down on time staff and officers spend away from their desks. It is believed the 'monitoring' was put in place after some workers 'took ages' and checked Facebook, Instagram and Twitter on their mobile phones while they were away from their desks. One worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'Of course some workers take the Mick and go to the loo for ages and come back with funny stories about what pals are up to on social media. 'They are the exception rather than the rule and they are behind this ridiculous monitoring that is going on now. Those found to be taking longer than the 'allotted time' on a regular basis claim they are sometimes followed to the toilet, where supervisors wait outside until the worker comes out (file picture) 'There have been some instances when workers have been confronted by supervisors (about how long they have been away from their desk) as soon as they open the loo door.' John Tully, the chair of the Met Police Federation, said he was aware that toilet breaks were 'an issue' for control room workers. He told Police magazine this week: 'I know they are very strict on breaks and have heard about the monitoring of toilet breaks.' He also said that officers at MetCC found it 'extremely difficult' to take holidays and were getting 'completely exhausted'. He added: 'Officers have said that at times it is virtually impossible to go on leave or have any time off, which can lead to people getting completely exhausted.' A spokesman for Scotland Yard confirmed that 'time off the operation floor was monitored', but said it was 'unaware' of supervisors following workers to the toilet. A spokeswoman for the Met's Territorial Policing Unit said it was looking at boosting morale at the MetCC, saying it was organising a 'Christmas jumper day' and 'cake-bake' to raise spirits. She added: 'Control rooms are an unusual policing environment, as the operating procedures of call centres need to be run in conjunction with emergency response.' Chief Superintendent Pippa Mills, who took over the Operation Command Unit (OCU) in March this year, said: 'We have done lots of consultation with officers and staff to identify those issues which would improve morale and working conditions. 'As OCU commander of such a large and diverse team, I value the close but ""critical friend"" relationship I have with the PCS and Federation.' Government guidelines say workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day, if they work more than 6 hours a day. A spokesman from London-based employment law experts Astute HR said although there were 'no specific rules' to say how long people could spend on toilet breaks, employers were obliged to allow people with medical conditions to have adequate time away from their desks. He added that employers, who often set out their rules for toilet breaks in the terms of their contracts, had to be mindful of data protection and health and safety legislation when monitoring workers' activities.","Workers say bosses sometimes check the time they spend on toilet breaks .

"The barristers who represented Man Haron Monis in court just three days before he staged a bloody 17-hour siege work in the same building as victim Katrina Dawson. The gunman's lawyers Guy Renolds SC and David Hume work at Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers, two floors below Eight Selborne Chambers office where Ms Dawson and colleague Julie Taylor work, the Daily Telegraph reported. The building is around the corner from the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place, where Ms Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson were fatally shot and 16 other hostages escaped after a terrifying ordeal at the hands Monis. Scroll down for video . Barristers Guy Renolds SC and David Hume represented Man Haron Monis (pictured) in court on Friday . Mr Hume and Mr Renolds SC work in the same building (pictured) as Monis's victim Katrina Dawson . Three days before he stormed a Sydney cafe with a shotgun Man Haron Monis had an appeal against conviction rejected in the High Court . Last Friday morning, after reluctantly pleading guilty to twelve charges of sending malicious notes disguised as 'sympathy letters' and making phone calls to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, 50-year-old Monis had taken his case to the High Court. But Monis was rebuffed. He had already been rejected by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA). He had already taken his case - that charges of using a postal service or similar to menace, harass or cause offence were unconstitutional - once to the High Court. In February last year, six members of the High Court returned their judgement. It was a split decision, divided evenly between three male judges who agreed with Monis that the charges were unconstitutional. Three female judges ruled that the appeal court decision that the charges against him were constitutional should hold. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family . On Tuesday morning many innocent people were injured and two were tragically killed in the deadly siege . Last Friday Monis went to the High Court again. Represented by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds SC, he made an application to remove the Appeal court decision to the High Court. By 10am, the court's Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler swiftly dismissed his application. Monis, who was not present in the court, was telephoned and told his bid had failed. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family. Following a bitter and vengeful relationship with the children's mother Noleen Hayson Pal after she ended it in 2011, Monis had been charged with intimidating her but was lucky enough to have the charge and an Apprehended Violence Order against him dismissed in May 2012. In April the mother of Monis' children Noleen Hayson Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington . But in April 2013, Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington and seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder. His girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, a Greek Australian Muslim convert was charged with Ms Pal's murder. Ms Droudis was also charged over the hate letters, for aiding and abetting Monis. In September last year, Monis told police he had known Droudis for six years but that their relationship had not begun until May 2013 - the month following Ms Pal's murder. Seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder while his girlfriend Amirah Droudis was charged with Ms Pal's murder . Ms Droudis was due to appeal her charges in court next February, the same months Monis would face a trial on the multiple sex charges, including two of inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. No date had been set for the murder trial. But it was the mark against his name over the poison pen letters which had dominated Monis's thoughts since 2009, as he went from the District Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the High Court and back to the High Court again, only to be rebuffed. Seventy-two hours later, Monis took a shotgun into Martin Place.","On Friday Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis was before High Court .

"With its dainty wooden ticket booths, tiled walls and rickety old trains, Budapest's M1 line must be among the world's most beautiful undergrounds. But that doesn't make it one of the friendliest. We have committed the cardinal subway sin: not 'validating' our tickets (by inserting them into a stamping machine on the platform). The punishment? An 8,000 Forints (£20) fine. Budapest can only get better. Thankfully it does. A Danube delight: Budapest sits prettily on the banks of western Europe's longest river . The Hungarian capital - which divides into the hilly Buda on the Danube's western bank and the flatter, more commercial Pest on the eastern bank - has plenty of architectural splendours and cultural treasures, plus indulgent food and a lively nightlife. The city's cheap prices - around £2 for a pint - attract stag do parties, but fortunately the local bars don't seem to specifically target these groups. We decide to see the main sights by bike and join a cycling tour run by Budapest Bike Breeze called Wheels And Meals. Moments after meeting - and with barely a glance each way - our energetic guide, Adam, leads us full pelt into Budapest's busiest square - Erzsebet Ter. We race around central Pest, stopping every five minutes for Adam to divulge titbits. For example, the Opera House is reminiscent of the Vienna State Opera (though smaller, so as not to outshine the seat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and the magnificent Neo-Gothic Parliament was inspired by Westminster. Now confident whizzing two-wheeled through the city, we speed along the riverfront. Scenes of Hungarian life: Local men focus on the serious pursuit of chess (and try desperately not to drop any pieces) at Budapest's Szechenyi Baths (left); St Stephen's Basilica, on the Pest side of the river (right) The sun is glistening on the Danube, cruise boats are pootling past... when I suddenly fly off my bike and crash to the ground. My boyfriend had somehow managed to wedge his handlebars under mine, thus careering me into the kerb. More embarrassed than injured, we cross the river to the medieval town of Buda, a Unesco World heritage site. Behind the fairytale-like Matthias Church - used as a cattle shed by the invading Turks - is Fisherman's Bastion, whose turrets provide the best views of Pest (and one of the settings for Lord Of The Rings). After a big bowl of goulash soup at the charmingly low-key Drum Cafe, we are back in our saddles. The final hours of our tour take in the wide boulevards of Varosliget district, Heroes' Square and the bizarre Vajdahunyad castle - with its mix of Baroque, Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque styles. A scene from a different era: The city's famous Hotel Astoria Cafe looks like a refugee from another century . Afterwards, we collapse into leather armchairs for coffee and cakes at the city's legendary Gerbeaud Cukraszda café. Hungarians have a reputation for being stand-offish, but with a little persistence, seemingly frosty locals quickly warm up and keenly offer recommendations about their city. Understandably, however, they don't readily discuss life under communist rule. And you will need plenty of energy to tackle the House Of Terror - a museum which commemorates victims of that communist dictatorship, and those of the preceding Nazi years. With all of the explanatory text on the walls in Hungarian, an English audio guide is crucial. Twenty-five minutes' drive away lies another reminder of Hungary's soviet history: Memento Park, the unusual home for a collection of redundant communist statues, which were torn down after the regime collapsed in 1989. Looking from the past to the future: The historic Buda district of the city gazes across at more modern Pest . Here, avoid a guide and do your own background reading instead. The only guide on offer was softly spoken with a thick Hungarian accent and had an infuriating habit of talking as she walked away from the group towards the next statue. Combined with the noisy gravel crunching under 20 tourists' feet and endless overhead planes, the tour was virtually inaudible. More subtle reminders of the nation's difficult history are the abandoned Stock Exchange and National Ballet buildings, plus other crumbling structures now reincarnated as sprawling bars known as 'ruin pubs'. At the end of a frantic weekend, we forgo these watering holes, instead treating ourselves to a soak in the 21 different pools at the Szechenyi Turkish baths.

"The Sydney man who was one of the first hostages to escape the cafe gunman said he has never felt more relieved than when he fell into the arms of heavily armed police on Monday. John O'Brien, 83, from Maroubra in the city's eastern suburbs, told reporters on Wednesday he is already back playing tennis, a favoured hobby. 'I have never felt so much relief in my life as when I turned that corner and saw those armed police waiting,' said Mr O'Brien, whose lip trembled with emotion as he thanked Australians for their support.

"Radamel Falcao's arrival at Manchester United on deadline day created more excitement and headlines than any other transfer in the last window, including Diego Costa, Alexis Sanchez and Angel di Maria. But the £3.8million wages - on top of a £6m loan fee - shelled out so far on the Monaco loanee have yielded just one goal, and the Colombian needs to prove his worth if he wants a permanent move. United have until April to make up their minds and while Falcao wants to stay at Old Trafford, is he worth an additional £43m transfer fee when they already have Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and emerging teenager James Wilson in the dressing-room? Radamel Falcao takes a free-kick against in Manchester United's 3-0 win over Liverpool . Falcao (left, holding off Martin Skrtel) failed to score against Liverpool, extending his barren run . Falcao (left) was again a second-half substitute for United, coming on for James Wilson (right) Joined: September 1, 2014 . Cost: £6m loan fee . Wages: £265,000-per-week . Appearances: 8 . Starts: 3 . Goals: 1 . Cost per goal in fees: £6m . Cost per goal in wages: £3.8m . Total cost per goal: £9.75m . Nobody doubts Falcao's talent. Anyone who watched his brilliant hat-trick for Atletico Madrid against Chelsea in the 2012 European Super Cup is aware this he is one of the world's outstanding centre forwards. 'He is the best striker in the world and it is a pleasure to have him. It's a luxury for us,' said Atletico's Mario Suarez at the time after Falcao had destroyed Chelsea's renowned back four. But a serious knee injury sustained in January while playing for Monaco forced the 28-year-old to miss the World Cup and while he appears to be over that problem, other niggles have occurred, most notably a calf problem, since he has arrived at United. It often happens to players returning after a long period but until Falcao starts hitting the back of the net with regularity, United can't be absolutely certain he remains the superstar player of two years ago. Falcao has started only three matches in his three-and-a-half months at United. Van Gaal says with all his injury problems, match sharpness has been a problem. Falcao has spent much of his time at  United sitting on the substitutes bench . Falcao has scored just once for United - against Everton in October .

Southampton 1-2 Man United (December 8) - Unused substitute . Man United 3-0 Liverpool (December 14) - 78th minute substitute . Overall: Three starts, five substitute appearances, one goal. 'Falcao needs match fitness. He can only play for 20 minutes,' said the Dutchman last week. 'I have selected him despite that but the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest.' Ideally, Van Gaal wants to give him a run-out in the Under 21s development squad but may still be tempted to use him at Aston Villa on Saturday. With United scheduled to play seven games in the next month, he will get his opportunity at some stage. You may wonder having read all that why United opted to bring in Falcao in the first place given they were spoilt for choice up front anyway. If they hadn't signed him, they would have kept Danny Welbeck in any case as a fourth striker. But Falcao, fully fit and firing, is a special breed. When transfer fees of £60m are quoted for PSG's Edinson Cavani, it's easy to forget that Falcao is probably the quicker, stronger and deadlier finisher of the two. His only United goal so far, the winner against Everton in a 2-1 victory in October, gave a glimpse of his instinctive anticipation in the penalty area. Angel di Maria's mis-hit shot was heading wide until Falcao, in line with the last defender, managed to reach it with his right leg and divert the ball past Tim Howard in a flash. It was marksmanship of the highest order. Falcao sees his shot at goal saved by QPR's Robert Green . VIDEO Falcao wants to play . If United could guarantee Falcao doing that 30 times a season, he would be worth the money. But that is the difficulty so far – he hasn't shown that guarantee – and the renaissance of Van Persie, with four goals in his last four games, means it is crowded for the coveted No 9 position in the team. Even Wilson from the academy was given a start ahead of Falcao for last weekend's 3-0 win against Liverpool. Falcao is also on top, A-list wages - around £265,000-a-week, and the transfer fee to Monaco would put a dent even in United's considerable coffers. Of course, they could afford it, but they will only want to pay out £40m-plus on two or three players in the summer, not four or five. Gareth Bale remains their gold-star target if the Welshman shows any signs of tiring of Madrid. Falcao has told boss Louis van Gaal (centre left) that he is now fit and ready to play a bigger part for United . Falcao arrived to huge fan fare on deadline day, along with Daley Blind . United have not given up on Falcao – he is too good for that. But there are choices to be made. Van Gaal is not the type of manager to be blinded by reputation, as you'd expect for someone who has helped develop the careers of Patrick Kluivert, Andres Iniesta and Thomas Muller. Falcao, who said this week he 'really wants to stay' at United beyond the summer will have to deliver on merit to make that happen. 'I hope it will work out. That is clear, I think,' said Van Gaal recently. 'Because of the (knee) injury, maybe we didn't buy him. We have him on loan but do you think that we expected he would be so many weeks injured (with other knocks)?' Judgement day may be approaching for Falcao.","Radamel Falcao arrived on loan from Monaco on deadline-day for £6m .

The former career nurse was taken to the home's nurse and an ambulance was called. She was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital, before being moved to a specialist burns unit at Whiston Hospital, Merseyside, where she died on September 28, 2012. Thermometer tests on another bath in the home without a valve after Miss Morgan's death by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had readings of 50.7 and 50.3 degrees celsius. The company which ran the home, Greencroft Care Ltd which is now in liquidation, was fined £5,000 in September over the death, in a Health and Safety executive prosecution. Miss Morgan formerly lived on the Wirral, and had been matron of Wrexham War Memorial Hospital during her long medical career. Tracey Davies, acting home manager at the time, said there was no working valve on the bath to regulate its temperature at the time. Pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers, who conducted a post-mortem examination, said Miss Morgan suffered serious burns and wounds on her body were consistent with being lowered only a shallow depth into the scalding bath. Miss Morgan formerly lived on the Wirral, and had been matron of Wrexham War Memorial Hospital during her long medical career . Recording a conclusion of accidental death, coroner John Gittens said there had been failings which contributed to Miss Morgan's death. 'I can only express a hope that this horrendous incident is a one-off, that other people are not placed at risk and have to suffer the horrendous incident which Betty Morgan had to endure at Greencroft,' he said. Mr Gittins said that although people with dementia were prone to develop deep vein and pulmonary thrombosis, Mrs Morgan was doing quite well, despite her conditions, before the accident. Mr Gittins recorded the cause of death as bronchial pneumonia and pulmonary embolism due to scalding to the lower legs, trunk and left arm. Senile dementia was listed as a contributory cause. Mrs Davies said social care workers at the home received 12 weeks of intensive training, but she had not seen a bathing policy for the home. She said she had been told the bath did not have a thermostatic valve to regulate its temperature by a builder, but that Greencroft Care Ltd director Timothy Ogunleye told her one could not be installed due to the costs involved. Mr Ogunleye told the inquest he had not had such a conversation with her. He said managers at homes owned by the company were responsible for carrying out audits and informing him of problems. Mr Ogunleye said when the company took over the home in 2011, it was contractually obliged not to change existing policies as the staff were familiar with them. Nicky Heap, one of three staff involved in bathing Miss Morgan, said she ran hot water first on the day in question, but had to take another patient back to his room before returning to run the cold water. She took the temperature with a thermometer and logged the temperature as 38 degrees celsius, she said. When questioned by coroner John Gittins, Ms Heap said she had not received guidance on mixing the water before taking the temperature and where to place the thermometer in the tub. Staff at the home (pictured) told an inquest in Wrexham yesterday that Miss Morgan, who had schizophrenia and dementia, screamed out in pain before she was removed from the bathtub . Ms Heap said she had no formal qualifications, but had shadowed other care workers. Colleague Sophie Davies had stopped on the way to the bathroom to get Miss Morgan's towels. She told the inquest she heard her screaming, but that Miss Morgan did this regularly when carers dealt with her. However, when entering the room she saw Miss Morgan being hoisted out of the bath. Miss Davies said the home's nurse told them to place cold towels on Miss Morgan and the nurse called 999. She was not aware of the bath temperature log and 'what little knowledge' she had came from colleagues showing her what to do. Susan Wooler, who was also involved in bathing Miss Morgan, said she had received training to perform the task.","Beatrice Morgan was resident at Greencroft residential home in Shotton .

"Maoist sect leader Aravindan Balakrishnan (pictured outside court today) has appeared in court charged with 25 offences including false imprisonment, rape and child cruelty . A Maoist sect leader has appeared in court charged with 25 offences including false imprisonment, rape and child cruelty. Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, was arrested in Lambeth, south London, in November last year. He faces one count of cruelty to a person under the age of 16, one count of false imprisonment, 19 counts of indecent assault and four counts of rape. The charges relate to three women between January 1980 and October 2013. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London today, his lawyer, Adam Wiseman, indicated that Balakrishnan would plead not guilty to the alleged offences. Balakrishnan, of Edmonton, north London, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address during the brief 20-minute hearing. He was dressed in a blue waterproof jacket, grey cardigan and peach-coloured scarf, wearing glasses and with his grey hair in a mullet style. The child cruelty charge states that between January 6 1983 and January 7 1999 Balakrishnan 'wilfully ill-treated, assaulted, and neglected' a child in a manner 'likely to cause unnecessary suffering to said child or injury to its health'. A 67-year-old woman, understood to be Balakrishnan's wife, Chanda Pattni, was arrested with him in November last year. In September, after 10 months on bail, she was told she would face no further action and was released without charge. District Judge Howard Riddle said the next hearing was set for Southwark Crown Court in London on December 31. 'There are 25 separate allegations against you,' the judge said. 'These allegations are sent for trial to Southwark Crown Court and you have bail with conditions.' Mr Wiseman said he would be applying to adjourn the next hearing to the week starting January 5. Balakrishnan was released on bail with conditions that he must live and sleep at his home address, not apply for international travel documents, not contact five women, who cannot be named, and not enter Lambeth unless accompanied by his solicitor.

"Watchdogs have flagged up concerns over the creation of a British pork pie monopoly. The Competition & Markets Authority has sounded the alarm over the purchase of the savoury pastries business owed by Kerry Foods by the rival manufacturer Pork Farms. The official watchdog is concerned the deal will concentrate the manufacture of pork pies, sausage rolls, pasties, scotch eggs and some other savoury pastries in too few hands. The pork pie is the ultimate everyman food and can trace its origins back to medieval times . Watchdogs have flagged up concerns over the decision by Pork Farms to buy the chilled savoury pastries business of rival manufacturer Kerry Foods . As a result, it warns this could lead to higher prices for the traditional pork pie, pies and sausages and a reduction in choice. The pork pie is the ultimate everyman food and can trace its origins back to medieval times. They were originally seen as a handy and transportable lunch that were popular with the lower class, particularly agricultural workers and grooms. Today, the Melton Mowbray pork pie is the most famous of the lineage and it has even been granted special status by the EU, which means production is restricted to a small area of Leicestershire. The decision by Pork Farms to purchase the chilled savoury pastries business of Kerry Foods has created a pork pie giant, which manufacturers the product both under its own brands and for the big supermarkets. Pork Farms, which was established in 1931 and is based in Nottingham, claims to be the nation’s favourite brand of pork pie selling over 20 million a year. It also sells millions more under the Bowyers brand, which also sells Scotch eggs and sausage rolls. Pork Farms said it was ‘disappointed’ with the CMA’s decision to order a further review of the deal . The company bought the savoury pastries business of Kerry Foods, which includes factories at Poole, Dorset, and Spalding in Lincolnshire, in August for an undisclosed sum. This allowed the company to make pork pies and other savoury pastry brands under the Wall’s and Millers brands, under licence from Kerry Foods. The new company will be a dominant force in a market for pork pies, sausage rolls and other savoury products that is estimated to be worth around £1billion a year. Pork Farms said it was ‘disappointed’ with the CMA’s decision to order a further review of the deal.","Watchdog worried about Pork Farms acquisition of Kerry Foods' savoury pastries business .

"A 7-year-old boy and self-described 'biggest fan' of NFL player J.J. Watt sent the football star a special gift - his own autographed Pee Wee jersey. The Houston Texans defensive end posted an image of the boy's letter and signed shirt on Twitter Tuesday. The letter said: 'Dear J.J.: I am 7 years old. My name is Anthony Tarantelli and I am your biggest fan. People call me J.J. because I also play DE and TE like you. It continued, 'I wear number 99 like you you too. I was the most feared rusher in my league this year.' Confidence: 7-year-old Anthony Tarantelli sent this message and jersey to J.J. Watt . Tarantelli then explained 'I am sending you my autographed game jersey so you will know me when I am a famous NFL player. 99 rocks!! Your friend Anthony.' Included at the bottom of the letter was an illustration of Watt playing against Andrew Luck, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback. Watt approved of the boy's move, tweeting 'This kid has some guts...I like it.' Watt told Anthony in a video message he may 'expect something in the mail,' the 7-year-old's mother Lauren Tarantelli told TMZ Sports. She also said that a referee previously warned Anthony to calm down while playing. The  shirt was first mentioned on Facebook by his father, before one of his friends told him he was familiar with the agent for the NFL star, father Joe Tarantelli told TMZ Sports. Watt's name, meanwhile, is currently being included in discussions by sports news outlets over whether or not he will win the NFL's MVP award this year. Last week, Watt told MMQB 'That's for people like you to decide, not me. I can't change any voters' minds, and I don't think I should try. I don't care, actually. It doesn't matter to me. 'If people vote for me, great. But to politic for it, no. Please vote for me? No. People who play don't get to decide who wins, nor should they. I want to be deserving, but not because I politicked for it. My play on the field is all that should matter. Nothing else.' Athlete:  J.J.

"The Prince of Wales has condemned the Taliban massacre of Pakistani schoolchildren as a 'sickening' example of those who kill in the name of faith. There has been outrage across the world after gunmen from the Pakistani Taliban went from class to class at the Army Public School in the city of Peshawar killing school children and their teachers. Prince Charles spoke out against the attacks during a visit to the London Cathedral of a community of Middle Eastern Christians. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles today condemned the mass murder of 141 children by the Pakistani Taliban . He was speaking during a visit to the London cathedral of a community of Middle Eastern Christians . Charles said the attack was a 'horrific reminder' that Muslims are themselves victims of 'violent extremists' Some of the worshippers have fled persecution in their homelands, but in recent months the spread of Islamic State fighters has brought further misery for them as their family members at home in Iraq or Syria have been forced to flee for their lives. At a special service held in Charles's honour, he told the congregation of the Syriac Orthodox Church, based in East Acton, west London: 'And as I have said before, it seems to me that all faiths to some extent shine a light on the divine image in every human life. 'And if that is so, then surely to destroy another human being is to desecrate the image of the Divine. To do so in the name of faith is, surely, nothing less than a sacrilege. 'I need hardly say that the murder of 141 people, 132 of them children, in Peshawar yesterday by fanatics claiming to act in the name of Islam was a sickening example of such sacrilege. 'But also a horrific reminder that Muslims themselves are the victims of the violent intolerance of the extremists.' Some of the worshippers who met Prince Charles have fled persecution in their homelands . The Prince of Wales talks to Abdulahad Denha who fled Isis fighters from Mosul in northern Iraq . Prince Charles talks to Kais Dawood and his wife Selwa who fled Iraq during his visit to St Thomas cathedral . The Cathedral is the focal point for the UK worshippers of the Syriac Orthodox Church whose followers are spread across the Middle East from southern Turkey to Syria, Jordan and parts of India. Charles had visited St Thomas Cathedral a year ago to the day and like last year he heard the personal stories of those who were living with the knowledge their family and friends were being persecuted in their homelands. Vean Al-Saka, 35, was comforted by the prince after she burst into tears while explaining how her brother and sister were forced to escape Islamic State fighters. Ms Al-Saka, who is an undergraduate at Newcastle University, said after meeting Charles: 'I don't know what's happening to them, all I know is they are in tents, they need help, they left everything behind - Charles was very sympathetic.' The visit was the third that Charles has made in recent weeks to Christian communities in the UK whose families are facing persecution in their homelands. He said in his speech: 'For now, the possibility of returning to the lands in which your families and communities have lived for so many centuries is, indeed, remote. 'However, I do pray most fervently that the situation there will change; that peace will return; that the time will come when you feel it is safe to return to your homeland and that, once there, you will be free, together with those of other religions, to celebrate your faith without any fear of persecution.' In his address, Archbishop Athanasius Toma Dawod, leader of the Syriac Church in the UK, told the prince that he was the 'King of Peace'. He added: 'Yes, this is the truth and this is how we feel. You have spoken about the plight of the Christians in the Middle East, you have felt the pain and suffering of the indigenous people.' Before leaving Charles was presented with a necklace for Prince George, traditionally given to newborns in the Syriac community, that was made from gold and featured a tiny bell.","Prince of Wales spoke out against massacre of Pakistani schoolchildren .

"The daughter of Korean Air's chief executive has been questioned by prosecutors over breaching aviation safety laws in the 'nut rage' incident in a flight earlier this month. Cho Hyun-Ah, 40, sparked a national uproar when she unleashed hell on cabin staff on a flight from New York to Seoul, when she was not served complimentary macadamia nuts the correct way. She has since been forced to resign as senior executive of Korean Air and the incident has landed her father's company with a flight ban and potential fines of up to $2million. Scroll down for video . Hanging her head in shame: Former Korean Air Lines Co. VP Cho Hyun-Ah arrives at the Seoul western prosecutors' office on Wednesday morning . 'I'm sorry,' Cho said feebly as she was mobbed by journalists and photographers when she appeared at the Seoul Western Prosecutors' Office, keeping her head low and her face covered with shoulder-length hair. A transportation ministry investigation found that Cho breached aviation safety laws when she screamed and hurled abuse at a flight attendant and the chief purser, Park Chang-Jin, during the 'nut rage' incident on December 5. Prosecutors will focus on whether she forced the purser off the flight, ordered the pilot to return the plane to the gate and whether she used violence against the two crew members, according to the Yonhap news agency. Park has claimed that Cho pushed him into the cockpit door and jabbed him with a service manual. She has denied reports she made him and the flight attendant kneel and beg her forgiveness, but another passenger in first class has confirmed she forced both to their knees.

"Conservative commentators, so often a backbone of broadcasting support for Tony Abbott, have turned on the embattled PM, with Ray Hadley insisting on Thursday that he made 'a really bad call' to proceed with the mid-year budget update during the Sydney siege on Monday. Mr Hadley joined the chorus of criticism about Mr Abbott, telling him in the 2GB Ray Hadley Show interview that: 'I thought until about a month ago, you were going B-plus, I think you're now a D-minus'. 'I thought that was a really bad call,' the broadcaster told the PM. 'We had seventeen people in there whose lives were at risk. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott offers a wave to the crowd of onlookers at the Martin Place shrine after signing the condolence book.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott arrives with wife Margie to place floral tributes at the makeshift shrine in Martin Place for the hostages of the Sydney siege . The PM and Mrs Abbott place their bouquets at the Martin Place shrine. Mr Abbott has come under fire from radio broadcaster Ray Hadley over his decision to proceed with the mid-year budget announcement during the height of the Sydney siege . 'I think you're a D minus' Ray Hadley told the Prime Minister on radio after his decision to proceed with the mid-year budget update on the same day Sydney was gripped by a siege in Martin Place . The personally signed card from the Prime Minister amid the field of flowers which continues to grow by the hour in Sydney's CBD . Treasurer Joe Hockey was given the go-ahead to hand down his mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, which only brought more bad news, showing even larger deficits across the four-year estimates than were predicted back in May. Some financial analysts believe that since the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook of August 2013, the budget position has deteriorated by almost $93 billion, it's estimated that the government's failed attempts to negotiate the budget through the Senate has, alone, come at a cost of some $10 billion. 'I made the call (to go ahead with the mid-year review) some people thought it was a good call, obviously some people didn't,' Mr Abbott countered. Tony Abbott used a sporting analogy to concede the government's 'fans in the stands' are unhappy. 'But my job is not so much to be worrying about the scoreboard,' the prime minister added. Even News Corporation columnist Andrew Bolt recently took a shot at the Coalition, writing that the PM was making the 'same blunders that killed Julia Gillard'. Mr Bolt, was referring to the government's broken Budget promise not to slash the ABC budget, said 'what is so frustrating for those who wish Abbott well is that this disaster was utterly predictable - and, indeed, predicted'. 'In April, even though it killed me, I warned through gritted teeth that the government should honour its promise to the ABC.' 'I thought that was a really bad call,' broadcaster Ray Hadley told the PM. 'We had seventeen people in there whose lives were at risk.' On The Ray Hadley Morning Show, the PM said of his performance, rated a 'D minus' by the host, that 'if I score myself high, people think I'm full of myself. If I score myself low, people think I'm lacking in self-confidence'. 'I know there are about 23 million judges out there, and I leave each of them to make their own judgement,' he said. Just over two weeks ago, the Prime Minister admitted the his government had had a 'ragged week'. He said at the time, on the back of the ABC cuts, inability to get the Medicare co-payment through and internal rumblings about the Treasurer, 'that 'I'd be the first to admit that last week was a bit of ragged week for the government, I'd be the first to admit that'. 'I know that appearances do count and I do concede that the appearance last week was a bit ragged - in the end nothing matters more than performance,' he said at the time. The woe has seemingly continued, as even Mr Abbott conceded it had been a 'ragged conclusion' to the year. 'I carefully considered it (to go ahead with the mid-year budget announcement) and I made the call that the ordinary business of government should go on,' he told Mr Hadley. 'Some people thought it was a good call. Obviously some people didn't and you're in that latter group.' The Government has for months lagged behind the Labor Opposition in opinion polls, with its unpopular budget largely to blame. Mr Abbott admits many of those who voted for the Coalition in 2013 are now unhappy with the government, with much of its agenda being held up in the Senate. 'A lot of people who are willing the government to succeed, get a little frustrated when they think that maybe it's not succeeding,' he said. Mr Abbott signs the condolence book at the Martin Place shrine to the hostages of the Sydney siege . 'It's our fans in the stands looking at what they think is the scoreboard and thinking `Gee wiz, the team ought to be in front, but it's not'.' The government has been beset by internal problems plus confusion over the Medicare co-payment, the defeat of university funding reform, anger over defence force pay and a devastating Victorian state election loss. But Mr Abbott asked voters to ignore the 'critical chatter'.","Prime Minister criticised for going ahead with the government's Budget update on Monday, at the height of the Sydney siege .

"Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie has said that Nigel Farage is like Jesus and UKIP members are his followers . Nigel Farage is like Jesus and Ukip members are his followers, one of the party’s candidates has claimed. Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie, who is a former professional boxer and has previously courted controversy with remarks about gay adoption, said the party leader can ‘do no wrong’. ‘Jesus was one man, we’re his army. Farage is one man, and we’re his army and that’s what it’s all about,’ he said. ‘Everywhere he goes, it doesn’t matter what he says or does - he gets away with it.’ Mr McKenzie joined Ukip after previously being a member of the Conservatives, Lib Dems and his own Unity party. He has stood to be an MP, Mayor of London and a local councillor, but lost his deposit on every occasion. ‘The one thing with Farage is there’s (sic) no heirs and graces, you do business. He’s a strong leader,’ he said in the interview with Chat Politics. ‘Farage is like (non-stick) Teflon – he can do no wrong.’ Mr McKenzie, who described himself as ‘not your average politician’, has developed a reputation for making controversial pronouncements. While standing for Ukip in the 2012 Croydon North by-election, he described gay adoption as ‘tantamount to child abuse’ and ‘unhealthy’. Asked by Chat Politics for his views on same-sex marriage, he said: ‘I have nothing against gay people, I’m not some kind of homophobe but I am entitled to express my heartfelt opinion.’ Mr McKenzie said that he favours a quota on immigrants coming into the country.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage (pictured left) has been compared to Jesus (pictured right) He said: ‘For every extra person that comes into this country, a British person has to do without and I’m not talking here colour or creed. ‘I define British as someone who comes here and toils and works and stands up for the traditions of the place they live.’ Earlier this year, Mr McKenzie described Croydon – where he was standing as a local councillor – as ‘unsafe and a dump’ after Mr Farage pulled out of appearing at a ‘Ukip carnival’ there. He made a rap video during his 2008 campaign to be Mayor of London and previously auditioned for the X Factor.","UKIP candidate Winston McKenzie compared Nigel Farage to Jesus .

This photograph shows the incredible moment a friendly bottle-nose dolphin named Fungi leaps out of the sea right in front of a pair of stunned boatmen who were taking a trip out to sea off the coast of County Kerry .

"Tragedy: Peter Fedden died in a July 2013 car crash, while allegedly driving drunk. His mother is now filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the cops who didn't arrest him during his first crash that night . A woman is suing the police for $30million, claiming they are to blame for her son's death since they didn't arrest him for drunk driving. Kathi Fedden's 29-yer-old son Peter died in July 2013, after getting into two drunk-driving crashes in one night in Commack, New York. Instead of arresting Peter after the first crash, responding officers drove the popular deli owner back to his mothers house. Just 30 minutes later, an inebriated Peter sped off in his mother's car to die in another accident, Newsday reports. According to the wrongful death lawsuit filed this week, Peter had downed at least 10 oz of Jack Daniels and smoked marijuana before getting behind the wheel to leave a Ruby Tuesdays the night of July 30, 2013 around 11:30pm. With two passengers in the car, Peter was speeding at 90 miles per hour when he lost control of his vehicle ramming straight through a fence, across two lawns and into a parked car in a driveway. Many of the responding officers recognized Peter from the Commack Breakfast Diner, a restaurant he owned where he treated cops like kings- charging them just $1 for everything. Mrs Fedden alleges that this is what caused them to go lenient on her son, driving him home instead of arresting him and holding him overnight to sober up. That plan backfired when 30 minutes later, Peter stole his mom's car and sped off again, this time getting into a much more serious car accident. It's believed he may have been travelling at speeds of more than 100 miles an hour when he crashed into the brick facade of an industrial park and died. Suffolk County officials didn't comment, citing the litigation.","Kathi Fedden says her son was popular among police in Suffolk County for charging them just $1 for everything at the diner he owned .

"Police are hoping that a sketch artist's rendering will help them identify the embalmed head of a woman found in the western Pennsylvania woods last week. Economy Borough police Chief Michael O'Brien told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the drawing isn't finished, but will be released to media outlets once it is. Police don't want to release a photo of the woman's head in order to be sensitive to her family. The head appears to be that of woman in her late 60s or early 70s, but police have no idea where it's from, especially since it was embalmed. Scene: The 'bizarre' was find was made in the woods of Economy in west Pennsylvania, however cadaver dogs that searched the area only found the head, and not a corpse . 'It's so bizarre, nobody has ever heard of anything like this,' O'Brien said. That's one reason police don't suspect the woman was the victim of a homicide. Help: Police hope a sketch of what the woman may have looked like will help identify her . But, depending on how and why the head wound up in the woods, a crime still could have been committed. Among other things, it's illegal to abuse a corpse in Pennsylvania. 'What's bizarre is not that we've found a head, it's that we've found a head that's embalmed,' O'Brien said. 'That's what's really strange about the whole thing.' Police are contacting medical schools to see if the head is from a cadaver, and are entering DNA from the remains into a nationwide FBI database for missing persons. If police can determine the woman's identity, that gives them a starting place to determine who would have had access to her body and when. The sketch hasn't been completed because the artist is backlogged, but O'Brien's hoping to release it in the next few days. The head was found Friday in Economy, a borough about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Search crews using cadaver-sniffing dogs searched the area, but found no other remains. O'Brien said the head appeared to be in good condition, leading police to believe it hadn't been there more than a week. But because it was embalmed, investigators can't be entirely sure.","Head was found Friday in Economy, west Pennsylvania .

"Sydney's housing prices are now among the most expensive in the world and easily the priciest properties in Australia. The median price for a house in Sydney is now $845,000 according to the latest figures released by property analysts RP Data, almost $300,000 more than the average property prices in Melbourne and Perth. But how much more can the price of a home in Sydney actually get you in other Australian capital cities? Scroll down for video . SYDNEY . 143 Merindah Road Baulkham Hills NSW . Sold just over a week ago for $845,000, this three bedroom property in Baulkham Hills is what house-seekers in Sydney can expect to find for that median price .

Although the land is generously sized, at 929 square metres, the property is positioned a lengthy 35km from Sydney's CBD. The associate director of Raine and Horne Double Bay, Monique March, told Daily Mail Australia that the $845,000 price tag wouldn't buy anything 'fantastic' near Sydney's coast. 'It could buy you a two bedroom property in Bondi with a balcony but no view and probably no parking,' she said. 'You might be able to get something small in the city near Darlinghurst or Surry Hills without a view but you won't find any houses in the east.' Ms March said her firm had recently sold a 56 square metre unit in Bondi with no balcony and parking for $850,000, while further west in Newtown they sold a two bedroom unit for $810,000, also with no parking.

'It's more likely to get you and un-renovated 80 square metre apartment with no off-street parking. You'd probably be looking at older style apartments,' he said. He said house-hunters would more likely find a two or three bedroom home about 15km out of the city , however it was still more likely to be of an older style and only renovated within the last 10 years.

"Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a plan Tuesday to equip 7,000 Los Angeles police officers with on-body cameras by next summer, making LA's police department the nation's largest law enforcement agency to move forward with such an ambitious expansion of the technology. The plan was unveiled at a news conference where Garcetti said he was planning to put forward millions of dollars in next year's budget for the cameras, and that the first wave of more than 800 cameras would roll out as early as January. Bloomberg reports that Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg, Activision Blizzard Inc. CEO Bobby Kotick and Occidental Petroleum Corp. chief Stephen Chazen  are among those who contributed $1.35 million of the $1.6 million cost for the first 700 cameras, Police Commission President Steven Soboroff said in an interview. New technology: Los Angeles Police Sgt. Dan Gomez, right, wears an on-body video camera as he takes questions about the technology at a news conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday . Financial backer: Executive Producer Steven Spielberg is one of the dozens of individuals helping to fund the body cameras in Los Angeles . Los Angeles police commission President Steve Soboroff said he estimated the cameras would cost roughly $10 million for the first two to three years and would include technology and software from Arizona-based Taser International Inc. 'This is a huge step for law enforcement. No other major city is even close to implementation,' said Police Chief Charlie Beck. 'On the street things aren't always clear cut. This isn't TV. It's not easily scripted. It's not always easy to tie up the loose ends,' Garcetti said. 'So the more facts and evidence we have, the more likely it is that we can get to the truth no matter what happens on the street.' The announcement follows a year of multiple field tests of the body cameras on a small number of the Los Angeles Police Department's 9,900 officers. Nationally, officers in one of every six departments now patrol with tiny cameras on their chests, lapels or sunglasses, and that number is growing. After an outcry over the shooting of an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, President Barack Obama recommended spending $74 million to equip another 50,000 officers with them. Garcetti said the city would be applying for part of those funds. The technology: This photo shows an on-body police video camera clipped to a Los Angeles Police officers' glasses during a demonstration for media in Los Angeles in January of last year . 'What happens in the smallest town in these United States affects all of us. What happens in Ferguson, a town not even the size of one of the police divisions in LA, has affected us, but we're stepping up,' Beck said. Beck said the cameras will not be officially in use until a policy has been devised with consultation from stakeholders and the public. It must be approved by the civilian oversight commission and City Council. 'Body cameras won't solve every problem in policing. But having video of police officers' interactions with the public will help hold officers' accountable for misconduct, quickly exonerate officers who are wrongly accused, and help the public understand the powers we give police and how they use them,' said Hector Villagra, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. Villagra said the most important part of the process would be setting the guidelines overseeing the new technology, such as when the cameras are turned on and off, or whether officers can review the recordings after using force. To address concerns about transparency, Los Angeles Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday asking the LAPD to report on the status of its program as well as a timeline for its rollout and details on how that would happen. Many law enforcement officials support cameras' use and say they are effective. The new evidence: Los Angeles Police Sgt. Dan Gomez demonstrates a video feed from his on-body camera into his cellphone during a news conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday . The police department in Rialto, California, found after a yearlong University of Cambridge study last year that the cameras led to an 89 percent drop in complaints against officers, possibly reining in misbehavior on the part of the public and officers, as well as ultimately limiting department liability. The Los Angeles Police Protective League has been in favor of the cameras, but the union is still working out details on how the cameras will impact privacy and working conditions for officers, President Tyler Izen said. The LAPD has also received a $1 million National Institute of Justice grant given to study their use of body cameras on policing. 'The entire nation waits to see what happens in LA,' Beck said. Garcetti also said Tuesday he would nominate Beck for the President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.","7,000 Los Angeles police officers will have on-body cameras by next summer .

"The BBC'S £1billion headquarters is 'swarming with petty thieves' who steal bananas, sandwiches, loose change, chocolate mousses, yoghurts - and even trousers - from staff. In the past few weeks, BBC staff working at New Broadcasting House (NBH) in central London have complained that personal items keep getting swiped. Among the items stolen recently include a pashmina, a cardigan, bunches of bananas, cheese, cakes, loose change left on desks, four-packs of yoghurts, homemade sandwiches and even a pair of trousers. Staff are even being told to stop stealing 'toilet paper' - although a sign telling staff to 'refrain from stealing toilet paper' was itself was pinched earlier this month. The BBC's New Broadcasting House in London (pictured) is said to be 'swarming with petty thieves' The sign, put up in female toilets on the 3rd floor of New Broadcasting House, stated: 'These Facilities are serviced regularly throughout the day. Should you find any fault or issue please contact 047. Many thanks'. Underneath the main notice is a 'polite notice' stating: 'Can staff please refrain from stealing the toilet paper.' The photo was posted by Today Programme worker Leanne Ward, who said even the sign has now been pinched. She said: 'I thought I'd send you (a photo of) this sign that used to be up in the toilets on the building's third floor. Believe it or not, even the sign got nicked. 'There is often no paper here as it is all stolen. Often people call out from their toilet cubicle 'can you please pass us some paper'.' The BBC's in-house magazine Ariel confirmed today that NBH is experiencing 'increasing numbers of petty thefts' - most of which take place at night. BBC economics editor Robert Peston confirmed that three letters addressed to him were pinched from his desk recently. He told Ariel: 'The letters went missing from my desk at New Broadcasting House - Good thing I am so boring & have no secrets.' Another BBC worker, Ruth Alexander, said a parcel containing a black cardigan had been pinched from her desk. Petty thieves have been stealing everything from toilet paper to sandwiches and even bananas . She said: 'It was an unopened delivery box from Benetton that I'd tucked well beneath my desk, so someone must have been having a good root around to find it. 'It was a black cardigan, size small, if anyone sees it on eBay' Production worker Gemma Ashman has three bananas and 60p in loose change pinched from her desk and Smita Patel had her lunch and pashmina pinched. One BBC worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'The thefts are definitely on the rise - last week someone had their lunchbox stolen from a fridge on the 5th floor and someone else had a pair of trousers they had collected from the dry cleaner pinched. 'Every day you hear of other things going missing - bananas, yoghurts, loose change - the list goes on and on. 'If it's not nailed down it's very likely it will be lifted.' Another worker said: 'The place is swarming with petty thieves who think nothing of taking your lunch or dinner - or the spare change from your desk. 'Leave anything lying around at your own peril.' Thefts are believed to have increased in the past two months - but petty thefts were first noticed in September 2013 when someone stole a six-pack of Iceland chocolate mousses from a fridge at NBH. The fuming BBC worker pinned a note on the fridge reading: 'To the person who keeps stealing my chocolate mousse from Iceland, please stop - For the sake of £1, you too could buy a six-pack of small pots and bring in your own.' 'It may just be a dessert for you, but for me it reminds me of my teenage years, is something I use as a reward after a hard day's work and is something I honestly look forward to.' Scott Noble, an operations manager at the Beeb said 'theft is theft' no matter what it is. He said: 'It doesn't matter if it's a £50,000 asset or a 20p yoghurt, theft is theft. 'If the issues are reported, and there's an underlying theme, it's incumbent on us to do something about it. 'Robert Peston's letters - that's deliberate and should be reported, as should the theft of food or tea bags.' Some of the problems are blamed on hot-desking, the BBC policy that nobody has 'their own desk' and sit wherever they find a desk. Bosses at the Beeb say staff should comply with the 'clear desk policy' to stop their personal items being stolen. Andy Baker, the BBC manager for the W1 programme - which saw 6,000 staff move into NBH - said: 'We do like people to move around - we don't like them to sit in the same place. 'The whole essence of this building is its flexibility and collaborative spirit. It shouldn't come as a surprise that someone's sat at your desk when you're not using it.'","BBC staff working at New Broadcasting House have complained of thefts .

"Mario Balotelli’s future at Liverpool remains in grave doubt after it emerged manager Brendan Rodgers has increasing reservations about his technical ability. Balotelli has endured a difficult start to his career at Anfield and is yet to score a goal in the Barclays Premier League club this season. Doubts have existed about the Italy forward's attitude, hunger and desire ever since he first played in England for Manchester City three years ago and his performances for Liverpool have done nothing to persuade his critics otherwise. Liverpool's Mario Balotelli is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Balotelli have a discussion during training . Rodgers has serious doubts about Balotelli's technical ability . The striker missed the Capital One Cup win at Bournemouth with a groin injury . But now it has emerged that Rodgers is beginning to have more fundamental issues with Balotelli after admitting privately that he has concerns about whether the striker is good enough to lead his attack. Liverpool won 3-1 at Bournemouth without Balotelli on Wednesday in the Capital One Cup and went into last Sunday’s game at Manchester United – that they lost 3-0 – without a recognised centre forward in the team. With young winger Raheem Sterling scoring twice at Bournemouth and finding himself in a host of scoring positions during the game at United, it would appear Balotelli is close to becoming surplus to requirements at Anfield. The Italian did look sharper after coming on as a substitute at United last Sunday and was perhaps unlucky to find home goalkeeper David de Gea in such good form. Balotelli came on as a second-half substitute in Liverpool's 3-0 defeat against Manchester United . Balotelli's attitude and hunger was questioned during his previous spell in England with Manchester City . VIDEO 'Balotelli must help himself' - Dudek . Nevertheless, Rodgers hopes to welcome main striker Daniel Sturridge back to fitness in the new year and also has Rickie Lambert to consider. Lambert has also had his own problems since joining Liverpool but has been used a little more by Rodgers in recent games. Recently, Rodgers admitted that the decision to buy Balotelli towards the back end of the summer transfer window had been a gamble. He said: 'I felt it was a risk we needed to take with Mario because, as a group, we couldn’t afford not to at that time. 'It was obviously late on and we needed to have someone in. It’s something that we can’t regret now. I made it clear at the beginning it was a calculated risk - and that is why he probably cost the money he did.' Liverpool have previously denied suggestions that they will try to sell Balotelli in the January transfer window.","Liverpool signed Mario Balotelli in for £16million in August .

"The Christmas Truce of 1914 was a brief moment of humanity amid the horrors of the First World War. But when Tommies and German troops emerged from the trenches to shake hands and swap gifts in no man’s land, the festive goodwill clearly did not extend to the French, a newly discovered letter reveals. Lance Corporal William Loasby tells how a shared contempt for Britain’s Gallic ally in the Great War helped the opposing sides briefly find common ground when they met, with one German officer even remarking: ‘Ten Frenchman don’t make an Englishman.’ Scroll down for video . Living history: A letter written by the soldier who sparked the famous 1914 Christmas Day Truce between the German and British soldiers has been sold for £20,000 at auction. Pictured is auctioneer Richard Westwood-Brookes holding the letter written by Lance Corporal Willie Loasby . The eight-page pencilled note was sent by Lance Corporal Willie Loasby of the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment to his mother on December 27, 1914 . Willie Loasby was probably shot by someone he was fraternising with on Christmas Day . Soldiers emerged from their trenches along parts of the Western Front and met each other in no man's land on December 25, 1914 . In his letter to his mother, Lance Corporal Loasby, 25, of the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment, tells how he and a comrade met two Germans between their trenches, which were just 40 yards apart. One of the Germans was an officer who shook hands, then asked in English: ‘Are you all English in front there, and no French?’ Lance Corporal Loasby wrote: ‘I answered, “All English, no French”. He replied, “I thought so”. Then he said, “Ten Frenchman don’t make an Englishman”. I thought, “Compliments”. ‘He weighed me up and down. Gave me six cigars, some chocolate, shook hands again and turned about, went back to his trench.’ The letter is expected to fetch up to £20,000 when it is sold at auction in March. Lance Corporal Loasby describes the Christmas event as ‘a remarkable experience… unbelievable I should say, had it happened to anyone else’. But in the letter, dated December 27, 1914, he adds: ‘We are at each others’ throats again now.’ The letter was discovered by a collector who bought it unwittingly in a house clearance sale, historical documents expert Richard Westwood Brookes of auctioneers Mullock’s said yesterday. Lance Corporal Loasby tells how his meeting with the officer came after an earlier encounter with another German in no man’s land on Christmas Eve. He asked if the British would stop firing on Christmas Day and Boxing Day so the Germans could bury their dead.

L/Cpl Loasby was buried in Guards Cemetery near a small French village called Cuinchy and his name appears on a war memorial in Kettering, Northamptonshir . ‘I asked my officer about the two days Armistice he wanted but no, he could not give it. But we would not fire unless we had orders otherwise on Xmas day,’ the letter adds. Lance Corporal Loasby is believed to have died just two weeks after writing the letter. He was buried in Guards Cemetery near the French village of Cuinchy. His name appears on a war memorial in Kettering, Northamptonshire. The letter’s insight into the reality of the events of the 1914 truce is a contrast to the rather idealised vision of life in the trenches depicted in Sainsbury’s Christmas TV ad. The ad has attracted more than 700 complaints, mainly from those who feel it is ‘distasteful’ to use war to sell groceries. The Duke of Cambridge, who was joined by England manager Roy Hodgson, said the story was a 'message of hope and humanity'. He added: 'Football had the power to bring people together and break down barriers. It is vital that 100 years on we keep the Christmas truce story alive. 'For future generations this memorial will help ensure that not just football, but also a nation, remembers.' Supermarket giant Sainsbury's has also made it the centrepiece of its Christmas ad campaign this year. 'On Thursday afternoon day before Xmas we stood shouting at the Germans in English (we can speak no German). 'They answered by calling us English Pigs and something a bit worse, well things went on like that for some time and matters improved and we asked them if they thought their people were in London. 'This happened in the section of trench I was in charge of between myself and a couple of men of my section. The Germans only being 40 yards away and we being nearer than at any other part of the line around here. 'Well the fellow next to me asked the German to stand right up, saying he would not shoot. The German did, then I asked him to come out of the trench and meet one of us half way and talk. 'He hesitated, but I assured him we would not shoot, if his fellows would not and to prove we meant it we stepped out of the trench and walked across towards them, all eyes were now watching this (the fellow I have just mentioned took our last loaf of bread the only one we had between about 10 of us, and gave it to the German, biting a bit off at the same time to let him know we had not poisoned it. 'Well everyone was now clapping both British and German and the Germans also shouted 'Brave English'. I walked across to my man and shook hands, I asked him how he liked it. 'Terrible, I wish I was back in Germany (in Good English!). 'I said, are you losing many men. He said 'yes & could I make arrangements with my officer commanding to have Xmas day and Boxing to bury their dead and not firing. I said I would ask for him. 'I wanted a souvenir so I took my knife out of my pocket and he let me cut a button from his coat. I could only give him a few dirty old biscuits from my pocket...on Xmas day I called up my friend the German and we met again halfway. 'Now out steps a German officer and comes up to me. The officer says, after shaking hands and in Good English 'Are you all English in front there and no French'. I answered, 'All English, no French.' He replied, 'I thought so', then said 'Ten Frenchman don't make an Englishman'. I thought: 'Compliments'. 'He weighed me up and down, gave me six cigars, some chocolate, shook hands again and turned about, went back to his trench. The other chap gave me a knife as a souvenir. 'I said jokingly if he would play us a game of football. He said 'yes' then I got called in again and we were soon banging away at them again. 'But what makes it so strange to me is on each side of us they were still fighting and an officer who ordered his men to fire volleys into them when they were asking to speak had his head blown off a few hours afterwards. 'Of course we have had to forget all about that now we are at each others' throats again...'","Lance Corporal Willie Loasby instigated the remarkable act of humanity .

"Kirsten Farage is  paid £800 a month by the taxpayer – or £9,600 a year – as the Brussels assistant of fellow Ukip MEP Ray Finch . Nigel Farage's wife is being paid by the taxpayer to work in Brussels, it has emerged a day after he denied it on television. The Ukip leader had insisted that his German wife Kirsten, who is employed as his assistant, is only paid by the party and does not receive a penny from public funds. He was questioned about the arrangements during his bizarre appearance this week on ‘Steph and Dom Meet Nigel Farage’ featuring the drink-swilling bed and breakfast owners from Channel 4’s Gogglebox. But a day after the programme was broadcast, it has emerged that Mrs Farage is in fact paid £800 a month by the taxpayer – or £9,600 a year – as the Brussels assistant of fellow Ukip MEP Ray Finch. Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Farage admitted this was the case but said the reason for denying it was that her husband had been ‘completely unaware’ of this arrangement. It was claimed that up until May this year Mr Farage did pay his second wife around £30,000-a-year until European Parliament rules outlawed the employment of family members. Instead it was arranged Mrs Farage would be paid for her work by Ukip – but they could only afford £20,000, a spokesman said. It the time the programme was filmed on July 22, Mr Farage was apparently unaware his wife had made an arrangement to top up her salary by working for Mr Finch since the start of that month. On the programme, over several rounds of wine and pink champagne with the couple at their home in Sandwich in Kent, Dom Parker asked Mr Farage about his wife being ‘on the payroll in Brussels’. Mr Farage replied: ‘She is no longer paid by the public sector’. Asked if he had hired someone else, he said Mrs Farage was still doing the job but ‘not paid by the European Parliament, no. Absolutely not.’ He said she was paid by ‘the party’. A Ukip spokesman said yesterday: ‘After the rules were changed so hiring spouses was no longer on, Nigel did a deal with the party that they would pick up the tab. 'I think he was still smarting a bit because he didn’t think there was anything wrong with paying his wife. What seems to have happened is that Kirsten then made a deal with Ray which Nigel was completely unaware of. ‘There is no way Nigel would have been so specific in saying she was not paid taxpayers money if he had known. He would have said one of my colleagues has chipped in.’ Mr Farage (right) was questioned about his wife's arrangements during his bizarre appearance this week on ‘Steph and Dom Meet Nigel Farage’ featuring the drink-swilling bed and breakfast owners from Channel 4’s Gogglebox . The spokesman added that she begun working for Mr Finch – as one of his seven assistants – on 1 July and added that her job had not changed. 'Kirsten has always worked for Nigel and others, and she still does, but in the past he had always picked up the tab. I cannot believe he would have deliberately lied in such a public forum about something so easy to check.’ All 751 MEPs are allowed to spend € 21,379 (£16,998) per month on staff. Since 2009, they have not been allowed to have close relatives among their staff. But existing MEPs such as Mr Farage were allowed to continue to do so until the European elections under a transitional arrangement. It has also been reported this week that Ukip has secured a £1.5million pot of European taxpayers cash by forming a new political grouping called the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE). The new party is dominated by Ukip, but some of the party’s own members have objected to taking the money as people would think Ukip were exploiting the EU gravy train. But Roger Helmer MEP said it would stop the funds falling into the hands of ‘federalists’.","Ukip leader insisted his German wife Kirsten is only paid by the party .

"A drunken thug repeatedly kicked and jumped on a man's head as he lay cowering in the road. Liam Sewell cried in the dock as he watched CCTV footage of him, drunk and bare-chested, repeatedly stamping on the head of Kenneth Burton in a street in Hull. After kicking and jumping on his head, the 21-year-old even ran away from his victim as he lay in the street only to return and stamp on his head again. The judge described the attack as 'chilling' and said it was astonishing that Mr Burton, who was left lying motionless in the road, did not suffer damage to his brain or die. Scroll down for video . Liam Sewell was caught on CCTV repeatedly kicking Kenneth Burton and stamping on his head in a street in Hull. The 21-year-old, who sobbed as he saw the footage at Hull Crown Court, has been jailed for 10 months . Sewell, who admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, was jailed for 10 months by a judge who branded his actions 'gross' and 'extreme.' The incident took place at about 12.30am on November 1 when Sewell was captured on CCTV bare-chested and in a gang. It is not clear what happened before the attack but it is alleged Sewell had earlier had his nose bitten. CCTV footage shown to Hull Crown Court captured Sewell first walking down Anlaby Road, with friends, who are gesturing towards Walliker Street, which he then runs down. Footage showed him walking alongside his victim, before squaring up to him and pushing him hard in the chest. As a friend tried to intervene, Sewell shoved Mr Burton to the ground and kicked him hard in the head four times. Sewell was seen on camera bare-chested and repeatedly kicking Mr Burton as he lay on the ground . A judge said it was astonishing that Mr Burton had not suffered a brain injury or died after the stamping . The friend managed to 'rugby tackle' Sewell off his victim, who scrambles back onto his feet, only for his attacker to return moments later. As his victim lay cowering in the street, Sewell, ran over and stamped down hard on his head twice. He then ran away again, only to return a second time to stamp his head into the concrete two more times. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said: 'It was chilling. 'A young man was kicked, repeatedly, by you and during the course of that attack, you additionally stamped upon him. 'There can be no doubt you intended much more serious injuries than were caused to him. Sewell, 21, admitted assaulting occasioning actual bodily harm and was locked up for 10 months . 'It is a miracle he was not more seriously injured by your action. 'The victim of such an assault could so easily have died.' Mr Burton was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, where he was treated for concussion. A CT scan revealed he had escaped brain injury. Prosecutor Philip Evans said: 'The Crown places this at the top of the tier for assault and does so because it is a repeated assault, albeit the injuries are slight. 'A shoed foot is used as a weapon and the defendant intended greater injury by his actions than were actually caused.' Paul Norton, defending, described the attack as an 'alcohol fuelled loss of control' and said Sewell, who has three convictions for violent offences, including threatening someone with a blade, had witnessed violence as a child. Mr Norton said: 'There was a degree of mutual aggression between him and the other person. 'Mr Sewell believed his nose was bitten. 'The CCTV also showed after he was rugby tackled by his peacemaker friend, another person took the opportunity to kick Sewell in the upper region of his body. 'Whilst the defendant's reaction is quite grossly and gratuitously extreme, this was not an assault on an entirely peaceful and innocent member of the public.' Sentencing Sewell, Judge Richardson said: 'It is truly miraculous he sustained no real injury apart from being unconscious for a short while. 'You kicked out and stamped, you intended greater harm. 'I note there was an incident with you before all this erupted, you were injured, but this was a gross, over-extreme response, whatever happened beforehand.'","CCTV footage showed Liam Sewell repeatedly kicking victim laying on floor .

Ailina Tsarnaeva, sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, appeared at a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday morning, accompanied by her lawyer.

Tsarnaeva, sister of the accused Boston Marathon Bombing brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, exits Manhattan Criminal Court in New York . She was later seen leaving the court in the company of her lawyer. 'Leave my man alone,' she said in a phone call on August 25, according to the criminal complaint relating to the threats. 'Stop looking for him. I have people. I know people that can put a bomb where you live.' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Abreu said Tsarnaeva was apparently referencing her brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who had been the subjects of an intense manhunt in the Boston area in the days after the deadly April 2013 marathon bombing. Tamerlan was later killed. Prosecutors said Tsarnaeva had driven past the woman's house since an order of protection was issued.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) died after a gunbattle with police . Tsarnaeva's attorney, Susan Marcus, said her woman disputes making such statements. 'My client is an easy target,' Marcus said. 'This is an uncorroborated claim.' Marcus said in September that Tsarnaeva, a mother-of-two, and her family had 'absolutely no means,' and she did not deserve to be jailed. Tsarnaeva avoided jail by pleading guilty last month to misleading a police detective during a counterfeiting investigation in Massachusetts. She entered the plea in South Boston Municipal Court in early November. If she avoids further legal trouble for 30 days, she will be free of any court supervision. If she does get into trouble, the judge could sentence her up to two and a half years in jail. Prosecutors said Tsarnaeva failed to cooperate with a police officer investigating the passing of a counterfeit bill by a group of people eating at an Applebee's restaurant in the South Bay Center, a mall in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, on April 16, 2010. A server saw the group leaving and wrote down their license plate number. She also was arrested in 2009 on charges she left the scene of an accident, but the case was dismissed, prosecutors said.

"A Russian father who fed parrots, guinea pigs, cats and puppies to his pet snake and filmed the gruesome footage is being hunted by police. Father-of-two Andrei Generalov, 32, from St. Petersburg in north-western Russia, started uploading videos of his Boa Constrictor 'King' devouring rats and hamsters. But as the videos rose in popularity, he began taking suggestions from viewers who demanded more 'blood and gore'. With this in mind, he started feeding 'King' larger animals in the sickening videos, which included terrified puppies. In the videos, he tells his audience: 'Why these senseless sacrifices? It's for the sake of food (ha ha). 'I like to film the way the animals fight for their lives, suffer and eventually die.' Scroll down for video .

An excited Mr Generalov says: 'I like to film the way the animals fight for their lives, suffer and eventually die' The guinea pig tries to wriggle free but the snake has jaws lined with small hooked teeth, for holding their prey . A petition has started in St Petersburg, Russia, by those appalled by the suffering of the animals . But furious campaigners - outraged at the appalling suffering - began a petition to take Mr Generalov to court. After collecting more than 4,000 signatures, they handed it to the prosecutors office who ordered police to arrest him. Chief Prosecutor Sergey Litvinenko said: 'An arrest warrant has been put out for this man but he has now disappeared. 'Anyone with information of his whereabouts should contact us or the police directly.' Local petition signer Tigran Evdokimov, 28, said: 'What this man did was sickening beyond belief. 'To film such cruelty and to enjoy it is the work of a very sick and dangerous man.' But his friend, Leopold Polyakov, 35, defended Mr Generalov describing him as a 'good, family man'. He said: 'Andrei is a very good man, a family man. He has three cats at home and has never shown any sign of cruelty towards people or animals. 'I find it just incomprehensible that he would do this.' Boa Constrictors will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, monkeys and wild pigs . In the videos, the Russian father tells his audience: 'Why these senseless sacrifices?

It is a member of the Boidae family and is found in the wild in North, Central and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. They live for between 20 and 30 years, reach up to 13ft in length and can weigh up to 60lbs or 27kgs. Like their cousins, Anacondas, Boas are excellent swimmers but prefer to stay on dry land. In the wild they tend to live in hollow logs and mammals burrows. Their jaws are lined with small hooked teeth, for grabbing and holding their prey, while wrapping their muscular bodies around their victim, squeezing it until it suffocates. Boas will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, monkeys and wild pigs. Their jaws can stretch to allow them to swallow their prey whole. Female boas incubate their eggs outside their bodies and can give birth to up to 60 babies during their lives. Some boa constrictors are hunted for their fine, ornate skin and as such, many of the species are endangered.","Andrei Generalov, 32, uploads videos of his Boa Constrictor eating animals .

The Kahns had a rocky residency in the 4,000 sq foot living space, having reduced the price multiple times after its initial listing as well as divorcing. There was even an unexplained fire just before they moved in. Their experience does nothing to lessen rumors the place something of a haunted house for the one per cent, cursed by Madoff's financial sins. Patsy laughed at the superstition to the Post shortly before purchasing penthouse duplex. '[Alfred] was worried about the karma, but I just loved the terrace,' she said. Beside whatever spooks may linger, Benenson now has three-bedrooms, four-and-a-half baths, and a wrap-around terrace.

But his high-flying lifestyle came crashing down in 2008 when it emerged it was being funded by the biggest financial fraud in U.S. history. The following year Madoff pleaded guilty to siphoning $17.5billion from thousands of investors in a long-running, pyramid-style scam.

"Two different strains of bird flu have been discovered in Washington State, just weeks after an outbreak across the border in Canada. The separate strains of the H5 virus were found in a northern pintail duck and a gyrfalcon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Tuesday. The discovery comes weeks after the virus was discovered in British Columbia, resulting in the deaths of 155,000 birds and the quarantine of several farms. A pintail duck (left) and a gyrfalcon (right) have both been diagnosed with bird flu . Both American cases were found in Whatcom County, which is on the Canadian border. However, officials were unwilling to say they had definitely spread from British Columbia. 'There are many strains of avian influenza, and it is not uncommon for wild waterfowl to carry the virus,' said Dr. Joe Baker, Washington's state veterinarian. But officials have moved to reassure the public there was no immediate risk to residents. The two viruses found in Washington State have been found in other parts of the world and have not caused any human infection to date, the USDA said. Dr Kristen Mansfield, a veterinarian with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said: 'There's really no reason to panic. This does not represent an increased risk to people. 'There's very little to no risk of these viruses affecting people.' Hector Castro, a spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture, said that after the Canadian outbreak, the state stepped up random testing in domestic poultry flocks near the border and put out information to other bird owners. The arrival of the disease in British Columbia has had a devastating affect on poultry farmers, with tens of thousands of turkeys having to be euthanized in the run-up to the industry's busiest time of year. A number of farms in British Columbia have had to be quarantined since the outbreak . An outbreak of bird flu in Japan has led to the government ordering the slaughter 4,000 chickens . Farms in Japan have also been hit by bird flu outbreaks, and the government has now ordered the slaughter of 4,000 chickens after cases were discovered in the south-west of the country. Bird flu - also known as avian influenza - has killed humans in the past. However, the infectious disease, caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus, has 15 different strands. The strand which is deadly to humans, and can be caught from birds, is the H5N1 strain. Since 2003, it has killed 379 people - or 59 per cent of those who have become infected. But so far, there have been no reported cases of this strand in any of the outbreaks across the globe. Outbreaks have also been reported in Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany in the last two months. So far, no cases have been confirmed in commercial poultry in the US. But Dr Baker warned poultry owners it was critical to take steps to protect their birds from wild fowl. It is thought the falcon, which was diagnosed with the H5N8 strain of the disease after its owner took it to a vet, had been fed wild birds killed by hunters. The wild duck was diagnosed with the H5N2 strain of bird flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there was an outbreak of the H5N2 virus in a flock of chickens in Texas in 2004. That was the first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 20 years, the CDC said. The bird flu strain that has caused the most global concern is H5N1, which began ravaging poultry across Asia in 2003 and is more easily spread among humans.","Officials confirmed two cases in Washington State on Tuesday .

The FBI has joined the hunt to catch the killer of a 19-year-old girl found burned alive in a rural road in Mississippi . Federal investigators will assist local and state authorities to probe the death of Jessica Chambers, it was announced yesterday. The case has so far stymied police and horrified residents of Courtland, a small town in northern Mississippi. On December 6 Chambers was found on fire and walking away from her burning car on the edge of Courtland . Her whole body, save for the soles of her feet, was burned, and she later died of her injuries. More than a week later, authorities have not identified a suspect or person of interest in Chambers' death and have made no arrests. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are all involved in the investigation, said Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby, whose office remains in charge of the case. 'We've interviewed numerous, numerous people,' said Darby. 'Some we will re-interview.' Courtland Fire Chief Cole Haley said Chambers made a dying statement to him, but he would not disclose what she said. Her sister told Reuters last week that Chambers had identified her killer before dying, but the sister has since declined further comment. The unsolved killing put the town of fewer than 500 people on edge, said Courtland resident Michael Eubanks. 'It's scary,' he said. 'You don't know who it was, and it could happen to anybody else.' Panola County District Attorney John Champion said there had been an unusual lack of street chatter about Chambers' death, but autopsy results and tests from the state crime lab expected later this week could help open up more leads. 'I've been in a lot of murder investigations,' he said. 'This is one of the more bizarre that I've dealt with.' Remembering: Mourners wrote personal messages on banners after the service and ahead of a candlelit vigil . Grief: Two people hold each other as they make their way into the chapel for Jessica's service . Tributes: Friends and relatives wrote messages and tributes to Jessica on her casket on Saturday . Mourning: Tearful guests paid their respects to the 19-year-old as police struggle to solve her murder . Memories: Her family compiled a tribute book filled with pictures of Jessica throughout her life . At a press conference on Thursday, District Attorney John Champion said they have spoken to 'many, many' people  but still feel like there is still a lot they do not know. In an emotional appeal ahead of her funeral, Jessica's father Ben Chambers said of the killer: 'They just don’t realize how they’ve messed up people’s lives. You know, they took something from me that God give me that can’t nobody replace.' Friends of Jessica's who attended the wake wore t-shirts branded with the phrase 'Justice for Jessica'. 'Anybody with any type of information on Jessica to come forward please,' friend Heather Parker said via WREG. The US Marshals Service has announced $11,000 will be handed to the person that can offer crucial information. 'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done it,' he said. 'We feel like somebody out there has heard something.' Speaking with Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale, they said there were some rumors circulating that were not true, including that Chambers was still on fire when she was found. But it has emerged that the killer apparently got into the car before setting it alight. The teenager also had a large gash on her head. To piece together the last few hours of her life, investigators continue to pore over surveillance footage from a gas station where she was seen 90 minutes before her death. They are also looking at her cell phone, which was left behind at the scene. 'We're leaving no stone unturned at this point,' Champion added. 'This is an absolute horrendous case... This situation is about as bad as it comes.' The gas station surveillance footage shows her climbing out of her car, walking across the forecourt and stopping to wave at a friend, before walking off camera. She then returns to the store to pay. Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel, who served the teenager, told the Associated Press that Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her. According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said. 'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said. Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store . Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby . Scene: The gas station and convenience store Jessica visited before she was found severely burned along the side of a nearby road. The cashier claims Jessica told him she was 'going somewhere' Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said. 'I asked her, 'Why are you putting so much gas?' She said, 'I'm going somewhere',' Fadhel said. Authorities have not commented on the claims. On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. When she left, she headed south on Highway 51, he said. About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the burned young woman. She was not covered in flames, as previously reported, authorities said at the press conference. Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off . Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight . Crime scene: Yellow crime scene tape marks the location where the 19-year-old  was found severely burned. Authorities are working to piece together the last hours of her life in efforts to catch who set her on fire . Grisly discovery: The teenager was barely conscious when first responders arrived to her car, which was on this bank, and she managed to whisper something - but authorities have not revealed what she said . She whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that the final words may help find her killer, WMC reported. 'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. Peter Odom, an attorney who has prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects. 'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said. Plea: District Attorney John Champion pleaded for information as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday . Tragic: Two years before Jessica's death, her older brother Ben (right) was killed in a car crash . Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. 'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.' Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, but they have said her appearance - pajama trousers and her hair in a bun - suggests she did not attend the party. Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone. They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved. Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information . Ripped apart: Her father Ben, pictured right, has also appealed for any information in her death . 'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.' Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday. Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.

"My husband is wonderful at a great many things but gift selection is not among them. So the run up to Christmas becomes increasingly rife with anxiety, amid regular pleas to 'just tell me what you want'.

"Gordon Strachan insists he has no issue with the Tartan Army booing Irish duo Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy — as long as it is on purely footballing grounds. Both players were born in Glasgow but opted to use family ties to represent the Republic of Ireland. While playing in Scotland with Celtic and Hamilton, respectively, they suffered abuse at the hands of rival fans. James McCarthy (left) in action for Everton on Saturday afternoon, pictured alongside Bafetimbi Gomis . Now Everton team-mates in the English Premier League, however, Strachan has seen the duo attract huge transfer fees since and believes any abuse from the Scotland support in next week’s Euro 2016 qualifier at Parkhead will be a testament to their footballing abilities. Asked if Scots fans should lay off the pair, Strachan — who named Rangers youngster Lewis Macleod in a 27-man squad yesterday — said: ‘No, they can do what they want. ‘Are you going to ask them to pay 60 quid and then tell them they can’t say something? ‘As long as you don’t have that nastiness about it, then that is fine. But we have all been booed. I used to come here (to Parkhead) regularly and get booed. It didn’t bother me. And that was when I was the manager. ‘It is part of football. It is like pantomime stuff. As long as it is pantomime humour, then we don’t mind that. If it goes beyond that, then that’s not fine.’ Addressing claims that previous abuse of McGeady and McCarthy might have betrayed a strain of anti-Irish sentiment in Scottish football, Strachan believes it might now happen for a different reason. Aiden McGeady also played in the match on Saturday, he is pictured (left) vying for the ball with Sung Yueng Ki . ‘Do you know why they’ll get booed? It is because they are good players,’ he said. ‘If they were useless, they would not boo them. ‘As long as you keep it to the boos and leave it like that, so it is pantomime booing, that is what I like. That is good fun. They are getting booed because they are terrific players.’ McCarthy’s grandfather hailed from Donegal and was a strong influence on his career, while McGeady also qualified for Ireland via the grandparent rule and played for Ireland up to Under-17 level before the SFA fully appreciated his ability. Sanguine on the decision both players made, Strachan insisted: ‘Listen, you play for whatever country you feel you are. If you feel Irish, then you play for Ireland and, if you feel you are Scottish, then you play for Scotland. ‘My boys are as Scottish as anyone but have lived most of their time in England. ‘Whatever you feel you are, wherever you feel you come from, where your family come from, you do that. I don’t have a problem with that.’ Gordon Strachan says he is happy for Scotland fans to boo the pair, but if it is in the right spirit . As Celtic manager, Strachan’s relationship with McGeady was occasionally strained. The Everton player has admitted that abuse from Scottish fans irritated him in the past but the Scotland manager believes booing will have no impact on his former charge. ‘Absolutely not,’ he said. ‘It will not bother him. He is a terrific player, so it will not bother him, and it will not bother James McCarthy. Despite widespread criticism of ticket prices, the SFA are close to a 60,000 sell-out for the encounter with the Republic — with travelling supporters allocated just over 3,000 briefs. Strachan, meanwhile, said there was no question of Stuart McCall quitting the Scotland set-up, following his resignation as Motherwell manager. ‘No, we didn’t even think about that,’ he said. ‘I think he is fine. He is good.’ Stoke full-back Phil Bardsley has been recalled to the squad in the absence of the injured Alan Hutton.","Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy were both born in Glasgow .

"Broadcaster: Joan Bakewell, 81, says she suffers from memory lapses and has become concerned it is not 'simple forgetfulness' Joan Bakewell yesterday revealed her fear of being diagnosed with dementia. The broadcaster says she suffers from memory lapses and has become concerned it is not ‘simple forgetfulness’. The 81-year-old now has to rely on prompts such as sticky notes and to-do lists. In a programme called Suppose I Lose It, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 yesterday, Lady Bakewell discussed the issue with Prunella Scales. The 82-year-old Fawlty Towers star has been forced to give up stage performances because of her advancing dementia. She and her actor husband Timothy West manage her condition with the support of a live-in helper. In the BBC‘s online magazine yesterday, Lady Bakewell wrote of her friend’s predicament: ‘The fact is dementia is changing her and their lives together but, as in the best of marriages, it is a shift rather than a catastrophe. ‘Tim clearly feels the loss – when they go out for the evening together they both enjoy the event, but once back home Pru can’t talk about it because it has already slipped from her memory.' Lady Bakewell also reflected on how friends are ‘drifting into this unknown world’ and considered the future of a nation that already has more than 800,000 dementia sufferers. She added: ‘What I’ve been learning about early intervention, the memory clinics, the ongoing research, is enough to persuade me that staying alert for symptoms and confronting fears early is the best way to grow old. I know I shall be taking those memory tests one day soon. Advancing dementia: Actress Prunella Scales (left) has been forced to give up stage performances. She and her actor husband Timothy West (right) manage her condition with the support of a live-in helper . 'There will always be a struggle for resources and new skills. If individuals can help with their own diagnoses, rather than hide away from bad news, then that will help.’ The former Heart of the Matter presenter concludes that her own needs have not changed greatly. She said: ‘Nonetheless it is evident enough for me to take small avoiding steps – sticky notes left around the house, a notepad beside the bed, a list of things to do each day. Thinking ahead: Lady Bakewell (pictured in 1978) reflected on how friends are 'drifting into this unknown world' and considered the future of a nation that already has more than 800,000 dementia sufferers . ‘But then didn’t I do that already when the overload of my busy life threatened to engulf me? 'I have been a journalist for over 40 years, working in different media and keeping tabs on what I do through well-ordered and sometime scruffy diaries, shelves of files and dependence on the support of agents and editors. ‘The agents and editors might well say their support has got stronger in recent months. I happily take for granted their loyalty and friendship. 'A network of obligations that keeps me busy and committed is keeping me on track. If dementia looms, I simply haven’t time to notice.’ Memory problems could be a stroke warning in highly educated people, a study has found. Researchers from the Erasmus University, Rotterdam, discovered that people with a university degree who struggle with memory loss are 39 per cent more likely to have a stroke. Experts believe the reason is that such people have fitter brains, with greater ‘cognitive reserve’. This reserve acts as a buffer if they are affected by brain diseases. As a result decreases in cognitive function, such as memory loss, could be a sign that their resilience has decreased significantly – indicating a greater likelihood of a stroke.","Lady Bakewell relies on prompts such as sticky notes and to-do lists .

"Nottingham Forest defender Danny Fox has released a picture on Instagram of his newly-dyed beard, which he hopes will raise awareness for Cystic Fibrosis. The 28-year-old has made 12 league starts this campaign as his Forest side look to secure promotion to the Premier League. However, off the pitch, Fox has been an ambassador for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust since May 2012, and has taken the radical step of dying his facial hair orange to draw attention to the trust and the work they do.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has quietly suppressed the public release of a lawsuit to keep untaxed cigarettes out of the city after downplaying those involved in Eric Garner's death, it is claimed. The groundbreaking suit was reportedly drafted by New York City's Law Department the same week that a grand jury decided not to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in the death of Garner. It was apparently filed in Brooklyn federal court on December 9 in a bid to prevent out-of-state businesses from supplying cigarette traffickers, who can then avoid hefty state and city taxes. Scroll down for video . 'Suppression': New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (pictured  on The View today with wife, Chirlane McCray (second left) has suppressed the public release of a lawsuit to keep untaxed cigarettes out of the city, it is claimed . Tragic: The suit was reportedly drafted by the city's Law Department the same week that a grand jury decided not to indict a white officer in the death of Eric Garner (left and right, at the time of his death on Staten Island) Following its filing, the Law Department wrote a press release, claiming the suit 'is the first of its kind brought by the city against an out-of-state entity for supplying cigarette traffickers', it is said. But before it could send it out, de Blasio, who criticized the city's police union leaders on 'The View' today, ordered City Hall lawyers to suppress the announcement, sources told the New York Post. The Mayor has recently 'minimized' Garner's purchase of illegal cigarettes in Staten Island - a crime that he was being questioned about when he was put in an apparent chokehold by Pantaleo. Garner, a 43-year-old father of three, died shortly after the incident on July 17. On December 3, a grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo, sparking protests across the country. Appearance: The Mayor (pictured with Ms McCray) has recently minimized Garner's purchase of illegal cigarettes in Staten Island, New York - a crime that he was being questioned about when he passed away . Illegal sales: Nearly 57 per cent of cigarettes smoked in New York are smuggled across state lines - the highest percentage nationwide, according to the Tax Foundation , a Washington-based think-tank (file image) On Hot 97 Radio a day after the verdict, de Blasio said: 'Eric Garner was a decent man. Obviously, it was a minor offense he was committing - there’s no way it should have ended up in this situation.' Referring to the politician's supposed concealment of the untaxed cigarettes lawsuit, a city official told the newspaper: 'City Hall knew they had screwed up, so they squashed the press release. 'You can’t have the mayor blabbing away that selling loosies is a ""minor offense"", but then have the Law Department, which represents and protects the city and the mayor’s interests, file this suit. The official accused de Blasio of 'pander[ing] to his voting base' while realising that illegal tobacco sales are 'a major issue with serious ramifications if left unchecked'. The civil racketeering suit targets Discount Tobacco & Things of Woodbridge, Virginia, which allegedly sold more than 2,500 cigarette cartons to an alleged Staten Island bootlegger. If the suit is successful, the business  and its president, Gaby Nouhra, will be barred from distributing cigarettes in New York, and forced to pay back all of its illegal profits and damages. Nearly 57 per cent of cigarettes smoked in New York are smuggled across state lines - the highest percentage nationwide, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think-tank. Protesting: Demonstrators march on Pennsylvania Avenue toward Capitol Hill in Washington last Saturday  in protest at two grand juries decisions not to indict officers in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown . Blocking traffic: Protestors march over the inbound lane of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York the same day . Meanwhile, more than 22 per cent of cigarettes bought in Wyoming are illegally trafficked in - compared to 21.3 per cent of those in Idaho and 21.1 per cent of those in Virginia. By engaging in such illegal activity, criminals can avoid state and city taxes of $58.50 per carton. The grand jury decision over Garner's death followed a similar verdict in Ferguson, St Louis, where a secret panel chose not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. Brown, 18, also black, was shot dead on August 9. Some witnesses have claimed he had his arms raised at the time of the incident, while others argue they were by his sides. Today, de Blasio delivered the latest volley in his ongoing battle with New York's police union leaders, dismissing their ability to speak for their rank-and-file members. Ex-president: Bill Clinton today said Garner was doing something illegal but 'didn't deserve to die' on July 17 . During his appearance on the daytime talk show 'The View', alongside his wife, Chirlane McCray, the Mayor also criticized the Patrolman Benevolent Association's petition to ban him from future New York Police Department funerals as 'inappropriate'. PBA head Patrick Lynch has accused de Blasio of throwing police officers 'under the bus'. Also today, Bill Clinton has waded into the controversy over the 'chokehold' death of Garner, saying that the unarmed black man 'didn't deserve to die'. The former president said that there is a 'divide that exists between the people and the police' which needs addressing. Tapping into the racial tensions around Garner's death, he added that people have 'preconceptions wired into us and we have got to get beyond them.' Speaking to news site Fusion, Clinton said: '[Garner] was obviously not well, he was overweight and vulnerable therefore had heart and lung problems.

"Robert Honan went to sleep with no idea his mother and sister were two of the 18 hostages who were taken during the Sydney siege. The Queenslander was woken about 2.30am on Tuesday by a call from his shaken mother, who told him she had been shot and could not find his sister after they were separated in the chaos that followed the end of the siege,The Courier Mail reported. Louisa Hope, 50, originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, and her 74-year-old mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning when self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis stormed in about 9.30am. Monis was brandishing a pump-action shotgun and held hostages inside the cafe for almost 17 hours as police swarmed the area. Scroll down for video . Injured hostage: Louisa Hope, 50, was held hostage by the self-styled Sheikh . Robyn Hope, the mother of Louisa, was also held hostage in the Lindt cafe . Louisa Hope - who featured in a hostage video - is pictured here being stretchered out of the Lindt Cafe . Mr Honan had been aware the siege was unfolding but had not considered that his family were part of it as the two women had an appointment he assumed they had attended. 'But they went there [to the cafe] first and never got to where they were meant to be going,' he told News Corp. Mr Honan said 'they were terrified and upset and had mixed feelings of they’re alive'. The ex-husband and close friend of Ms Hope, who preferred to go by the name Tony V, told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning his former partner was injured during the last moments of the siege. He told how she was used as a 'human shield' by the gunman just before the crisis came to a bloody end. 'He'd used her for a human shield for most of the time that she was in there,' the ex-husband, who used to live in Bondi but now runs a restaurant in South Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, said. 'That was just before the young lad was shot when he went to take the gun off the gunman.' The dramatic siege - considered a terrorist event according to NSW Police Force protocols - came to an end about 2am on Tuesday morning when hostages attempted a mass escape and cafe manager Tori Johnson attempted to grab Monis' weapon. Monis was falling asleep but woke up as the escape was underway. 'He [Monis] had dozed off. He was falling asleep,' Tony said. Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape . 'Some rustling noises had woke him when the lad was trying to take the gun off him. 'That's when [Mr Johnson] was shot. Apparently that's when my ex-mother-in-law [Robyn] was then shot in the shoulder and that's when the police then went in... and that's when Louisa was shot in the foot.' Mr Johnson was killed as well as barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson who died after she was taken to hospital. At least four people were injured and taken to hospital. Ms Hope's ex-partner, who spoke to family on Tuesday morning UK time, said the whole incident had been 'very frightening'. He had some words of support for his injured friend, who he said has been operated on and is recovering in hospital. 'I'd just give her a hug and just tell her to keep strong,' Tony said. 'She's a strong woman with a lot of faith in God.'","Robert Honan went to bed on Monday night without any knowledge his family members were inside the Sydney cafe .

"Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis became more frightening and violent as he got deeper into 'his Islamic studies' and at one point displayed such scary behaviour that his mother-in-law realised for the first time just how 'dangerous' he was. In a court appearance just over a year before she was murdered in a brutal killing which Monis was alleged to have plotted, his late wife Noleen Hayson Pal revealed how he became more and more paranoid as his Islamic activities increased. Court documents reveal Monis, who was practising as a 'psychic ... [who] could predict the future' and was unable to control his anger. Scroll down for video . Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis became more frightening and violent as he got deeper into 'his Islamic studies' and at one point displayed such scary behaviour that his mother-in-law realised for the first time just how 'dangerous' he was . It was 11am on August 22, 2009, the Saturday of the Ramadan religious festival and Monis, who went by the name of Michael Hayson at the time, was in the backyard of locksmith Ashouk and his wife Marian Pal's Green Valley home in south-western Sydney. The Pal family are Muslims. He was 45 years old and had been in a de facto relationship with Noleen Hayson Pal, 26. The Pal family was preparing to visit family and friends as is customary at Ramadan, but Monis did not want Ms Pal to go out. The couple lived in a granny flat in he garden of the Green Valley home and Mrs Pal had already noticed how he often argued with her daughter. On Ramadan Saturday 2009, Hayson 'started to argue [with my daughter]'. 'She wanted to go out with me to visit our relatives. You know we go places during Ramadan,' Mrs Pal told Downing Centre Court during an domestic violence order application and hearing for a charge against Monis of intimidation and stalking in January 2012. 'He liked to cause trouble between our friends and family, like telling us to stay away from these people, they're not good enough. In 2009 Monis was in a defacto relationship with Noleen Hayson Pal . In a court appearance just over a year before she was murdered in a brutal killing which Monis was alleged to have plotted, his late wife Ms Pal revealed how he became more and more paranoid as his Islamic activities increased . 'That day he created so much problem... He was showing his true colours. 'He started to argue and then ... he was out of his sense ... like he was banging his head with his hand. 'He was very angry and my daughter was pleading with him ""I want to go and visit Mum's friends"".' Mrs Pal said Monis was banging his head forcibly and 'that day I really saw him how ... arrogant and dangerous he was'. But it would be another two years before Noleen Pal threw Monis out of the granny flat, an act which would unleash a violent tirade of death threats and revenge. Ms Pal told Campbelltown Court she had met Monis as Michael Hayson in early 2003 when she answered his newspaper advertisement as a 'psychic' and she made an appointment. She said Monis was selling his services for 'like where he can tell the future and stuff'. They began a relationship which she said the began to break down in 2006 because he was 'too busy doing his own stuff ... he was taking a lot more time out for his Islamic activities. In October last year, Man Haron Monis was charged with accessory before and after the fact of Ms Pal's murder and his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis (pictured) was charged with murder . Ms Pal told a court he tried to hit her, but her mother Mrs Pal intervened . 'He wasn't hardly coming home ... financially he wasn't supporting me, as well. He wasn't supportive. He didn't care. She said she didn't report it to police because 'I was scared ... that if I did ... he would do something even worse'. She said Monis had also tried to hit her, but her mother had intervened. Despite the deterioration of their relationship, Monis continued to visit Ms Pal and stay in the granny flat two days a week. She said during this time he became more and more paranoid as he got into his Islamic activities 'Every time he's come to my house, he's been very paranoid,' she told the court. 'As soon as he walks into the house, the doors have to be closed, the blinds have to be drawn, we can't go outside. Monis reportedly became very paranoid as he got deeper into his Islamic studies and Ms Pal feared if she moved out with him he would control her . 'He's always saying to me that people are watching, people are hearing our conversations, especially when he started getting more into his Islamic activities, running the websites.' She said he came and went 'randomly, whenever he pleased' until finally, on June 18, 2011, she told him to take all his things and not come over again. 'He was shocked, surprised and said ""Are you sure?"". I did see his face change. He became, like angry. 'I was worried he could just attack me, like become violent in that moment.' She said she was frightened and over the next week when he came back almost every day to collect his belongings, she 'avoided talking to him ... because I didn't want to start any more arguments or get him angry towards me. 'Like when I do start up with conversations he, instead of talking calmly, he starts getting angry.' Monis then started pleading with Ms Pal to move out of her parents' property and to go and live with him, which she resisted. Mrs Pal told the court of many instances where she realised just how dangerous Monis was, fearing for the wellbeing of her daughter . 'I knew if I move out with him he'll start controlling me. He'll start doing you know whatever he wanted with me.' At around 9pm on July 20, 2011 he demanded an 'urgent' meeting in person with her at McDonalds in Hinchinbrook, near her parents' home. Ms Pal's parents would not let her go alone and drove her in her car  to the fast food outlet, and waited in the car as Monis tried to draw Ms Pal into the darkest area of the McDonalds car park. Mrs and Mrs Pal watched their daughter arguing with Monis, noting his 'angry face'. Ms Pal said after several minutes of talking, he said to her in a loud angry voice, '... you're going to pay, even if I have to shoot you.' Ms Pal returned shaking and terrified to her family in the car and drove home. Her mother told the court that following the encounter her daughter had been 'very upset, nervous ... frightened at the same time ... because I think she knows how dangerous Michael is.' Monis' ex-wife told of her fear of going to police worried that her husband would commit more serious violence against her . Monis was arrested a week later and in a long, rambling interview he gave at St Mary's Police station, he flatly denied the threat saying 'I swear to God, I swear to God is lie, absolutely a lie. I swear to God it's a lie.' The court hearing was adjourned twice and on May 30, 2012, Man Haron Monis aka Mohammad Hassan Mengheti was found not guilty of stalking and intimidation of Noleen Hayson Pal. Just under 12 months later Ms Pal was dead, following a brutal attack after she was lured to the Werrington apartment where Monis was living in western Sydney on a Sunday afternoon, April 2, 2013. Attacked in the stairwell by a 'woman in a black cape', Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times, doused with accelerant and then set alight as horrified neighbours watched on. In October last year, Man Haron Monis was charged with accessory before and after the fact of Ms Pal's murder and his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis was charged with murder. On December 12, both were released on bail to await trial.","Court documents have revealed how self-styled sheikh Man Horan Monis frightened those around him .

"DNA samples from thousands of foreign criminals have been deleted from British databases due to a legal loophole. Police are not allowed to store swabs or fingerprints from offenders who were convicted abroad, it emerged yesterday. The scandal was revealed in the annual report from Britain’s independent biometrics watchdog. In one case, police had to delete samples from a burglary suspect after he was arrested in the UK, even though he had served 13 years for similar offences elsewhere in Europe. Scandal: DNA samples from thousands of foreign criminals have been deleted in Britain (file photo) Police are only allowed to store biometric data when an offender has been convicted in Britain. If they are merely arrested, the data must be destroyed. The Biometrics Commissioner, Alastair MacGregor, said: ‘This seemed to me to be an obviously unsatisfactory state of affairs which might well be putting the UK public at unnecessary risk.’ He continued: ‘The effect of those legislative arrangements has been that the DNA profiles and fingerprints of some thousands of individuals who have been convicted of such offences outside England and Wales have had to be deleted from the UK national databases.’ Until 2008, officers were allowed to keep profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The details of about 4.5million people are held on the British database even though one in five – including 40,000 children – have never been charged. Even those convicted in other countries can have their details deleted if innocent in the UK (file photo) However, a landmark ruling from European judges has meant that it is now unlawful for police to store swabs and fingerprints from suspects later cleared of wrongdoing. The current rules mean a foreign suspect could be arrested in Britain but, after being released, their DNA would still be deleted from British databases even though police know they have been convicted of a crime elsewhere. They could then commit an offence in Britain and get away with it, because officers would not be able to use their DNA samples to secure a conviction. The Home Office said that for the most serious criminals – such as rapists, murders and terrorists – exceptions could be made. However, in order to retain DNA from the majority of overseas offenders, police must repeatedly visit them to take further samples and fingerprints under different sections of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Mr MacGregor said this would place huge workloads on forces. In addition, he warned that re-arresting suspects and forcing them to provide new DNA samples could ‘constitute greater interference with their privacy’ than holding on to samples that have already been taken. The watchdog said the legislation also meant ‘difficulties have arisen’ with retaining biometric data from criminals who have been convicted in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which are different police jurisdictions. If a foreign criminal is arrested on suspicion of a crime in the UK, details of previous offences can be secured from police forces elsewhere in Europe. But Mr MacGregor also warned that these cannot be placed on the police’s national computer database unless the suspect is convicted here. The news comes after the Association of Chief Police Officers revealed that foreigners accounted for one in seven crime suspects apprehended last year.","Scandal revealed in annual report by Britain's biometrics watchdog .

"A man charged Tuesday with fatally stabbing a 75-year-old grandmother from Minnesota he didn't know in a Duluth grocery store told investigators he went to the store to 'either shop or kill somebody,' it was revealed today. Jesse Dahlstrom, 35, is accused of grabbing Sally Marie Pionk, of Proctor, from behind in the bakery section of Super One Foods on December 11 and stabbing her in the neck. Pionk 'lost a tremendous amount of blood' and died at the scene, according to a criminal complaint. Horrific attack: Jesse Dahlstrom (left), 35, is accused of grabbing Sally Marie Pionk (right), 75, from behind inside a Duluth, Minnesota, supermarket and stabbing her in the neck . Crime scene: The random knife attack took place in the bakery section of Super One Foods. A store employee intervened and tried to kick the attacker away from Pionk, but it was too late . Dahlstrom appeared in St. Louis County District Court on one count of premeditated first-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence upon conviction in Minnesota. The 35-year-old murder suspect made numerous outbursts in court, saying he wanted to represent himself, WDIO-TV reported. Judge Eric Hylden set bail at $1million. Criminal proceedings are on hold while Dahlstrom undergoes a mental health evaluation requested by his public defender and approved by the judge. According to the complaint, a witness reported seeing Dahlstrom enter the store at around 8pm last Thursday, pull out a steak knife and walk around with no attempt to conceal the weapon. A male employee saw Dahlstrom come up behind Pionk and stared at her for about 20 seconds before grabbing the unsuspecting woman and putting his arm around her neck, the complaint said. Pionk 'immediately went down to the floor, and the employee ran to kick Dahlstrom away from her. Dahlstrom dropped the knife and was held by several people until police officers responded to the scene. Cold-blooded: The mentally unstable suspect told investigators he went to the store to 'either shop or kill somebody' An autopsy found Pionk suffered 'sharp and blunt force trauma to her neck' and died from blood loss, the complaint said. 'Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Sally Marie Pionk,' St. Louis County Attorney Mark Rubin said in a statement Monday, adding, 'We will do our best to hold the offender accountable and seek justice.' Pionk's family thanked the store's employees and customers for their help in trying to save her from her attacker. 'Sally was a wonderful and dedicated mother,' the family's statement said. 'She was a caretaker of many. There wasn't a day that went by that she didn't assist someone in need.' Dahlstrom's family released a statement Monday claiming they had unsuccessfully tried to have him committed for psychiatric treatment seven years ago. 'The judge set him free, and he hitchhiked to Duluth,' wrote Dhalstrom's uncle, Burt Nordstrand. 'It was the beginning of the end.' The statement went on to say how over the years, Dahlstrom's condition has deteriorated. ‘He’s now much, much worse, and in spite of many requests for help, there was none,’ the statement said. ‘The system failed him.’ A grand jury will convene to review the case and decide whether or not the first-degree murder should stand, according to Duluth News-Tribune. If the jury declines to indict Dahlstrom, the prosecution will bring a lesser charge of second-degree murder against him. A candlelight light vigil will be held in Sally Marie Pionk's honor beginning at 7.30pm Saturday at the Duluth grocery store. Her family and friends described the 75-year-old matriarch to the News-Tribune as a loving mother and grandmother who dedicated her life to helping others, especially the elderly. Those who knew her said she loved country music and polka, and even recorded an album with her best friend in 2013 - something she had been dreaming of doing for many years.","Jesse Dahlstrom, 35, charged with first-degree murder in December 11 death of Sally Marie Pionk, 75, inside Duluth, Minnesota, grocery store .

"A woman discovered a passive aggressive letter she wrote to the Tooth Fairy 23-years-ago when she was just nine-years-old. After Jenny, who goes by the Reddit name Judokitten, posted the letter on Monday it got nearly 6,000 points and thousands of comments in response. 'My dad found my passive aggressive note that I wrote to the Tooth Fairy,' Jenny wrote with the snapshot of the letter she wrote back in 1991. The author: Jenny, 32, discovered the letter at her family's home over the weekend and posted to Reddit on Monday not expecting to get the overwhelming response she did . 'It was better than I remember.' Jenny told Yahoo Parenting that she recalls writing the letter at a time when she was starting to, 'figure out the truth' about things like the Tooth Fairy and Santa . She said that after losing a tooth she'd wait for two days to tell anyone to see if the Tooth Fairy would actually come. 'So when I lost this tooth, I didn’t tell anyone for two days because I wanted to see if she would come,' said Jenny. Jenny told her mother about her anger towards the Tooth Fairy and her mother suggested she write a letter to the Tooth Fairy telling her how she felt. '(Not very) Dear T. F. — This is the second time you’ve done this. You forgot me. So if you’re not going to come, then I’m going to keep my own teeth. You are through collecting teeth. From Jennifer. From now on I’m keeping my own teeth. Unsincerely, Jennifer E. PS Keep collecting from Mike, though. Obviously you like him better. P.P.S. Don’t bother to write back,' said the letter. The next day, the Tooth Fairy (Jenny's mother) wrote Jenny a letter back. Letter to the Tooth Fairy: 'My dad found my passive aggressive note that I wrote to the Tooth Fairy,' Jenny wrote with the snapshot of the letter she wrote back in 1991 . 'I couldn’t get to your pillow the night before last because I got stuck in all the mess. Maybe if you clean your room, I could get to you in a timely manner,' said the note in response which arrived the next day. Jenny thought of the letter when she went to visit her parents over the weekend. After Jenny brought up the letter to her father he was able to pull it out from a notebook minutes later. 'My mom keeps all of my adorable things —like my kindergarten graduation cape — and my dad keeps all the snarky things, so it made sense that he would have it,' said Jenny. Jenny said that her mother's response to her Tooth Fairy letter let her in on the secret that the tooth fairy wans’t real. 'Her response was a quiet acknowledgement between us that my mom and I both knew the truth,' Jenny said. 'Mike, my brother – well, I won’t reveal how long he believed. But let’s just say for his last tooth, the Tooth Fairy gave him gas money.' Jenny who has a seven-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter hasn’t had to deal with her children doubting the Tooth Fairy's existence yet but she has been late on a few tooth payments. 'I’ve forgotten to leave money before and had to come up with excuses for why the Tooth Fairy was late, though none were as good as my mom’s,' she told Yahoo. 'Recently I used, ""you lost the tooth really late in the afternoon so the fairy already got her list for the day. She’ll catch up with you tomorrow."" I think it worked!'","After Jenny, who goes by the Reddit name Judokitten, posted the letter on Monday it got nearly 6,000 points and thousands of comments in response .

"Good things come in small packages — except bubbles, apparently. Over the past year we’ve developed a thirst for champagne and sparkling wine in big bottles, with sales of magnums more than doubling in Waitrose. Marks & Spencer recently launched a range of magnums and Tesco is now selling a £499 Methuselah — the equivalent of eight bottles of champagne. But what difference does a big bottle make? Well, for a start, they have show-stopping qualities. Walk (or rather, stagger) into a room carrying one and it says generous host without you even having to open your mouth. Scroll down for video . Over the past year we’ve developed a thirst for champagne and sparkling wine in big bottles, with sales of magnums more than doubling in Waitrose . Then there’s the quality argument. Magnums, holding 150cl or two bottles, effectively slow down the ageing process of the fizz within. That’s because contact with air helps wine to develop and age. A magnum neck size is the same as a 75cl bottle so they both have the same amount of air in contact with the wine inside, but there’s twice as much liquid inside the magnum. It’s this lower air-to-wine ratio that enables the wine inside to evolve more gently over time. So it is that fizz from a magnum usually tastes fresher and brighter than the equivalent wine from a standard sized bottle. A magnum neck size is the same as a 75cl bottle but there’s twice as much liquid inside the magnum . Unfortunately, buying a bigger bottle doesn’t necessarily mean bagging a bargain. Magnums are usually at least double the price of a single bottle, owing to higher production and packaging costs. But there are some great wines to be found, assuming you don’t mind lugging the bottle home afterwards. Of course, there is one other major logistical problem with big bottles: they don’t fit in the fridge door. But a kitchen sink or ice bucket filled with half water, half ice will chill a magnum nicely in half an hour. When it comes to pouring, the easiest way to do it is with one hand at the bottom of the bottle, thumb in the punt, or dimple. Then with the other hand, cradle the neck of the bottle. Magnums require a little more muscle than usual; Jeroboams (containing four bottles of champagne) take both stamina and a steady hand. Mark the occasion with a Methuselah and you’ll need an extra pair of hands — as the equivalent of eight bottles it weighs more than 11kg! If you fancy super-sizing your fizz this year, here’s my pick of the magnum bunch. Grandi Mori Prosecco . 150cl, £11.99, Aldi . Aldi has shipped in a few different magnums this year but this one stands out not just because what’s inside is delicious, but the dark, curvy bottle makes it look way more expensive than it is. Really frothy and fabulous, with lots of apple and citrus fruit flavours. Fillipo Sansovino Prosecco Magnum . 150cl, £12 on offer (normally £15), Asda . Pretty label? Tick. Lovely stuff inside the bottle? Double tick. Great value? Double tick, again. This one’s fresher than many of its rivals too, with gorgeous pear fruit flavours. Do as the Italians do and serve it with a dash of Campari if you want to mix it up a bit. Sainsbury’s Conegliano Prosecco, Taste the Difference . 150cl, £14.50 on offer (normally £19), Sainsbury’s . This is one of the best own label proseccos around, with a bit more weight to it than most. But crucially, it’s still light on its feet with crisp lemony fruit. Waitrose Brut Champagne Magnum Brut NV. Made from 90 per cent pinot noir and meunier and 10 per cent chardonnay, it’s ripe with lemon peel and rich with toasty flavours . And because prosecco is generally lower in alcohol than wine (this one’s 10.5 per cent) you can enjoy a glass or two without having to have a lie down afterwards! The Society’s Cava Reserva . 150cl, £17.50, The Wine Society . Cava is made in the same way as champagne, with the second bubble-inducing fermentation taking place in the bottle (with prosecco, this happens in a tank). But being Spanish and made from different grapes, it tastes completely different. Pol Roger Brut Reserve NV Champagne Magnum . The flavours are bigger but not as fine as champagne. This one’s on flying form though, made exclusively for The Wine Society by a small family estate in Penedes. Voted Best Value Cava at the recent Wines From Spain Awards. Waitrose Brut Champagne Magnum Brut NV . 150cl, £39.99 . Some champagnes are as lean as a supermodel but this one’s got proper body and curves. Made from 90 per cent pinot noir and meunier and 10 per cent chardonnay, it’s ripe with lemon peel and rich with toasty flavours. Great value. Billecart-Salmon Brut . 150cl, £75.95, Lea & Sandeman . Hardly cheap, but a real cracker. The style is super smart, with pure red fruits and textured toasty flavours. A bit big for a stocking perhaps, but it’ll definitely fit in a pillowcase. Pol Roger Brut Reserve NV Champagne Magnum . £79.99, Marks & Spencer (online only) Winston Churchill, a lifelong fan of this particular champagne house, once declared Maison Pol Roger the ‘most delightful address in the world’. Not a quiet wine, this’ll get the party started with its out-there citrus flavours. Bollinger Rosé Magnum Champagne Magnum NV . £100, Tesco . Created by blending over 300 so-called ‘base’ wines and made pink by the addition of a touch of grand cru pinot noir. Rich, bold and powerful, with red fruits and spice, this’ll cope with more than just a plate of smoked salmon. It’ll take on turkey quite happily.","Good things come in small packages — except bubbles .

"A painting by Sir Winston Churchill sold for £1.8million last night – a record price for a work of art by the former Prime Minister. The Goldfish Pool at Chartwell, labelled 'extremely personal' by auctioneers, had been estimated to be worth between £400,000 and £600,000. Of the 11 pieces of artwork sold at Sotheby's in London last night, at least five went to American buyers. Two were bought by UK buyers and a further four remained anonymous. A Sotheby's spokesman said: 'Churchill's exceptional ability as a painter was celebrated.' In demand: The Goldfish Pool at Chartwell, labelled 'extremely personal' by auctioneers sold for £1.8million . A portrait of Sir Winston by Sir Oswald Birley, painted in 1950, went for £1.4million – almost ten times its estimated value. In the four days before the sale, which followed the death of Sir Winston's last surviving child, Lady Mary Soames, more than 4,000 people flocked to the auction house to admire the possessions up for sale. Among 150 lots in the auction, the ivory-mounted wooden humidor box Sir Winston used to keep his cigars dry sold for more than £20,000. The war-time Prime Minister's despatch box fetched £158,000, more than 30 times its estimated value. The box is inscribed with 'The Rt Hon Winston S Churchill MP' in gold and is made of scarlet leather. It was used during his time as Secretary of State for the Colonies between February 1921 and October 1922. The box is one of seven Sir Winston used during his time in office. The others are on display in The House of Commons War Rooms. Cigar smoker: The ivory-mounted wooden box Sir Winston used to keep cigars dry sold for over £20,000 . Meanwhile, a photograph of President Franklin D Roosevelt was sold for £32,500. The picture had been estimated to be worth between £2,500 and £3,500 and was a gift from President Roosevelt to Lady Soames, who died in May, aged 91. Beneath the picture are the words: 'For Mary, from her friend the other naval person, Franklin D. Roosevelt'. A chalk drawing of General Charles de Gaulle featured in the auction. The drawing, also a gift to Lady Soames, is inscribed with the words 'Mary, in appreciation from the de Gaulle Statue Committee'. Lady Soames had met de Gaulle at Chequers during World War II and again during the liberation of Paris in 1945. Lady Soames spent most of Sir Winston's career at his side. She was a junior commander in the Auxilary Territorial Service during the war, and was his confidante during critical war-time negotiations. When she died, David Cameron described Lady Soames as 'an eyewitness to some of the most important moments in our recent history'. In total, the 150 lots raised £15.4 million – more than three times the expected amount. Following the sale of his items, 38 of Churchill's paintings will be dispatched to Chatwell, the family's home which is now a National Trust site. There the paintings will hang proudly to be admired by those who visit the estate in Westerham in Kent, where the former British leader lived between 1924 and 1965 – the year of his death.","Goldfish Pool at Chartwell painting by Winston Churchill sold for £1.8m .

"For years they’ve topped the list of disappointing presents. Up there with talc and drawer-scenters, bath salts were the least sexy of all Christmas ‘smellies’. Or at least they were until now. Because this Christmas bath salts have shaken off their maiden aunt image and are marching proudly into the 21st century. Dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting says Dead Sea salts may offer anti-inflammatory properties from the absorption of minerals such as magnesium into itchy skin . There have never been so many varieties on sale, and, after years in the fuddy-duddy doldrums, business is booming. Boots say sales of bath salts are soaring, citing celebrity fans such as Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Lawrence as one reason behind the surge. Sophie Beresiner, beauty director at Elle magazine, thinks she knows another reason why bath salts are enjoying a resurgence. ‘As we become increasingly time and money-poor, indulging in a bath is a real luxury,’ she says. ‘It’s downtime that we schedule in, and we want to ensure maximum relaxation. ‘Using bath salts makes it something of a ritual, especially if they are a premium brand, great quality and scent the whole bathroom.’ Bath salts contain an abundance of trace minerals such as sulphur and magnesium that mimic the properties of natural hot springs . What sets bath salts apart from bubbles or oils is their reputation for healing properties. Tired limbs, sore backs, pulled muscles, stress tensions and even insomnia are all still thought to be cured by a long, salty soak. Bath salts contain an abundance of trace minerals such as sulphur and magnesium that dissolve in your bath and mimic the properties of natural hot springs and therapeutic baths. Some bath salts contain phosphates, which help to exfoliate and soften skin, others glycerin, which lock in moisture. Many come with added essential oils with all their mood-enhancing aromatherapy benefits, muscle-soothing properties and detoxification qualities. If you want the ultimate in relaxation, Himalayan Bath Salts by Therapie (£37 for 400g; cultbeauty.co.uk), created by renowned aromatherapist Michelle Roques O’Neil, are just the thing. These luxurious bath salts, scented with juniper and lemon grass essential oils, promise to lower stress levels and help you relax. A bath with these is as good as a sleeping pill.

Beloved of celebrities such as Laura Bailey and Emma Freud, these Himalayan pink salts, thought to contain 84 of the 92 trace minerals found in the body, have been infused with Mauli’s signature blend of 13 therapeutic oils – including patchouli, sandalwood and Frankincense. If you’re having trouble sleeping, look for bath salts containing lavender, which has been scientifically proven to enhance sleep, such as L’Occitane Relaxing Bath Salts (£16 for 300g; loccitane.com). Or add 2tbsp of Aveda Stress-Fix Soaking Salts (£31 for 450g, aveda.co.uk) to your bath and all your troubles will just drift away. Infused with lavender essential oils and clary sage, which is thought to help balance the central nervous system, these smell wonderful and feel very luxurious. Heaven in a bath soak. If it’s aches and pains you’re suffering from, look for salts that contain thyme, known for its ability to soothe joint and muscle pain. Try Radox Muscle Soak (£1.05 for 400g, boots.com). Boots say sales of bath salts are soaring, citing celebrity fans such as Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Lawrence as one reason behind the surge . If you’ve got a sniffle go for Kneipp Cold and Sinus Relief, (£6.99 for 500g, kneippus.com) as eucalyptus is a decongestant. And if you’re worrying about fitting into your party dress, then a bath with Epsom salts may be just the thing — Elle Macpherson has often cited a bath with salts as her secret weapon in maintaining her enviably flat stomach. Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow, who believes in the detoxifying qualities of bath salts, raves about an Epsom salt bath to relieve a hangover. Kneipp Cold and Sinus Relief, (£6.99 for 500g, kneippus.com ) One of the nicest things about a salt bath is the feeling of buoyancy; when salts are used in high concentrations your limbs feel lighter, as if you’re floating. Rubbed on your skin, they’re a great exfoliator. Dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting says: ‘Where as our usual bubble bath can leave dry, winter skin even more parched, bath salts infused with essential oils can deliver the same aromatic hit without the harsh chemical agents needed to create bubbles. She adds: ‘Those from the Dead Sea may also offer additional anti-inflammatory properties from the absorption of minerals such as magnesium into itchy skin.’ Try Dead Sea Genuine Bath Salts (£7.89 for 1,000g, boots.com). You won’t get heavenly aromas or the soporific effects from essential oils, but these are the real deal. The only ingredient is unadulterated Dead Sea salt. Swirl in warm water and just feel the healing effects. Bliss. And if the season of goodwill has left you penniless, fear not, it couldn’t be easier to make your own bath salts and give them to loved ones as a homemade gift. Just mix up Epsom salts with essential oils, add dried herbs such as thyme or rosemary, a few drops of food colouring, and you’re all set. If you want to go the extra mile, seek out a vintage tin in which to present your gift. You’ll not only be giving the gift of a good night’s sleep, but an enhanced mood and a flatter stomach.","Bath salts contain an abundance of trace minerals .

"An owner who thought his dog had drowned when a storm destroyed their boat has been reunited with his beloved pet after she swam more than a mile in the dark to find him. Stephen Alioto, who lived on the boat in Richardson Bay, California with Daisy his pit bull, was ashore in Sausalito without her when a massive storm battered the area last Thursday. When he returned, all he saw above the water was the boat's mast, and he feared she'd drowned. But in fact, when the boat started filling up with water, Daisy had scrambled through the hatch  and, remembering swimming lessons her owner had given her, made it to shore. Scroll down for video . Back together: Stephen Alioto (left) has been reunited with his dog Daisy after a storm destroyed their boat last week. Rev. Paul Mowry (right), found the dog shivering outside his church in Sausalito, California . She then found her way to Sausalito Presbyterian Church, where she and Alioto sometimes went for free meals. 'My neighbor told me there was a soaking wet, shivering dog crouched in the church doorway,' the Reverend Paul Mowry, who is also the police chaplain, told the Mercury News. 'Initially, I thought she was just a lost dog.' He told the Sausalito police and the Marin Humane Society and an officer scanned Daisy's microchip, which gave them telephone numbers and told them the dog's name was 'Babe'. When Mowry got through to one of the numbers, the person on the end of the phone said the dog had been given away to a friend named Steve, who had changed her name to Daisy. 'We have a Steve who comes to our free lunches on Wednesday,' Mowry said. By this point, Alioto had reported his missing dog to police. After hearing about the report, Sergeant Thomas George recalled the lost dog at the church and called Mowry, Mercury News reported. But Alioto was now homeless and impossible to track down. That's when Mowry's partner, Joe Silverman, suggested they go to location holding the next free meal in the city. Together again: Alioto hugs and kisses Daisy, who was identified by a microchip, after they are reunited . Relief: Alioto said he sobbed when the pastor told him Daisy had turned up outside his church last week . Astonishing: Daisy somehow climbed out of the boat and swam more than a mile in the dark to shore. She headed to the church because she and Alioto sometimes had free meals there, officials believe . The following day, they went to The Open Door Ministries and learned there was a man there telling people his boat sank while his dog was on board. 'I walked over and said to Steve, ""We have your dog."" He said, ""Are you kidding me?"" I told him the dog showed up at the church. He started sobbing and threw his arms around me,' Mowry said. 'I cried so hard,' Alioto told KPIX5. The following day, Mowry took Alioto to the Humane Society to be reunited with Daisy. He told officers that once he took her in, he had changed her name from Babe. He told Mowry that, unlike his belongings, Daisy could never be replaced. 'That dog is his companion,' the pastor said. 'She's his everything.' Alioto told KPIX5 that he was overjoyed to be reunited with his pet. Storm: Alioto's boat was flooded when a huge storm struck Northern California last week. Pictured, children look at a flooded road in Forestville, California last Friday, 50 miles north of where Alioto's boat sank . 'I'm big daddy Kibbles and Bits,' he said of their relationship. 'I'm the guy who provides the dog food, the walks, the baths, and everything that she tells me she needs.' Daisy and Alioto are now staying on a friend's boat. Strangers visiting the Humane Society gave him a 50-pound bag of food, while the shelter gave Daisy a new collar. 'As they were leaving, a Good Samaritan heard the story and handed some money toward Daisy's care,' said Lisa Bloch of the Humane Society. 'This is a beautiful story and I think it says a lot about our community here in Marin and how much we care about animals and people.'

"These are the horrific injuries sustained by a Good Samaritan when he was stabbed 11 times with broken beer bottles. Anthony Jukes, 25, needed more than 100 stitches after he was attacked in a country park in July. Following the assault, he said he could 'see my insides' and was 'holding my rib cage and stomach' to stem the bleeding. Violent thug Robert Barone, 40, was sentenced to eight years in prison this week for the sickening attack. Robert Barone, 40, (pictured left) was imprisoned for eight years for the attack on Anthony Jukes (right) Mr Jukes, from Meir in Stoke, needed more than 100 stitches after he was attacked in a country park in July . Sentencing at Chester Crown Court, Judge Roger Dutton said: 'Mr Jukes was lucky he didn't bleed to death because the extent of his injuries are just awful. '(They were) bad enough at the time but the outcome many months later is not much better. 'He will be living with this experience for the rest of his life.' A court heard the 25-year-old truck driver only had his life saved by an off-duty paramedic who was walking past at the time. Mr Jukes was walking through Astbury Mere Country Park, in Congleton, Staffordshire, when a fight broke out between a friend and another group. As he tried to intervene, he was slashed by Barone who had smashed two beer bottles together. He suffered shocking injuries to his face, chest and arms and was taken to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Mr Jukes he said he could 'see my insides' and was 'holding my rib cage and stomach' to stem the bleeding . The truck driver said: 'I never thought in a million years that something like this would happen to me' Previously describing the savage attack, Mr Jukes said: 'I looked down and could see my insides. I said to myself, ""just keep calm, keep calm"". 'I was holding my rib cage and stomach because I didn't want all the blood to come out. 'I kept as calm as I could because if you are stressed, your blood pressure goes up. 'At the hospital they said I was very lucky. If there hadn't been an off-duty paramedic there, this could have been a very different situation. 'I was in theatre for four hours. They said my injuries were a lot more complicated than they thought. 'But I will have huge scars for the rest of my life all over my body and my face. 'I never thought in a million years that something like this would happen to me - that I would be attacked like this.' In a statement read to the court Mr Jukes, who lives in Packmoor, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'I have received significant, permanent scarring to my face, torso and arms. 'I have been unable to work again. I'm an HGV driver and I cannot even get in a cab now.' Mr Jukes was slashed by father-of-one Barone who had hit two beer bottles together . Barone, a father-of-one from Meir, Stoke-on-Trent,  only handed himself into police when Mr Jukes made an emotional public appeal to find the men who attacked him. The court heard Barone - who has a partner and a two-year-old child - contacted the police on August 2. Bob Sastry, defending, said: 'He went back to Stoke-on-Trent and, when he saw the report, he handed himself in. 'Without that, there wouldn't be any evidence to him being involved with this case. 'I suppose the police may have caught up with him eventually but equally there's an even chance they might not.'","Anthony Jukes, 25, was stabbed 11 times with broken beer bottles .

"Indigenous Brazilians armed with bows and arrows tried to break into the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, battling with police who fired tear gas and pepper spray in response. Around 30 Indians, many in colourful headdresses and some carrying arrows, clashed with law enforcement outside the building in the capital Brasilia yesterday in protest at a bill which would give parliament powers to demarcate indigenous territory. One police officer escaped injury when an arrow struck his boot, but four of his colleagues were hurt in the clashes, as the indigenous people tried to force their way into the chamber of deputies.

Shocking images emerged of angry protesters squaring up to police in riot gear, who fought them off using shields, tear gas and pepper spray. The group attempted to storm a committee which was taking a vote on the bill, causing it to be called off. Four indigenous men were arrested on suspicion of throwing arrows at police officers. The authority to determine which areas of Brazil belong to native peoples currently resides with the country’s executive branch. Indians and other opponents of the new bill say transferring that power to Congress would give more power to large landowners and mining and lumber companies that operate in the Amazon region where most of Brazil's indigenous population lives. That's because they have too much influence over the country's parliament, protesters argue. Indigenous leaders worry the new bill, known as PEC 215/00, could legitimise the occupation of large parts of their land in the Amazon by farmers and loggers.

"India successfully launched its biggest ever rocket today in an effort to ramp up its ambitious space programme. The rocket, designed to carry heavier communication and other satellites into higher orbit, blasted off from Sriharikota in the southeast state of Andhra Pradesh. The launch was the next crucial step in India's space programme history, after the nation successfully put a satellite into orbit around Mars in September. India today announced two more successes in its space program — launching the country's largest rocket and testing the re-entry of an unmanned crew module, part of India's quest to send humans into space . 'This was a very significant day in the history of (the) Indian space programme,' Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman K.S Radhakrishnan said from mission control. ISRO scientists have been riding high since an Indian spacecraft successfully reached Mars on a shoe-string budget, winning Asia's race to the red planet. Although India has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years, it has struggled to match the heavier loads sent up by other countries. The new rocket, weighing 630 tonnes and capable of carrying 4 tonnes, is a boost for India's attempts to grab a greater slice of the £190 billion ($300 billion) global space market. The rocket was carrying the crew module and released it 78 miles (125km) above the Earth. The pod, meant for carrying two to three astronauts, splashed down in the Bay of Bengal . India, which is striving to become a player in the multi-billion dollar space market, has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years, but has faced problems sending up heavier payloads. Pictured is the GSLV Mark-III which launched today . 'India, you have a new launch vehicle with you. We have made it again,' ISRO mission director Mr Somnath said. 'The powerful launch vehicle has come to shape, which will change our destiny... (by) placing heavier spacecraft into communications orbits.' The rocket - officially named the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk-III - was carrying an unmanned crew capsule. ISRO said this successfully separated from the rocket and splashed down in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast 20 minutes after liftoff. ISRO says the crew capsule project would take at least another seven years to reach the point where an astronaut could be put into space. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the test mission as 'yet another triumph of (the) brilliance and hard work of our scientists' in a post on Twitter. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the test mission as 'yet another triumph of (the) brilliance and hard work of our scientists' in a post on Twitter . ISRO said the unmanned crew capsule successfully separated from the rocket and splashed down in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast 20 minutes after liftoff . The GSLV MK-III rocket sits on launch pad at The Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island. The new rocket, weighing 630 tonnes and capable of carrying 4 tonnes, is a boost for India's attempts to grab a greater slice of the £190 billion ($300 billion) global space market . The 630-tonne Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (MK III) blasted off from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh on this morning, the Indian space agency reported . The rocket blasted off from Sriharikota - barrier island off the Bay of Bengal coast located in Andhra Pradesh . In September, India triumphed in its first interplanetary mission, placing a satellite into orbit around Mars. In scenes broadcast live on Indian TV, scientists broke into wild cheers as the orbiter's engines completed 24 minutes of burn time to place the spacecraft around Mars. Scientists described the final stages of the Mars Orbiter Mission, affectionately nicknamed Mom, as flawless. The success marked a milestone for the space program in demonstrating that it can conduct complex missions and act as a global launch pad for commercial, navigational and research satellites. Reaching the fourth planet from the sun is a major feat for the developing country of 1.2 billion people, most of whom are poor. At the same time, India has a robust scientific and technical educational system that has produced millions of software programmers, engineers and doctors. India describes Mom as the first successful Mars mission on a maiden attempt by any country, although Esa also did it on its first Mars mission in 2003. Rival China is also expanding its space exploration program with a space station in orbit and the landing of a lunar rover on the moon earlier this year, although it has not sent a satellite to Mars. India also as its sights on a low-budget missions to land on the moon and study the sun after its recent space successes. 'The aim is three years from now, an Indian lander and Indian rover will land on the moon,' Mr Radhakrishnan said. 'We have a programme to study the sun that is by putting a satellite into the sun-Earth Lagrangian point,' he said, referring to the position where the satellite, held by the pair's gravitational pull, can orbit with them. India has come a long way since it began its space programme half a century ago when it set up the first rocket launch pad in a field in the southern state of Kerala. A church in a fishing village was the agency's main office. The chairman said the agency was reaping the benefits of years of hard work, after sticking to its 'mantra of self reliance' rather than relying on other countries for assistance. Western sanctions were slapped on India after it staged a nuclear weapons test in 1974. ISRO also remained committed to its national mandate of benefitting the 'common man' - for example by launching Indian satellites that help with weather projections and disaster management - in a country with tens of millions of poor. 'Twenty-two years we worked on it (a launch vehicle for satellites and other craft) and we got it. We adapted and we improved,' said Mr Radhakrishnan. 'It was not a soft route, it was the hard route.' The GSLV Mark-III rocket shoots skyward past a flock of geese, from the east coast island of Sriharikota .

"Come rain, shine or snow, a military enthusiast has found a way of making sure his children always get to school on time - by dropping them off in his 17 tonne tank. Nick Mead, owner of Tanks A Lot Ltd driving events company, regularly drives around his sons Ashley, 13, and Danny, 16, in one of his impressive fleet of more than 120 military vehicles, worth £2million. The 53-year-old from Helmdon Northamptonshire, said people often did a double take when they saw him driving one of his road legal tanks, many of which weigh more than 17 tonnes, around town at speeds of up to 40mph. Scroll down for video . Nick Mead (right) always makes sure his sons Danny, 16, (left) and Ashley, 13, (centre) get to school on time, by dropping them off in his 17 tonne tank . The  surprisingly spacious tank, which comes equipped with its own guns, is part of Nick's  fleet of more than 120 vehicles . The 53-year-old said he often saw people do a double take when they saw him approaching in the armoured vehicle which is road legal . 'People often do a double take. They can’t believe it, and when they see the tax disc which verifies it’s road legal, they’re even more gobsmacked,' he said. 'My children love it, the tanks are a bit of a tourist attraction, but I can imagine they're probably even a bit bored of it now, it's just the norm for them.' 'Their friends can't get enough of it though; I just think all the attention is funny.' When taking his sons for a spin to school, the dad-of-two will often drive his 17 tonne FV432 armoured personnel carrier - which  MOT exempt - instead of a car, teasing police and stunning follow motorists by revving its eight litre, two stroke engine and intimidating passers-by with its sheer enormity. Danny and Ashley's school friends were blown away by the family's unusual mode of transport to the school gates . Nick said his children love the tanks but admitted they might even be a little bored by the vehicles which the boys simply considered 'the norm' Both of his sons have been driving tanks themselves since the age of eight at the family's private farm . The 17 tonne FV432 armoured personnel carrier (pictured) has an eight litre, two stroke engine and is MOT exempt . Everyone is desperate for a ride in the tanks which make up his fleet of more than 120 military vehicles, especially his sons, who have both been driving tanks on his private farm since they were eight. Tanks are able to be declared road legal once owners de-activate any weapons and fit road-ready rubber tracks. If the armoured personnel carrier is over 25 years old it does not require an MOT. Dependent on size, weight and intended usage, vehicles can also be road tax exempt. A special H driving licence is then required to drive on British roads. Nick said: 'When we drive through town, everyone waves as if their hands are going to drop off. 'The police often grin or look the other way and most of them don't know what to do, it's not every day you see a tank rolling into town. 'All the children love to take pictures. It's sometimes difficult when I drive it down hills, we'd had some close calls, and I took the fuel cap off a bus once when it got too close. 'But in my 20 years driving tanks I've never had one crash, I'm always extremely careful, especially with the kids.' Tank collector Nick bought his first armoured vehicle, a FV433 Abbot for £1750, more than 20 years ago. Since then, he has amassed a fleet of more than 95 operational tanks - the most valuable being a 1948 Centurion worth an estimate £50,000 - which he uses on his off road military fun park at Spring Farm, Helmdon. The armoured vehicles have been used for weddings, funerals, in films, stag and hen parties. Most recently, one full size army tank was driven down Oxford Street as part of the DVD and Blu-ray release of The Expendables 3. But for Nick, running his children to school, or even taking a trip to the shops in an armoured vehicle has become the norm. The military enthusiast admitted he had the occasional close call when driving the tanks but said in 20 years, he had never had one crash . One of those 'close calls' came after he accidentally took the fuel cap off a bus while driving when it got too close but he said he was always extremely careful .

'My partner even instructs sometimes, but I think she likes the more glamorous jobs, such as the film shoots and corporate events. 'But despite what people think, I'm not from a military background; my interest in tanks was a spur of the moment fascination. 'I bought my first tank 20 years ago and it just snowballed from there.

"A family is in hiding after the wrong magistrate was accused of being responsible for the release on bail of deranged terrorist Man Haron Monis. Police have been regularly monitoring the family home of Darryl Pearce after he was incorrectly singled out as the presiding court official who released Monis, despite the 50-year-old facing more than 40 offences. 'They are very overwhelmed by it all,' a family friend told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video .

Amirah Droudis, girlfriend of dead Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, pictured arriving at police station in Western Sydney after the fatal shootout . The self-proclaimed sheik, Man Haron Monis, was on bail facing charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, when he stormed the central Sydney cafe on Monday and held 17 people hostage. Monis and two of his hostages died at the end of the near 17-hour siege. But a mix-up over whether the magistrate's name was Pierce or Pearce has caused heartache for the latter. Mr Pearce's family have been the subject of tirades of abuse, and even death threats, after it was claimed, incorrectly, that he had made the bail decision. 'I guess is a natural reaction by some members of the public who feel obliged to stick their head up and make an issue of it but sometimes they do too much,' the Daily Mail was told. The woman wouldn't elaborate on the level of threats but confirmed there had been serious warnings levelled at the Pearce family and police were at the premises. 'They're worried about the unknown, the fact that it has gone way too far and they were wrongly singled out especially by those who are just ranting about the issue and using the wrong name. 'They just want to keep their heads down and are very guarded about who they speak to now.' The Department of Justice refused to confirm that Mr Pearce and his family were under police protection, a spokesman telling Daily Mail Australia that they would not be drawn on the matter. 'We will not be making comment about any apparent threats against the judiciary and cannot reveal any security arrangements,' he said. First it was floral tributes now Sydney has taken to placing chalk messages to the victims of the Martin Place siege . 'RIP Katrina & Tori'. A message aimed at the two hostages killed by Monis in the Lindt cafe . Monis, whose real name is recorded as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year. He was placed on a good behaviour bond in 2013 when he wrote a series of offensive letters to families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. But within a year he had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's murder and more than 40 sex offences against several women. Ms Pal, 30, was stabbed to death and set alight in April 2013 in a Werrington unit block in western Sydney. Monis' then partner, Amirah Droudis, 34, has been charged with her murder. He had been released on bail in December last year on the accessory charge under the old bail laws. It has since been reported that Magistrate William Pierce said that the crown, in fact, had a weak case against Monis and that the pair did not represent a threat to the public. 'If there is a threat, it was to this woman who was murdered,' Pierce was reporting as saying. However, he reappeared in court on May 26, only days after new bail laws came into effect, and again in October over new sexual assault offences. He was deemed then to pose an 'unacceptable risk to interfering with witnesses and endangering the safety of victims and individuals in the community'. But the 50-year-old committed sexual offences against women in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September 2014. The assaults committed in his registered business called Spiritual Consultation included sexual intercourse without consent and rubbing of genitalia during sessions in which he apparently acted as a 'spiritual healer'. Further court documents show he threatened to shoot the mother of his two sons at Minchinbrook  in western Sydney, almost two years before Noleen Hayson Pal was murdered. Flowers are left as a sign of respect at Martin Place in Sydney. Lone gunman Man Haron Monis, was shot dead by police in the early hours of Tuesday morning after taking hostages at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe Two other people died, 33-year-old cafe manager Tori Johnson and 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson. According to an interview at St Mary's Police Station on July 27, 2011, Monis threatened Ms Pal after they had split up and demanded custody of their children, then aged seven and three. Ms Pal, who told police she was afraid of Monis, had met him at a local fast food outlet a week earlier to discuss custody. Police say Monis told her 'if I can't see the kids more than I am now, you're going to pay, even I I have to shoot you'. Court documents from 2011, when he was charged with stalking and intimidating his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, reveal he had a firearm licence while working as a security officer, but it had expired. The file also shows that he allegedly threatened to shoot his former partner if his demands were not met. But the 2011 charges against Monis of stalking or intimidating his wife were dropped. He told police he was just 'a protective father' and wanted full custody of his sons because he feared they were being maltreated. Asked about the threat to shoot Ms Pal he said 'I didn't threaten her'. Monis told investigating officers that he was a former 'security offficer in Australia' and that he had previously held a forearm licence and gone target shooting. Members of the Muslim community have flocked to the makeshift shrine in Martin Place to pay their respects . Faiths of all varieties have been present at the Martin Place shrine in the hours after the deadly shootout . There have been tears and tributes as Sydneysiders struggle to come to grips with the tragedy which took place at the cafe on Tuesday morning . But Ms Pal, who became Monis' de-facto wife some nine years before she was murdered, died in a brutal killing on the afternoon of Sunday, April 21. Lured to his Werrington flat, she was set upon, stabbed 18 times and then doused with an accelerant and set alight. Neighbours in the block reported seeing a woman in a black cape run from the flat. It was not until seven months later, in October 2013, that police arrested and charged Monis' girlfriend, Amirah Droudis with murder and charged him with being an accessory to murder before and after the fact. Flowers are placed on top of barriers outside the Lindt cafe where a crazed gunman held 17 people hostage, killing two and wounding several others . Police opposed bail, and he was put in custody where he complained that he'd been 'tortued' and had 'excrement' thrown on him. But last December he was released on bail. In April this year, he was charged with sexual assault, and was granted bail. However, a further 40 sexual assault charges were laid against Monis on October 10, but he was still allowed to walk free. His bail conditions included not going within 500 metres of an airport, not approaching witnesses or victims, reporting every day to Campsie Police Station and surrendering his passport.

"New York's famous bronze bull is a mascot for Wall Street, but when it was dropped off by a guerrilla artist in the middle of the night 25 years ago, it was not quite so popular with traders. The Charging Bull was created by Sicilian immigrant Arturo Di Modica. He wanted his work to be a symbol of strength and hope after the 1987 stock market collapse. Icon: New York's famous bronze bull (pictured) is a mascot for Wall Street, but when it was dropped off by a guerrilla artist in the middle of the night 25 years ago, it was not quite so popular with traders . Outrage: When the bull was removed, the next morning's New York Post, displayed a photo of it being carted away, reading: 'Bah, Humbug!' 'N.Y. Stock Exchange grinches can't bear Christmas-gift bull' Idea: Artist Arturo Di Modica (pictured) stands in front of the Exchange this week. He wanted the bull to be a symbol of strength and hope after the 1987 stock market collapse . He spent $350,000 of his own money to create the three and a half ton beast in his Soho studio - it was designed to be a Christmas gift to the city. After two years of work the casting was final and the final pieces were welded together - the slick, powerful-looking bull measured 18 feet long. At 1 a.m. on Dec. 15, 1989, Di Modica, with the help of 30 friends and a rented crane, lifted his majestic artwork onto a flatbed truck, drove it to the financial district in Lower Manhattan and dropped it off. He had cased the area the day before, selecting a prime site on the sidewalk in front of the New York Stock Exchange and meticulously timing the police officers' patrols to every eight minutes. New additioon: Amazed workers saw the bull as they arrived at the offices in 1989 and a crowd built up as seen in this photo . 'It took us five minutes to drop it off and get out of there,' Di Modica recalled. He was so excited by his present that he stayed behind and watched as amazed workers discovered the massive crouching bull with big horns and flaring nostrils. 'It was love right away,' Di Modica, now 73, told MarketWatch. 'They wanted to touch it, embrace it - it was beautiful. I stood there watching until about noon, when I took a break and went to lunch.' But officials were not happy and they called police who either unwilling or unable to move it. They were so desperate to remove it, that the exchange hired private contractors to pick it up and the statute was transferred to Queens. Protected: During Occupy Wall Street protests police put barricades around the famous bull statue in 2011 (pictured) Worldwide: The bull has gone global and replicas (left and right) have been made for several countries across the world including China . But the bull's mysterious arrival had already made headlines across America and indeed the world. The next morning's New York Post, displayed a photo of the bull being carted away, reading: 'Bah, Humbug!' 'N.Y. Stock Exchange grinches can't bear Christmas-gift bull.' Di Modica could not bear the idea of his bull living its life out in the Queens and was determined to bring it back to Manhattan. Di Modica says he spoke to the Richard Grasso, then president and chief operating officer at the NYSE,  who said the bull could return only if it a bear was made to sit alongside it. 'He wanted me to make a bear, too,' the artist said. Lucky bull? How the S&P fared under the watchful guide of the Wall Street bull . 'I told him I was not going to do that - the bear means the market goes down, but I wanted to represent the city getting bigger, stronger, faster.' Di Modica paid for the bull to be brought back to Manhattan. His website states: 'Thanks to then Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, Mayor Ed Koch and Arturo Piccolo of the Bowling Green Association, a permanent home was found for the Charging Bull close by at Bowling Green. 'The Charging Bull stands there to this day, visited by millions of tourists, a talisman for Wall Street traders, and a source of pride for all New York City residents.' It now attracts tourists posing for photographs and investors superstitiously rubbing its horns for good luck. The bull is now seen a symbolic for New Yorkers - it was even temporarily barricaded to protect it from Occupy Wall Street in 2011. Di Modica told MarketWatch that when the market is down, people ask him why it is not working. 'I tell them he's resting, he's tired, but he'll get back to it soon,' he said.","Artist Arturo Di Modica created Charging Bull as a symbol of strength and hope after the 1987 stock market collapse .

Robert Cheek, 38, allegedly threatened to strip Brandon Morris, 18,  of his clothes, burn his belongings and baptize him in Satan's blood . He said Cheek pistol-whipped him as he told him that he belonged to the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist group, and mentioned recruiting Morris. 'He told me he was going to baptize me in the blood of Satan,' Morris told Fox News. 'He was telling me how he knew of this clean body of water, he was gonna take me there and baptize me and burn all of my belongings and leave me in my underwear to walk away. 'And that's actually the only way I would live... if he baptized me.' The pair then drove to a garage, where they are both seen on a surveillance tape, which has not been released. But Morris (center pictured with his wife and brother) is now worried for his life and his family as Cheek told his driver's license and his social security card so knows where he lives . According to the police report, Cheek then demanded to drive the Volvo, and when he got out of the car, Morris tried to flee by driving off following the hour-long ordeal. But Cheek held on to the luggage hooks on the top of the car and started kicking the windscreen, leading Morris to crash the car. Cheek fled and was arrested December 11 after a deputy recognized him. He was being bonded of out jail on Saturday. But Morris is now worried for his life as Cheek told his driver's license and his social security card so knows where he lives. The family are so fearful of reprisals that they are moving home.

"Inspired by the death of her only son, a former medical secretary spent countless painstaking hours and thousands of dollars to recreate Princess Diana's iconic wedding dress. Julie Oliver, 49, from Port Macquarie in northern New South Wales, was inspired to drop her career and take up a four-year course in fashion design after her disabled son Haydon died in 2010 at the age of 16. 'He had an epileptic seizure and a heart attack and I thought life was too short and I wanted to do something I'd always wanted to do – I realised that there was so much more to life,' Ms Oliver told Daily Mail Australia. Stunning: Princess Diana in her famous wedding dress in 1981. The dress  featured thousands of pearls, silken layers and a 25-foot train . Julie Oliver, 49, spent more than two months sewing a replica of Princess Diana's wedding dress . The final product (pictured on model Alison) has more than 13 metres of ivory taffeta, at least 16 metres of tulle, over eight metres of English bridal net, thousands of metres of lace and hundreds of beads . Princess Diana's original 1981 wedding dress was  created by British designers Elizabeth and David Emanuel . Her life dream, to recreate the much loved Princess Diana's 1981 wedding dress, meant sewing more than 13 metres of ivory taffeta, at least 16 metres of tulle, over eight metres of English bridal net, thousands of metres of lace and hundreds of beads into a replica dress. The result is a flamboyant and elegant dress which looks almost entirely identical to the one created by British designers Elizabeth and David Emanuel for Princess Diana. Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, inherited their mother's lace and ivory silk wedding dress earlier this year. The recreation did not come without painstaking effort and some heartrending moments for the mother-of-two. Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, inherited their mother's lace and ivory silk wedding dress earlier this year . 'You just couldn't get the lace the right colour..so I had to dye them with a coffee bag,' Ms Oliver said . Ms Oliver, whose love for the royals was encouraged by her parents, described how she worked on sections of the dress alongside her mother . Ms Oliver, whose love for the royals was encouraged by her parents, described how she lost her mother and father in October this year. The former medical secretary was inspired to drop her career and take up a course in fashion design after her disabled 16-year-old son Haydon died in 2010 . 'My mother was a dress maker, she taught me to do embroidery when I was young whilst sitting by the fire; my mother made all our clothes when we were growing up,' Ms Oliver said. 'She got cancer and we didn't even realise she had it and we went to say goodbye to her at the hospital and that night my dad died because he didn't want to live without her. 'I'd been sewing the bodice panel with her – she didn't get too see it finished.' She said that her parents had first met on a train coming back from Melbourne where the queen had been visiting. Seeing Duchess Kate Middleton's wedding dress in 2011 prompted her mother to reminisce about seeing Diana’s magical wedding at the age of 16. The mother-of-two now remains undecided as to what she'll do with the recreated dress, admitting that the 'labour of love' holds great sentimental value for her. She described how she spent endless hours in the first half of the year simply studying photos from the world exhibition of the dress, as well as the book released by the designers. 'I spent an awful lot of hours sewing well into the night, hundreds of hours hand sewing the beads on and I still think ""I could put a few more on her""',' Ms Oliver said. 'My mother was a dress maker, she taught me to do embroidery when I was young whilst sitting by the fire,' Ms Oliver said of her mother Lorna, pictured with her husband Glen . She described some of the challenges she faced when making the dress. 'You just couldn't get the lace the right colour either, so I had to die them with a coffee bag – I would hold it in the water for just the right amount of time until I got what I wanted'. 'The bodice and the sleeves: I'm really happy with how they turned out. I'm always going to see that's it's not the same, but it does look very close. 'The fullness of the dress: Princess Diana had about 100 metres of tulle (the net that you pump out around the petticoat) – that's almost impossible to recreate and I gather it's impossible to even walk in. Ms Oliver described how she spent endless hours in the first half of the year just studying photos of the wedding dress, as well as the book released by the designers . Ms Oliver is hoping to turn her hobby into a career and and says she is considering making a replica of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress next . 'I used 16 metres of tulle that I ruffled and gathered and I couldn't get it to puff out as much. In the end I had to use a hoop petticoat because I couldn't seem to get it big enough.

"Russia's ambassador to Denmark  Mikhail Vanin made the controversial remarks . Swedish authorities have been smoking too much cannabis – that's according to Russia's ambassador to Denmark, who was trying to make light of their concerns over a Russian military jet's alleged near-miss with a passenger plane. Mikhail Vanin, Russia's ambassador in Copenhagen, told Berlingske daily: 'The Swedish authorities also recently said there was a submarine in their waters. There wasn't. 'Now they say again that they have seen something. I'm afraid the Swedes visit Pusher Street very often,' he said, referring to the Christiania neighbourhood in Copenhagen known for its cannabis trade. Swedish military said that a Russian military jet on Friday nearly collided with a commercial passenger plane south of the Swedish city of Malmoe, shortly after taking off from Copenhagen International Airport. Swedish and Danish fighter jets were scrambled in response to the Russian plane, which came dangerously close to the passenger jet at less than nine kilometres (six miles), according to the Swedish military. Russia replied that their plane was 'more than 70 kilometres' (43 miles) away. The incident happened amid growing concern in the Baltic region over signs of more assertive Russian behaviour, including Russian planes regularly skirting or violating the air space of neighbouring countries. For the second time this year, a Russian military aircraft turned off its transponders to avoid commercial radar and nearly collided with a passenger jet over Sweden, officials have revealed; pictured above is a Russian fighter jet which was spotted off the coast of Norway in 2007 . Sweden and Denmark summoned Russia's ambassadors on Monday to protest the incident. The Russian ambassador admitted Russian planes were patrolling the area more frequently than they used to, but said that was probably 'a response to NATO's activities and escalation in the region.' 'I'm sure that if NATO reduces its activities in the region, we will do the same. Do not provoke the Russian bear,' Vanin said. Sweden's claims were part of 'a very well-orchestrated campaign' to portray Russia as 'a very dangerous neighbour', he said. 'But it's a very dangerous path that Swedish and some Danish campaigners have embarked on,' he added. Sweden, which is not a member of NATO, has said there is evidence that a mini submarine entered its waters in October, but that it hasn't been possible to confirm the vessel's nationality. In September, Stockholm lodged a protest with Moscow after the incursion of two Russian fighter planes into the Nordic country's airspace. Following the incident on Friday Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told a local radio station: 'This is serious. This is inappropriate. This is outright dangerous when you turn off the transponder.' In October RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Some 26 intercepts were made in around 24 hours . Officials at Russia's Ministry of Defense in Moscow were not immediately available to comment. Sweden's air force chief, Major General Micael Byden, said the incident in international air space looked 'pretty serious,' adding the southern-bound commercial flight was immediately ordered to change course. Swedish fighter jets were sent up to identify the aircraft, and later confirmed it as a Russian intelligence plane. Media in Sweden and Denmark said the commercial plane was en route to Poland, but the carrier and the number of passengers it has on board has not been reported. Byden said this was not as serious as in March when a Russian plane flying without transponders came within 300 feet of an SAS plane that had taken off from Copenhagen. In recent months, Russia has increased its military presence in the Baltic Sea area, prompting some Swedish officials to compare it to the Cold War . In October, non-NATO Sweden launched its first submarine hunt since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Swedish authorities said a small, foreign submarine had entered its waters illegally but never found it and didn't disclose its nationality .

"It was the awkward moment which left Prime Minister Tony Abbott a little red-faced after calling Sunrise host David 'Kochie' Koch the wrong name on two occasions during an interview last week. But this morning Kochie revealed on Channel Seven's breakfast program that Mr Abbott recently approached him and apologised for the error, confessing he was 'a bit hungover' from a staff Christmas party. During the interview on December 8, Kochie grilled Mr Abbott on live television over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan. But just like his interview with Karl Stefanovic on rival program Today two weeks ago, the dialogue with Kochie didn't go so well. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on December 8 to face questions over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan . 'I saw him the other night and he came up and he goes ""g'day Chris"" and then apologised,' Kochie said on Thursday morning. 'He said ""I was a bit hung over because we had our staff Christmas party"".' The interview last week started with Kochie quoting the new opinion poll results and saying Mr Abbott was 'now as unpopular as Julia Gillard at her lowest'. 'Well Chris, sorry David... We're not the first government that's had a rough patch in the polls. We're getting on with delivering for the Australian people,' Mr Abbott said. As the Prime Minister listed promises and policies the Liberal government had delivered on in its first year, Kochie interrupted and told him people were actually focusing on the promises he had broken. 'The public feels like you have lied to them consistently over your first term,' Kochie told the PM.

'They didn't think they'd get a $7 co-payment or have to pay university fees… all things that you've broken since then. 'Do you need to apologise to the public and say ""Yeah I've let you down, I did lie to you, I did break a lot of promises but hey I'm going to rebuild from here?"".'

'Well Chris, Kochie, I do not accept the accusations that you’re making. I just don’t accept them,' he said shaking his head. 'I think there are a lot of things that people have said and frankly a lot of these so called commitments were commitments other people had attributed to us post the election.' Sunrise host Kochie repeatedly asked Mr Abbott is he was going to apologise to the public over his broken election promises . Mr Abbott had a radio interview with the ABC's Chris Uhlmann prior to Sunrise, which may explain the slip-up. In last week's interview on Channel Nine, Mr Abbott took aim at the Labor party saying they were trying to sabotage the government's budget and he wished they weren't 'in such a feral mood'. Karl Stefanovic hit back by saying he was exactly the same in Opposition. 'With respect you were fairly feral in Opposition weren't you, I mean the greatest respect by that, and ... why would (Bill Shorten) do anything different when it worked for you?' Stefanovic asked. 'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse. 'No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.'

"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says Arsene Wenger should not be used as a scapegoat for Arsenal's disappointing season so far, insisting the players are to blame. The 21-year-old starred in his side's 4-1 win against Newcastle last Saturday, easing the pressure on Wenger  after the Frenchman was abused by some of his own supporters after the 3-2 defeat at Stoke the week previous. While Oxlade-Chamberlain understands the fans' frustrations over Arsenal's indifferent form, he feels the criticism aimed at Wenger is unwarranted. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) has backed under-fire Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . He told the Evening Standard: 'It's a hard one for me to say what I would say to the fans. 'I understand their frustration. I would definitely say that and they are completely entitled to their own opinion. They pay good money to follow us around and support their club. 'I am sure they have supported us for a number of years so they are definitely entitled to their opinion and I can understand their frustration. But I wouldn't put that on the manager. We have to stand up ourselves as players. 'On that day [at Stoke], it wasn't the manager's fault we went 3-0 down like we did in the first half. It was us as a group of players — we were not at the required level. 'On that day, it would have been harsh for a fan to completely blame our manager. As players, we are adults and we need to stand up and take some of that blame ourselves.'

"Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's cancerous tumor has shrunk in half thanks to chemotherapy treatments, his brother revealed Tuesday. Doug Ford said the malignant growth in his abdomen — which doctors had initially said was 4.7 inches by 4.7 inches in size — is now down to 2.4 inches by 2.4 inches. Mr Ford says his ex-mayor brother will be finishing a fifth round of chemotherapy soon and will also get radiation treatment. Good news: Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's cancerous tumor has shrunk in half thanks to chemotherapy treatments. Pictured here is Ford speaking to Deputy Mayor Denzil Mennan-Wong at a council meeting earlier this month . All smiles: Dough Ford said if all goes according to plan, doctors will be able to remove his brother's tumor in the fall . Speaking to reporters at Mount Sinai Hospital, Doug Ford said that his brother will be home for Christmas next week after wrapping up Round 5 of chemotherapy. He will have 18 days off and then undergo radiation treatment for 25 consecutive days, reported the Toronto Star. 'Rob was signing Christmas cards, he was ecstatic,' Doug Ford said. 'He knows he is in a battle for his life.' If his condition continues to improve, doctors will perform surgery to remove the tumor from Rob Ford's abdomen in the fall of 2015. Doug Ford said: ‘It’s the first positive news we’ve received since Rob’s down there. It’s still a long, long journey but, when you don’t hear positive news for a long time, you grab anything you can. We want to thank everyone for their prayers and wishes.’ Last week, the cancer-stricken former mayor said he was gearing up for the mayoral race in 2018, but the following day he appeared at a City Council meeting looking ill and told colleagues he was feeling 'rough.' Ford was diagnosed with a rare form of abdominal cancer called liposarcoma in September and dropped his bid for mayoral re-election shortly afterward. Instead, he ran for a seat on the city council and won. In late November, Rob Ford said his tumor had not shrunk, but had not gotten larger either. Fighting for his life: In late November, Rob Ford said his tumor had not shrunk, but had not gotten larger either . Notorious: Rob Ford's term as mayor was plagued by scandals involving public drinking and crack cocaine use . While the family is happy to now be getting more positive news, Doug Ford said it's too early to celebrate because his brother still has a long journey ahead of him, calling it an 'emotional roller-coaster.' 'He's doing well,' Doug Ford said, adding: 'I'm all smiles.' Rob Ford's term as mayor was plagued by scandals involving public drinking and crack cocaine use. After months of denials, Ford in 2013 acknowledged he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his 'drunken stupors,' but he refused to resign. The City Council stripped Ford of most of his mayoral powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime. Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the US. Last March, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after months of wooing by the talk-show host, who introduced his guest by saying he 'has tripped, bumped, danced, argued and smoked his way into our national consciousness.'

"In the biggest criminal case ever brought in the U.S. over contaminated medicine, 14 former owners or employees of a Massachusetts pharmacy were arrested and expected to be charged Wednesday in connection with a 2012 meningitis outbreak that killed 64 people. The nationwide outbreak - which also sickened over 750 -was traced to tainted drug injections manufactured by the now-closed New England Compounding Pharmacy in Framingham. The facility produced infected steroids, feds say, that were used for medical purposes, mostly as injections for back pain. Barry Cadden, a co-founder of the business, and Glenn Adam Chin, a pharmacist who was in charge of the sterile room, were hit with the most serious charges, accused in a federal racketeering indictment of causing the deaths of 25 patients in seven states by 'acting in wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood' of death or great bodily harm. Scroll down for video . Serious indictiment: New England Compounding Center President Barry Cadden (left) and pharmacist Glenn Adam Chin (right) were among 14 people from the Framingham, Massachusetts, pharmaceutical  company arrested at their homes on Wednesday . Arrested: Carla Conigliaro (left), majority shareholder of New England Compounding Center, and her brother Douglas Conigliaro, owner and president of Medical Sales Management, were arrested in Deadham . Among other things, Cadden, Chin and others are accused of using expired ingredients, failing to properly sterilize drugs and failing to test them to make sure they were pure. The other defendants were charged with such crimes as fraud and interstate sale of adulterated drugs. U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said NECC was 'filthy' and failed to comply with even basic health standards, and employees knew it. For example, she said, they falsified logs on when labs were cleaned. 'Production and profit were prioritized over safety,' Ortiz said. More than 750 people in 20 states were sickened — about half of them with a rare fungal form of meningitis, the rest with joint or spinal infections — and 64 died. The steroids given were for medical purposes, not for bodybuilding; most patients received the injections for back pain. In reaction to the outbreak, Congress last year increased federal oversight of so-called compounding pharmacies like NECC, which custom-mix medications in bulk and supply them directly to hospitals and doctors. Scene: Federal prosecutors say the New England Compounding in Framingham (pictured) manufactured tainted steroids that lead to a fungal meningitis outbreak that killed 64 people across the country . Linda Nedroscik of Howell, Michigan, said her husband, John, survived the tainted injection. But she said the 64-year-old 'still struggles, has nightmares.' 'It's hard to say it's a relief because it doesn't change anything for us in our physical lives,' she said of the indictment, 'but it takes a burden off emotionally.' Chin's lawyer, Stephen Weymouth, said he was stunned that prosecutors charged his client with second-degree murder under the racketeering law. 'He feels hugely remorseful for everything that's happened — for the injuries and the deaths — but he never intended to cause harm to anybody,' Weymouth said. 'It seems to be a bit of an overreach.' Messages were left for lawyers for 11 other defendants. Scathing: U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz told a press conference Wednesday that New England Compounding Pharmacy's high-ranking officials and pharmacists knew batches of injectable steroids were tainted with fungus but shipped the drugs anyway and faked inspection logs to cover it up . Charges will be laid: U.S. Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery speaks as federal officials announce the indictment of the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Boston, Massachusetts, on Wednesday . Lawyers for two defendants could not immediately be located. After the outbreak came to light, regulators found a host of potential contaminants at the pharmacy, including standing water, mold and dirty equipment. The business filed for bankruptcy after it was bombarded with hundreds of lawsuits from victims or their. The owners then established a $100 million fun for victims of the outbreak in 2013, according to CNN. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Delery said the defendants showed 'not only a reckless disregard for federal health and safety regulations, but also an extreme and appalling disregard for human life.' 'Every patient should have the peace of mind knowing that their medications are safe,' he said. Stand back: A Food and Drug Administration Agent stands at the doorway of New England Compounding Center in Framingham in October, 2012, following the meningitis outbreak . Bacteria: Meningitis is a potentially deadly inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord . Gregory Conigliaro, another co-founder, was among 12 of the 14 arrested at their homes around the state. Chin had been charged with mail fraud in September. All those charged were expected to make an initial court appearance later Wednesday. NECC was founded in 1998 by brothers-in-law Cadden and Conigliaro. Cadden earned a pharmacy degree from the University of Rhode Island. Conigliaro is an engineer. According to The Boston Herald, patients who were given NECC’s injectable methylprednisolone acetate began dying in September 2012. Deaths were reported across the country. Among the total were eight in Michigan, seven in Tennessee, three in Maryland, two in Virginia and one in Florida. The other defendants named in the inidictment are NECC Director of Operations Sharon P. Carter of Hopkinton, NECC National Sales Director Robert A. Ronzio of North Providence, R.I., and Alla V. Stepanets of Framingham, Kathy S. Chin of Canton and Michelle L. Thomas of Framingham, Gene Svirskiy of Ashland, Christopher M. Leary of Marlboro, Joseph M. Evanosky of Haverhill, and Scott M. Connolly of Brockton. Some were expected to appear in court later on Wednesday.","14 employees of New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts were arrested at their homes on Wednesday .

"Sales of red lipstick are rising as women treat themselves to inexpensive indulgences.

At least one beauty firm has sold 31,000 red lipsticks in a month - twice the monthly average of sales. And overall UK lipstick sales have increased eight per cent – from £126m million in 2012 to a predicted £137million this year, according to the Mintel Colour Cosmetics UK 2014.

Giorgio Armani Beauty has sold 31,000 red lipsticks in the UK this month so far – twice the monthly average. But the beauty firm’s research at 21 of its make-up counters in the country, found many women were still scared of wearing the colour. The survey of 1,000 women revealed someone thought red lipstick did not suit them, while many would not consider wearing the colour due to a lack of confidence. But Giorgio Armani Beauty’s national face designer Vanessa D’ Ambrosio said: ‘Red suits all complexions. It’s the ultimate symbol of feminine glamour, power and ability, this is why it has never, and will never fall from fashion. ‘Woman often shy away from drawing too much attention to their features and think they must have confidence to pull off the red lip, when in actual fact red gives you confidence.’ Overall UK lipstick sales have increased eight per cent – from £126m million in 2012 to a predicted £137million this year .","UK lipstick sales have increased by eight per cent this year to £137million .

"A court has heard Rina Khan lost her temper and called the pupil a 'muppet' after he got a question wrong and hit him over the head with a ruler . A primary school teacher hit a boy of six over the head with a ruler so hard it snapped in half, a court heard yesterday. Rina Khan, 41, is accused of calling the child a 'muppet' and hitting him for getting a question wrong. A teaching assistant said part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20, which left the boy 'sad and scared'. Khan, a full-time teacher for two-and-a-half years who has also worked with the disabled, denies child cruelty and common assault. Prosecutor Peter Arnold said she had been teaching Year Two maths with assistant Joanna Fleary. He said: 'She was having problems with him. Khan was standing behind the youngster when he got a question wrong. The defendant was upset about that and the long and short of it is that she had a plastic ruler in her hand and she hit the boy on the top of his head and the ruler broke. 'What she did was unlawful.' When asked about the incident, the boy said that it had hurt and made him 'sad and scared'. Miss Fleary said she heard Khan, from Smethwick, West Midlands, shouting increasingly loudly. She added: 'I looked up again and a piece of ruler flew across the room.' She said she put a compress on the boy's head, and added that Khan later admitted she had not meant to hit so hard. Khan wept as she told Birmingham Crown Court she loved her pupils at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, and denied mistreating them. She said: 'The boy was being really quite disruptive with the pupils next to him. He kept poking a sharp pencil into their arms and he was really reluctant to do his own work. 'He kept doing the same thing. He poked the girl next to him in the arm with the pencil and was pulling faces at her.' Khan claimed she repeatedly told him to stop, but he persisted. 'I turned around. I had to stop him. I have a duty of care to all my pupils. I had a ruler in my hand at that time because I was drawing lines for a pupil and I turned around and simply tapped him on the head.' She said that she was 'really really shocked' that it broke. 'I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. Those rulers at the school have been known to break.' Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard the teacher denies the charges of child cruelty and assault . Khan said she asked the boy if he was hurt and he said no. 'I checked his head for any bruises or bumps. There weren't any. I offered to get medical assistance, but he was OK. 'I did not hit him. If I had hit him, the children would have been frightened. They were not.' She added: 'I did call him a muppet but [not] on that day. I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppet Show.' Tom Walkling, defending, asked the court: 'Is tapping a naughty boy on the head with a ruler really a criminal assault? Do we want to live in a world where teachers are so afraid of being prosecuted in a criminal court that they are wary of any contact with the children in their care?' The trial continues.

"A 75-year-old man was left lying on the freezing cold pavement for more than two hours waiting for an ambulance after a fall - even though passers-by had called 999 five times. The pensioner was found on the ground outside Teeside Magistrates' Court in Middlesbrough having fallen and hit his head. Passers-by found him shortly after the fall - at 7pm on Monday - and covered him with blankets in a bid to keep him warm as temperatures dipped as low as 4C. A 75-year-old man was left lying on the freezing cold pavement for more than two hours waiting for an ambulance after a fall . But an ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 9.10pm - and only turned up after the people caring for him had called 999 five times. One man, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'We got here about 7.25pm and saw the man lying on the floor. 'There were quite a few people gathered around him, so we went to get blankets and hot water bottles. We have already put in about four phone calls to the ambulance but they are still not here.' Around 7.50pm, three Middlesbrough street wardens arrived to offer their help to the man, who is believed to have been from the North Ormesby area of the town. After a fifth phone call to the emergency services an ambulance arrived at 9.10pm and the pensioner was taken straight to hospital. Ambulance bosses have apologised and said the service was experiencing 'exceptional pressure' that evening. A Met Office spokesman said temperatures that day ranged from 2C to 6C in Middlesbrough but estimated it would have been around 4C at the time of the incident. An ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 9.10pm - and only turned up after the people caring for him had called 999 five times . One street warden, who wished to remain unnamed, said: 'We got here and the man was just lying there and you could tell he was freezing. 'These three young people were already here and really it was them who did all the work. 'They are students who have just finished a 12-hour shift so they could have just walked past but they stopped to help. A spokesperson for North East Ambulance Service said: 'We would like to say sorry to the patient, and apologise for not being able to reach him sooner. 'Over the last few days ambulance services across the UK have been experiencing exceptional pressure, and this has meant that some patients have had to wait longer than normal for a crew to become available. 'There are six levels of alert for UK ambulance services and on Monday it went up to level four, which means extreme pressure. 'Nearly all of the other UK ambulance services are the same. 'We would also like to thank the three students who stayed with the patient during this time for their kindness and concern.'","Pensioner was found on ground near Magistrates' Court in Middlesbrough .

"A mother who gave birth to surprise identical quadruplets has revealed how her life has changed since she welcomed her four daughters in February. Kimberly Fugate, 43, from Jayess, Mississippi, who had been expecting triplets, was both shocked and delighted when doctors revealed mid-way through her cesarean section that she was carrying an 'extra' daughter. But the mother-of-four, who also has an 11-year-old daughter with husband Craig, revealed to Today.com that, while there have been some scary 'roller coaster' moments, the large family couldn't be happier. One in 13 million: The chance of having identical quadruplets is 'almost incalculable' according to experts . Surprise! Kimberly Fugate had been expecting triplets, but was stunned and delighted when doctors revealed that she was carrying a fourth baby . 'I feel very lucky, like the luckiest mom in the whole world,' she said. 'I wasn’t planning on starting over with more children, and many things have changed since I had my quadruplets, Kenleigh, Kristen, Kayleigh and Kelsey. 'It’s a lot of work taking care of even one baby, let alone four, but I don’t mind. It’s a lot of fun, and they make it all worth it.' It wasn't just the Fugates who were left stunned by the arrival of their four beautiful babies. The likelihood of giving birth to quadruplets is one in 729,000, but the chance of having identical babies is 'almost incalculable' - around 13 million to one - and doctors at the the University of Mississippi Medical Center admitted that they had never seen anything like it before. Sadly, the drama didn't end their for the family. Happy families: Kimberly (L) and her husband Craig (R) also have an 11-year-old daughter Katelyn (C) who has welcomed her four new siblings with open arms . Medical marvels: The girls were born more than two months early and had to spend three months in intensive care before being allowed to go home . Following the surprise birth of their four daughters, the Fugates were forced to endure many more ups and downs, as the young girls were whisked straight into the neonatal intensive care unit, having been born more than two months early. 'When the babies were born more than two months early, they weighed between 2 and 2½ pounds and were critically ill,' Kimberly explained. 'They spent more than three months in the NICU, and needed to be on ventilators to help them breathe because their lungs were so small.' And while Kimberly says that the ten-month-old girls are 'doing really well', she admits that there have been 'a lot of very scary moments' during which the family weren't sure whether all four babies would survive. 'There were times when I feared for their lives,' she revealed. 'Several of the girls’ heart rates dropped, and I held my breath as I watched two be resuscitated.' 'I feared for their lives': Kimberly, 43, admitted that there were times when she wasn't sure whether all four babies would make it . 'I'm very blessed': The mother-of-five believes that God chose her to have the 'miracle' quadruplets . Thankfully, the girls were given the all clear in June and were able to leave the NICU and return home with their parents and sister. Since then, the Fugates have been happily settling into their new routine, which Kimberly admits can be incredibly stressful at times, particularly when 'they are all crying at once'. But despite the day-to-day chaos of raising four babies, as well as their older daughter Katelyn, Kimberly insists that she and husband Craig couldn't be happier. 'I believed that God picked me to have these quadruplets, and I felt that He would take care of them and allow them to survive,' she added. 'To see how far they’ve come makes me feel very blessed.'","Kimberly Fugate was expecting identical triplets and was shocked when her doctor revealed during the birth that she was carrying a fourth baby .

"Downing Street has had some cunning residents over the years, but perhaps none quite as slippery as this cheeky fox, who scampered through this morning. The creature caused quite a stir when it became trapped in the famous street ahead of a planned appearance by Prime Minister David Cameron. The Tory leader was due to leave his official home ahead of Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons at midday today. But instead of seeing the country's leader, photographers, armed police and awaiting aides watched as the fox appeared and ran around the fenced-off road looking for an exit. Police and political aides were given a surprise this morning when a fox trotted down Downing Street . The bold animal ran around in front of waiting photographers shortly before David Cameron made his way to Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons . The animal is one of hundreds of urban foxes living in the capital, which some say are becoming increasingly bold in their hunt for food. The creatures are now often seen during the daytime, even in the busiest parts of the city, with reports of them going into people's homes. This fox seemed uninterested in entering the corridors of power however, and soon disappeared into a neighbouring street. Last month, it was reported that George Osborne's cat, Freya, had been banished from his 11 Downing Street residence because it did not get on with the Chancellor's dog, Lola. In 2011, the sight of the Prime Minister's cat, Larry, became well-known in Downing Street after it was brought in to deal with a rat problem. The pet, which has its own spoof Twitter account, was later retired amid claims he wasn't catching enough vermin. A police officer guarding the Prime Minister's  central London home watched as the fox strolled past . A visitor to Downing Street is confronted by the creature, which became trapped in the gated-off road for a few minutes late this morning .

"A man who bit a dog during an altercation outside a corner shop later ran inside and died from a suspected heart attack after 'being restrained', it has emerged. The man, who is in his forties, bit the dog – believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier – during a dispute with a 45-year-old man in Cambridge. He then ran into a nearby One Stop convenience shop, reportedly in his socks, and died a short time later, after allegedly being held by four men. The man, in his forties, bit the dog - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier - during a dispute with a 45-year-old man outside a One Stop shop (pictured) in Cambridge. He later died of a suspected heart attack inside . Police and paramedics were called to the store following the incident at about 6.30am on Monday, having received reports of a man in cardiac arrest. The man, who is believed to live in the area but has not yet been formally identified, was pronounced dead a short time later. A post mortem examination to determine his cause of death proved inconclusive, police said. Further tests will now be carried out at Peterborough City Hospital, including a toxicology test. Four men, aged 40, 44, 69, and 50, from  Cambridgeshire, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following his death. They have since been released on bail until February 11. A 45-year-old man, who was allegedly involved in the original dispute outside the shop, was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm but has since been released without charge. Police said no further action would be taken. Witnesses to the incident described seeing two men 'shouting and struggling' in the street, prior to the man's death. Samantha Lander, a resident on Dudley Road, told Cambridge News that she was awoken by the sound of shouting and looked out of the window to see a struggle, which appeared to involve a dog that looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier. It is believed the man who died had run off into the shop following the dispute and was being restrained by four men in the store when he became unwell. East of England Ambulance Service confirmed a rapid response car, ambulance and an air ambulance were sent to the scene after receiving reports of a man having a cardiac arrest. A spokesman said: 'We were called at 6.51am on Monday and were on scene in seven minutes. 'Unfortunately despite the best efforts of everyone involved a male patient sadly died at the scene.' The spokesman confirmed paramedics performed CPR on the patient. Police said they received reports that the man had bit a dog outside the convenience store in Cambridge (pictured) during the dispute and later ran off into the store, where he passed away a short time later . Cambridgeshire Constabulary said the man's death was being treated as 'unexplained' but confirmed it was not deemed to be suspicious. A spokesman said: 'The death of a man on December 15 in Cambridge is being treated as unexplained by police. 'The man, who is in his 40s and from Cambridge, died after police were called to an incident at a premises in Ditton Lane at just after 6.30am. 'A post mortem has proved inconclusive and further tests will have to be carried out. 'There was an altercation outside the shop. We know this involved the man who died and a 45-year-old man.

"An entire street has missed out on Christmas cards and presents this year after Royal Mail banned all deliveries following an incident involving a postman being bitten by a dog - five months ago. Residents of Chestnut Grove, in Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire, have had to trek to a post office a mile away every day for the past five months if they wanted their post on time. But now Royal Mail have announced they will begin delivering to the street again from tomorrow. The dog believed to be the one that was involved in an altercation with a postman five months ago . Residents of Chestnut Grove, in Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire, have had to trek to a post office a mile away every day for five months after a dog bit a postman while he was making his deliveries to the street . However, outraged residents say over the last few months they have repeatedly missed out on important post. They say they don't understand how local newspaper deliveries have been able to make it  while the postman has not. Karen Rowell, 56, said she received a letter from Royal Mail on August 4 stating that deliveries were cancelled until further notice. The nursing home worker said: 'There are a lot of people on the street that can't make it to the post office every day because they work or are very elderly and they are left missing out on important letters. 'I missed an eye check-up for my Glaucoma because the appointment card didn't make it to me in time. 'When I missed picking up my post for a week, I got behind on a bill and got fined. 'It's just absolutely outrageous.' A sign on the house where the dog believed to have been in an altercation with a postman lives. It reads: 'One step more and you will feel my jaw' Residents living in the 10 homes were initially asked to make six mile round trip to Long Eaten but after protests about the elderly people on the street, post was rerouted to Sandiacre post office. Despite the apparent risk to postmen, local paper deliveries and takeaway leaflets have continued to make it through the letter boxes of all the residents. Roy Lewin, 60, said he was forced to get his post redirected to his work address so  he did not miss important letters and deliveries. He said: 'I know it all started off when a dog on the street bit a postman but as far as I'm aware it was all resolved in the courts over a month ago. 'So I don't know why we're still not getting deliveries. 'Why does it have to be the whole street anyway? Couldn't they just have missed out that house? 'The people at the post office say there is nothing they can do. 'If the meter reader, the gas man and the local paper delivery boy can make it, why can't the postman? 'It's a burden and a nuisance for everyone and it is so disappointing that nothing has been done.' Royal Mail have announced today that they will be resuming deliveries to the street from tomorrow . Another resident Brian Kirk, 81, said he is fed up of the two-mile round trip to Sandiacre Post Office to pick up his mail. He said: 'I haven't had my mail for months. I can understand why they don't deliver to the house with the dog, but why should I suffer? It's ridiculous.' Mr Kirk, who has lived on the street since 1966, said: 'I have breathing problems and need my inhalers. I only feel like I can make that trip once a week. Sometimes bills arrive late and I end up behind.' Roy Pearson, 84, also of Chestnut Grove, said he has only seen the dog allegedly involved in the incident outside twice. 'I don't fancy picking up my Christmas cards from the Post Office,' he said. 'I understand if it was just that house they were not delivering to, but there are a lot of elderly people on the street. 'It's an absolute farce.' A Royal Mail spokesman said today: 'We had to temporarily suspend mail deliveries to a number of houses on Chesnut Grove following a serious dog attack on one of our postmen, which resulted in a successful prosecution. 'We would like to apologise to affected customers and reassure them that deliveries will be reinstated tomorrow.' The postman who was bitten, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've got puncture marks on my elbow and a puncture mark on my back. 'I'm not frightened of dogs but it has changed my whole perception of them. 'For the first few weeks if there was a dog on a drive or in a house I wouldn't go in.' The dog owner's son, Michael Bandari, 28, apologised and said that the dog had never caused any problems before. He said: 'The dog has been living there for eight years and had never attacked anyone before. 'To my neighbours who have been affected I'm so sorry. 'I didn't realise what was happening with the post, so I do apologise for the inconvenience.'","Houses on a road in Sandiacre haven't received post in five months .

"Norman Bridwell, a soft-spoken illustrator whose impromptu story about a girl and her puppy marked the unlikely birth of the supersized franchise Clifford the Big Red Dog, has died at 86. Bridwell, who lived for decades in a house with a bright red door on Martha's Vineyard off Cape Cod in Massachusetts, died on Friday at Martha's Vineyard Hospital, where he had been for about three weeks after a fall at home in Edgartown, his wife, Norma, said. He suffered from several ailments, including a recurrence of prostate cancer, she said. He passed peacefully with family members at his bedside, she said. Dead at 86: Illustrator Norman Bridwell, creator of 'Clifford the Big Red Dog,'pictured here with a pair of stuffed Cliffords at his home in Massachusetts in 1997, died of prostate cancer . Starting in 1963 with 'Clifford, the Big Red Dog,' Bridwell wrote and illustrated more than 40 Clifford books, from 'Clifford and the Grouchy Neighbors' to 'Clifford Goes to Hollywood.' More than 120 million copies have sold worldwide, along with cartoons, a feature film, a musical, stuffed animals, key chains, posters and stickers. Images of Clifford have appeared everywhere from museums to the White House. 'A lot of people were Clifford fans and that makes them Norman fans, too,'said his wife of 56 years. Clifford became standard nighttime reading for countless families and a money machine for publisher Scholastic Inc. Spinoffs include cartoons with John Ritter as the voice of Clifford and future 'Hunger Games' novelist Suzanne Collins among the script writers. Scholastic, which became a top children's publisher thanks in part to Clifford, installed bright red cushions on the chairs in the corporate headquarters' auditorium in New York. Scholastic had been in business for decades before Clifford, but the series' success inspired the publisher to look for other stories with brand appeal, including 'Goosebumps,' 'The Magic School Bus' and 'I Spy.' Bridwell had completed two more Clifford books to be released next year, Scholastic said in a statement. Missed: Norman Ray Bridwell, who brought delight to millions of readers young and old as the author of Clifford the Big Red Dog series of books, died on Friday, December 12, at Martha's Vineyard Hospital . In his pre-Clifford life, Bridwell was a filmstrip and slide illustrator, trying to break into children's publishing to support his family. His work had been rejected all over New York when an editor at Harper & Row (now HarperCollins) suggested he try writing a story to go with a picture he had submitted of a child and her horse-sized dog. Bridwell's idea: Thanks to the girl's affection, a puppy -the runt of the litter - grows into a klutzy but good-hearted behemoth, as big as the lighthouses on the author's imaginary 'Birdwell Island.' A nearby paint container inspired Bridwell to color Clifford fire engine red. Bridwell had sketched a bloodhound because he wanted one while growing up and he named the girl Emily Elizabeth, after his daughter. He planned to call the dog 'Tiny,' but his wife, Norma, suggested 'Clifford,' the name of an imaginary friend she had as a child. Bridwell spent a weekend working up a story. Several publishers turned the book down before editor Beatrice de Regniers of Scholastic's 'Lucky Book Club"" saw Clifford's potential. 'I said to my wife, ""Now don't count on there being any more. This one is just a fluke. I don't know if there will ever be another one,""' Bridwell told The Associated Press in 2012. Beloved: Illustrator Norman Bridwell, an Indiana native, Bridwell chose what became a successful career in illustrating children's books despite heart-breaking rejections from various publishing houses . Bridwell achieved mainstream success without mainstream distribution. Scholastic offered the first Clifford story through book clubs and school fairs (Clifford wasn't available in stores until the 1980s) and it sold well enough that Scholastic published a second, non-Clifford book by Bridwell, 'The Witch Next Door.' Over the years, Bridwell added such 'Clifford' sidekicks as the purple poodle Cleo, the three-legged training dog KC and Emily Elizabeth's cranky schoolmate, Jetta. Bridwell's name was a ringer for Norman Rockwell's and Birdwell's books were also a comforting portrait of stability and innocence. But he did work in social commentary, such as including children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. 'I visited a school in Washington state and some kid said, `Why do you have these black people in the book?""' Bridwell told The Associated Press in a 2011 interview. 'I said that we wanted to have a little mix of races and nationalities and not just a purely lily white town.' Sudden success: An editor at Harper & Row advised Bridwell him that he might find success by writing a story about one of his pictures and because of his young daughter, wrote about a dog . Bridwell said he came up with ideas for Clifford by watching other dogs. Clifford would often get himself in trouble, scattering garbage on the lawn or crushing a fence, then redeem himself as only a big dog could, whether saving a drowning child or gently gripping a stranded car between his teeth and carrying it to the nearest garage. Bridwell believed Clifford's imperfections were part of his appeal, making kids more forgiving of their own mistakes. While he denied that Clifford was based on himself, Norma Bridwell disagreed. 'He's never been able to recognize that,' she told the AP. 'Clifford tries to do the right thing, Norman tries to do right the thing, and he makes a mess of it. But he's the most lovable grown-up man. He's just a nice guy.' 'I'm not really all that nice,' the author responded, 'but I try to be.' Bridwell was born in Kokomo, Indiana, in 1928. He was not a star in art or writing classes, but his mechanical skills were so much worse that a high school shop teacher suggested he stick to drawing. After graduation, he attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, then moved to New York and studied at Cooper Union. Bridwell spent much of the 1950s as a commercial artist. In addition to his wife and daughter, Bridwell is survived by a son, Timothy, and three grandchildren. The family planned a private service with a public celebration of his life and work to come later, likely over the summer, his wife said.

The sea of flowers outside the Lindt Cafe continues to grow as mourners lay bunches of flowers, write tributes on the pavement and say prayers for not just mother-of-three Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson, but for all the victims of the act of terrorism carried out by Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis. Among Wednesday's crowd were hostage survivor Harriette Denny and her partner, as well as the family of Mr Johnson, 34, who died after trying to wrestle the gun off Monis.

Condolence messages are left as a sign of respect at Martin Place. This one was attached to purple flowers that read: 'With Light and Love' The mood on Wednesday was sombre amid mounting anger over the national security system's failure to flag gunman Man Haron Monis for surveillance, despite his long history of violence and mental instability. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that he has serious questions about why the 'madman' was not on any counter-terrorism watch list. 'The system did not adequately deal with this individual,' he said. 'Two very decent people are dead, others are injured, others are traumatised because of a madman who was roaming our streets.' Tori Johnson's employees left a handwritten note, a bouquet of flowers and Lindt chocolates among the thousands of tributes that have now taken over Martin Place . NSW police have urged Sydneysiders to go about their business as usual. 'We see the fear in their eyes and we want to let them know that we are out there to know they are safe,' Assistant Commissioner Mick Fuller said on Wednesday. Police have re-opened the exclusion zone in Martin Place. Mr Abbott intends to publish a report into the lead-up to Monday's siege and how and where Monis got a gun. The self-declared Muslim cleric was well known to ASIO, federal and NSW police for a string of alleged crimes and after he was convicted of sending of threats to the families of dead Australian soldiers. Thousands of people continue to flock to the area more than 24 hours later to pay tribute to the victims . The 34-year-old manager of the Lindt cafe, Tori Johnson (left), and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, 38 (right), were the two hostages killed during the Sydney siege on Tuesday morning . As recently as Sunday he railed against Australian 'terrorism' on his website, vowing to fight the 'oppression and terrorism of USA and its allies including UK and Australia'. 'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored given his history of violence, his history of mental instability and his history of infatuation with extremism,' Mr Abbott said. The prime minister's comments come as senior officials from the Australian Federal Police and ASIO appear before a national security committee in Canberra probing the government's proposed metadata retention laws. A Lindt employee pinned photos of manager Tori Johnson and his business card to the fence outside the cafe . A NSW police officer left a floral tribute (right) saying the courage of Tori and Katrina had touched the nation . Tributes have since extended beyond the makeshift shrine to the fence surrounding the crime scene at Lindt Cafe . Thousands of people have come to Martin Place to read the tributes left for the victims . One person painted a tribute on the concrete late on Tuesday night and it has since been surrounded by flowers . People of all faiths have been leaving tributes, with many saying Tori and Katrina were 'brave Australians' ASIO deputy director-general Kerri Hartland said terrorist attacks against Australia were 'not hypothetical'. 'Australia is a terrorist target and recent events have once again demonstrated that Australia is not immune from acts of terror,' she said. Meanwhile, former prime minister John Howard and his wife Janette joined the stream of Sydneysiders continuing to pay their respects to the dead hostages at a makeshift floral shrine in Martin Place. A single bunch of white roses left resting on a pole when the siege ended at 2.15am on Tuesday has sparked the beginning of a makeshift shrine that has now grown to take over a large portion of Martin Place . The makeshift shrine at Martin Place started with just a few bunches of flowers before people from all over started flocking to the area . Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were both killed after being held hostage for more than 16 hours . As Australia mourned the dead, thousands of people gathered at Martin Place to lay flowers . Hundreds of people were laying tributes on Wednesday in other areas of Martin Place . Workers laid flowers and notes early on Wednesday morning, more than 24 hours after the siege ended .

Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lynne also paid tribute, bowing their heads . Many of those office workers, friends and tourists leaving tributes were in tears . NSW Premier Mike Baird laid a bunch of flowers alongside hundreds of other Sydneysiders . Sydneysider Cat Delaney has been handing out tissues to mourners at the site for the past two days. 'When you get out into the middle and you're there amongst that emotion, it's overwhelming,' she said. 'When they get to me and I offer a tissue, it's permission to vent.' Local florist George Lackerdas sold out his entire stock within an hour of opening on Wednesday. 'Two days worth of flowers I've sold in an hour. It's unbelievable,' he said. 'Yesterday I had queues of 30 people waiting non-stop until I sold out.' Visibily distraught men and women have been laying tributes for the two innocent victims of the siege .

Wendell had plenty of warm words for his father, telling him: 'First of all, I'm glad to know that someone was looking for me. I want you to know that I have no feelings of resentment, or sense of abandonment, or anything like that. 'On the contrary I want to actually thank you for making the decision that you did, whether it was your decision or not. The parents that I got were two of the most wonderful people on the planet and I couldn't have asked for better parents to raise me.' Father and son: 'It's important to me for him to know that I never abandoned him. I always wanted him,' Greg (right) told Dr Phil . Wendell only had one pressing question for his dad: whether Greg, who was 18 at the time, was involved in the process of placing him with his adoptive parents. Greg quickly explained that it was actually the parents of Wendell's mother who insisted on giving him up, adding that he and his family fought to try and keep him with them. 'Your mother came from a wealthy family,' Greg said. 'We were relatively poor.' 'When she became pregnant, it became obvious that her mother kept her under wraps - sent her to a home for unwed mothers, wouldn't let her walk in the neighborhood, except at midnight, because she didn't want the neighbors to find out that she was pregnant.' Grateful: 'I'm glad to know that someone was looking for me,' Wendell told his father . Greg's father threw his college scholarships away and instructed him to begin working the day he graduated from high school. He found a job at Rohr Aircraft and was prepared to abandon his dreams of continuing his education. 'My father said: ""There's no such thing as illegitimate children, just illegitimate parents."" And that stuck with me my whole life.' he added. When Wendell was born, Greg was not allowed at the hospital. His name didn't even appear on Wendell's birth certificate, as he had expected it to. Emotional: Greg teared up after the touching moment he met his long-lost son . Greg's girlfriend's family then informed him that they were giving the child up. 'My mother had fought to take custody,' he recalls. 'This was her first grandson, and she wanted that child; she wanted you.' 'They had more money, they had more power, and they just did it. And I was sick and I didn't know what to do, and I was lost.' Greg went on to enroll at a junior college, where he played football, but still thought of the baby boy over the years. 'You never, ever left the back of my mind or my heart,' he said.","Greg was 18 when his girlfriend became pregnant and was heartbroken when her parents insisted on giving up the child for adoption .

"Gordon Strachan has told Scotland new boy Lewis Macleod to use Andy Robertson's rise through the international ranks as inspiration. The Rangers midfielder has been given his first call-up for the European Championship qualifier against the Republic of Ireland and the friendly against England at Celtic Park on November 14 and 18 respectively. The 20-year-old, capped at every level from Under-16s to Under-21s, has impressed the Scots' boss with his performances for the Championship club this season. Lewis Macleod (above) has been given his first Scotland call-up by Gordan Strachan . Strachan believes Macleod need only to look at 20-year-old Hull City left-back Robertson to see that he is 'not only there to make up the numbers'. As a Scotland Under-21 player at Dundee United before his £2.85million move to England in the summer, Robertson was invited to a training session with the senior team and was soon promoted, making his debut against Poland in a friendly in March before becoming an established member of the squad. 'If things go well this week you never know what might happen,' said the former Southampton and Celtic boss. 'Young Andrew Robertson joined us for an afternoon and played against 11 versus 11 to work on certain things. 'After the game finished I asked the coaches who played well and apart from Scott Brown and James Morrison, he was man of the match. Gordon Strachan believes it will benefit both Macleod and Scotland for him to join up with the squad . 'I am looking forward to seeing him (Macleod) and working with him. 'I see him in the first game of the season and I caught up with videos and obviously other people watch games. 'So it is easy to find out if a player is playing well. We think it will be good for us to have him along.' Meanwhile, Strachan expects Stuart McCall to be back in the management hot seat soon. The Scotland coach resigned as Motherwell manager on Sunday following five consecutive Scottish Premiership defeats. McCall had led the Steelmen to three successive top-three finishes and a Scottish Cup final appearance, as well as the Champions League qualifiers but left the Fir Park men second bottom in the table. The 20-year-old Macleod has scored seven goals for the Ibrox club so far this season . Strachan said: 'I spoke to him and he is fine. 'He will be back again. At Motherwell, he was third, second, second - that is some going. Terrific. 'That won't be missed by other clubs throughout the country and it shouldn't be because he is a terrific guy, a terrific manager and players love playing for him as well. 'During the games he sees things, the information he gives us is invaluable. 'He has a good way about him, he links the players and staff together. 'There is no doubt he will be back in football soon - but it is nice to have a break now and then.'","Scotland face Republic of Ireland in a Euro 2016 qualifier on November 14 .

"Logan Wood tragically died after an accident on his motorbike at a motocross track near Rochdale . A 12-year-old boy described as an 'adrenaline junkie' was killed in a motocross accident in front of his father as he completed a high 'leap' on his bike for the first time. Logan Wood had been striving to achieve the 15-foot jump on his KTM 65cc bike at a designated track supervised by marshals but, when he finally achieved the stunt, he lost control and was thrown off the machine. Logan's father Edward, 42, was watching from his van when the accident happened and rushed over to cradle his son in his arms. He told his son he had completed the jump in the hope of comforting him, but the youngster had suffered fatal chest injuries and died later in hospital. An inquest was told that Logan, from Oswaldwistle near Accrington, Lancashire had been riding quad bikes since the age of nine after his dad got one from a friend at work. Mr Wood said his son had got 'really good on his quad bike' and had 'nagged' for a motorbike. In October 2013, Logan's parents had decided that they would buy him one for Christmas. The inquest heard that the bike was dismantled and put into boxes to be opened Christmas day. Mr Wood, who grew up around motorcycles and cars, told the inquest that he and his son then worked alongside each other to put the machine back together. By February this year, Logan was attending the motocross track at Cown Quarry in Whitworth, near Rochdale most Saturdays. His father said: 'He would get a little bit more confident with gear changing. He was always supervised.' Mr Wood added that he had told his son, who always wore a helmet, that if he ever lost control of the bike to 'get the bike as far away' by standing on the pegs and pushing it away. Mr Wood said the circuit was 'a well marked out track with no room to go the wrong way' and was well supervised. He added: '[Logan] would always come up to the straight and check if anyone was behind him. He was very conscious if other people were around him. 'He was getting much more confident on the bike and always striving to get to the top of that jump. Maybe he was trying that little bit harder which he did always. He wanted to push himself that little bit more.' On October 1, the schoolboy rode on the track with no other riders after a month's break from the motorsport. Mr Wood told the inquest he approached 'a big jump' differently from usual. He said: 'He would go up the first part of the jump, leave the ground and land both wheels on the incline. He was going a little bit quicker than he had been doing. 'The bike didn't seem to accelerate until three quarters along the stretch. I can't explain, whether he backed off or there was an issue with the bike accelerator at the base of the jump.' Logan's  father, Edward, said his son approached a jump differently from usual before the crash . Mr Wood told the inquest that he landed at the top of the 15ft hill but did not veer to the left as planned and the machine crashed causing Logan to lose his helmet. Mr Wood ran  towards his son and did what he could to save him. He tearfully told the inquest that as he tended to his son he told him that he had made the jump. PC Robert Newcombe who investigated the tragedy said there had been no concerns about the course and said: 'It was marked out clearly which way you had to travel and there are tyres around the track. 'Marshals checked Logan before riding, they seem to be very committed to improving people on motorbikes.' He added that Logan's bike had no defects and brakes and steering were working correctly. PC Newcombe added: 'For some reason or other Logan seems to have lost control. I think he has possibly become a little over confident. 'He was the only person on the track at the time, perhaps he has gone a little too fast, got to the top of the hill, perhaps beyond his capability to resolve it, it bends sharply to the left. 'He has gone up the hill and gone down instead of going round left, he has virtually gone straight off instead of going round the bend.' Logan was riding a KTM 65cc, like that pictured, which he had been given for Christmas when he crashed . He added that although Logan's helmet was fastened underneath it had been loose and had come off. But, he said, the loss of the helmet had not been a contributory factor in his death. Coroner Mr Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of accidental death and said: 'He was doing something he loved and he was getting better at it. We will never know really what happened. 'It is a best guess that he did become more confident, in you telling me he was asking 'where did I land' and 'how far did I get'. 'It is quite easy to misjudge that. He would probably have been proud that he landed at the top. Sadly he lost control after he landed. As a result of that it was fatal. 'There's no criticism of the bike, the course, the marshals, there's no criticism of Logan. He was an enthusiastic young man.' In a statement Logan's family said: 'He was tragically taken from us doing what he loved the most, riding his motorbike. 'He was a real outdoors boy if he wasn't playing sport he would be out on his BMX or scooter showing off the tricks he could do - a real adrenaline junkie.' The accident happened at Cown Quarry in Whitworth, near Rochdale in October. A coroner said nobody was to blame, adding: 'There's no criticism of the bike, the course, the marshals, there's no criticism of Logan'","Youngster had been riding quad bikes since the age of nine .

"If you thought your Christmas shopping list was long, spare a thought for pensioner Mary Scholey. The 82-year-old can't afford to leave her present buying to the last minute because she has to find and wrap the perfect gift for each of her 80 grandchildren. As well as the presents Mrs Scholey, who has 10 children, remembers the names of all her 33 grandchildren, 44 great-grandchildren, and three great-great grandchildren to send them all a Christmas card. Mary Scholey pictured with her growing family during a pre-Christmas get-together . Super-gran: This Christmas Mary Scholey, 82, has had to buy and wrap presents for each of her 80 grandchildren . 'I don't know how she does it, especially as she's getting older - it's amazing,' said son Stephen Gregory. 'She writes the majority or cards for herself and goes to Barnsley and Wombwell markets to find presents. It's a massive task.' Mrs Scholey who lives with her husband Raymond in Sheffield, South Yorkshire had 10 children with her first husband Jim, who died about 20 years ago. The pensioner, known as Nanan Mary by the youngest in the family, said: 'I never really thought I would have a big family but 60 years ago there wasn't that much of a choice in the matter. 'I had two sets of twins and six other children so the family just kept on growing. 'Christmas is a busy time because there are so many of us but it's nice to see everybody. It's always busy here anyway so I'm used to that. Mary Scholey, pictured with her second husband Ray, manages to remember the names of all her 80 grandchildren . 'When I first had grandchildren I told them to call me Nan because I thought Grandma sounded too old. All of the little ones call me Nanan, they just always have. 'I don't find it difficult to keep up with all the names. We are not on Facebook or anything so I get all of the news about my family through word of mouth.' Mrs Scholey's reams of relatives try to get together for special occasions, such as milestone birthdays and weddings, but it is no mean feat. As an early Christmas present for the pensioner 100 family members gathered at a Working Men's Club in Sheffield. 'It was lovely to see them all and when they saw me they were all in a queue to give me a kiss. I enjoyed that,' she said. Mrs Scholey said she never thought she would have a big family . 'When everybody was together it was easy to see how big the family really is. 'My son Stephen thought it would be a good idea to get the family together.' Her offspring included two sets of twins, and the family has just kept on growing since. Mrs Scholey's children include: mum-of-three Lesley, aged 62; 60-year-old dad-of-two Stephen; father-of-three Neil, 58; 55-year-old dad-of-four Peter; mother-of-four Vicky, 54; 50-year-old mum-of-three Debbie, and 45-year-old twins Josie and Jane, both mums-of-three, as well as mum-of- three Jacqueline and Stephen's twin Stuart, a dad-of-five, who have both passed away. Four more great, great grandchildren are due next year to join her youngest relatives, including seven-month-old Harper Blu, daughter of Neil's daughter Keeley. Mr Gregory said: 'With her having 10 children, we didn't need to produce many children for the family to grow quite rapidly. 'She gets a fair few visitors with grandchildren dropping in to see her. 'She's a classic nan in that she doesn't stand for any nonsense, but she's very loving. Family certainly comes first for her. 'Most of the family live in the Sheffield area though there are a few relatives in Austria, Jersey and Australia. 'I'd be intrigued to know if there is a bigger family in Sheffield. Ten children and almost 100 grandchildren is some going - we must be one of the biggest.'","Mother-of-ten Mary Scholey, 82, has a total of eighty grandchildren .

"From her first name to her religion, much has changed in the life of the wife of the Sydney siege gunman - herself on bail for the alleged murder his former wife and who allegedly featured in videos where she described herself as a 'terrorist'. Before Amirah Droudis, 35, married Man Haron Monis, the self-styled Sheikh behind this week's deadly sixteen-hour siege, she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage. Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, southwest Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years. As a young adult, she would often visit bars and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Amirah Droudis, pictured here with friends, used to be known by the traditional Greek name Anastasia prior to her conversion to Islam . Droudis is pictured at Campsie Police Station on Tuesday evening, hours after her family's home in Belmore was raided by authorities . Amirah Droudis remains free despite being charged with serious crimes, including murder . Man Haron Monis, pictured, was the gunman who took 18 hostages and terrified Sydney in a sixteen-hour siege . Raid: Police executed a search warrant at the Belmore property belonging to the Droudis family on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the Sydney siege came to a bloody end . But after she met the Iranian fanatic who this week took eighteen people hostage in a terrifying 16-hour siege that left two hostages and the gunman dead, Droudis dropped her birth name in favour for Amirah, an Arabic name, and reportedly converted to Islam. 'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, ""I'm whatever now""'. Like Monis, Droudis has had repeated run-ins with the law - and like Monis she remains free despite being charged with serious crimes, including murder. The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years. Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday. Droudis declined to comment outside her home and later reported to Campsie Police Station, where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions for the alleged murder of Monis' estranged wife, Noleen Hayson Pal. Police allege Droudis stabbed Pal eighteen times in her Werrington apartment and set her on fire. Monis was on bail charged with being an accessory to the murder when he entered the cafe and took his hostages. A court was told earlier this year that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty. Mother: Amirah Droudis is pictured here around a decade ago . Daily Mail Australia understands that Droudis, pictured, worked as a hairdresser in her teenage years . Droudis' family were followers of the Greek Orthodox Church . Four years before the alleged murder, a woman believed to be Droudis, posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God’s will. The videos bear the address of Monis’ website. 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman, 'Amirah', in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab. In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.' 'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.' The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. Transformed: In 2009, a female follower of Sheikh Haron, identified as 'Sister Amirah' made a series of videos including in which describes herself as a terrorist . This is the introductory message at the beginning of the video that was posted on the Sheikh Haron website . At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan. Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service. In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case. Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with. ‘She’s always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it’s also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.'

"China has unveiled its latest method of crowd control - a ray gun likened to a 'human microwave' which gives its target the excruciating sensation of feeling like they're on fire. Operating on similar principles to a microwave, the Poly WB-1 projects a wave beam up to a range of 80metres that causes movement in water and fat molecules just below the skin. Despite the extreme burning pain felt by those shot, the weapon is completely non-lethal, leaves no lasting damage and the pain subsides immediately when moved off the person. China's Poly WB-1 (pictured) leaves no lasting damage but makes its target feel like they're on fire . The China Poly Group Corporation used a recent air show to reveal its new weapon, and claimed its range could be increased to up to a kilometre, IHS Jane's reported. It is remarkably similar to a weapon briefly deployed by the US military in Afghanistan in 2010 that was withdrawn after concerns it could be used against the US in a propaganda war. However, the weapon - called the Active Denial System (ADS) - also required 16 hours to warm up before use. The futuristic device has long been popular with authorities as a means of effective crowd control because of its ability to repel groups of people without leaving any visible marks or injuries. It was described in  Harper's Magazine as 'the next hurdle for non-lethality'. Author Ando Arike wrote: 'Although “first-generation” weapons like rubber bullets and pepper spray have gained a certain acceptance, despite their many drawbacks, exotic technologies like the Active Denial System invariably cause public alarm.' Pictured are two US humvees fitted with the US military's Active Denial System, used to make its target feel like they're on fire .","New weapon for crowd control has been likened to a 'human microwave'

"On Saturday night they could be crowned the best team on the planet if they win the FIFA Club World Cup against San Lorenzo, but next month Real Madrid could establish themselves as one of the greatest sides ever by breaking the world record for consecutive wins. When they beat Ludogorets 4-0 in their last Champions League group game they made it 19 successive wins and that gave them the best record of any Spanish team ever, beating the 18-match run of Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona side in the 2005-06 season. But now the challenge is to match the Ajax team that won 26 straight games in the 1971-72 campaign. To manage that they will first have to beat San Lorenzo on Saturday, Valencia at the Mestalla in their first league game back after the winter break, and then Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey in January at the Vicente Calderon. This will draw them level with Brazilian side Curitiba, who won 24 games on the bounce in 2011.

The Portugal forward sprints during a training session in Marrakech on Thursday . Goals: 79 . Left-footed goals: 19 . Right-footed goals: 42 . Headed goals: 15 . Goals (outside box): 9 . Goals (inside box): 70 . Goals (penalties): 8 . Conceded: 10 . Then, if they were to beat Espanyol and Getafe, they would then draw level with Ajax, and a win over Atletico in the second leg of their Cup last-16 match would give them the new world record. The incredible run has been made all the more impressive by the fact that it followed consecutive defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico earlier in the season. There were doubts over whether the new signings were fitting in, and whether the side could cope with the loss of Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso. Carlo Ancelotti's assistant Paul Clement recalls: 'We had a difficult game against Real Sociedad. We were really coasting in the first half and could have been 5-0 up and ended up losing 4-2. Then we followed that up with a defeat by Atletico Madrid. It was a difficult time and we really hadn't got up to speed quickly enough.

Bale (right) looks on during training as Ronaldo (left) picks up a cone and talks to Sami Khedira and Pepe . 'I think it was a combination of some change in personnel and a difficult pre-season coming off the back of a World Cup on an American tour where we only had 10 senior players. But you can look at the form from then on, and see that we have really put things right since.' The first win of the run came on September 16 at home in the Champions League when Basle were on the wrong end of a 5-1 hammering. Madrid then put eight past Deportivo la Coruna and five more past Elche. Suddenly they were averaging six goals a game and it wasn't all easy home wins against intimidated opposition either. They went to Villarreal and won 2-0 and they then travelled to Bulgaria and saw off Ludogorets 2-1. Then came the real test - Liverpool home and away and Barcelona in the space of just two weeks. They made it look easy. The Real players huddle around during training ahead of Saturday's match with San Lorenzo .

'Going to Anfield is always difficult because of that atmosphere,' says Clement. 'It's like another player for them. But we did really well after a difficult first 20 minutes. We got the goal and calmed the crowd.' Real ran-out 3-0 winners and former Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo was even applauded off by the Kop when substituted. Barcelona turned up at the Bernabeu in the next game and were still yet to concede a goal. They scored first with debutant Luis Suarez setting up Neymar. But Real were too strong and eventually ran out 3-1 winners. After victories over Cornella and Granada, Liverpool visited Madrid with a drastically changed team from the first leg. Brendan Rodgers' personnel and tactics were different but the result was just the same with Real winning 1-0. Ronaldo (centre) laughs during the training session on Thursday in Marrakech . The players huddle around in the centre of the training pitch in Marrakech . With three mighty scalps under their belts the Madrid steamroller has gone on flattening everyone put in its path since. On their 21-game run, they have scored 79 goals. Nine of those have come from outside the box, eight have been from the penalty spot and 15 have been headers. They have also passed teams into submission with a total of 12,128  - while their share of possession has only dropped below 50 per cent four times, against Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona, Villarreal and Celta. And while Ronaldo and company have been running wild at one end, the defence has held firm at the other, with only 10 goals conceded. It will not be easy to take the world record. San Lorenzo will provide tough opposition on Saturday and having to play Valencia once and Atletico Madrid twice at the turn of the year is not ideal. But, on the evidence of the last four months, it is clear that nothing is beyond this team.","Real Madrid have won 21 games in succession since September 16 .

"Drivers who smoke with a child in the car will face a £50 fine from next year, under plans backed by ministers. They say making it a criminal offence will protect children from second-hand smoke, which is linked to serious health problems. A ban is set to be implemented on October 1, with police officers to issue Fixed Penalty Notices for those caught smoking with an under-18 in the car. Drivers who smoke with a child in the car will face a £50 fine from next year, under plans backed by ministers . Ministers have given the plan their support, including David Cameron, whose spokesman said this year he believed ‘the time has come’ for such a law. But while health campaigners are pleased with the move, questions have been raised about how the ban would be enforced and whether it would waste police time. Under the draft law published yesterday, it would be an offence for adults to ‘smoke in a private vehicle with someone under age 18 present’. Health minister Jane Ellison (left) said second-hand smoke was 'a real threat to children's health', while Professor Sheila Hollins of the British Medical Association (right) said the ban was 'an important step' It would also be an offence for a driver to ‘fail to prevent smoking in a private vehicle with someone age under 18 present’ if another passenger is lighting up. Both would carry an immediate fine of £50, but non-payment could result in criminal charges. It would be the biggest crackdown on smoking since 2006, when smoking was banned in all public places. And while polls suggest the majority of adults – and smokers – back a ban, even the anti-smoking campaign group Action on Smoking and Health conceded it could be ‘difficult to enforce’ and called for ministers to go further and ban smoking in cars altogether. Pete Williams, of the RAC, said: ‘While it is undoubtedly the right thing to do in principle in terms of children’s health, it may be overly optimistic to think it will be enforced on a widespread basis.’ A spokesman for the AA said: ‘There is haze around enforcement – are children going to have to tell on their parents?’ Public health minister Jane Ellison said yesterday: ‘Second-hand smoke is a real threat to children’s health … The only effective way to protect children is to prevent them breathing second-hand smoke and our plans to stop smoking in cars carrying children will help us to do this’. MPs and peers approved the principle of the law earlier this year. The final hurdle is a vote next month on the wording of the bill, but MPs are expected to give it resounding support. The ban would only apply in England as smoking legislation is devolved, although Wales and Scotland are both consulting on a similar ban. England would be the second country in Europe to impose such a ban, after Cyprus. Smoking in cars with children under age 12 present is banned in South Africa. In Australia and some US states the law applies with under-18s present. The British Lung Foundation say around half a million children are exposed to second-hand smoke every week in a family car. Around 300,000 GP visits a year are caused by children passive smoking. Professor Sheila Hollins of the British Medical Association said the ban was ‘an important step’. Department of Health said cars carrying under-18s should be smoke-free to ‘protect young people from the serious health harms of smoked tobacco’ A Department of Health spokesman said enforcement was being discussed with the College of Policing. As with the ban on using a mobile while driving, and seatbelt legislation, police officers will be able to stop a car if they believe an offence is taking place. They can ask for identification to check someone’s age, but the passenger does not have to provide it. Police will have to make a ‘reasonable assessment’ of the situation. Pro-smoking group Forest called the ban a ‘gross intrusion on people’s privacy’ and said enforcing it would be a waste of police time.","Department of Health said cars carrying under-18s should be smoke-free .

"Homeowners face curbs on CCTV cameras on their properties after a surge of complaints about spying neighbours. Gripes about security cameras attached to neighbouring buildings, including homes and shops, to deter crime have almost tripled to six a day amid fears about snooping, it has emerged. The independent surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, warned he would ask the Government to legislate if concerns about the growing use of domestic CCTV systems, which cost as little as £100, did not abate. Gripes about security cameras attached to neighbouring buildings, including homes and shops, to deter crime have almost tripled to six a day amid fears about snooping . He has vowed to issue new guidance next March about the use of cameras on private homes to tackle mounting worries about use of the technology. Many complaints focus on CCTV cameras which invade neighbours’ privacy by focusing on their garden or by pointing into their windows, or fears that paedophiles could use the state-of-the-art kit to leer at children. The Office of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner has seen a rise in the number of calls from people from around two a week – or about 100 a year – to up to six a week, as many as 300 a year. Some 80 per cent are about CCTV on someone’s home. In his annual report, Mr Porter said: ‘The use of surveillance camera systems within domestic environments continues to grow. This upsurge in domestic use is directly responsible for an increase in complaints around their use. ‘The most common concerns coming in to my inbox - around 80 per cent - are over the use of CCTV at someone’s home, in a domestic setting. The concerns are primarily about the intrusion into a neighbour's privacy.’ Commercial CCTV systems have to comply with a code of practice which sets out transparency requirements and a number of measures about how recordings can be stored and used. Home Secretary Theresa May, arriving for a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street this morning, may face calls to crackdown on the use of CCTV cameras on people's homes . However, the code does not apply to householders who have installed CCTV to deter burglars and other crime. Mr Porter said drones and body-worn video, including by bouncers, door supervisors or landlords, ‘present challenges’ but did not highlight any of the complaints received about the technology.","Gripes about security cameras attached to neighbouring buildings triple .

"Paedophile: Chris Denning gave a disturbing interview to a newspaper in Prague in 2001 . A disturbing interview by Chris Denning - in which he described himself as a ‘bizarre person’ - emerged last night as the former BBC DJ was jailed for sexual assault. The 73-year-old paedophile gave the interview in Prague in 2001 after spending more than three years in jail for sexually abusing underage boys in the Czech Republic. Before leaving Pankrác Prison in the city, he tried to defend himself by claiming that his crimes were fuelled by a desire not to be lonely and spending his teenage years as a rent boy. Speaking to reporter James Pitkin of The Prague Post, he said: ‘It's just what happened. And what am I supposed to do? Live my whole life on my own? I wasn't prepared to do that. He added: ‘If anyone could prove that this hurts anyone, I would never do it again and I never would have done it in the first place. They base their prejudice on pseudo-science and preposterous notions. ‘I think the root of my condition, if you can call it that, is that I only felt comfortable with boys who wanted to do the same thing. That's where the guilt comes in, because I felt I was a dirty boy.’ Denning said he was a male prostitute from the age of 13 and often formed lasting friendships with boys. But he was sent to prison for four years for the sexual abuse of eight boys in Prague in 1997, with a court hearing that he paid the children, all under the local age of consent of 15, for sex acts. Paid local boys for sex acts: Denning (left) is escorted by a justice guard to a court hearing in the Czech Republic in March 2000, three years after he was jailed for the sexual abuse of eight boys in Prague in 1997 . The interview in the English-language newspaper was reprinted in full by The Independent today. Yesterday, Denning was jailed at Southwark Crown Court in central London for 13 years for sexually assaulting 24 boys - including one allegedly at Jimmy Savile's house. Denning, one of the founding presenters on Radio One, ‘used the allure of the record industry and celebrity’ to seduce and groom his victims. He took boys to watch Top of the Pops recordings and introduced them to stars including Savile. He began assaulting the boys in 1967 - the same year he was unveiled as one of the founding DJs. Court sketch: Denning was jailed at Southwark Crown Court in central London yesterday for 13 years for sexually assaulting 24 boys - including one allegedly at Jimmy Savile's house . And he continued his campaign of abuse against boys as young as 10 for two decades. He later opened computer games shops and used the ‘exceptionally exciting’ technology to prey on boys. Denning, of Basildon, Essex, stared at his victims and their families - who had travelled from all over the country to see justice done - as he strolled into the dock for the sentencing. The former DJ, who suffers from a string of health problems including Parkinson's, admitted 40 assaults - 36 counts of indecent assault on a male and four indecent assaults on a child. He has a string of convictions for sex offences on boys. The case was brought under Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up in the wake of the Savile scandal.","Chris Denning gave interview in Prague  after spending three years in jail .

"Petr Cech has insisted that the current crop of Chelsea stars are good enough to become the best side in the Blues' history, if they can ensure they win some silverware. Chelsea have lost just one game in all competitions this season and sit top of the Premier League heading into the hectic festive schedule. And victory over Derby County on Tuesday ensured they moved into the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, having already qualified top of their group in the Champions League. Eden Hazard strikes to give Chelsea the lead in the Capital One Cup quarter-final clash against Derby County . Petr Cech believes Chelsea have the 'potential and quality' to be one of the best teams in Blues history . Jose Mourinho's squad is impressing Cech and he thinks they can make history this season. The Czech Republic international said: 'This team has the potential and the quality to be one of the best in Chelsea's history - if it can prove it by winning trophies. 'I like the way we approach games. We want to win every game. You cannot go and just say we leave this competition and chase another one because in that competition you pick you can have one unlucky game and you're out. 'That is why we try to win every game and progress in everything we have entered.' Cech has found himself superseded as Chelsea's No 1 by Belgian stopper Courtois, but the 32-year-old  has returned to the team in recent weeks due to an injury to the former Atletico Madrid loanee. Hazard jumps and punches the air after scoring the game's opening goal against Derby . Jose Mourinho's side have lost just one match all season and remain on the hunt for trophies on four fronts . There is still the possibility of a quadruple of trophies for the Blues this season - the Capital One Cup, the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League - and Cech is confident they can achieve success in at least one of them. He continued: 'The aim is to win as many games and competitions as possible, but football is football - it's difficult to know how many of them you'll win. 'I think all the people that have come in this season have been doing remarkably well. Hopefully we all stay fit and the manager can use the whole squad because in this busy period you need everybody.'

"Looking for a high-impact dish to grace your Christmas lunch table? The latest foodie craze is to serve up a bombe. Traditionally, these are dome-shaped French desserts made from ice-cream, so-called because they’re shaped like a cannonball or bomb, and with a hidden ‘exploding’ liquid or surprise centre. But this holiday season they come in all flavours and guises — often with a special surprise in the middle. Here, AMANDA CABLE rates the bombes that will add a taste explosion to any festive feast — and the ones best left off the menu. DOUBLE CHOCOLATE BOMBE . £15, www.cookfood.net, 550g (main picture) VERDICT: This huge chocolate bombe feeds ten people — but once they reach the soft raspberry toffee ‘surprise’ in the middle, it could turn into a brawl as they all try to get some more. Believe me, it’s much more delicious than it sounds. The outside layer is made from chocolate sponge, soaked in sweet Marsala wine, and covered with a dusting of cocoa. Inside is rich chocolate mousse and whipped cream — with the raspberry toffee centre. It comes ready to eat. Perfect for a dinner party — and as it looks homemade, you could pretend you’ve made it yourself. 5/5 . TURKEY BOMBE . Around £34 (varies according to size), Morrisons . VERDICT: This savoury bombe features layers of bacon on the outside, turkey on the inside and a centre filling of sage and onion stuffing. Needs baking according to instructions. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the thick, succulent bacon, which could be straight from the farm. There were more than 22 rashers layered so beautifully on top that it felt like a crime to carve through them. The turkey is tasty and matches the bacon for quality, and as you carve through the bombe each layer of bacon, turkey and delicious stuffing falls away in perfect appetising slices. A winner if you want the wow factor. 4/5 . STUFFING BOMBE . £5 for 650g, Asda . VERDICT: This stuffing bombe looks so spectacular it could outshine the Christmas turkey. The size and shape of a medium Christmas pudding — it serves eight to ten — the edges are artfully lined with thin delicious-looking orange slices. The first problem is removing it from the plastic bowl. I slid a knife into the side and gently eased it out. Then you pop it in the oven. When finished, it looks impressive with a golden crust on the stuffing and the pretty orange slices glistening. But oh dear, the taste. It contained so much cinnamon and spice, it was like tasting a mouthful of Christmas potpourri — horrible! If only this tasted as good as it looks. 2/5 . HESTON’S HIDDEN ORANGE CHRISTMAS PUDDING . £15 for 1.5kg, Waitrose . VERDICT: This is the original surprise-in-the -middle (therefore qualifying it as a bombe) pudding produced by the master of molecular gastronomy. Launched in 2010, this helped create the current bombe trend. This year they cost £15 — if you are lucky enough to find one on the shelves. Preparation is relatively time-consuming — it has to be steamed for three hours. Alternatively, it can be microwaved for around eight minutes. But it’s hugely satisfying to cut into the pudding and hear the squelch of the whole candied orange — one which has been previously soaked and preserved in sugar syrup — buried in the middle. Its delicious citrussy juices and flavour infuse the fruity surroundings. The combined taste of sweet orange and Christmas pudding is glorious. A real treat. 5/5 . HIDDEN CLEMENTINE CHRISTMAS PUDDING . £4 for 454g, Tesco . VERDICT: Tesco have cheekily come up with the little brother of Heston’s bombes — a Christmas pudding with a smaller Clementine inside instead of an orange. You steam it for one hour, or microwave for three minutes. It’s not only just as tasty as Heston’s bigger orange version, but the Tesco pudding has less saturated fat — 2.9g per 100g compared to 3.4g. I’d recommend Tesco for smaller gatherings of four or so, and Heston for a larger group. 5/5 . FINEST BELGIAN CHOCOLATE BOMBE . £2.50 for 227g, Tesco . VERDICT: The middle contains a thick dollop of melting chocolate, which isn’t exactly unexpected but tastes delicious all the same. Gloriously rich, it even defeated the appetite of my 13-year-old son Charlie, who stopped halfway through his second helping, declaring: ‘If I eat any more of this bombe I’ll explode!’ 3/5 . PETIT FOUR BOMBES . £4.99 per 35g bombe, www.selfridges.co.uk . VERDICT: Pile these on to your Christmas table and they’ll look more like decorations. Mine were just so pretty I stuck them in a tree. These are different flavoured chocolate bombes each wrapped in a small hexagon-shaped, brightly coloured cardboard box. Inside each is a domed chocolate bombe, crafted by petit four company Marasu’s. Choose from a variety of flavours such as espresso, peanut butter, praline and Amaretti biscuit. My favourite, however, has to be pavlova. Far too good for children — but the perfect way for adults to round off a Christmas meal! 4/5 . CHOCOLATE AND CHERRY SNOW BOMBE . £6 for 810g, The Co-Operative . VERDICT: The Co-op has been turning quietly foodie this last year, with some surprisingly delicious products. This one will look really attractive on any Christmas table and better still, is ready to serve. There’s white chocolate ‘snowflakes’ on the outside, and inside the bombe is a brown chocolate sponge, with a surprising middle of melting dark chocolate. This gives a snow-capped ‘wow’ factor to your table, but I found it a bit too sweet and sugary for an adult palate. One slice was more than enough. My kids, however, felt otherwise and greedily asked for seconds. 3/5 . CHEDDAR BOMBE WITH CHILLI AND RED PEPPER . £3.00 for 250g, Tesco . VERDICT: Warning — don’t feed this to your children without telling them about the chilli. I made that mistake and all three complained their mouths were on fire. It is a great twist for your cheeseboard though, and because of the dome shape it looks far more impressive than a simple block of cheese. There’s a dramatic topping of red pepper and chilli flakes. The chilli and red pepper is flecked throughout the delicious orange-coloured cheddar cheese, and each bite brings a new flavour. A great way to make cheese and biscuits more interesting, although some might find the chilli kick a bit too intense. 3/5 . CHOCOLATE CREAM BOMBE . £4.40 for 550g, lepain quotidien.co.uk . VERDICT: It may look like a simple, cocoa-covered bombe. But cut inside, and the soft Belgian chocolate mousse is so tasty you won’t be able to stop eating. Rather than a surprise in the middle, this has a surprise base of soft almond biscuit. So good that you will find room for more — and it’s not too rich for adults or children. 5/5 . WHITE STILTON CHRISTMAS PUDDING BOMBE . £3 for 250g, Tesco . VERDICT: If you want to confuse your mother-in-law after the Christmas lunch, serve up this Christmas pudding-shaped Stilton. It certainly doesn’t resemble any Stilton she’s ever tried before. It is topped with dried cranberries, and inside there’s a host of other dried fruit such as apricots, dates, and raisins. Great if you love dried fruit, but I found the hint of alcohol from the Grand Marnier extract in the cheese too sickening. Imagine cheese crossed with Christmas pudding, and this is the over-complicated and unappetising flavour you get here. 1/5 .","Serving a bombe instead of Christmas pudding is this year's latest craze .

"Britons heading to Dubai for some Christmas sunshine have been warned to avoid holding hands, kissing or being drunk on the street. A campaign by British Embassy staff in the United Arab Emirates this week is a play on the Twas the Night Before Christmas poem, and includes travel advice to help keep Britons out of trouble.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted that Australia's security system failed to put Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis under surveillance before he killed two people. 'The system did not adequately deal with this individual,' he conceded on Wednesday morning. 'Two very decent people are dead, others are injured, others are traumatised because of a madman who was roaming our streets.' Monis and two of his hostages - Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson - died at the end of a 16-hour siege in Sydney's centre, in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, before dawn on Tuesday. Mr Abbott has promised to be upfront with Australians in a public report about how the security system neglected to put the self-styled Sheik on a watchlist but federal police and spies are unlikely to shed much light when questioned. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted that Australia's security system failed to keep Man Haron Monis under surveillance . The investigation will also look at how and where Monis got a gun and how he was left unwatched . Court documents show that the dead gunman was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. Monis painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege. The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. Mr Abbott said he intended to publish a report into what happened in the lead-up to Monday's siege and why Monis was not on any counter-terrorism watchlist. Tony and Margie Abbott lay flowers at a memorial in Martin Place after the siege ended on Tuesday . Barrister Katrina Dawson (left) and Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson (right) were killed during the siege . The gunman made repeated demands to speak to the Prime Minister on the phone during the siege . Mr Abbott said he intended to publish a report into what happened in the lead-up to Monday's siege . The investigation will also look at how and where Monis got a gun. The self-proclaimed cleric was well known to ASIO and federal and NSW police after a string of alleged crimes and sending threats to the families of dead Australian soldiers. He was on bail with an accessory-to-murder charge related to his ex wife's death. As recently as Sunday he railed against Australian 'terrorism' on his website, vowing to fight the 'oppression and terrorism of USA and its allies including UK and Australia'. 'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored given his history of violence, his history of mental instability and his history of infatuation with extremism,' Mr Abbott said. The dead gunman was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges before he carried out the siege . He held 17 hostages captive inside the Lindt cafe in Martin Place for almost 17 hours . Four people were wounded and two people were killed as the siege came to an end after 2:00am on Tuesday . On Monday five hostages managed to escape and run to the protection of armed police . It was impossible to monitor everyone all the time so security agencies made judgments about who posed the most risk, he said. The threshold for placing someone on a watchlist was whether they were regarded as being at risk of committing violence against innocent people. However, federal police and spies are unlikely to shed much light on why  Monis was not on a security watchlist when they are questioned by MPs on Wednesday. Senior officials from the Australian Federal Police and ASIO will appear before a national security committee on Wednesday to face questions over the government's proposed metadata retention laws. But the committee chairman, Liberal Dan Tehan, is playing down the prospect that they will be offering answers on Monis. Mr Abbott meets assistant commissioner Mark Murdoch (L), deputy commissioner Catherine Burn (2ndL) and NSW Premier Mike Baird as he visits the Police Operations Centre in Sydney on December 16 . Mr Abbott (R) meets Chief Superintendent Steve Cullenas he visits the Police Operations Centre in Sydney . 'It might be that there are some questions regarding this new piece of legislation and how if we can retain data, how that might help in these types of situations,' Mr Tehan told ABC radio. 'But as far as the government is concerned I'm sure the prime minister will want to make sure that there is a methodical, thorough pertinent investigation of what has occurred.' Mr Tehan was asked how data retention powers, which would require telcos to retain certain data for two years, could have prevented the Lindt cafe siege. 'We need every tool to cope with these lone wolf attacks,' he said. 'It might not be the sole thing that can prevent these lone wolf attacks, but it is part of a suite of measures that is necessary.'","Man Haron Monis was well known to ASIO and federal and NSW police .

"The poetry professor accused of sending 'racist and sexist' emails has resigned from Sydney University after he was suspended from work in October. The emails included slurs against Indigenous AFL player and Australian Of The Year recipient Adam Goodes and appear to be sent to numerous friends and colleagues of Professor Barry Spurr over two years. In another email referring to a woman who was sexually assaulted by a colleague who 'put his penis in her mouth' while she slept, Mr Spurr allegedly responded with 'Ye gods. I think she needs a lot put in her mouth, permanently, and then stitched up'. A statement from The University of Sydney on Friday said: 'Professor Barry Spurr has submitted his resignation and the University has accepted it. 'At Professor Spurr’s request, the University will provide no further comment on this matter.' Scroll down for video . A number of racist and sexist emails allegedly sent by  University of Sydney Professor Barry Spurr have been leaked by news website New Matilda . In one email, Mr Spurr allegedly mocks Indigenous AFL player and Australian Of The Year recipient Adam Goodes . After a first round of emails were leaked, further emails were published by website New Matilda in response to Mr Spurr's claims that he was quoted out of context and his defence that they had been sent during a 'whimsical linguistic game' largely to one other recipient. 'An Aborigine, a sportsman [footballer], his mother one of the ""Stolen Generation"",' Mr Spurr allegedly wrote of Mr Goodes. 'Ticking all the correct boxes. Now all we need to know is that he suffers from 'depression' and has a disability, and he becomes the complete role model for Australians today. 'In his acceptance speech, all he talked about was racism and every time he said ""Australia"" he mispronounced it.' 'Abbott wants this so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year… to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all.' Mr Spirr told Fairfax that the exchange was a pastime 'that mocked extreme language', saying the comments were 'largely to one recipient with whom I have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements'. 'Abbott wants this [for Goodes to be titled Australian Of The Year]  so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year,' Spurr allegedly wrote . However, New Matilda says the emails, which were allegedly sent between late 2012 and 2014, had been sent between Mr Spurr and numerous colleagues and friends. Two separate emails, one sent in February 2013 and the other in January 2014, include the following comments from Mr Spurr's on various video links: 'no fatties, darkies or chinky-poos' and 'No Abos, Chinky-poos, Mussies, graffiti, piercings, jeans, tattoos. BCP in all Anglican chruches; Latin Mass in all Roman ones. Not a woman to be seen in a sanctuary anywhere. And no obese fatsoes' Another email allegedly shows Mr Spurr calling a house in which an Aboriginal family live 'a rubbish tip: human and material'. New Matilda disputed claims by Mr Spurr that the emails were a 'whimsical linguistic game' between himself and one recipient by releasing almost 20 of the emails that were sent between late 2012 and 2014 to numerous colleagues and friends . He wrote: '...it is now utterly destroyed, with its contents and smashed up fabric vomited out onto [a street], the pile impregnated with empty booze bottles, awaiting the Council special garbage collection for trashed housing. 'These are the people whose ""ancient wisdom"", our V-C says, we should respect, and to whom we apologise on every possible occasion and whose rich culture we bow down before, confessing our wickedness in our mistreatment of them.' Another email, it is alleged Professor Spurr called the Chancellor of Sydney University as an 'appalling minx'.. Professor Spurr was employed at The University of Sydney as Personal Chair in Poetry and Poetics but was suspended by the university on Friday . The allegations against Professor Spurr, who took charge of examining nationwide English courses, came just days after results of the National Curriculum Review were released. Despite claims from the Labor party that the review is 'tainted', education minister Christopher Pyne has refused to review the new curriculum for bias, according to the ABC. However, a spokesperson for Mr Pyne told Fairfax Media: 'the minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex, race, sexual orientation or beliefs'. As part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum, Professor Spurr made the recommendation to reduce study into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language. Sydney University students rallied outside the city campus on Friday calling for the sacking of Professor Spurr for the racist, sexist and derogatory comments in the email exchange . In one of the emails released by New Matilda on Sunday, sent on April 19 2014, Mr Spurr is alleged to complain about being sent 300 pages to read by Mr Pyne for the completion of the review. 'And whereas the local curriculuim has the phrase 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander' on virtually every one of its 300 pages, the Californian curriculum does not ONCE mention native Americans and has only a very slight representation of African-American literature (which, unlike Abo literature, actually exists and has some distinguished productions),' Mr Spurr apparently wrote. '[A fellow University academic] tells me that at her grand-daughter's school – [in Sydney] - every day begins with an acknowledgement of the orignal [sic] owners of the land. No flag-raising or national anthem - just this, every day. On the school's website, it proclaims that it prides itself on its 'atheletics' [sic] program. 'If ever an education system needed a bomb under it, it's ours.' They also attached a note to the Professor's office door which dubbed him the 'professor of bigotry' Mr Spurr told the New Matilda his recommendations in the review were made with his 'considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play'. Professor Spurr said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally. The University of Sydney  suspended Professor  Spurr's employment in October after initial reports that offensive emails, including one which referred to Prime Minister Tony Abbott as an 'abo lover', had been sent from his university account. Christopher Pyne had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs but will not review the new curriculum for bias . 'Professor Spurr is suspended, effective immediately, from teaching and engaging in any other University business and is precluded from attending any University campus, while the matter is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the terms of the University’s Enterprise Agreement,' the university said in a statement. 'Racist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the University of Sydney. The expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct are clearly set out in the University’s Code of Conduct.' Daily Mail Australia has approached Professor Barry Spurr for comment on this matter.","A number of racist and sexist emails allegedly sent by suspended University of Sydney Professor Barry Spurr were leaked .

"Illegal immigrant Babar Khan was jailed for 20 months after police stopped his sham marriage in Southampton, Hampshire . A sham marriage was uncovered after a registry office worker spotted that the groom was unable to spell his bride-to-be's name, a court heard. Babar Khan fake big day came crashing down when police dramatically stormed the ceremony as the fake couple prepared to exchange their vows. The illegal Pakistani national stumped up £4,660 to marry the woman he barely knew in a desperate attempt to remain in Britain at a ceremony in front of just two guests. Officers quizzed the couple who gave 'wildly conflicting' accounts of how they met, Southampton Crown Court, Hants, heard. Police then searched Khan's home and discovered 'crib notes' with prepared answers about their history together. He was released on bail yet the groom made one last frantic bid to evade being sent home by fleeing to London - before the authorities caught him again. Khan was jailed for for 20 months after he admitted conspiring to breach immigration law and two counts of breaching marriage laws. Siobhan Linsley, prosecuting, told the court how Khan was initially granted entry to Britain in September 2011 to study a three-year accountancy course in the capital. But when he failed to attend classes, immigration officers ordered him to apply for an extension or leave by the following June. Khan, 24, instead decided to pay money to a Mr Atta to arrange a marriage with a Southampton woman. On their arrival at Southampton Register Office on April 14 this year, staff became concerned, the court heard. Miss Linsley said: 'He misspelt her name and they had no interest in seeing the room where it would take place and were vague about details.' The woman, who is not being named, is believed to have received £250 for her part in the deal and police searching her home found no evidence of him ever living there. Khan, of no fixed address, later escaped to the capital but was eventually re-arrested in September this year working in a factory, the court heard. Staff at Southampton Registry Office, pictured above, became suspicious when Khan was unable to spell his bride-to-be's name . In mitigation barrister Jane Rowley stressed Khan was not the main organiser of the scam, adding: 'He bitterly regrets his misguided action. 'His motivations to come here weren't just greed. He wanted to make a constructive life in Britain.' Jailing Khan for 20 months, recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis, sentencing, said: 'This was a sham marriage and not genuine. 'You made the decision to stay in this country and went awol. 'You were burying your head in the sand to avoid the consequences of your actions.' Khan will be deported to his home country at the end of his sentence. The woman denies a charge of conspiracy to breach UK immigration law and is due to stand trial next year.","Pakistani national Babar Khan, 24, was jailed for 20 months by judge .

"A devoted daughter beat her 93-year-old mother to death when she could no longer cope with caring for her, a court heard. Susan Potts, 64,  battered grandmother Gladys Allen's face and head with a heavy purple glass vase at least 30 times at her home in Sheffield. Potts, of Uxbridge, Middlesex, has now pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Sheffield Crown Court. She was handed an indefinite hospital order during yesterday's court hearing and will be treated at St Bernard's secure hospital unit in Southall, London. Susan Potts, 64, battered her mother Gladys Allen with a purple glass vase at least 30 times at her home in Sheffield (pictured).  She has now pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility . During the case, the court heard how the mother of two had temporarily left her home in Middlesex in January to go and stay with her mother in Sheffield after she came out of hospital following a fall. But within weeks Potts, who had suffered from severe depression for decades, found the cooking, cleaning and toilet duties too much. She agonised over putting her mother into private care and felt she was letting her down, even vetting 14 different care agencies before choosing one. Just a week before carers were due to take over, when she and her husband intended to move back to Middlesex, she 'snapped', the court heard. Michael Slater, prosecuting, told the court: 'She was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with providing care for her mother on a daily basis. 'Some of her friends and family including her husband thought she was stretched to breaking point by her responsibilities. 'It is not suggested she cared for her mother in anything other than an exemplary way. She was the main if not the exclusive carer.' Mrs Allen, a widow who lived with her 33-year-old grandson Jonathan, one of Potts' sons, had been due to go the hairdressers on the day she died but Potts was worried about her possible incontinence on the way. Potts woke her husband Robin, who had been staying with her in Sheffield, at 8.45am on January 22 to tell him what she had done. She told him: 'Something terrible has happened in the dining room, go downstairs and check. I think I have killed mum.' Potts was handed an indefinite hospital order at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) after pleading guilty. She has now been sent to St Bernard's secure hospital unit in Southall, London, where she will receive treatment . He found seven-stone Mrs Allen in her blood-stained nightdress on the floor at the side of her bed, which was in the dining room. Potts said she had dreamed of suffocating her mother with a tea towel during the night and could no longer distinguish reality. Mr Slater said: 'When the police arrived, she admitted to an officer that she had killed her mother and expressed disbelief and said caring for her mother had just become too much.' She said later she had told her husband: 'I don't know whether it is a dream but I might have killed mum.' A pathologist found Mrs Allen had a range of injuries, including  head wounds, multiple rib fractures and injuries to her hands where she had tried to fight off her daughter. Mr Slater added: 'He was satisfied she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault using more than one method of inflicting injury.' Potts denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She was flanked by four hospital staff and two security guards as she observed the proceedings intently without showing any emotion in the dock. Alwyn Jones, defending, said psychiatrists concluded she was suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder at the time. It impaired her ability to form rational judgement and caused her to lack a degree of self-control. 'Her depression, personality traits and the circumstances formed a cocktail which led to the loss of Mrs Allen's life,' he said. 'There is no evidence she would have sought to harm her mother without the depressive illness.' He said it was 'abundantly clear' that Potts was 'driven in her desire' to care for her mother. 'She had a caring nature and did her level best to look after her mother,' he said. Family and friends spoke highly of Potts who 'changed things around' at her mother's home for the pensioner's comfort. One said: 'She is a very caring, kind and loving person.' The court heard Potts had been left 'devastated' by what had happened and was receiving treatment at the secure hospital unit at St Bernard's in London. Judge Julian Goose made both a hospital order and a restriction order under the Mental Health Act which means Potts will continue to receive treatment at the unit until doctors decide she is fit to be released. Making the restriction order, he said: 'The attack was of such violence that I cannot conclude there is no future risk to members of the public.' The court heard how Potts attacked her mother after becoming overwhelmed with caring for her at her house in Sheffield (pictured). She woke up her husband on January 22 and told him: 'I think I have killed mum' After the hearing Potts' family said in a statement that she was a 'caring and loving daughter' who felt 'regret and sadness' at the death of her mother. They said: 'Gladys was a central focus for our family and loved and respected by us all. 'Susan was a caring and loving daughter, thoughtful and attentive to her mother's needs. Her only desire was that her mother should live out the rest of her life in happy independence, doing what she had always enjoyed doing. 'The tragedy that occurred was because at that time Sue had become severely depressed, it would have been unthinkable in any other circumstances. 'Her mother was central to everything she did and the manner of her passing fills her with regret and sadness. 'It is the continuing generous support of friends and family which is helping us come to terms with these tragic events and we extend our thanks to them all. 'We are grateful that the justice system has recognised, that, but for her mental state, this tragedy would not have occurred, and that Sue will continue to receive treatment in hospital. 'The hope for all of us, including Gladys' friends and neighbours, is that with expert care, Sue will recover and eventually return to her family.' Detective Inspector Ian Fidler, the officer leading the case, said: 'This has been a difficult investigation of the most sensitive nature, because of the familial relationship between the victim and the defendant and a highly emotive case for all involved. 'Mrs Allen's death was tragic and unfortunate, and we extend our deepest condolences to her family, who have shown tremendous strength throughout our investigation.'","Susan Potts, 64, battered her mother Gladys Allen with a vase 30 times .

Hannah Overton, 37, will spend the holidays with her husband and five children for the first time since her 2007 conviction and life sentence for poisoning her son, Andrew Burd, with an overdose of salt. Throughout her incarceration, her family have stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurk has said that he will push again for capital murder charges, although a date has not yet been set. Out for now: Attorney Cynthia Orr, left, hugs Hannah Overton after Judge Mario Ramirez reduced Overton's bond during a bail hearing at the Nueces County Courthouse in Corpus Christi, Texas on Tuesday . After seven years in prison, Hannah Overton, center, smiles as attorneys Cynthia Orr, left, and John Raley escort her out of the Nueces County Jail on Tuesday . An appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News. Original prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since. On a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well. When he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning. A week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Sandra Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning. But during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt. The mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence. Overturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right) Still not in the clear: A Texas prosecutor announced his plans to try Overton on capital murder charges . New details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death. The defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested. The pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial. Dr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder. 'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal. Teachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to each trash on one occasion. Andrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica . The boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children. But the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home. 'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008. Eastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010. In 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.

"The ex-husband and close friend of an injured Sydney cafe siege hostage has told how she was used as a 'human shield' by the gunman just before the crisis came to a bloody end. Louisa Hope, 50, originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning. Self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis stormed in around 9:30, withdrawing a pump-action shotgun and holding customers hostage for more than sixteen hours. Ms Hope's ex-husband, who preferred to go by the name Tony V, told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning that his former partner was injured during the last moments of the siege. Scroll down for video . Injured hostage: Louisa Hope, 50, was held hostage by the self-styled Sheikh . Robyn Hope, the mother of Louisa, was also held hostage in the Lindt cafe . Louisa Hope - who featured in a hostage video - is pictured here being stretchered out of the Lindt Cafe . 'He'd used her for a human shield for most of the time that she was in there,' said the ex-husband, who used to live in Bondi but now runs a restaurant in South Yorkshire in the United Kingdom. 'That was just before the young lad was shot when he went to take the gun off the gunman.' The dramatic siege - considered a terrorist event according to New South Wales Police Force protocols - came to an end around 2am on Tuesday morning when hostages attempted a mass escape and cafe manager Tori Johnson attempted to grab Monis' weapon. Monis was falling asleep but woke up as the escape was underway.  'He [Monis] had dozed off. He was falling asleep,' Tony said. Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape . 'Some rustling noises had woke him when the lad was trying to take the gun off him. 'That's when [Johnson] was shot. Apparently that's when my ex-mother-in-law [Robyn] was then shot in the shoulder and that's when the police then went in... and that's when Louisa was shot in the foot.' Two people - Johnson and barrister and mum-of-three Katrina Dawson - were killed and at least four people were injured and taken to hospital. Ms Hope's ex-partner, who spoke to family on Tuesday morning UK time, said the whole incident had been 'very frightening'. He had some words of support for his injured friend, who he said has been operated on and is recovering in hospital. 'I'd just give her a hug and just tell her to keep strong,' Tony said.

"The Bulgarian Football Union has thrown its support behind Aleksandar Tonev after the on-loan Celtic winger was banned last week for seven matches, having been found guilty of racially abusing Aberdeen’s Shay Logan. The 24-year-old was found to have breached disciplinary rule 202 by an SFA judicial panel. The charge covered ‘excessive misconduct by the use of offensive, insulting and abusive language of a racist nature’. Aleksandar Tonev (centre) has been found guilty of using racist language towards Shay Logan (right) Tonev is set to appeal against the ruling and could yet face Logan when Celtic travel to Pittodrie on Sunday. The Parkhead club have already expressed their support for the player, with his manager Ronny Deila saying he was ‘livid’ with the decision. And, on Tuesday night, Tonev’s home association came out with its backing of the on-loan Aston Villa player. Celtic manager Ronny Deila is 'livid' about the decision to ban Tonev . Celtic assistant manager John Collins accompanied the Bulgarian midfielder to his hearing on Thursday . ‘The Bulgarian Football Union would like to express its full support for the player,’ said the statement. ‘We join Celtic and express our willingness to use every possible set of international football laws to reveal the truth. ‘And, in this case, it is undeniable. ‘A young and talented Bulgarian footballer is charged and punished for an offence he allegedly did not commit and no evidence of his guilt. ‘Aleksandar Tonev (has) always been a role model, put his heart and soul on the field and never violated the principles of fair play in the football game. Collins and Tonev leave Hampden after hearing the result, but the club have insisted they will appeal . ‘The Bulgarian Football Union strongly condemns all forms of racism and xenophobia in football stadiums and will continue its policy of zero tolerance for such events. ‘In the case of Tonev, however, we demand to see evidence that he had committed that of which he is accused. ‘Otherwise, we will consider that the penalty is biased and exaggerated.’ Tonev has made eight appearances for the Parkhead club since joining on a season-long loan deal from Villa during the summer transfer window.","Bulgarian Aleksandar Tonev accused of calling Shay Logan a 'black c***'

"A mother who was found dead after taking her newborn baby from the maternity unit of a hospital sparking a major search was discovered in a gully close to her child's body, an inquest heard today. Charlotte Bevan, 30, disappeared from St Michael's Hospital in Bristol with four-day-old Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck at about 9pm on December 2. CCTV footage showed the new mother leaving the hospital without a coat, wearing hospital slippers and carrying her daughter in a blanket. The footage also showed her walking past at least three nurses without being stopped. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Bevan, 30 (pictured left and with her baby right), disappeared from St Michael's Hospital in Bristol with four-day-old Zaani Tiana at about 9pm on December 2. Their bodies were found at the foot of Avon Gorge . Ms Bevan was calmly took her little girl from the maternity unit of the hopsital before leaving the hospital . Following a city-wide search, the body of Ms Bevan was found on the cliff face of the Avon Gorge, almost two miles away from the hospital ward, a day after she disappeared. The body of Zaani was found near where her mother had been found, 15 hours later, following an extensive search. A short hearing at Avon Coroner's Court, in Flax Bourton, near Bristol, heard that the pair had apparently fallen from the cliffs, which overlook Clifton Suspension Bridge. The pair were discovered after a walker spotted Ms Bevan's slippers and a baby blanket on the cliff's edge and called police. Avon Coroner's Court heard today that post-mortem examinations had been carried out on both the mother and daughter by a Home Office-registered pathologist, but further tests were required. No members of Ms Bevan's family were present at the 10-minute hearing, which was opened by Assistant Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing. He told the court there would be 'separate and distinct' inquests into the deaths of the mother and daughter. 'But given the circumstances of which their deaths occurred it was appropriate to deal with matters at the same time,' he added. Coroner's officer Alex Basson said Ms Bevan was pronounced dead by a paramedic at 9.17pm on December 3 in the Avon Gorge. She was believed to have been be suffering from depression, schizophrenia and severe sleep deprivation when she left the hospital and had reportedly stopped taking medication so that she could breastfeed when her child arrived. The new mother and her baby were found in a gully at the foot of Avon Gorge, an inquest in Bristol heard . Officers descended into the Avon Gorge while searching for the baby as a sniffer dog team worked below . 'She was identified by her uncle to a detective constable,' Mr Basson told the hearing at Flax Bourton, near Bristol. 'The circumstances surrounding her death were that the deceased had recently given birth to a baby daughter and was seen on CCTV to leave St Michael's Hospital in Bristol with child on December 2. 'Her lifeless body and that of her child, also lifeless, was later found following a police search in a gully in Avon Gorge having apparently fallen.' Mr Basson said Zaani was born on November 28 and she was confirmed dead by a paramedic at the Avon Gorge at 3.02pm on December 4, just six-days-old. 'She was identified by hospital wristbands to a detective constable at the Avon Gorge,' he said. 'The circumstances surrounding her death were that the deceased was found lifeless in the Avon Gorge. 'The body of her mother Charlotte Bevan was recovered nearby.' The court heard that post-mortem examinations had been carried out by Dr Russell Delaney who has provided provisional reports to the coroner. 'We await the final report subject to histology and toxicology examination,' Mr Basson added. Mr Basson also confirmed that he was not in possession of any medical cause of death relating to Zaani. 'I have spoken at length to the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Russell Jones, and clearly the investigation into the deaths of Charlotte and Zaani is well underway,' he said. 'They anticipate having their investigative report available in about eight weeks' time.' The court heard that the reports from Ms Bevan's GP and both the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, who had dealings with her, and the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, which runs St Michael's Hospital, had been requested. Dr Harrowing said the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) had recently updated its guidelines for health professionals working with pregnant women who were at risk of mental health problems. Police launched a city-wide search for Ms Bevan and her daughter and found their bodies at Avon Gorge . Ms Bevan (pictured left with partner Pascal Malbrouck and right in the late stages of her pregnancy) had reportedly stopped taking her depression medication so she could breastfeed when her baby arrived . 'I think it is important that we ensure that both the mental health partnership and the University Hospitals Bristol address those guidelines in the reports they prepare,' he said. 'They should be able to provide information and evidence of how those guidelines were applied in respect of Charlotte Bevan.' The coroner said that for the resumed hearing he would be making Ms Bevan's partner, Pascal Malbrouck, her mother Rachel Fortune, and the two health trusts 'interested parties'. A provisional date for the full hearing was fixed for April 16 and could run into a second day, the court heard. Adjourning the hearing, Dr Harrowing added: 'The family are not in attendance at this opening today but they are fully aware of today's hearing and understandably chose not to attend.' Paying tribute after the deaths, Ms Bevan's mother said: 'My beautiful daughter and granddaughter are now at peace.' A funeral for Ms Bevan and baby Zaani will be held at Christ Church in Clifton at 1pm on Friday. Her family has asked those attending to wear bright clothing and not to bring any cut flowers. A private cremation will take place for family only following the funeral.","Charlotte Bevan, from Bristol, carried daughter Zaani Tiana out of hospital .

"A mass grave of 230 bodies has been uncovered in Syria after Islamic State militants are believed to have slaughtered members of a tribe who tried to fight back. Relatives of the dead, who were from the Shaitaat tribe, discovered the burial site in the country's eastern Deir el-Zour province, a monitoring group said today. The grim discovery brings the number of tribe members killed during the jihadists' summer advance in the province, which is close to the border with Iraq to more than 900, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Scroll down for video . A mass grave of 230 bodies has been uncovered in Deir el-Zour, Syria after Islamic State militants are believed to have slaughtered members of a tribe who tried to fight back. Pictured is an alleged IS execution carried out in the Salaheddin province . 'The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has learned from trusted sources that more than 230 bodies have been found in a mass grave in the desert near Al-Kashkiyeh in the east of Deir el-Zour,' said the Britain-based group. It said the 'vast majority' of the dead were civilians, and that many of them had been executed in cold blood after the tribe rose up against ISIS fighters, having already driven out rival jihadists and rebels from the area. Hundreds more members of the Shaitaat tribe, which numbers around 70,000, are still missing, said the Observatory, which relies on a large network of activists, doctors and military sources on all sides of the Syrian conflict for its reports. According to the jihadists' rules, anyone who fights back is considered a heretic and should be executed. Pictured is an execution in a town near Baghdad, Iraq, in October . Tribespeople discovered the grave as they returned to their villages after months of displacement having lost their battle against ISIS. They were allowed to return only after agreeing to respect an IS-imposed curfew, as well as a ban on gatherings and having weapons. According to the jihadists' rules, anyone who fights back is considered a heretic and should be executed. Islamic State militants control all but a few pockets of Deir al-Zour province, which borders territory also under its control in Iraq. The province's oilfields have been a major source of revenue for the group although its operations have been under pressure since a U.S.-led coalition started launching air strikes against it in Syria in September. Islamic State militants control all but a few pockets of Deir al-Zour province, which borders territory also under its control in Iraq . In August, activists said the militant group had killed some 700 members of the Sheitaat tribe - the majority of them civilians - over the preceding two weeks after conflict flared when the militants took over two oilfields. The Observatory, which has tracked violence on all sides of the nearly four-year-old conflict, said beheadings were used to kill many of the tribe's members. Islamic State fighters are currently battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces near Deir el-Zour city for a military air base that is one of the government's last strongholds in the country's east.","Relatives of the dead, from the Shaitaat tribe, discovered the bodies .

"King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have unveiled the design for their first Christmas card since  taking the Spanish throne in June this year. The cover of the magenta  card features a snap of the royal couple standing on the balcony of the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid with a crowd of well-wishers below. Inside, there is a family photo, with the couple joined by their two daughters, eight-year-old Infanta Leonor and seven-year-old Infanta Sofia. Scroll down for video . Merry Christmas, Spanish style: The interior of the card features a charming family photograph . There is also a message written in both Spanish and English, which reads: 'Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2015. 'We hope that the excitement, the hope, and the goodwill of Christmas remain beyond these days of celebration.' Princess Leonor, who will one day be Queen of Spain,  signed the card with her official  title, Princesa de Asturias - the designation once held by her father. Since taking the throne last June, King Felipe has been taking his new role extremely seriously, attending official events several times a week. Earlier this week,  Letizia, 42, and  Felipe, 46, attended a function held to honour members of the Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas - the Spanish cinema association. This is not the first time the Spanish royals, who are currently in mourning for the late Queen Fabiola of Belgium, have shown their support for the arts in recent months. Greetings: The front features a snap of the royal couple on the balcony of the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid . Letizia in particular is known to be a fan and travelled to Vienna at the beginning of October to open an exhibition dedicated to Spanish court painter, Diego Velázquez. Later the same week, she and King Felipe were both on hand for the launch of a new Spanish dictionary and have consistently championed the arts since ascending to the throne in June. The two have also overseen a sea-change in the way the Spanish royal family does business, with Felipe banning private employment and accepting lavish gifts last week. The new rules, which also apply to former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia, come into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'. Felipe's move comes after his father's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an €18m (£14m) yacht. Royal duties: Letizia, 42, and  Felipe, 46, attend an event held to honour the Spanish cinema association . Fortuna, which Juan-Carlos was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity, became a regular plaything of the Spanish royals, who used it during summer holidays in Mallorca. Felipe's new-look Spanish monarchy is closer in style to the Scandinavian system, which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles. As part of his drive to modernise the institution, the 46-year-old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.' Despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their British and Spanish counterparts, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish monarchs and their families do accept gifts, although like the British royals, most have to be declared. Signed, sealed, delivered: Princess Leonor, left, signed the card with her official title, Princesa de Asturias . Busy year: The family on the balcony during Felipe's coronation ceremony on June 19 in Madrid, Spain . In the case of the UK royal family, gifts either become part of the Royal Collection and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution. Although the Queen is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like Juan-Carlos, she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits, including a collection of shells, a set of lacrosse sticks, sunglasses, a pair of sandals, pineapples, eggs, a box of snail shells, a grove of maple trees, a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns. The Queen has also been given a number of horses, among them her Trooping the Colour mount, Burmese, and a series of exotic animals, including a canary, jaguars, sloths and an elephant called Jumbo - all of which were given to London Zoo.","Royal couple's first Christmas card since taking the Spanish throne .

"The evidence was there in front of me — stark, incontrovertible and shocking — but I still found it hard to take in. There on my computer screen, a familiar face swam into view. It belonged to Sarah Leacy, the carer who looked after my 90-year-old mum; the person in whom I invested my absolute trust. My mum is vulnerable: she has dementia. But she is sociable and loves companionship. In the background, against the babble of her TV, I heard her voice drift in from the sitting room, raised in friendly chat. Scroll down for video . Annemarie Flanagan (right) with her mother Monica (left) in happier times. Monica, 90, suffers from Dementia and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three years ago . Then Sarah’s face filled the screen. I watched her potter around the kitchen, and winced at the haphazard way she made mum’s sandwich — daubing butter carelessly on the bread, then tearing a sheet of plastic wrap with her teeth, to cover it. But what happened next was chilling, heart-stopping. Sarah continued to chat to mum but, as she did so, I watched as in one deft movement she took a cash box from a cupboard, unlocked it, snatched a £10 note from it and stuffed it into her bra. I felt a giddy mix of nausea and relief. My mum’s carer was a thief. And now, after a year, we finally had the evidence, caught on film by a hidden camera I had installed in Mum’s kitchen, to convict her. Our mum Monica had relinquished control of her finances to us, her four children, when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s three years ago, after Dad died: she knew nothing about the cash box from which we took money to buy her groceries, and we’d given no one permission to help themselves from it. Monica's carer, Sarah Leacy, 33 was caught on hidden camera stealing from the elderly woman but denied the charges in court even after the footage was shown . So when money began to go missing — £10 one week, £20 the next; about £300 in all was unaccounted for — I turned detective and installed the hidden camera in Mum’s kitchen. Now here it was: evidence that the thief who had so grotesquely abused the trust of a defenceless elderly woman was her carer. We could finally go to the police. Last week, at Wimbledon magistrates’ court, Leacy, 33, was sentenced to 80 hours’ unpaid community work and ordered to pay £700 costs after being found guilty on two counts of theft. She had denied the charges; what struck me was the act she put on. She hobbled into the witness box — a stout and robust-looking young woman with her fair hair scraped into a ponytail, but holding her back as if it ached, and sighing heavily. When arrested, she had the temerity to swear on her ‘nan and granddad’s ashes’ that she had not taken the money. The evidence from the hidden camera was, however, irrefutable. When she was shown it by the police, Leacy had burst into tears. Even then, she did not admit the truth, claiming instead that she’d taken the cash to buy groceries for our mother in Sainsbury’s. The police had continued to press her: would CCTV footage from the supermarket corroborate this? Leacy was cornered. All she could do was bluster about having been ‘confused’. Her brazenness was outrageous. I watched her in court with disbelief. She did not react when she was convicted, but my relief was profound, and I still feel a burning anger that a woman so lacking in scruples could have so flagrantly exploited such a kind and defenceless elderly woman. Leacy, 33, sentenced last week, at Wimbledon magistrates’ court, (pictured) she was sentenced to 80 hours unpaid community work and made to pay £700 costs after being found guilty on two counts of theft. Leacy had been helping Mum, who lived in a flat in a sheltered housing complex in Putney, South-West London, since October 2013. We’d realised — me, my geophysicist brother Stephen, 56, my sisters Eileen, 61, a surveyor, and Patricia, 59, a headteacher — that Mum’s mental acuity had declined sharply. The decline had happened since my dad, Tom, died in 2011 at 90. Mum was at a loss; he’d been her companion for more than 60 years. They met through their church social club after the war when Mum was a telephonist at Manchester Airport and he was an engineer. When she was diagnosed in October 2011 with Alzheimer’s, it didn’t come as a surprise. Even so, we were reassured by her doctors that, as long as she had help, she would be fine to live on her own. The carer (pictured) had been working with Monica since October 2013 but it wasn't until early this year that the family began to suspect that she was taking money from her employer . So we found a flat for her, near Eileen, Stephen and me, and one or other of us would call round most days in the week. But Mum, also needed a daily visit from a carer. And this was how Sarah Leacy insinuated herself into a position of trust. She was employed by an agency, and although Mum remained in many ways independent, she relied on her carer to administer her medication, make her a meal and clean her flat. Whenever I encountered Sarah, she seemed nice enough, but would gripe about the agency, claiming ‘they expect too much’. Actually, I felt sorry for her and empathised about the stress of the job. Because of Mum’s Alzheimer’s, power of attorney for both financial and welfare matters had been signed over to Stephen and Eileen. Apart from her purse, which contained a few coins, Mum had no dealings with money. Because of this, we kept small sums in the flat for anything we might need to buy for her. And each time we visited her, my siblings and I would email each other with details about how she was doing and what we had bought. Occasionally, we would forget and sometimes there was confusion as to how much had been left. We were not suspicious at first, but decided we needed something more secure, so replaced the envelope with a cash tin with a key that was kept on a different shelf in the cupboard. In the early part of this year, we started noticing the money wasn’t totally accounted for. Sometimes it was as it should be, other days I would email my brother and sister and ask: ‘Did you say you left £50? There’s only £40 now.’ After a few such queries, the truth dawned: money was disappearing. Given that Mum wasn’t aware of the box, she wasn’t taking it. The incidences were increasing. With no evidence, we knew the police wouldn’t be able to do anything. I decided to turn detective and install a hidden camera. I came across details for The London Spy Shop, which sells such devices, so phoned them to ask advice. As I told a member of staff what was going on, I burst into tears. ‘Someone is stealing from my mum,’ I sobbed. ‘She’s 90 and has Alzheimer’s, I don’t know what to do.’ The voice at the other end was calm and reassuring. After discussing various options, we settled on a small camera. It was installed in Mum’s galley kitchen, where we kept the cash box. As days then weeks went by, I became more and more frustrated — money was going missing, but the camera wasn’t recording it. Sometimes the device hadn’t worked, other days I had taken it home to recharge it. By June this year, I was getting disheartened and the family discussed removing the cash tin. But that would have meant capitulation. We would never find out who the offender was. Even when the evidence began building up, I failed to believe what was unfolding before my eyes. The first clear CCTV clip I saw revealed Leacy opening a cupboard door. I heard the cash tin rattle. But, perhaps, she was retrieving something for Mum? Next, I moved the camera to the top of the fridge. Just a couple of days later came indisputable evidence on film. Leacy openly stole cash from Monica, 90, . There was Sarah talking to my mum, getting her tea ready, and brazenly stealing from the cash box. Shoving £10 into her bra as she continued to chat amicably. Though justice has now prevailed, I still feel deep anger and disquiet. How dare a woman, whose job it is to care, so flagrantly abuse her position of trust. As for Mum, she is unaware of what has gone on and now has a lovely new carer — a lady in her 60s called Jan — who deserves the title. And while I fervently hope nobody else is exploited so ruthlessly, my suspicion is that many vulnerable elderly are being fleeced as my Mum was. So my message, I’m afraid, is a cynical one: do not be too trusting. Don’t assume all carers worthy of their job description.","Annemarie Flanagan set up hidden cameras in her mother's home .

"Prisoners in a new 'superjail' will have a choice of Christmas dinners costing taxpayers more than the food given to patients at nearby hospitals, it has emerged. Inmates at the £150million HMP Grampian, in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, will be tucking into chicken Balmoral and chocolate gateau on Christmas Day at a cost of £2.47 per prisoner. Patients in NHS Grampian hospitals have just 89p spent on them for a two-course meal on average - although it does rise to £2.17 on December 25. Inmates at the £150million HMP Grampian, in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, will be tucking into Chicken Balmoral and chocolate gateau on Christmas Day at a cost of £2.47 per prisoner . While taxpayers will pay £2.47 per prisoner per meal at the £150million HMP Grampian (pictured), patients in NHS Grampian hospitals will have just £2.17 spent on their Christmas meals . The difference in price has already been branded 'bizarre' by campaigners. Eben Wilson, of TaxpayerScotland, said: 'This bizarre revelation just shows us the level of control the state has on our money. 'Obviously, we would like to think that patients would be treated more favourably at Christmas than convicted criminals. 'It seems like it is the season of goodwill for some men and not others.' Prisoners were given menu sheets covering four days - Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year's Day and January 2. On December 25 they will have the choice of either chicken Balmoral or a mushroom, brie and hazelnut wellington for their main course. Their brightly coloured menus feature pictures of Father Christmas, holly, sheep and bells with space at the top for the prisoner to write in their name, number and which wing they live in. Inmates were also handed a wordsearch with movie titles to keep them occupied in their cells. For their Boxing Day meal, they can choose between a burger, a pizza, lasagne or curry. The New Year's Day selection features either a steak pie or a nut roast slice. For their Boxing Day meal (left), they can choose between a burger, a pizza, lasagne or curry. A menu for January 2 (right) features a kebab, fish cakes, ginger sponge  and macaroni cheese . The cost of hospital patients food on Christmas Day rises to £2.17 for the main meal of the day with patients offered the choice of four dishes, including turkey with trimmings. In the evening, a cold buffet style tea is provided for patients at a food cost of approximately £1.79 each. Peterhead councillor Alan Buchan, a vocal critic of the prison, said: 'Peterhead has six of ten of the most deprived areas of Aberdeenshire in it including the most deprived area. 'I have constituents who can't afford to switch on the heating never mind eat all this fancy food. 'Meanwhile, these prisoners get underfloor heating, football pitches, a gym and all the comforts of home. 'It's ridiculous that the poorest people are treated worse than criminals.' However, a prison source has revealed that some prisoners are complaining that sex offenders and violent criminals are getting the same treats as them. The source said: 'Lots of these guys inside are happy being locked up because they get three square meals a day and usually a better telly than at home. 'They know they have it better than if they were on the dole outside - they read the papers and know about the poverty in the UK.

Inmates were also handed a wordsearch with movie titles to keep them occupied in their cells . 'They wouldn't get chicken Balmoral on Christmas day if they were just getting benefits.' But Margaret Mitchell MSP, Tory justice spokesperson, defended the costs as 'reasonable'. She said: 'There could be many mitigating factors simply by the fact that ill people can't eat as much as those who are well. 'Prison has to be as much about rehabilitation as punishment and giving the prisoners the odd special day is a key part to reintegrating them into society.' A spokeswoman from the Scottish Prison Service said: 'All offenders are offered the same choices, these can vary depending on the establishment. 'The average cost per adult prisoner per day which is £2.47 per day - young offenders get slightly more at £2.75.' The latest revelation about life inside Scotland's newest prison comes just days after it was revealed that nearly 300 complaints had been made by inmates since it opened in March.

"The spiritual leader described Britain's position as 'realistic', but added that the free world has a 'moral responsibility' to bring democracy to China . The British government needs Chinese money and is too scared to confront the communist state for fear of losing trade, according to the Dalai Lama. Speaking about recent anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the Buddhist spiritual leader said Britain's lack of intervention was because 'the British government’s pocket is more or less empty'. While he conceded that this approach was 'realistic', he also said that the West has a 'moral responsibility' to help bring democracy to China. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: 'China, economically, very much wants to join the mainstream of the world economy. They are most welcome. 'At the same time the free world has a moral responsibility to bring China into the mainstream of democracy. China’s own people also want that … so therefore I think the whole world’s future has to be freedom and democracy. 'I think the free world has certain responsibilities to stand firm over democracy and the rule of law and the freedom of the press.' Hong Kong police have just finished clearing the last student protesters from the city's financial district after the largest demonstrations China has seen since Tiananmen Square in 1989. The activists were demanding freedom to chose their own candidates in upcoming local government elections, taking control of the process away from the regime in Beijing. The Dalai Lama used to be bitterly opposed to China, having been forced to flee the country into exile in 1959 after a failed revolution. However, since then his stance has softened and he now advocates a 'middle way' with Chinese authorities which would see Tibet become autonomous, but remain part of China. The Dalai Lama added that he may not have a successor after he dies, saying he would prefer that the position dies with him, rather than passing to a 'stupid' successor . The Dalai Lama also suggested he may be the last Tibetan spiritual leader and would rather the post faded into history than be passed to a 'stupid' successor. He added that it will be 'up to the Tibetan people' to decide what happens after his death, a remark sure to anger China, which insists it has the right to chose his successor. He said: 'The Dalai Lama institution will cease one day. These man-made institutions will cease. 'There is no guarantee that some stupid Dalai Lama won't come next, who will disgrace himself or herself. That would be very sad. 'Much better that a centuries-old tradition should cease at the time of a quite popular Dalai Lama.' He also noted that the position no longer holds political responsibility, as that was passed to an elected leader of the Tibetan government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, in 2011. Tibetan Buddhists believe the position of Dalai Lama is passed from one man to the next through reincarnation, with the previous leader's spirit reborn into a new body. The current Dalai Lama, the 14th to hold the title, fled into exile from China in 1959 after a failed uprising. He did chose his own successor in 1995, but China put the boy under house arrest and replaced him . After the Dalai Lama dies it is traditionally left to the High Lamas to hunt for his successor, which can take years and involves intense meditation, with the new leader often revealed in a vision. The current Dalai Lama, real name Tenzin Gyatso, is the 14th to hold the title and took four years to discover, being made leader at just 15 years old. He did name his own successor, known as the Penchen Lama, in 1995, but China placed the boy under house arrest and put another in his place. It is not known where the Dalai Lama's choice currently is, or whether he is even alive. Since then, the Dalai Lama has changed his position, saying he will not be reborn in Tibet as long as the Chinese regime is in power, saying Beijing has no right to chose a leader 'for political ends.'","Spiritual leader says British government's 'pocket is more or less empty'

"Police bail will be capped at 28 days to end people languishing in legal limbo. Paul Gambaccini (pictured) was held on pre-charge bail for 12 months before being told he would face no further action . Police bail is to be capped at 28 days to end the 'scandal' of people languishing in a legal limbo. Ministers will today set out plans to reform the law which means there is currently no restriction on the amount of time that police can keep someone on pre-charge bail. Lawyers and campaigners have warned that innocent people are being waiting for years before seeing their cases being dropped or thrown out of court. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has led demands for a change in the law in Cabinet talks. The Home Office will today set out two options for reform, both of which will mean a magistrate having to approve bail of more than three months and a judge in a Crown Court having to agree to it being extended beyond a year. There is a coalition split over how to reform shorter bail periods, however. Conservative ministers are understood to be arguing that after a police inspector puts someone on bail up to 28 days, a chief superintendent should then be able to extend it to three months. Liberal Democrats, however, say the power to keep people on bail beyond 28 days should be removed from police altogether and a magistrate should have to sign off an extension to a period up to three months. Pre-charge bail was introduced in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which gave police the power to put someone who has been arrested under bail while they gather additional evidence. Before the change, people suspected of crimes had to be held in prison while officers investigated allegations against them. However, there is no time limit on pre-charge bail as the law stands – meaning police can roll it on for months or even years while they determine whether they can gather enough evidence to persuade prosecutors to bring charges. Civil liberty campaigners say the law has increasingly been abused, leaving people in limbo for months and undermining the principle that they are 'innocent until proven guilty'. People caught up in long-running police bail can lose their careers and have the fear of potential charges hanging over them with no known decision date. Of around 70,000 people are currently on pre-charge bail in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, more than 5,000 are thought to have been on bail for more than six months. The issue has gained prominence because of a number of high-profile cases including that of DJ Paul Gambaccini, who was held on pre-charge bail for 12 months over alleged historical sex offences before being told that there was no basis for further action. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) has led demands for a change in the law in Cabinet talks, and senior Tories including former Home Office minister Damian Green (right) have backed the campaign . Some journalists accused of phone hacking, meanwhile, have been left on police bail for more than two years. Senior Tories have backed the calls for a change in the law, including Damian Green, a former Home Office minister, David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, and Sir Edward Garnier, the former solicitor general. They signed a campaign letter earlier this month which warned: 'Innocent people have been left on pre-charge bail for years before their cases have been dropped or thrown out of court. 'This is a scandal. Those on it have their careers put on hold. The mental anguish of not knowing what will happen to them is in itself a form of punishment without trial: The weight of suspicion grows heavier with each day. 'All these individuals are innocent until proven guilty. It is a fundamental axiom that justice delayed is justice denied.' The Home Office will today announce a consultation on bringing in a 28-day cap on the amount of time someone can be held on police bail without approval from the authorities, a Government source said. 'There is going to be a statutory limit,' the source added. 'There are going to be two models: either a chief superintendent or a magistrate will have to sign off bail up to three months, and then a magistrate will have to be persuaded of the case up to 12 months and a Crown Court judge beyond that. 'There may have to be exemptions for complex fraud cases, tax evasion or historical sex abuse cases which can take a long time to investigate. 'But it can't be right that people are spending months and years waiting to find out they are never going to be charged.' Law Society president Andrew Caplen said people are often left 'in the wilderness' while police decide whether they should be charged with a crime. 'The Law Society has been calling for a statutory limit on length of time the police are able to keep suspects on bail, often with conditions, before they are charged with a criminal offence,' he said. 'Not only does keeping someone on police bail interfere with their liberty; it also means that police investigations can be protracted and slow, making the justice system less efficient and with a negative effect on complainants and witnesses. We support there being a statutory limit of 28 days, after which the police should apply to a magistrate for an extension where this can be shown to be necessary.'","Campaigners have warned  people can be  on pre-charge bail for years .

"A policewoman who used the force database 'like Google' to leak information about the manhunt for police killer Dale Cregan to her  sister has been jailed. PC Katie Murray wept as she was jailed for almost three years after accessing confidential information about the pursuit to trade as 'gossip.' The 29-year-old even sent her sister, Lindsey, the name and picture of one of the two women police officers shot dead by the one-eyed killer, three hours before they were formally identified at a news conference. In a WhatsApp message between the pair, Lindsey said: 'Oh my God, I can't believe this s***, you better come here after work and fill me in' only for Murray to reply: 'I don't really know anything. He he'. Police constable Katie Murray, 29, (pictured left) was jailed for nearly three years for leaking confidential information about the manhunt for police killer Dale Cregan to her gossip loving sister, Lindsey (pictured right). Lindsey Murray, 33, was jailed for six months . Dale Cregan is serving a whole life sentence for the gun and grenade ­killings of PCs Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, in 2012, and a gangland double murder . The officer, who had been with Greater Manchester Police since 2004, later filmed Cregan as he arrived at Newton Heath Police Station for interview. In the clip she could be heard repeating 'Oh my God, oh my god,' as the killer was being transferred after handing himself in. Cregan is currently serving a whole life sentence for the gun and grenade ­killings of PCs Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, in 2012, and a gangland double murder . Hospital worker Lindsey, said to be a habitual gossiper, was said to have passed on the sensitive material given to her by her sister. Eight days after the serial killer carried out his second of four murders, she told a friend: ''Talking to Kate last night, I know the full story about Cregan x' She was said to have provided details of the case and future police tactics concluding: 'keep it to yourself though. They are all targets our Kate said.' At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, the sisters, both of Droylsden, were both convicted misconduct in a public office after a trial. Katie was jailed for two years nine months and Lindsay was jailed for six months. Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Foster QC told the women: 'Katie and Lindsay Murray, until this event you had both done well with your lives, both had responsible jobs and many people spoke well of you. But as sisters you have one thing in common. You both failed to recognise or respect the boundaries between right and wrong. 'Katie Murray you have fallen from grace and you have compromised the confidence of the public in the integrity of the police force. You have affected the reputation of the vast majority of serving police offices and made it less likely members of the public with cooperate with them. 'You knew your sister was a habitual gossiper and was likely to pass on information to others outside confidence. You used the police computer as if you were accessing Google.' The court heard the WPC had once been in a relationship with cannabis dealer Jason Lloyd, 44, and also used the force database to get confidential information to him about police investigations into his criminality over a 20 month period. But Nick Clarke QC prosecuting said: 'She also misused police systems to gain and provide information to friends and family members without any lawful policing purposes. 'Lindsey has requested Katie to check police systems and provide information to her regarding other individuals and incidents known to her. 'There was no proper policing purpose for such inquiries and no legitimate basis for the dissemination of the information.' Leaks by Katie included details of the investigations into the murders by Cregan of Mark Short, 28, who was shot dead at The Cotton Tree Pub in Ashton-under-Lyne on May 25 2012 and father David Short, 46, who was killed in a gun and grenade attack at his home on August 10 2012. When Cregan and another suspect were initially arrested and questioned and bailed on their return from Thailand on June 12 2012, Katie reviewed the arrests and looked at their custody records. PC Katie Murray also shared information with her ex-boyfriend Jason Lloyd . The QC added: 'Lindsey is also very interested in the information that can be obtained from Katie. 'Examination of call data, text and 'What App' messages between Katie, Lindsey and associates has established that Katie divulged to her sister information regarding the murder investigations including the hunt for Dale Cregan and his associates, their arrest and custody process. 'Lindsey was aware that Jason Lloyd was in contact with the Cregan family..' Mr Clarke said when the two policewomen were killed on September 18 2012, Katie was not assigned to the investigation team - yet sent a picture of WPC Nicola at 12.53pm three hours ahead of the Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy naming the dead office during a news conference. The prosecutor said: 'Not only did she constantly monitor the incident logs and activity as shown on the police computers, she was also contacting her sister, then almost immediately afterwards Lloyd. 'Katie Murray calls Mr Lloyd at the time the news is breaking so she can talk to him about developments. Lindsey Murray is clearly very interested in what's going on. 'In a WhatsApp message she said 'Oh my God, I can't believe this s***, you better come here after work and fill me in'. Clearly, Lindsey knows Katie has inside information and Lindsey is not interested in news bulletins but a greater degree of interest in private information. 'Katie replied: 'I don't really know anything. He he'. We suggest the impression of that is that she did, because she has been monitoring the police systems all day. 'She even released a picture of one of the murdered officers before that unfortunate officer had been publicly named by police. 'We are sure that you will be aware how sensitively and carefully controlled the release of such information has to be, to ensure that families are first told through appropriate official channels, other than reading about it on Twitter or through some other gossip based system of information leak - which is what was instigated by Katie that day.' 'Katie went on to video the arrival of Cregan at her police station and to immediately publish that to her sister ad the continued to relay the progress of the investigation and whereabouts of members of the Cregan family..' Police constable Fiona Bone,32, (pictured left) and police constable Nicola Hughes, 23, (pictured right) were both killed by Dale Cregan on a routine call . Murray was found out when police seized Lloyd's mobile phone following the Cregan murders and texts on his mobile phone was examined. 'When police raided Katie's home, they found an envelope of letters written to her from Lloyd which she kept in the drawer of her bedside cabinet. In mitigation Murray's defence counsel Rick Holland said: 'Despite the fact she was a police officer for ten years, nothing can prepare her for the rigours of the custodial regime that awaits her. 'She was profoundly upset when those two officers died as were all the officers. She didn't take the images from the internal computers, the information was obtained and she shared their details from Facebook. 'There was a language used that was contemptuous of Cregan and others. She described the day she was arrested as the worst in her life. She is utterly ruined now.' James Harrison, representing Lindsay Murray said: 'She was receiving information from police computers out of curiosity. It was a sustained course of misguided curiosity. She says she was like a member of neighbourhood watch.'

"The earning power generated by some university courses is so low and student debt so high that pupils would be better off choosing apprenticeships, new research suggested today(THUR). Findings showed sharp variations in the graduate earnings premium depending on the university and course chosen. With student debt now averaging £44,000, industry apprenticeships would be a ‘better deal’ for many pupils than costly degrees, according to the charity behind the study. The Sutton Trust said some youngsters ‘may be better earning and learning on good apprenticeships than on a degree course with poor prospects’. Scroll down for video . Industry apprenticeships would be a 'better deal' for many pupils than costly degrees, according to the Sutton Trust . The claim came as the trust published a new study showing that students who go to Oxford and Cambridge enjoy starting salaries £7,600 higher than counterparts who go to so-called ‘new’ universities. The Oxbridge premium drops only marginally to £4,760 when the prior A-level grades of students and their social background are taken into account. Differences by degree subject were found to be even larger, with medicine and dentistry graduates attracting starting salaries £12,200 higher than those who studied design and creative arts. Sir Peter Lampl, the trust’s chairman, said the research showed that ‘not all degrees are created equal’. The figures underlined the ‘importance of choosing the right degree and course’. He said: ‘It may not surprise anyone that an Oxbridge graduate on average commands a higher salary than someone from a newer university, but a £7,500 (42 per cent) difference which only falls to just under £5,000 allowing for social background and prior attainment is a bigger difference than many might have expected. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said the research showed that 'not all degrees are created equal' And he added: ‘With debts of £44,000 on average, returns from some degrees may mean going into a good apprenticeship offers a better deal for many students.’ Sir Peter went on: ‘We need to look honestly at the extent to which some young people may be better earning and learning on good apprenticeships than on a degree course with poor prospects.’ He called for ‘many more high level apprenticeships for that to be a real option’. The research used official data to examine the differences in the starting salaries of recent graduates and their earnings three-and-a-half years after finishing their studies. It found that the average starting salary for a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge was around £25,600 - £7,600 higher than the equivalent wage for students who went to a ‘new’ university created after 1992. The Oxbridge earnings premium compared with other, more established universities was smaller but still apparent. Oxbridge graduates earned £3,300 more than their counterparts who attended other highly-selective British universities, it emerged. After allowing for their previous achievement and background, Oxbridge graduates still took home £4,760 more than fellow students who went to new universities – and £2,500 more than graduates of other top institutions. The subjects with the highest earnings premium emerged as medicine and dentistry, engineering and technology, economics, computer science and education. The lowest salaries were earned by graduates in psychology, English, design and creative arts, biological sciences and history and philosophy. In a further finding, more evidence was uncovered of the earnings premium enjoyed by private school pupils. They earned starting salaries £1,350 higher than counterparts from state schools with the same degree from the same university. Other than this, university tended to act as a ‘social leveller’. Graduates from different backgrounds tended to do equally well after graduation. Sir Peter said there was ‘no link’ between the cost of a degree and its later value in the job market. He added: ‘This new research shows how important it is that we enable low and middle income students with the ability to go to Oxbridge and other elite universities to fulfil their potential. ‘With your chances of going to a top university nearly 10 times higher if you come from a rich rather than a poor neighbourhood, it is vital that we redouble our efforts to improve access to these institutions.’ Under reforms in 2012, maximum tuition fees tripled to £9,000-a-year and the available Government-backed loans rose accordingly. A real interest rate was also applied for the first time and graduates must start repaying once their annual incomes reach £21,000. Previous research has shown that 73 per cent of graduates will still be paying back their student loans after 30 years. They will take so long to repay their university loans they will qualify for their debts to be written off after three decades – when most will be at least 52.","Sutton Trust says some youngsters may be better off on apprenticeships .

"Scott Brown has insisted Aleksandar Tonev retains the full support of the Celtic dressing room — despite the Bulgarian being hit with a seven-match ban for racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan. The 24-year-old winger, on loan from Aston Villa, was hammered by an SFA judicial panel last week over the incident. Celtic officially appealed against the decision and, as things stand, the player is free to play against the Dons at Pittodrie on Sunday lunchtime. No date has yet been set by the SFA for the Appellate Tribunal. Speaking for the first time about the matter in Bucharest, skipper Brown was adamant that all of Tonev’s team-mates remain squarely behind him. Celtic assistant manager John Collins (right) speaks to Aleksandar Tonev during a Celtic training session . ‘We’ll stick by him as we know he didn’t say it — that’s the main thing,’ Brown said. ‘I didn’t think he needed to explain himself. We know he didn’t say it. We know he doesn’t come in and lie. ‘He speaks to everyone in the changing room.’ Having been rested against Inverness at the weekend because he was not mentally ready, Tonev travelled with Celtic to Romania. Manager Ronny Deila looks set to use him at some stage against Astra — but cast doubt on whether he would ask him to play against Aberdeen. Tonev trained with Celtic in Salzburg as they prepare for Thursday's Champions League match . ‘We have made the appeal and there is nothing new there,’ Deila said. ‘We believe he is innocent and that it is word against word. We are going to support him. ‘I think Europe is easier for him to play in than Scotland, but this has had an effect on him. It would have on anybody and I feel sorry for him. It is a very hard thing to be accused of. But we are supporting him and I think he will be ready for the game.’ Asked if he’d consider fielding him at Pittodrie on Sunday, Deila said: ‘We’ll see.’ Meanwhile, the Celtic manager insisted he has no concerns about throwing Stefan Scepovic in  after Anthony Stokes pulled out of the trip through illness.

The Irishman checked in at Glasgow Airport but was told to go home after being assessed by the club doctor. With John Guidetti ineligible for the match in Giurgiu, Scepovic is set to get the nod for the central striking berth ahead of Leigh Griffiths. ‘I’m confident Stefan can come in and do well,’ Deila said. ‘I think he’s played well lately and he’s desperate to play. So that’s good. ‘You see a change in him now that he’s scored a few goals. He’s more confident and he believes there’s much more to come from him. ‘He’ll keep on working hard and look for his next chance. ‘He needs minutes, he’s scored two goals in the last three matches.

"A technical problem could set back the planned finish date for work in the main search zone for missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre said on Sunday that investigators could finish scouring the priority zone of the Indian Ocean by May if there were no delays with vessels, equipment or weather. But on Wednesday, JACC revealed the vessel Fugro Discovery had a 'system issue' with a component of the search equipment. Scroll down for video . A technical problem could set back the planned finish date for work in the main search zone for missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 . 'Search activities have been suspended while the issue is remedied,' it said. Also, JACC said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau had advised that measures to fix Fugro Discovery's problem were being trialled and the results would be reviewed. 'Until that process is complete, the extent of the issue's effect on the progress of the underwater search is unknown,' JACC said. Meanwhile, other search efforts will continue during the festive period. The Fugro Equator is scheduled to depart for Fremantle on Wednesday after finishing its current survey, and the GO Phoenix continues its underwater search. More than 200,000 sqkm has been surveyed and 11,000 sqkm of the sea floor has been searched. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre said on Sunday that investigators could finish scouring the priority zone of the Indian Ocean by May if there were no delays with vessels, equipment or weather . The latest JACC update said the survey vessel Fugro Equator was continuing to map the ocean floor and would return to Fremantle when it completes its current phase this month. About 200,000 square kilometres of the search area has been surveyed so far. Fugro Discovery arrived back in the search area on December 4, while GO Phoenix returned last Tuesday, and both have recommenced underwater search operations. Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was on the missing flight, wrote an article for the Sunday Times. She said when she and her two young children said goodbye to him they never thought it would be for the last time. Last week, families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the March 8 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing provided DNA samples to assist in identifying loved ones once the plane was found . 'But now, March 7 is permanently engraved in my mind and often on rewind,' she wrote. 'Not only as the day we kissed Paul goodbye at Perth Airport, but because mentally, for me, it is still March 7.' Ms Weeks said not knowing what really happened to her husband continued to haunt her. The Fugro Equator is scheduled to depart for Fremantle on Wednesday after finishing its current survey . 'Every waking minute, your mind runs scenarios of what might have happened,' she said. 'You are searching the news constantly for any small piece of information that may give you a clue to their whereabouts, and your heart pounds every time the phone rings. Is this it? Have they found something?' Those hunting for debris of the plane have revealed footage of what they've found on the ocean floor. Lead search agency, Australian Transport Safety Bureau, released this sonar acoustic image on Thursday of the ocean floor as teams continue to scour the Indian Ocean . The picture, released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Thursday, shows what search vessels are recording as they continue to scour the Indian Ocean for any signs of the Malaysian Airlines plane. 'The image is a synthetic aperture sonar acoustic image of the sea floor gathered by GO Phoenix. This is indicative of the resolution and quality of the data and that it is revealing important detail of the sea floor,' the ATSB, who is leading the search, said in its latest operational report. The GO Phoenix vessel returned to the area on Tuesday to recommence underwater search operations. Another vessel, Fugro Discovery, is also searching underwater as the Fugro Equator continues to conduct bathymetric survey operations in the search area. More than 9,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean floor has been searched to date, but there's been no signs of the missing Malaysian Airlines flight . 'In addition to locating the aircraft, the underwater search aims to map the MH370 debris field in order to identify and prioritise the recovery of specific aircraft components, including flight recorders, which will assist with the Malaysian investigation,' the ATSB said. 'The ATSB has utilised the data from the bathymetric survey work to prepare the initial plan for the underwater search, to be followed and referred to by all parties involved. 'The plan includes search timings, methods, procedures, safety precautions and the initial search areas for the various vessels. About 200,000 square kilometres of the search area have been surveyed via bathymetric surveying . 'The equipment used on the vessels is providing extraordinary data.' More than 9,000 square kilometres of the ocean floor has been searched to date and about 200,000 square kilometres of the search area has been surveyed, according to the ATSB.

"Gynaecologist Dr Anthony Madu, 45, worked shifts as a locum at one hospital while on paid sick leave from another . A doctor who worked shifts as a locum at one hospital while on paid sick leave from another cost the NHS £250,000. Gynaecologist Dr Anthony Madu, 45, could be struck off after he pocketed huge sums in well-paid locum work at the same time as he was receiving sick pay. The Nigerian - who pocketed a total of £100,000 as a result of the scam - had insisted he was the victim of a racist conspiracy when NHS bosses suspended him over his conduct. But he was branded ‘dishonest and irresponsible’ in court as he was found guilty of fraud. He is understood to have cost the NHS a total of £240,000 in salary and cover for his absence as he worked at hospitals across England while still officially employed by the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Prosecutor Christian Jowett told the court: ‘He was legally obliged to tell his employers about his work but he did not do so. ‘He was also legally obliged to tell two locum agencies that he was on extended leave and had been granted sickness leave. ‘But he continued to work and receive payment from both Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and his work in England. ‘This was a very costly business for the NHS and very lucrative for Dr Madu. ‘That’s why he did it. ‘Madu had been irresponsible as well as dishonest.’ During an investigation by the General Medical Council over his behaviour, Madu he told health chiefs he was the victim of a racist conspiracy. He made his discrimination claims at a tribunal after he was sacked from Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital for not informing his employers that he was under investigation for fraud. Madu told the tribunal in Newcastle that his Welsh colleagues had displayed a ‘racist attitude’ and wanted to destroy his career. He said: ‘I strongly believe if I was not of an ethnic minority this case would have been dealt with very differently.’ Nigerian-born Madu took a specialist registrar obstetrics gynaecology post at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in August 2009. But he was suspended and put on extended leave two months later over allegations about his conduct towards other staff and claims he had falsified his training record. From January 2010, he submitted sick notes signed by his GP on three different occasions, saying he could not work because of stress. Madu then made £98,904 while working for Sandwell General Hospital in Birmingham as well as Scarborough General Hospital and The Royal Oldham Hospital in Greater Manchester. Madu was signed off sick from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, pictured, but went onto work at other hospitals . The extra cost to the NHS came from paying other staff for cover, his sick pay, and administration costs. Mr Jowett said: ‘During this extended leave and sickness he continued to work as a locum doctor at hospitals in England.’ Madu, from Woolwich, London was described as being ‘nowhere near’ the level of clinical competence expected of a year five specialist registrar, and convicted of six charges of fraud. Judge David Wyn Morgan sitting at Newport Crown Court spared him an immediate jail sentence because a psychiatric report said he would be at ‘high risk’ of suicide if he was jailed. The judge told the doctor: ‘You have persuaded yourself of your innocence of these matters in the face of the evidence. ‘You are a deluded individual led astray by your misunderstanding of your real medical qualifications. ‘In pursuing a medical career in the UK you have overstretched yourself and have resorted to dishonesty to cover up your shortcomings. ‘These convictions will make it impossible for you to practice medicine in the UK ever again.’ Madu was given a 24 month prison sentence suspended for two years. He was ordered to complete 150 hours community service and will be under curfew and wear an electronic tag for three months. Madu is currently suspended by the General Medical Council, which has been engaged in a long-running legal battle with him. They have accused him of misrepresenting his postgraduate training record, behaving inappropriately to colleagues and patients, working in medicine in breach of previously imposed restrictions and failing to co-operate with investigations. Madu, who suffers with malaria, stress and depression, has contested all the allegations made by the GMC.","Gynaecologist Dr Anthony Madu, 45, pocketed £100,000 from scam .

"Todd Horsfield (pictured with his sister Elivia) accidentally hanged himself with his dressing gown rope - the same day he was named Star Pupil at school . A ten-year-old boy accidentally hanged himself with his dressing gown rope - the same day he was named 'Star Pupil' at school. Todd Horsfield was  killed after he got caught in a makeshift swing which he used while playing computer games, an inquest heard. He was discovered by his sister and despite attempts by his mother Louise to resuscitate him, he couldn't be saved. His tragic death came on the same day that Todd was feeling 'happy and proud' having been named 'Star Pupil of The Day' at Darton Primary School in South Yorkshire. An inquest yesterday, heard how after returning from school on March 24, Todd had asked to go out and play with his friends, but was told to go and tidy his room. The youngster had gone upstairs in a 'bad mood' and refused to have any tea, before swinging on the dressing gown cord, which was attached to his cabin bed. Todd, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire was discovered at around 8pm, and an ambulance was called, but he was pronounced dead in hospital at 9.30pm. His devastated family were too upset to attend the inquest hearing, but the court heard from their family liaison officer from South Yorkshire Police. Detective Constable Darren McConnell said investigations had found no suspicious circumstances  suggesting anyone else had any involvement in Todd's death and police had found nothing to suggest it had been a deliberate act. DC McConnell added that police investigations had found no issues with bullying or any other reason  to suggest Todd would want to take his own life. He told the inquest: 'My view and after speaking to my colleagues is that we believe this was an accident.' He said there was no internet access on Todd's computer games console, ruling out the influence of any website in what happened. The youngster's tragic death came on the same day that Todd was named 'Star Pupil of The Day' at Darton Primary School in South Yorkshire (pictured) 'He was a happy young boy who had no problems or issues brought to the family's attention,' DC McConnell added. 'He enjoyed his family and also enjoyed going to school.' Assistant coroner Louise Slater, recording a narrative verdict, said she was able to 'completely discount' the idea Todd had taken his life. She said: 'Todd had this swing by his bed and had been known to use it to support his body weight whilst playing on the console. 'This is a particularly tragic accident. There are no easy or pleasant inquests, but certainly ones that will stay with you longer. 'I cant imagine what grief the family has gone through. I hope my ruling gives them some comfort today.'","Todd Horsfield died after accidentally getting caught in a makeshift swing .

"Britain has been just days from a major terror attack, with five plots foiled in the last four months, Met Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe revealed today. Terrorists have been 'very close to hurting somebody badly, or killing them' since the summer and there is 'no doubt' that there are extremists in the UK as dangerous as the gunman behind the Sydney café siege, the Commissioner warned. And he claimed officers are struggling to cope with the mountain of digital files seized in police raids, with recent cases seeing terror suspects hours from being released before crucial evidence was found for them to be charged. Scroll down for video . Sir Bernard Hogan Howe warned officers are struggling to cope with the mountain of digital files seized in police raids . David Cameron last night warned Britain could be hit 'at any moment' by a Sydney-style terror attack. Two hostages died and Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis was killed after a 16-hour siege in the busy financial district of the Australian capital. The Prime Minister said it was only through the efforts of the security services that plots to murder UK police officers 'in cold blood' had been foiled in recent months. But Sir Bernard insisted that the police need extra resources to deal with the growing terror threat in Britain. In a wide-ranging interview, the country's most senior police chief: . Sir Bernard told LBC Radio: 'In terms of plots over these last four months really it's probably five. We have arrested 35 people.' The dramatic warning comes amid growing fears of a so-called lone wolf attack in the UK. In Sydney, the Iranian asylum seeker Monis struck terror into the heart of the city after taking 17 staff and customers hostages inside the Lindt cafe in Martin Place. The 50-year-old gunman is believed to have fired the first shots, which sparked teams of heavily armed police to swoop on the café at 2am on Tuesday. Asked if there were people in Britain as dangerous as Monis, Sir Bernard told LBC radio: 'There will be, there's no doubt. You look at what happened to Lee Rigby. 'There are people out there who are dangerous, and that's why we keep arresting them because we need to stop them hurting people. 'And the operations we have talked about earlier, they have been very close to hurting somebody badly, or killing them. So they are a threat. Very, very close.' Pressed on how close the plots had been to being carried out before being intercepted by police, he replied: 'I'm acknowledging days.' The 34-year-old manager of the Lindt cafe, Tori Johnson (left), and mother of three Katrina Dawson, 38 (right), have been named as the two hostages killed during the Sydney siege on Tuesday morning . Children as young as 15 are travelling to fight in Syria with ISIS extremists before trying to return to Britain, Sir Bernard Hogan Howe warned. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said that a 'handful' of people leave the UK every week intent on joining the conflict. Sir Bernard said: 'There has been a rise in the number of young people over this past 12 months. 'People have been travelling who are 16 or 18. We even had 15-year-olds, and it's changed because we have seen more young girls or women going out...15 it was a girl. 'Some have been intercepted so have been turned back from Turkey, these are the ones we know about. 'You could go to Spain and then go to Turkey and then Syria. It's not hard. The numbers are significant, and of course there are still people coming back.' He said that of 550 who have travelled to Syria, around half have returned already. There are fears that fighters who have been radicalised in Syria will carry out terror attacks in the UK. Terror suspects can be held for up to 14 days before they must be charged or released. Sir Bernard revealed: 'The last couple of case we have got right to the wire, to 13 days, I fact 13 and a half days, another one 12 days, and then we've found the thing we needed to prove the charge. 'Had we not got that we'd have had to release on bail. So for those reasons we need some help.' The government last month announced that an extra £130million would be made available over the next two years for the security services to 'monitor and disrupt those self-starting terrorists'. But Sir Bernard said Scotland Yard needed more money to cope with the rising threat level and the increasingly complex use of technology by criminals and terrorists. Police and security officials have previously warned it is 'almost inevitable' that Britain will be hit by an attack by fanatics who have been 'militarised' by Islamic State. Sir Bernard warned that have a 'radicalised individual' with weapon taking many people hostage is 'a terrifying prospect' which is 'very difficult to guard against'. He stressed that the best defence that the police has is good intelligence. 'It means members of the public tell us when they are worried about someone. Other criminals tell us when they are worried about people. 'We get some of our best information from criminals, for various motives, frankly sometimes financial, but sometimes they don't like them, sometimes they're frightened of them. 'We get the best information from people in that area.' Last night the Prime Minister warned it was much harder for the authorities to prevent attacks by fanatics who are 'self-radicalised on the internet' than to tackle known extremists who had travelled to the Middle East. Prime Minister David Cameron said Australia was a country 'very close to our hearts', and warned the attack in Sydney could be repeated in the UK . Mr Cameron, appearing before senior MPs at the Commons Liaison Committee, said: 'The threat we face definitely includes those sort of self-starting, sometimes quite random attacks that could happen at any moment in Britain. 'We've seen over the last few months there have been a series of plots that have been detected and prevented that would have seen police officers or other authorities murdered in cold blood. 'It's thanks to the brilliance of our security services that these things have been prevented.' But he added: 'We can't count on them to prevent it every time because it is one thing understanding the terror networks coming out of Pakistan or Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria, trying to monitor what they're doing, who's going and who's returning. That's one thing. 'But people who are self-radicalised on the internet, who then suddenly do appalling things, that is much more difficult to prevent.' Scotland Yard has requested an extra £50million to track and prosecute terror suspects. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe revealed he has asked the government for 'more help', including staff to trawl millions of digital files seized in counter-terror raids. He likened trying to find conclusive evidence of extremism to looking for a needle in a haystack, adding: 'The last job we had 10 haystacks and weren't sure which one the needle was in.' Police need more resources to trawl computers, laptops and mobiles seized in raids to secure a prosecution, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said . Sir Bernard said: 'Have we got enough resources? Well we have asked the government for more help. 'We are losing money, but in this area we have got to invest so we have asked for around £50milion for across the country. We are waiting for an answer on that. We need it.' He said counter-terror operations 'use lots of people' and cost a lot of money.They are resource intensive when trying to track suspects around the clock. But once someone has been arrested, officers facing a daunting task in analysing their computer files for evidence. Sir Bernard added: 'When we arrest them what we have found is we are seizing huge amounts of digital evidence, computers, laptops, all the things we all have. 'One of the operations, the last one I think, one person had about 19 devices. Now you think that's ridiculous. But you think how many devices you have at home. 'We get all that, then we've got to download it, and then having downloaded it we have got to find the stuff. 'Sometimes you are looking for a needle in a haystack. The last job we had 10 haystacks and weren't sure which one the needle was in. It's really hard. So we are getting backlogs in the digital retrieval.' The government insists that it does not break down the counter-terrorism budget into individual lump sums it is only ever published as a single total figure. Officials also refused to discuss the details of funding requests made by 'operational partners'. Mr Cameron last month announced that an extra £130million would be made available over the next two years for the security services to 'monitor and disrupt those self-starting terrorists'. The PM's official spokesman said: 'We have already protected funding for counter terrorism policing due to the ongoing threat posed to the UK by terrorism and more recently the Prime Minister announced an additional £130million to strengthen counter-terrorism capabilities. 'This will include new funding to enhance our ability to monitor and disrupt terrorists and some of this funding will go to counter-terrorism policing.' A Home Office spokesman added: 'Public protection is the first responsibility of any government and we are committed to ensuring the police and other agencies have the resources they need to respond to changing threats. 'While all public services must constrain their spending, we have protected funding for counter terrorism policing due to the ongoing threat posed to the UK by terrorism. 'The Prime Minister has also announced an additional £130million which will be made available over the next two years to strengthen counter-terrorism capabilities. This will include new funding to enhance our ability to monitor and disrupt terrorists and additional resources for programmes to prevent radicalisation.'","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe reveals scale of terror threat faced by Britain .

Owner Robin Davies said the firm usually take mobile phones from customers until they cough up, but when Jodie was reluctant to hand hers over, the driver took her tree instead. He said: 'She was in Cardigan Saturday night, Sunday morning. 'She flagged the taxi down and when the driver took her home the driver asked her for her mobile phone. 'That's what we normally do - we take the mobile phone and when they come down [to the office] on Sunday or Monday morning, they pay the fare and get their mobile phone back.

Dead: Eric Williams is charged with killing District Attorney Mike McLelland (left) and convicted of killing his wife, Cynthia (left , right). He is also charged in the death of prosecutor Mark Hasse (right) Prosecutors say Williams killed the three in a revenge plot after Hasse and McLelland prosecuted him for the theft of county equipment. He lost his job and law license as a result. Williams' estranged wife, Kim Williams, testified before closing arguments Tuesday that the couple's mood after the McClellands' killing was 'happy, joyous.' The estranged wife of a former Texas justice of the peace testified that she was a 'willing participant' in her husband's revenge killings of a district attorney, his wife and a senior prosecutor. Eric Williams was convicted December  4 in the shooting death of Cynthia McLelland. He is also charged, but has not been tried, in the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and assistant prosecutor Mark Hasse. Kim Williams is also charged in the slayings. She testified for more than two hours Tuesday about her role in the murder plot. 'His anger was my anger,' she said. Her testimony indicates she drove the getaway car in Hasse's slaying and helped to dispose of the weapons used in the killing of the McLellands at their home east of Dallas. 'His anger was my anger': Kim Williams, the estranged wife of Eric Williams, testifies in court on Tuesday and says she was a 'willing participant' in her husband's revenge killings . She said Eric Williams had a hit list that included former state District Judge Glen Ashworth and Kaufman County District Attorney Erleigh Norville Wiley. 'He told me if he ever decided to take everybody out, he was going to kill me too and then kill himself,' she said. With Kim Williams' assistance, prosecutors have a gun linked to Hasse's death and a mask believed to have been worn by the gunman. Williams said she has no deal with prosecutors but is hoping for some lenience when she's tried for the murders. 'I'm hoping for some consideration,' she said.

"A Melbourne man jailed for life for killing his two daughters moments after dressing them in ballerina outfits and filming them dancing to Frozen's 'Let it Go' was motivated by hatred of his ex-wife, a judge says. Charles Amon Mihayo, 36, must serve at least 31 years in prison for smothering four-year-old Savannah and three-year-old Indianna with a pillow during a game of hide-and-seek on Easter Sunday. Mihayo later told police he had to do it but they did not need to know the reasons why. Scroll down for video . Charles Amon Mihayo, 36, must serve at least 31 years in prison for kis his three and four-year-old daughters . Savannah (right), four, and Indianna (left), three, were suffocated by their father 'during hide and seek' But Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said his crimes were inextricably linked to his ongoing conflict with his ex. 'You decided she would pay the price and inevitably so would your children with their lives,' he said. 'You decided to demonstrate to your ex-wife that she did not have the control over the children and their relationship with you that she thought she had. 'Your breach of parental trust is almost beyond belief. 'You gave in to the basest of instincts - revenge.' Justice Lasry said Mihayo's crime was one of the most hideous he had been involved with in his 40 years in criminal law. 'I believe I largely understand why serious crimes occur, no matter how vicious,' he said. 'But I admit I am at a loss to understand these terrible crimes.' The court heard the Melbourne father filmed his girls dancing in ballerina dresses to 'Let It Go' from Frozen . Mihayo is led into the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Thursday for sentencing . He said the justice system must learn to be able to better identify parents at risk of murdering their children so crimes such as Mihayo's can be stopped. 'Killings like this are subject to regular public discussion, and so they should be, because they are hideous crimes devoid of any form of justification or proper explanation.' The day before the April 20 murders he texted his ex-wife asking to see the kids one last time and told her she had 'won'. Before they arrived at his home, Mihayo bought the girls the new dresses and shoes they would die in. He suffocated, then bathed and put them back in the outfits before calling police. When his ex-wife, worried by the silence, knocked on his door, he told her to 'wait a minute' and 'you'll know when they get here'. Charles Amon Mihayo (pictured), 36, pleaded guilty to murdering Savannah and Indianna . He met the police officers at the door, telling them: 'It's done. I've killed them. I've killed my kids.' When police asked why he killed them, Mihayo looked at the girls' mother and said, 'You have to ask her.' He later said they would not understand what he had been through and providing a reason would not make a difference. The Tanzanian-born Mihayo did not react in the court dock as he was sentenced. In an earlier court hearing, Chief Crown prosecutor Gavin Silbert QC said there was ongoing hostility between Mihayo and his ex-wife regarding access to the children, exacerbated when he found out the girls' mother had a new partner, and Mihayo killed the girls as revenge. Mr Silbert said after the relationship broke down, Mihayo told a co-worker he had been thinking about ways to kill his ex-wife and get away with it but he would make sure his daughters were in a safe place. Four days before the girls died he Googled 'how can I kill my ex-wife', the court heard. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said his crimes were linked to his ongoing conflict with his ex . Defence barrister Tim Marsh said Mihayo did not want to try to justify what had happened in any way. But he told the court the murders should not be considered premeditated, pointing out certain things Mihayo told police after the act. He said Mihayo told police: 'That just happened, it just happened right then and there.' Mr Marsh said Mihayo indicated he decided to kill the girls while they were playing hide-and-seek, after dancing. 'Mr Mihayo instructs he was consumed by a particular thought, a particular idea, and made the decision to kill the children,' Mr Marsh said.Mihayo had indicated 'some particular horror' that his children would grow up not knowing their father, as he himself had done, Mr Marsh told the court. 'Mr Mihayo says, ""I thought, well, if the kids are not there, they are not going to suffer the way I suffered, knowing their dad is somewhere but you never get to see him"",' Mr Marsh said, referring to a police interview.

"Maine's former top drug prosecutor James Cameron was sentenced Wednesday to nearly 16 years in prison for child pornography . Maine's former top drug prosecutor who fled the state and set off a nationwide manhunt after being convicted of child pornography charges was sentenced Wednesday to nearly 16 years in prison. James Cameron, 52, apologized and said there's no excuse for his conduct especially since he understood how it affects child victims, having served as an assistant attorney general for 18 years before being fired in 2008. 'I am doubly ashamed of my actions because I knew,' said Cameron, who wore a tan jumpsuit and a chain around his ankles during the hearing before Chief Judge John Woodcock at the U.S. District Court in Bangor. 'I cannot express the shame that I feel.' Cameron was sentenced to 15 years and nine months, and given credit for about three years he has already spent behind bars. Under federal sentencing guidelines, he could have gotten more than 30 years, which the prosecutors asked the judge to impose. Cameron's lawyer sought a six-and-a-half year prison term. Cameron, who once oversaw Maine's drug prosecutions, was convicted in 2010 of 13 counts of child pornography and sentenced to 16 years in prison. A year later, a federal appeals court ordered that he be freed on bail pending his appeal. Hours after a federal appeals court upheld his conviction on seven of the 13 charges and sent the case back to federal court for resentencing, Cameron cut off his electronic monitoring ankle bracelet and fled the state in November 2012. Cameron evaded capture for nearly three weeks before he was arrested at a convenience store in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Cameron's attorney, David Beneman, said in court documents that Cameron had become depressed several years ago amid family concerns, including his son's diagnosis with autism and his parents' deaths. In seeking the lesser sentence, Beneman argued Wednesday that Cameron had no prior criminal history and accepted responsibility for his actions. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Gail Malone said Cameron committed some of the crimes at home while he had claimed to be working and was getting paid by the state. She said he showed a 'flagrant unwillingness to accept responsibility,' even trying to blame the images on one of his computers on his autistic son. Cameron, who is currently being held at the Strafford County jail in New Hampshire, requested he be sent to the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado. He told the judge that jail has been therapeutic for him and said he has the 'capacity and desire to change.' 'I can see myself in the future as a much better person than I have ever been before,' he said .","James Cameron once oversaw Maine's drug prosecutions .

"The parents of a teenage girl have spoken of their anguish after she hanged herself over fears of telling them she might be gay. In the months before her death, 14-year-old Elisabeth Lowe, known as Lizzie, had confided to friends that she thought she may be a lesbian, an inquest heard. Her friends said she was scared of telling her parents and had struggled to reconcile her feelings with the family's strong Christian faith. But Lizzie's father said her fears were 'misplaced' and that she would have received a 'wealth of love and acceptance'. Scroll down for video . Elisabeth Lowe had confided to friends that she thought she may be a lesbian. She was scared of telling her Christian family and killed herself, but her father said she would have had a 'wealth of love and acceptance' The alarm was raised after Lizzie, from Didsbury in Manchester, sent a text to a friend at around 8.30pm on Wednesday, September 10, which concluded by saying '...stay strong. I am sorry.' The friend told her mother who in turn alerted Lizzie's parents and the police, sparking a desperate search for her. She was eventually found hanged in the Millgate Fields area of Fletcher Moss Park in Didsbury at around 11.15pm. Despite extended resuscitation attempts by paramedics, Lizzie could not be saved and she was pronounced dead shortly after midnight. A post-mortem examination concluded she died from the effects of hanging and that she had no drugs or alcohol in her body at the time of her death. She also had no diagnosable mental health problems. Speaking about Lizzie's fears of telling her parents about her sexuality, a friend told the inquest: 'She said she wasn't sure if they (parents) would be ok with it. I told her that I didn't think it would be like that but she did not want to tell them.' Floral tributes at the entrance to the park. She was described as a gifted student, sportswoman and musician who was outgoing, fun-loving and enjoyed the love and respect of many friends . The teenager found hanged in  Fletcher Moss Park in Didsbury. Paramedics were unable to revive her . Some of Lizzie's friends admitted to the coroner that they had shared a feeling of 'sadness' with her and they had regularly talked to her, both in person and over texts and Facebook messages, about self-harming and having suicidal thoughts. One told the hearing, in Manchester, that Lizzie, who was a top performer at school, a Scout and a musician in a Christian orchestra, had told her that cutting herself was a 'coping mechanism'. Another said she was 'finding it hard to connect with God as she thought she was lying to him'. The police officer who oversaw the investigation into her death said he could rule out any third party involvement. Det Insp David Turner said: 'Despite the fact that suicide was clearly an issue with these children, I found no evidence of what is sometimes called a 'suicide pact'.' Lizzie's father Kevin, an engineer, told the inquest that he and her mother had no idea about the issues she was grappling with. Tribute: After the hearing: 'We wish she had confided because she would have found a wealth of love and acceptance and support.'The loss our precious daughter has left us heart broken-hearted' 'There was nothing to suggest she was distressed or had any issues,' her father told the hearing . He said: 'She was just normal and seemed happy. 'There was nothing to suggest she was distressed or had any issues. 'She was very mature, she knew what she wanted and she knew her own mind.' Asked how the family would have reacted if she had spoken to them about her sexuality, Mr Lowe said: 'It wouldn't have come as much surprise. She was very much a tomboy. 'In fact, she was more of a boy than some of the boys were, so it would have been no surprise at all. 'We would have been very supportive.' The principal of Parrs Wood High School in Didsbury told the inquest the incident had 'shaken their sense of reality' The principal of Parrs Wood High School in Didsbury told the inquest the incident had 'shaken their sense of reality'. Andrew Shakos said immediately after the incident, several pupils were referred to a psychologist and staff were made available to help youngsters. Senior coroner Nigel Meadows said the school couldn't have done any more to pick up on Lizzie's distress. Recording a verdict that Lizzie killed herself, Mr Meadows said: 'She was clearly an intelligent young woman. 'She was a successful student but was going through issues of developing maturity and exploring her sexuality and was struggling to come to terms with that against her faith beliefs. 'It is clear she was struggling and she was talking to others about it. 'She never had the opportunity to share her concerns with her parents. 'But I have absolutely no doubt they would have been supportive in their reaction.' He concluded that Lizzie did intend to kill herself and carried out the act. Mr Meadows also issued a plea to all youngsters to talk to an adult if they have any issues or concerns. Speaking after the hearing, father Kevin and mother Hilary, a chartered accountant, said: 'Lizzie was a wonderful exuberant and loved member of her church, school and community. 'She was a gifted student, sportswoman and musician who was outgoing, fun-loving and enjoyed the love and respect of many friends. 'We are utterly devastated at losing her. 'Lizzie did not make known her struggle with depression and the challenges she tried to face alone as a young adult.

"When it comes to producing the centerpiece for the ideal Christmas lunch, Patricia Graham knows the worst thing you can do is rush the process. Indeed, as her aunt used to tell her, if a turkey is to be just right for the Big Day, they must have ‘tasted the April dew’. Sadly, of the ten million turkeys that will be consumed in Britain over the next couple of weeks, the vast majority will have done nothing of the sort. Scroll down for video . Ten million turkeys will be eaten in Britain over the next few weeks and Norfolk Black turkeys (pictured) are a popular choice for Christmas dinner . Raised intensively in hangar-like buildings, these giant white-feathered birds will never have been outside during their 12-week lives. In that time, their weight will have ballooned, piling breast meat on at such a rate that, by the end of the process, they struggle to walk. But alongside cheap, mass-produced turkeys, consumers can choose one with a bit of history — and taste. About a million birds sold this year will be free range. And top of the pecking order are two traditional breeds. In one corner of the coop is the Norfolk Black, a turkey that Mrs Graham, 75, and her family pretty much saved from extinction in Britain. In the other is the KellyBronze, another old-fashioned breed that is also only here thanks to the foresight of another farming family. Originally called 'Spanish Blacks' the turkeys name was changed to reflect the area where they are reared . Both have vocal champions among the foodie elite who believe the end product more than justifies the cost — £14-plus a kilo rather than £5 a kilo for a standard supermarket bird. The breeds trace their lineage back to the turkeys brought back to Europe by 16th-century visitors to the New World. The Spanish Black was immediately popular, its name changing to the Norfolk Black to reflect where it was largely reared. For the next 300 years the bird would be the mainstay of turkey production until superseded by the bronze turkey (a name reflecting its bronze-tinted plumage). The bronze was slightly heavier, with a bigger breast. As a result, by the Thirties the Norfolk Black had almost vanished. That it did not is largely due to Mrs Graham’s father, Frank Peele, part of a family that had been breeding turkeys in Norfolk since the 1880s. Responding to a request from the local government poultry adviser, he agreed to hatch out a few Norfolk Black eggs. In the Fifties his birds performed well in industry competitions. Realising the potential, Mr Peele got rid of his other breeds and concentrated on the Norfolk Black. Meanwhile, the bronze turkey was going out of fashion. When a ‘bronze’ is plucked, stubble-like black feathers can be left behind. The public did not like this, so the feather colour was bred out of the bird. With a white-feathered turkey, any quills left behind cannot be so easily seen. ‘The bronze went out of fashion and the white came in, so all the breeding and genetic development was done on the white turkey,’ says Paul Kelly, 51, the man behind the KellyBronze. ‘It has got to the stage when they kill the turkey at the right weight rather than when it is right to eat. Thus, it has a reputation for being dry and tasteless.’ To this background, in 1971 Mr Kelly’s father Derek, a farmer from Danbury, Essex, realised there was room in the market for a proper, old-fashioned turkey. The Kelly Bronze (pictured) can be cooked quickly, taking just a couple of hours for the average sized bird . All KellyBronze birds sold this year — some 34,000 — will be reared on one of the Kelly’s Essex farms or by of their accredited farmers across the country. One reason that traditional breeds such as the Norfolk Black and KellyBronze taste better is because they take twice as long to reach their slaughter weight. ‘They are free range, we grow them for 27 weeks, and they are then dry-plucked by hand,’ says Mr Kelly. ‘This enables them to be hung for 14 days. All this creates a great-tasting bird.’ The same efforts go into producing the Norfolk Black that I buy online from a farm in Norfolk (the 1,000-plus birds reared by Mrs Graham’s son James have already sold out). Again, it has been roaming free for 24 weeks and hung for more than a week after slaughter. ‘The shape of the Norfolk Black is more like a pheasant, they are a sort of single-breasted bird,’ says Mrs Graham. ‘The Norfolk Black has a much tighter, firmer meat and therefore keeps the flavour and the moisture.’ Both birds come with detailed cooking instructions, which are remarkably similar. The KellyBronze is to be cooked ‘quickly’ — ‘an average-size turkey will take just over a couple of hours to cook to perfection’. As with the Norfolk Black, it is suggested the bird is cooked breast down to allow the fat on its back to trickle through to the breast and keep it moist. Foil is advised against — it causes the skin to steam rather than go crisp — as is stuffing, which slows down the cooking times. For a 5kg bird, two hours and 15 minutes at a temperature of 180c, or gas mark 4, is recommended. The Norfolk Black will cook in a similar time, albeit after an initial blast in a hotter oven. After cooking, it is important to let the birds rest so the juices can settle: 20 minutes for the Norfolk Black, up to an hour for the KellyBronze. Mr Peel got rid of his other breeds in the fifties after realising how successful the Norfolk Black had become . Once cooked and sitting side-by-side, they look remarkably appetising. I cut into the breast of the KellyBronze and am impressed not just by how moist it is, but by the firm texture of the meat. It also has great taste. The same goes for the Norfolk Black. If anything it has more flavour, slightly gamey, which I find even more appealing. In the past, I have struggled to muster much enthusiasm for the Christmas turkey. How could something that takes so long to prepare, taste of so little? That’s not a problem with these birds. But are they worth the additional cost? Given the care that’s gone into growing them, and the finished result, I think they are.","Ten million turkeys will be consumed in Britain over the next few weeks .

"Comedian Russell Brand has taken aim at the Australian government, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the mainstream media following Monday's siege at the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. Brand criticised the way gunman Man Haron Monis was branded a terrorist by some media outlets, saying instead he was simply a mentally ill criminal. 'This man is clearly a mentally ill criminal with a long history of mental illness and criminal behaviour and lots of evidence of instability,' Brand said in a video posted to Youtube as part of his Trews series. Scroll down for video . Comedian Russell Brand has weighed in on the media coverage surrounding the siege in Sydney . 'By us labelling him a terrorist rather than a dangerous mentally ill person - not that all mentally ill people are dangerous, I'm mentally ill - and by allowing him to set the agenda ""I'm doing this on behalf of Islam"" it gives a certain grandeur to nihilistic and violent actions but what's more interesting than the actions of a mentally ill person is the response of the political establishment,' he continued. The comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame, amid worldwide fears about Islamic State. 'It's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around ISIL because currently there's an appetite to increase security measures domestically, to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends.' Brand criticised media reports that claimed gunman Man Haron Monis was a terrorist with links to ISIS . Monis kept 18 people captive for many hours until police stormed the cafe in the early hours of Tuesday . Brand dispersed Australian news reports and addresses from Mr Abbott in between his statements, and made the claim that terrorism is more a structure upheld by governments as a tool of power than anything else. 'Terrorism is continually used as a tool to control a domestic population. I'm not saying there aren't a lot of dangerous people out there, I'm saying a lot of those people are in government,' he said. Australia's new terror and metadata laws were also up for discussion, with Brand saying giving authorities the immunity from prosecution is very dangerous, especially in light of recent information surrounding the CIA and torture claims. Brand also claimed Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the government used the situation to fit their own framework . But he did acknowledge that 'we' need to pull together in times such as these . He however ended his bulletin on a more positive note, saying the #illridewithyou hashtag was 'an offer of solidarity'. 'We have at this point got to pull together more than ever, when people control the media like Rupert Murdoch who says things like ""Egyptians being white, all the Egyptians I know are white"", . 'Of course what's happened in Australia is sad and of course there's dangerous things going on in the world but our media uses that danger to suit their ends. 'It's really important in this time of division and fear that we embrace one another. Us, the normal people in the middle, embrace one another. Forget the extremists are either end of the social scale, whether they are motivated by religion or money or desire for power, and us, the ordinary people that want to make connections, have a right and a duty, in fact, to define the way we see reality,' Brand concluded.","Russell Brand has criticised mainstream coverage of the Sydney siege .

'It's one of the worst cases I've seen in 12 years,' said Matthew Collins, principal environmental health officer for Newham Council. Mr Collins said the takeaway posed a serious risk of food poisoning and contamination of food amid a total lack of management. The council team had received a tip-off from a member of the public, who had not eaten at the takeaway, about staff at the Golden Dragon fly-tipping behind a nearby shop. When environmental health officer Edward King went to inspect the business he had no inkling that it would become the worst case he had ever seen. After twice finding the shutters down and the building apparently closed, he was finally able to carry out an inspection at the fast food outlet. 'On the third visit, Mr King stood on the other side of the road and watched a man leave the premises with a bag that looked like one used for transporting hot food,' said Mr Collins. 'He knocked on the shutter and went in - as he was entitled to do - and found it in an awful condition.' Inspectors also discovered a filthy wok hob which was swimming in fat, food and grease at the East End takeaway . Rodent droppings, found of the next to bottles of sauce, posed a serious risk of contamination to food . Pans of food were left to cool inches from piles of rubbish and a dirty mop bucket in one of the many health and safety breaches at Golden Dragon . 'There was a risk of food poisoning as well as contamination from the droppings and cockroaches.' The Golden Dragon was served a notice to stop trading immediately but not before it had taken orders online through popular website Just Eat. The business previously operated under the name Sancho's but disappeared off the council's radar 'a couple of years ago', said Mr Collins. 'There are about 2,000 food businesses in Newham and they change hands quite regularly,' he added. 'I'd say we shut down one every two weeks on average, which I believe is the highest figure in London.' Some 31 businesses have been shut in Newham this year as the council cracks down on restaurants and takeaways with shocking hygiene. The owners of the Golden Dragon must now undertake a deep clean their takeaway from top to bottom, impose proper pest control and set new health and safety standards before they can reopen. A Newham Council spokeswoman said they were also considering their options regarding a prosecution of the takeaway and would be speaking to the owners in due course. The owners of Golden Dragon were unavailable for comment.","The Golden Dragon in  east London was shut on the spot by inspectors .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott said questions needed to be answered as to how Iranian refugee Man Haron Monis, who was known to authorities and on bail as an alleged accessory to murder, was able to get the gun which allowed him to take 18 hostages in Sydney's Lindt cafe in Martin Place. ""There was incredulity around the National Security Committee of the Cabinet yesterday when we were briefed on the details of his record and his life in this country,"" the ABC reported Mr Abbott as saying. Mr Abbott promised a full report into the incident, which would be made public, and also raised the possibility the gun laws would need to be examined if Monis did possess a firearms licence. New South Wales police later said that Monis did not have a gun licence, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. ""We particularly need to know how someone with such a long record of violence, such a long record of mental instability was out on bail after his involvement in a particularly horrific crime. And we do need to know why he seems to have fallen off our security agencies' watch-list, back in about 2009,"" Mr Abbott said in Canberra. According to The Australian newspaper, the New South Wales government on Tuesday requested its lawyers review all bail decisions. Monis carried out a bloody siege on Monday, which ended with his death along with that of his two hostages, Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson after a 17-hour ordeal. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said questions needed to be answered as to how Iranian refugee Man Haron Monis was able to get a gun .

Two hostages who were killed in the siege - Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson (right) and barrister Katrina Dawson (left) The prime minister's national security advisers are examining the siege. 'The system did not adequately deal with this individual,' Mr Abbott said. 'My intention certainly would be to publish a report on this.' A criminal investigation, a coronial inquest and a police critical incident probe are already under way. Other court documents alleged that Monis threatened to shoot the mother of his two sons at Minchinbrook McDonalds in western Sydney almost two years before Noleen Hayson Pal was murdered, Daily Mail Australia previously reported. According to an interview conducted at St Marys Police Station on July 27, 2011, Monis threatened Ms Pal after they split up and had demanded full custody of their children, then aged seven and three-and-a-half. Ms Pal, who told police she was afraid of Monis, had met him at the McDonald's a week earlier to discuss custody of their children. Police say Monis told her, 'If I can't see the kids more than I am now, you're going to pay, even if I have to shoot you'. Monis also told constables Mina Matta and Matthew Gillett that he was a former 'security officer in Australia' and that he had previously held a firearm licence and and gone target shooting.

Sheikh Man Haron Monis, 50, killed two hostages and was shot dead during a siege in central Sydney . Monis is pictured here  outside the Downing Centre Court, Sydney, on February 10, 2010 . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said it was important not to have a blame game. A committee examining new data retention laws - the third round of counter-terrorism measures proposed by the Abbott government - held a minute's silence before taking evidence from security officials. ASIO deputy director-general Kerri Hartland said her agency was working with NSW and federal police to investigate the siege. She said terrorist attacks against Australia were not hypothetical. 'Australia is a terrorist target and recent events have once again demonstrated that Australia is not immune from acts of terror,' Ms Hartland said. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said requiring telcos to keep two years of customer data was essential to fighting terrorism. He said accessing data had already prevented two major terrorist attacks in recent years, but police feared the emergence of small internet providers that dumped their data after only months would have grave implications for disrupting crime. Flowers are left as a sign of respect at Martin Place, in Sydney's CBD, on Wednesday . Mr Abbott and wife Margie Abbott lay flowers at a shrine after the siege . Former attorney-general Philip Ruddock questioned why the new laws exempted internet cafes. 'It would be just another place for people to say, ""I can go there and nobody can monitor my movements"",' he told the committee. The committee heard small providers were kept out of the laws because of the compliance cost. Another Liberal member, Senator David Fawcett, suggested the laws be amended to limit data access to only government agencies. Labor members of the committee said the government had not released figures on how much it would cost the industry and what public money would be used to compensate companies. Attorney-General George Brandis has promised to cover the 'reasonable costs' of the industry. John Stanton, of the Communications Alliance, which represents service providers, said a detailed cost-benefit analysis should be released before parliament resumed in February. Mr Stanton said companies had no problem with a two-year retention period for phone data but internet-related data should be held for only six months. Mr Colvin said police would prefer companies kept data for five to seven years.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott said questions needed to be answered as to how Iranian refugee Man Haron Monis was able to get a gun .

"A forensic psychologist called in to analyse the Sydney siege gunman has revealed how just hours after the ordeal ended he counselled a crying Muslim taxi driver who feared for his life because two people had been killed by a man claiming to be part of his religion. Self-styled Sheik Man Haron Monis forced his 18 hostages to hold up an Islamic Shahada flag, which bore an inscription 'There is no god but God, and Mohamed is the messenger of God' during his 16-hour siege at the Lindt Café in Martin Place. As Tim Watson-Munro hoped into a cab to travel to his office on Elizabeth Street, not far from the scene where Monis killed Lindt manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson, he noticed his bearded driver looked upset. The driver had not seen the #illridewithyou hashtag which has gone viral around the world as some Australians ensured members of the country’s Muslim community that they place no blame at their door for the actions of one madman - Monis. Scroll down for video . Forensic psychologist Tim Watson-Munro had offered his  advice on gunman Man Haron Monis during the Sydney siege and then found himself consoling a fearful Muslim taxi just hours later . The terrified driver began sobbing as Mr Watson-Munro asked him: ‘Are you OK?’ Mr Watson-Munro gave the man a hug as the driver poured out his grief and fears. ‘He burst into tears and he said “I can’t believe what has happened. I grieve for the deceased and the country”,’ Mr Watson-Munro told Daily Mail Australia. The criminal profiler said he tried to reassure him but the driver was crying so uncontrollably that he told him to pull over to the side of the road. ‘I told him these tragedies occur and they are great tragedies. I have enough faith in this country that they are not going to say “this is a Muslim inspired tragedy”,’ Mr Watson-Munro said. Man Haron Monis, gunman in the Lindt Chocolat Café siege in Martin Place, Sydney, is photographed outside the Downing Centre Court, Sydney, on February 10, 2010 . Deranged gunman Man Haron Monis seen here in 2011 outside court when he was accused of sending offending letters to the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan . Mr Watson-Munro noticed his Sydney taxi driver looked upset and ask him if he was 'OK' ‘He said “I work as a taxi driver I’m very frightened someone will kill me today” and my heart went out to him. Whose wouldn't? ‘We pulled over and spoke for half an hour to reassure and calm him down. I said by and large this is an egalitarian and fair country we live in and no one is going to blame him for what happened.’ Mr Watson-Munro said that in his view it’s a ‘terrible event that has resulted in huge tragedy’. The taxi driver thanked him and said ‘it’s so good to know there are good Australians who understand’. Mr Watson-Munro said he hoped ‘one of the lessons coming out of it [the siege] is the need for greater financial resources to go into treating the mentally ill’. In his opinion the actions of 50-year-old Monis,  killed in siege, were the actions of ‘random craziness’. ‘I had a bad feeling about it in terms of what were his motives beyond wanting to hold up a flag and talk to Tony Abbott?... I don’t know if it was attention seeking that went majestically wrong.’ After Tessa Kum noticed Rachael Jacobs Facebook status she wrote to those on her regular bus 'wear religious attire, & don’t feel safe alone: I’ll ride with you' Opposition leader Bill Shorten joined the movement, along with South Australian Premier Jay Wetherill . Twitter user Tessa Kum began what has become a worldwide phenomenon, offering to sit next to members of the Islamic faith on transport . Australian Socceroos star Harry Kewell showed his support for the campaign on Twitter . The promises weren't empty offers, with many detailing the routes they travelled on and encouraging others to join them . The unlikely moment of shared grief between a man who has worked as a forensic psychologist on mass murders and a Sydney taxi driver comes after a young Brisbane woman, Rachael Jacobs, posted a moving Facebook status about her encounter with a Muslim woman on Monday. ‘...and the (presumably) Muslim woman sitting next to me on the train silently removes her hijab,’ Ms Jacobs wrote. ‘I ran after her at the train station. I said “put it back on. I'll walk with u”. She started to cry and hugged me for about a minute - then walked off alone.’ The hashtag #illridewithyou had gone viral within hours on social media, as Twitter users from around the country offered to ride public transport with people who feel intimidated by anti-Muslim sentiment. The hashtag was soon picked up by his followers, gaining support from fellow Australians who offered lifts to work, promises of protection, and friendship to anyone feeling threatened .

"Broke, on the dole, a failed last ditch High Court appeal to clear his name, facing lengthy jail sentences for sexual assault and plotting his wife's murder, Man Haron Monis walked into the Lindt Cafe on Monday morning a man at the end of the line. Just three days earlier his all consuming desire to clear his name had for all practical reasons come to an end. The 50-year-old, who almost two decades earlier had fled Iran accused of scamming thousands from innocent citizens, faced widespread exposure as a sham Islamic cleric if convicted on more than 50 sex charges. Monis had taken up a number of jobs and aliases since arriving in Australia, where he was known as Michael Hayson, Michael Hassan, Michael Hayson Mavros, Mohammad Hassan Manteghi (his real name), Shiekh Haron and, finally, Man Haron Monis. Scroll down for video . Three days before he stormed a Sydney cafe with a shotgun Man Haron Monis had an appeal against conviction rejected in the High Court . His 'profession' had ranged from psychic to spiritual healer, and it was in the latter job which he practised at Wentworthville and other western Sydney locations which resulted in sexual asault and indecency charges stretching back to 2001. After six years on unemployment benefits, Monis couldn't even afford the $1000 bail on the charges in April, relying on his girlfriend's mother to pay up. And last Friday morning, just three days before he took a shotgun to Martin Place, Monis was rebuffed yet again. After reluctantly pleading guilty to twelve charges of sending malicious notes disguised as 'sympathy letters' and making phone calls to he families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, Monis had taken his case to the High Court. The 50-year-old faced widespread exposure as a sham Islamic cleric if convicted on more than 50 sex charges . On Monday he took 18 hostages and held many of them in the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney for over 16 hours . He had already been rejected by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA). He had already taken his case - that charges of using a postal service or similar to menace, harass or cause offence were unconstitutional - once to the High Court. In February last year, six members of the High Court returned their judgement. It was a split decision, divided evenly between three male judges who agreed with Monis that the charges were unconstitutional. Three female judges ruled that the appeal court decision that the charges against him were constitutional should hold. Last Friday Monis went to the High Court again. Represented by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds SC, he made an application to remove the Appeal court decision to the High Court. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family . On Tuesday morning many innocent people were injured (pictured) and two were tragically killed in the deadly siege . By 10am, the court's Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler swiftly dismissed his application. Monis, who was not present in the court, was telephoned and told his bid had failed. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family. Following a bitter and vengeful relationship with the children's mother Noleen Hayson Pal after she ended it in 2011, Monis had been charged with intimidating her but was lucky enough to have the charge and an Apprehended Violence Order against him dismissed in May 2012. In April the mother of Monis' children Noleen Hayson Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington . But in April 2013, Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington and seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder. His girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, a Greek Australian Muslim convert was charged with Ms Pal's murder. Ms Droudis was also charged over the hate letters, for aiding and abetting Monis. In September last year, Monis told police he had known Droudis for six years but that their relationship had not begun until May 2013 - the month following Ms Pal's murder. Seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder while his girlfriend Amirah Droudis was charged with Ms Pal's murder . Ms Droudis was due to appeal her charges in court next February, the same months Monis would face a trial on the multiple sex charges, including two of inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. No date had been set for the murder trial. But it was the mark against his name over the poison pen letters which had dominated Monis's thoughts since 2009, as he went from the District Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the High Court and back to the High Court again, only to be rebuffed. Seventy-two hours later, Monis took a shotgun into Martin Place.","On Friday Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis was before High Court .

"The ex-wife of Scot Young, the bankrupt property tycoon who fell to his death, is seeking 'a fresh pair of eyes' to search for the fortune she believes he kept from her during a bitter divorce battle. Mr Young was jailed for six months for contempt of court during his high-profile matrimonial row with his former partner as she accused him of hiding away more than £400million. The 52-year-old fell on to railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone, central London, last week in what witnesses described as a 'grisly' and 'brutal' scene. Scroll down for video . Michelle Young (left) is seeking 'a fresh pair of eyes' to search for the fortune she believes Scot Young (right) kept from her during a bitter divorce battle . A High Court judge said in a ruling handed down today, following a hearing in November, that Michelle Young, 50, was entitled to apply for a creditors' meeting to press for the appointment of new bankruptcy trustees to carry out the search. But first she must pay outstanding costs bills, including those owed to the current joint trustees. The judge said Ms Young wanted the pair - David Ingram and Richard Hicken, two partners in professional services firm Grant Thornton - replaced because they had identified none of the late Mr Young's assets. The judge said she was also accusing the trustees of 'lacking neutrality and being biased against her'. The Youngs separated in 2006 after starting a relationship in 1989. Andrew Hochhauser QC, a deputy judge of the High Court's chancery division, said Ms Young had two daughters with her former husband and was his largest creditor. Under the 1986 Insolvency Act, creditors have a democratic right to remove a trustee in bankruptcy at a creditors' meeting, although the courts can intervene to stop a meeting being convened. Judge Hochhauser said the current trustees had applied for a direction that a meeting should not be convened. Scot Young fell on to railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone, central London, last week in what witnesses described as a 'grisly' and 'brutal' scene . Ms Young wanted them replaced by Ian Cadlock, from Quantuma LLP, and Louise Brittain of Wilkins Kennedy LLP. The judge said during her divorce proceedings Ms Young had changed her solicitors and forensic accountants several times. She was now on her 14th firm of solicitors, with her total litigation costs around £6.4million. The judge said: 'Ms Young believed the bankrupt (Mr Young) to be hiding more than £400million and certain well known, exceptionally wealthy people were helping him to conceal his money'. He described how Family Division judge Mr Justice Moor had found the former husband had retained assets valued at £45million, but could not say where they had been secreted. Judge Hochhauser concluded: 'Whilst I accept that, in all the circumstances, it is understandable that to date there has been no identification of assets belonging to the bankrupt, and I wholly reject any suggestion of reluctance or intransigence on the part of the joint trustees to identify or recover assets, Ms Young is entitled to invite the other creditors to consider replacing the joint trustees with a ""fresh pair of eyes"".' A letter from the trustees had indicated no appetite for change, but Ms Young should have the chance to put her case, said the judge. However, the meeting would not take place until she had paid outstanding costs orders in relation to 'unnecessary and hopeless' applications she had made to stay or annul the bankruptcy, plus the additional costs for a document production exercise carried out by the joint trustees.","Tycoon jailed during matrimonial row with former partner Michelle Young .

"A Montana man who shot and killed a German exchange student caught trespassing in his garage was convicted of deliberate homicide Wednesday. It was a case that attracted attention as a test of 'stand your ground' laws that govern the use of deadly force to defend life and property. Cheers erupted in the packed courtroom when the verdict was read in the case against Markus Kaarma, 30, of Missoula. Scroll down for video . Markus Kaarma (pictured today) was found guilty of deliberate homicide today after shooting Diren Dede . Parents Gulcin and Celal Dede embrace following the guilty verdict against Marcus Kaarma who was convicted of deliberate homicide for the killing of their 17-year-old son Diren last April . Kaarma shot 17-year-old high school student Diren Dede in the early hours of April 27 after being alerted to an intruder by motion sensors. Witnesses testified Kaarma fired four shotgun blasts at Dede, who was unarmed. Kaarma faces a minimum penalty of 10 years in prison when he is sentenced Feb. 11. His lawyers plan to appeal. Dede's parents were in the courtroom and hugged and cried when they heard the jury's decision. Kaarma's lawyers argued at trial that he feared for his life, didn't know if the intruder was armed, and was on edge because his garage was burglarized at least once in the weeks before the shooting. They said under Montana's 'stand your ground' law, Kaarma's actions were justifiable because he feared for his family's safety. Diren Dede (pictured from his Instagram) was to leave the U.S. just weeks after the incident that killed him . Deputy County Attorney Jennifer Clark hugs Diren Dede's mother, Gulcin Dede, before the verdict today . Prosecutors maintained that after the previous burglary, Kaarma was intent on luring an intruder into his garage and then harming that person. That night, Kaarma left his garage door partially open with a purse inside. The case generated outcry in Germany, where the government said it launched its own investigation. At trial, neighbors testified that Kaarma's girlfriend, Janelle Pflager, told them of the couple's plans to bait an intruder and catch a burglar themselves because they believed police weren't responding to area break-ins. Prosecutors said Kaarma fired a pump-action shotgun four times into the garage — pausing between the third and fourth shots. During that pause, police testified, Kaarma might have adjusted his aim before he struck Dede in the head. Dede's parents attended the trial, often leaving the packed courtroom during emotional testimony. Celal Dede, left, gives lead prosecuting attorney Andrew Paul a hug today following the guilty verdict in the shooting death of Dede's son Diren last April . Standing in front of a forensic X-ray of Diren Dede's skull, State Medical Examiner Dr. Gary Dale, described the shotgun wounds and points out the pellets left in his brain that killed Dede (pictured on December 8) The Hamburg teen was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and was to leave the U.S. after the school term ended in just a few weeks. More than 30 U.S. states have laws expanding the self-defense principle known as the 'castle doctrine,' a centuries-old premise that a person has the right to defend their home against attack. The name evokes the old saying, 'my home is my castle.' Since Florida in 2005 became the first of several states to expand the castle doctrine's use outside the home, a flurry of cases has tested the boundaries of self-defense law. Most famously, a Florida jury acquitted security guard George Zimmerman in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. Zimmerman followed the teenager, contended the boy attacked him, and was acquitted of murder charges even though he was not at his home at the time of the shooting. In Germany, Hamburg prosecutor Carsten Rinio said his office was still looking into the Dede case after opening an investigation as required under German law. U.S. authorities were sent a request for documents several months ago, he said, but have not yet provided them.","Markus Kaarma, 30, shot Diren Dede, 17, in his Montana garage .

"Svetlana Krivsun, 23, is currently under house arrest accused of causing the crash at a Moscow airport . The young female Russian air traffic controller accused of causing the death of French oil boss Christophe de Margerie has has lost her baby due to stress, her lawyer has revealed. Trainee Svetlana Krivsun, 23, currently under house arrest, faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty of giving the order to Total boss's Falcon business jet to takeoff at a Moscow airport when a snowplough was on the runway. The plane clipped the vehicle moments after leaving the ground, exploding in a fireball and killing de Margerie and the three crew. 'My client had a miscarriage as a result of the continuous nervous tension,' said her lawyer Sergey Isaev during a court hearing to prolong Krivsun's detention. He told a judge that she had been pregnant on the day of the air crash but at the time did not know she was expecting a baby. Her house arrest made it difficult for her to see a doctor when her pregnancy became evident, he claimed. 'Because of the delay in seeking medical help, she lost the baby,' he said, saying she was unable to attend the court hearing. 'Now she needs long-term treatment, including psychological.' The judge ordered that she remain under house arrest until April 23 pending a trial into the tragedy. Rookie air traffic controller Krivsun maintains she acted properly during the incident when she was under a supervisor, who is now held in custody also accused of violating safety rules, so causing the fatal crash. Critics have alleged low-level staff have been accused over the crash while investigators have failed to examine failures by senior staff at Vnukovo Airport, including cost cutting and use of outdated equipment which may have failed to show the snowplough was on the runway as Krivsun gave the go-ahead for takeoff. She told an earlier hearing from behind the metal bars of a court cage: 'I am a simple trainee controller.

Snowplough driver Vladimir Martyenko, 60, who was alleged by investigators to have been drunk at the time of the crash, is also held in detention, along with three other staff from Vnukovo Airport.

However, he denies being drunk and maintains he was carrying out orders when the crash happened. Krivsun is a recent a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia.

'We are outraged with the horrendous actions of the Investigative Committee of Russia who have detained and took away our colleagues at 2am on 23 October after 48 hours interrogation,' said Sergey Kovalev, president of Russia's Federal Trade Union of Air Traffic Controllers. 'These air traffic controllers had just finished their night shift. They were interrogated without lawyers. They treated them like dangerous criminals, they took them out in handcuffs. 'They were morally and physically depressed. They were without food and sleep for almost three days. 'The trainee air traffic controller needed medical help. An ambulance was called. We think that their detention is groundless, they agreed to cooperate with the investigators.' De Margerie, 63, was seen as one of Russia's biggest business supporters in the West. He died after attending a meeting with Russian premier Dmitry Medvedev in which he urged Moscow to act to end US and EU sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.","Lawyers for Svetlana Krivsun claim she had a miscarriage due to stress .

"It's a classic newsroom blunder which appears to have slipped through the cracks. The Age has incorrectly printed a photo of 'Legally Brown' comedy star Nazeem Hussain in its entertainment column today with the caption: 'Waleed Aly joins The Project'. The awkward mix up was spotted by the stand-up comedian, of Sri Lankan descent, who lightheartedly tweeted on Thursday morning: 'Well, we are kinda the same person...' It has since gained more than 500 retweets, sparking comments such as: 'Brown people all look alike', 'Un-freaking-believable' and 'demonstrates why tv needs more non-white face'.

"More than 80 residents of a Cambodian village have tested positive for HIV/Aids in an outbreak thought to have been caused by contaminated needles, it was revealed last night. Hundreds of panicked residents in the Sangkae area of Battambang province in the country's west have flocked to a health centre for testing since news of the mass infection emerged last week. Some 72 - including 14 children – of the 556 people tested had results that were positive for HIV/Aids. The total number of people infected in the village of Roka now stands at 82. Help: A Cambodian doctor (left) offers anti retro viral drugs to a woman living with HIV at the Khmer-Soviet Friendship hospital in Phnom Penh (file picture) Teng Kunthy, secretary general of the National Aids Authority based in Phnom Penh, told Agence France-Presse: ‘Of 556 people tested, 72 of them came back positive for HIV/AIDS. ‘This is a higher rate than usual... It may be caused by the use of the same tools such as needles. This is our preliminary conclusion... we are working to collect more evidence.’ A further ten people were found to be infected with the virus yesterday when more villagers arrived at the health centre, also in Battambang, it was reported. Hei Sik, a local HIV/Aids programme director, told AFP: ‘According to villagers, they suspected the infection may have been caused by injections from private local medics. ‘This is a surprisingly high rate, the highest that I have ever seen. Some of them are women aged in their seventies and eighties.’ Aerial view: Hundreds of panicked residents in the Sangkae area (file picture) of Battambang province in Cambodia have flocked to a health centre for testing since news of the mass infection emerged last week . Cambodia has been widely hailed for its efforts in tackling HIV/AIDS, although there are estimated to be more than 73,000 people living with the disease in the country. The National Aids Authority says the rate of HIV infection among people aged 15 to 49 in Cambodia has declined from 0.6 per cent in 2013 to 0.4 per cent in 2014. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It attacks the immune system and weakens the ability to fight infections and disease. It is most commonly caught through unprotected sex, but can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment. Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the final stage of HIV, when the body can no longer fight life-threatening infections.","Hundreds of panicked residents have flocked to health centre for testing .

"Ikea customers say the furniture store is the latest to be hit by a delivery backlog - with some claiming packages have been dropped off after midnight. A huge boom in online shopping and a rush before Christmas has seen delivery drivers for a number of companies struggle to keep up with soaring demand. Courier firm Yodel admitted it was delivering items up to two days late earlier this month following huge sales on so-called Cyber Monday. Ikea is said to be the latest hit by the problems, with some customers in London reporting long waits and late deliveries . Joanna Bird (pictured with daughter Lili) was among customers left fuming after their Ikea deliveries took hours - and in some case days - to arrive as the company deals with huge pre-Christmas orders . Joanna Bird, a mother-of-one from Pinner in the north west of the capital said she was forced to twice delay the delivery of a children's wardrobe after a  driver couldn't arrive until late in the evening, when her child would be asleep. The 40-year-old bookbinder said: 'I was expecting the delivery before 9pm on the day I bought it as I paid £30 for same day delivery. 'When the driver phoned up at 10.30pm and said he was on his way I just told him it was too late as my four-year-old was fast asleep and I told him to come back the next day. 'I thought it would arrive at a sensible time, but at 9pm I was calling Ikea to complain, but couldn't get through for more than an hour. 'The driver then phoned up just after 10pm and said he would be late and I told him to forget it. 'When the same thing happened the next day - three days in a row - I couldn't believe it. 'The driver eventually called at 10.30pm and told me he was on his way I just thought I should get it over and done with otherwise I'd never get it. The driver said he was desperate to 'get rid' of the wardrobe. 'He arrived at midnight and he said he still had a couple of deliveries to do. She added: ''When I asked him if he thought it was appropriate to be delivering stuff after midnight he just shrugged his shoulders and said he ""had his orders"". 'What really get to me is that I ended up paying to phone the Ikea hotline endless times and they never apologised - all they did was give me the £30 delivery charge back. 'The emailed apology even got my name wrong and called me Mr Bird and said the case was resolved to my satisfaction, which it most certainly wasn't.' Another customer in Watford, north of the capital, said he had waited in for four days running earlier this month  after being told £1,500 of furniture would be delivered before 9pm. It eventually turned up at 11.15pm, four days later. Customers of Ikea living in London say they are having to wait hours for pre-Christmas deliveries to arrive . The 35-year-old said: 'The driver never called before 9pm, often calling around 10pm and no matter what I did - or what I told Ikea customers services - the delivery was four days late. 'The first day I got a call about 10.30pm saying he was on his way and nobody turned up by 11.30pm so I went to bed and put in some earplugs. 'The next day it took me an hour to get through to customer service and they were no good at all - they just said my furniture would arrive before 9pm. 'Safe to say it didn't and I got a call again after 10pm, but I was out with friends by then, so told him to come back to next day. 'The third day I heard nothing and the furniture eventually arrived four days after I ordered it, arriving at 11.15pm.' Customers have also taken to Twitter to complain about the Swedish chain. London's Verity Symes tweeted: '@IKEA two days waiting in for delivery, no phone call, no help from your call centre other than they don't care if I cancel?!?' Natalia Barua, also living in the capital, added: '@IKEA 4 failed deliveries and a total call waiting time of 2.5 hours in 1 week.Incompetent delivery providers & call centre team.' A number of customers took to Twitter to complain about delays to the flat-pack furniture giant's deliveries . And Ade Walker wrote: '@ikea joke delivery service. 2hrs late, no comms, no reason, bad attitude from driver, drove off dangerously fast. Worth £40? No. #Ikea' Ikea has yet to comment on whether deliveries are being made after midnight. But Gerard Bos, Customer Relations Manager, apologised for late deliveries, saying that 'elements outside the control of the delivery crew' could mean they were delivered after 9pm. He said: 'We do everything possible to deliver to our customers within their communicated time window. 'Occasionally elements outside of our control can affect our deliveries as planned. We appreciate that late deliveries can be frustrating so in such circumstances, we always attempt to make contact to check if it is still convenient to deliver or if a new delivery slot should be arranged. 'We apologise for any inconvenience caused by late deliveries and are continuously looking for ways to improve our services for the future.' Yodel has said its delivery backlog has now been cleared. A spokesman said: 'Yodel is now operating a normal Christmas service and we're working to make sure that all deliveries are made as swiftly as possible.'

"It might have been a mild 65 degrees in St Petersburg, Florida, today - but it didn't stop these happy kids having a snowball fight. Pupils at the Douglas L. Jameson Jr. Elementary School in the central Florida city, on the Gulf of Mexico coast, put on their winter coats and Santa hats after six tonnes of the white stuff was trucked in. They got a taste of the unseasonable weather for their 'snow day', which is sponsored by the PTA.

As well as indulging in a classic snowball fight, the students also made snowmen and rode sleds down a ramp. For some students it was their first ever experience with snow. Fifth-grader Layla Frazier, who threw one of the first snowballs, stopped briefly to say: 'It's fun'. St Petersburg is a very unlikely candidate for December snow - with an average low temperature of 56 degrees, according to the Weather Channel. The record low for December - recorded in 1938 - was 35 degrees, still slightly above freezing point. It is unclear how much the event cost, but comparable 'snow party' services offer several tons of snow for around $1,200. In a statement, a member of the PTA said: 'It was a wonderful day with lots of fun had by all students and staff!' Fun for all: Laura Rohan, a first-grade teacher, laughs alongside her pupil Hayden George, left, at the bottom of the sledding ramp .

"Households across the country have been warned they could be putting their families at risk this Christmas by hanging old decorations filled with deadly asbestos. Vintage baubles, wreaths and other festive ornaments could be laced with the killer mineral in the form of fake snow  which could then spread throughout the house putting anyone living there in danger, experts claim. Anyone with old  decorations that might contain fake snow are now being urged to dispose of them properly. Vintage baubles and other festive ornaments could be laced with the killer mineral in the form of fake snow made from pure asbestos, (pictured in Penguin Snow Drift) experts claim . Concerns go back to the 1940s when asbestos-based fake snow was popular in shops and homes. The white powder, which had alluring brand names like Pure White, White Magic and Snow Drift, was used by manufacturers of Christmas decorations on baubles, statues and wreaths. Production of the fake snow stopped at the outbreak of the Second World War when it was used to insulate ships and aircraft. But it is thought that homes all over the country could still be using the vintage decorations without realising the potentially-deadly implications. The UK Asbestos Training Association, the body responsible for ensuring asbestos safety in homes and workplaces, has issued a warning to replace any Christmas decorations that might contain fake snow. Craig Evans, manager of the UK Asbestos Training Association, said: 'In the 1930s and 1940s asbestos was used in abundance to create fake snow - products called Pure White, White Magic and Snow Drift were common in department stores and even in people's homes. Concerns go back to the 1940s when asbestos-based fake snow, with alluring brand names like Pure White (left) White Magic and Snow Drift (right), was used by manufacturers of Christmas decorations on baubles, statues and wreaths . 'Children played with it. Anyone who had any contact with this material was inhaling asbestos fibres in quantities normally associated only with those who worked in asbestos mines. 'The use of asbestos-based fake snow stopped with the Second World War when tonnes of asbestos was needed for insulation on ships, planes and other military uses. 'But Christmas decorations it was used on may still exist. Households up and down the country may still have decorations from that era that they keep in the loft until Christmas comes round. 'People might be completely oblivious to the fact that each year they could be running the risk of inhaling deadly asbestos fibres from their old decorations. 'What's more, it's estimated around 1.5 million homes in the UK have asbestos in them and if people are storing Christmas decorations in their lofts underneath loose-fill asbestos insulation it could be dropping onto them. 'Asbestos dust which may settle on their tree and decorations, which will ultimately spread throughout their home whilst putting up their decorations. The fake snow created using asbestos, such as in the 1942 film Holiday Inn featuring Bing Crosby (pictured) and Fred Astaire, could cause fatal complications according to the UK Asbestos Training Association . Asbestos dust from fake snow, such as Snow Drift (pictured) could spread throughout their home as people put up their decorations . 'It's impossible to know how many people could potentially be exposing themselves to asbestos each Christmas. 'Our warning is to replace any antique decorations that have fake snow on them with new decorations. They might not look quite as nice but they are guaranteed to be safe. 'Anyone who thinks they have asbestos-laced decorations should contact their local authority which can advise on how to dispose of them in the proper way. 'Asbestos in Christmas decorations is not something many people will be thinking of this festive season but it's a very serious danger that should not be underestimated.' Asbestos is the name given to six fibrous minerals which have been mined for thousands of years. Large-scale asbestos mining started in the late 19th century when it became popular with manufacturers and builders for its strength, resistance to heat, and sound-proofing capabilities. But it was only in the mid 20th century that it was revealed as a cause of serious diseases like cancer and asbestosis. The UK has one of the highest rates of mesothelioma - an incurable type of cancer caused by asbestos - in the world with around 2,500 people being diagnosed each year.","Asbestos was used to create fake snow for baubles and wreaths in 1940s .

"Rosalind Cormack, of Bristol, is facing jail after RSPCA officers found eight dead pets at her home after she left the animals unattended . A woman is facing jail today after leaving her pets to die in disgusting conditions - and they were only found after neighbours complained about the smell of a dead cat in a wheelie bin. The RSPCA visited the home of Rosalind Cormack, of Knowle, Bristol, on three consecutive days after complaints from neighbours about the smell and flies, but she was never in. Police eventually broke into the house after RSPCA officers found a dead cat in a wheelie bin. On entering the property they were hit by an 'unbearable stench' and discovered seven other dead pets, including three cats, a dog, two rabbits and a hamster littered around the property. Officers also found a further eight cats alive but in an emaciated state. Widowed Cormack, 58, had been away for up to three weeks when officers raided the house in July. She pleaded guilty this week to one count of causing unnecessary suffering to a cat called Mi Mi, not providing a suitable environment for a further eight cats, all of which were alive on discovery, or for three cats which had died. Charges for the cat in the wheelie bin, dog, rabbit and hamster were not brought. Some of the cats that survived later had to be put down due to their condition. Cormack was told magistrates would adjourn for a full pre-sentence report but a prison sentence of up to 12 weeks is possible. Lindi Meyer, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, described how the unbearable stench of rotting flesh meant the inspector could not breathe through his nose. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Cormack is facing jail after leaving her pets to die in disgusting conditions at her Bristol home . Police were forced to break into the house after RSPCA officers found a dead cat in a wheelie bin . Once inside the property they were hit by an 'unbearable stench' and discovered seven other dead pets . The court heard a visiting animal welfare officer had also seen evidence of cats trying to get out of the property but had been unable to contact Cormack. Cormack had been away from the property for between seven days and three weeks. Ms Meyer said: 'When police forced entry to the premises there was a very strong smell of faeces, with one officer saying it was unbearable and he could not breathe through his nose. 'There were flies everywhere and the officer said the state of the house meant it was impossible to walk through the lounge without treading in faeces.' She went on to describe the 'horrendous' smell of rotting flesh when officers found the maggot-riddled and decomposing body of the dog in the kitchen with a live cat, Mi Mi. The dead animals included three cats, a dog, two rabbits and a hamster littered around the property . An animal welfare officer had seen cats trying to get out of the house but couldn't contact Cormack . A decomposing kitten was found on the stairs as well as another that was found in a basket. A dead hamster was found in the bedroom and two dead rabbits in their cage in the garden. Ms Meyer added: 'In interview she said the dog had been dead for three to four weeks and the hamster and rabbits for some time. 'She said the three cats had been alive when she had left. 'She said things had got on top of her and that she was suffering from depression.' Ms Meyer told magistrates she would be seeking to have a lifelong ban on owning any animals imposed on Cormack. Cormack does not have any previous convictions. Sentencing has been adjourned until next month.

"A New Zealand couple have been rescued from their locked car 'close to death' because they thought the remote device - which they did not have - was the only way to get out. For close to 13 hours Mollieanne and Brian Smith sounded the Mazda 3 car horn and tried to smash the windows with a car jack as they sat trapped in the vehicle that was parked in the garage of their home In Alexandra, on the South Island. The elderly couple had been led to believe that only the remote control would open the doors - not realising that a simple catch by the door handle would have freed them, reports Otago Daily Times. For close on 13 hours Mollieanne and Brian smith sounded the horn and tried to smash the windows of their new Mazda 3, believing they were trapped inside . When the couple were finally freed by neighbours the following morning Mrs Smith was unconscious because they had used up all the air in the car and her husband was struggling to breathe. She told the paper today that they had learned from emergency services that if they had spent another half an hour in the car they could have died. They said they believed there was no way to get out if the doors were locked and they did not have the remote control device with them. They swung a car jack against the windows, hoping to break out, without success and sounded the horn after realising they could not open the doors at seven o'clock in the evening, but no-one came to help. It was only the following morning that neighbours found them and called for an ambulance. Mrs Smith was so ill and distressed that she spent three days in hospital. The elderly couple had been led to believe that only the remote control would open the doors - not realising that a simple catch by the door handle would have freed them . Mr Smith told the Otago paper that he considered himself 'very methodical' but he could not work out how to open the doors without the remote control device. 'Once I found out how simple it was to unlock it I kicked myself that I did not find the way out,' he told the Otago paper. 'I had this mind-set that I did not have the transponder (so I could not get out).' He said the car salesperson had made it seem the car would not work without the transponder. But he said he now knew that the manual lock was the same as the inside door handle on many other vehicles. And he had a message for the owners of other 'keyless' cars and not just Mazdas: 'Educate yourselves on how to operate your car before using it.' His wife said she had decided to speak out because people needed to be aware of the risks of keyless cars, particularly older people inexperienced in new technology. Mrs Smith told the paper that she had received phone calls from about five other people reporting similar experiences with keyless cars. But Mr Glenn Harris, Mazda New Zealand's general manager, said the report of the couple being trapped in the car in that manner was an industry first. 'It's not a design flaw with the car,' he told the paper.

"Super typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines with winds of up to 195 mph, was so powerful that it rolled a boulder weighing more than 26 adult male African elephants up a beach for 150 feet. It is the largest rock to be moved by a storm ever recorded, according to scientists who examined huge piles of debris deposited by the typhoon in the island of Samar in 2013. Haiyan, which is one of the most powerful tropical cyclones on record, killed more than 6,000 people, devastated more than a million homes and caused widespread destruction as it swept across the Philippines in November last year. Scroll down for video . Typhoon Haiyan was so powerful it created Tsunami-like waves that swept this 198 ton boulder up a beach . More than 16 million people were affected as storm surges of nearly 23 feet (7 metres) and waves of 16 feet (5 metres) smashed the coastline. Now researchers from the University of Cologne and the University of the Philippines, said the category five storm was so powerful that the waves it created dislodged some of the most massive boulders to be recorded. The largest weighed, around 198 ton (180 tonnes) and was rolled 150 feet (45 metres) up a slope of a beach on the south east coast of Samar. Measuring more than 29.5 feet long (9 metres) and 14.7 feet wide (4.5 metres), it was almost the same size as the largest animal on the planet, a blue whale. Dr Max Engel and his colleagues from the University of Cologne used satellite images taken before and after the typhoon to identify areas where boulders may have moved. They found another boulder weighing around 77 tons (70 tonnes) was thrown 150 feet by the storm surge while a 25.9 ton (23.5 tonnes ) boulder was torn from a cliff face and carried almost 20 feet above level. Several other boulders of around 18.7 tons (17 tonnes) were carried so far that they were finally dropped inland at heights of around 40 feet above sea level. The researchers found distinctive marks on the rock that showed they had been moved by the storm, including downward facing rock pools and patches of grass on the bottom sides of the boulder. The researchers discovered several large boulders had been carried up the beach by the storm waves . The storm was so powerful that sea water carried huge quantities of debris inland as it surged up the coast . Eastern Samar in central Philipinnes were among the most badly hit by typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 . Dr Engel, who presented the findings at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, said that it appeared the typhoon created protracted tsunami-like waves that pushed the enormous rocks up the beach. In a paper titled 'Storm surge of super typhoon Haiyan on Samar moved the largest boulder ever documented for a recent storm', he said: 'Downward-facing rock pools, grass patches, living barnacles, roots and soil staining on exposed former bottom sides, and fresh wood jammed under the rocks provide unambiguous evidence for sub-recent transport and overturning. 'We conclude that the geological legacy of Haiyan calls for a careful reconsideration of possible storm surge transport where boulders, based on their size, previously associated with tsunami impacts and storms, have been ruled out to be the cause.' He added: 'We currently think that storm surge was not the main process shifting the boulders but another long-wave phenomenon that is evolving from groups of extremely high and steep regular storm waves when interacting with the coral reef. 'This phenomenon obviously caused a tens of seconds to minute-long one-directional high-velocity flow in the area capable of transporting the giant boulders. 'The wave phenomenon has characteristics of a tsunami, but it is by no means a tsunami.' Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore also found Haiyan ripped rocks from reefs that line the coastline of Samar. They found a 99 ton (90 tonnes) boulder and several others weighing more than 66 tons (60 tonnes) had been dislodged from reef platforms close to Hernani on the Pacific coast of eastern Samar. Adam Switzer, who lead the Nanyang team, said: 'The large clasts on the Hernani coast provide further evidence that storm waves are capable of quarrying and transporting very large clasts.' The boulders were found on the south east coast of Samar, which was badly hit by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 . The boulder is the biggest rock proven to have been moved by waves during a storm surge or tsunami . Super typhoon Haiyan was a category five storm and is one of the most powerful tropical cyclones on record . Winds of 145mph created waves that measured up to 16 feet as typhoon Haiyan swept across the Philippines .","Boulder was rolled 150 feet up a beach in south east Samar in Philippines .

"A single mother of two from Los Angeles working as a McDonald's server has boldly taken on the fast-food giant as part of a growing labor movement demanding higher wages. Earlier this month, the woman known only as Maribel went on a strike against her employer. In a video released by BuzzFeed last week, Maribel recounts how she was brought to the US from her native Mexico when she was only 7 months old. Scroll down for video . Activist: Maribel, a single mother of two from Los Angeles, went on a strike against her employer McDonald's earlier this month . Movement: Maribel has joined a group of fast-food workers demanding higher wages and union rights . Leading the charge: Maribel was at the front of the pack when fast food servers marched on her McDonald's in downtown LA chanting slogans and waving signs . The McDonald's staffer lives in a modest house in LA's South Central neighborhood with her two kids and seven other relatives, including her grandmother and niece. Maribel currently earns $9.35 an hour, which she says is not enough to support her one-year-old son, Brandon, and two-year-old daughter, Kaitlin. ‘I need fifteen to buy my babies diapers, their wipies, their clothes,’ she explains. ‘Its hard with nine dollars per hour — you can’t do that. It’s really hard to pay rent.’ She goes on to say: ‘If I pay my rent, I leave my kids without their diapers.’ Breadwinner: Maribel has a 2-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son, and says the $9.35 an hour she currently earns is not enough to support her family . Tough choices: Maribel says if she pays her rent, there is almost no money left to buy diapers for her kids . Maribel, pictured with her mother (right) and fellow McDonald's worker, was brought to the US from Mexico when she was only 7 months old . On the same day, fast food workers walked off the job in more than 150 cities, including New York, Chicago and Pittsburgh. Protesters are pictured here givign the Mockingjay salute from the Hunger Games films . Earlier this month, Maribel joined a large group of fast-food workers calling for $15 per hour and the right to unionize. ‘We're gonna go show them that we're not scared, that we're here to fight for what we deserve,’ Maribel says in the video on the eve of the strike. On December 4, Maribel led a group of protesters on a march to her McDonald’s eatery in South Central waving signs and chanting slogans like ‘this is what democracy looks like!’ Maribel was joined at the protest by her mother, who also works at McDonald’s. With a yellow banner draped around her shoulder like a cape, Maribel says with a smile: 'It's really exciting to go into my own store.' On the same day, fast food workers walked off the job in more than 190 cities, including New York, Chicago and Washington DC. Workers like Maribel, pictured walking out of her MCDonald's branch, say they are fed up with pay that does not come close to keeping them out of poverty . For the first time since fast-food workers began walkouts two years ago, they were joined by workers from convenience stores and markets in 24 cities, the Fight for $15 campaign said in a statement. Employees in low-wage jobs and labor unions supporting them are pushing to raise the minimum hourly wage to $15 -- about double the current federal minimum of $7.25. Workers say they are fed up with pay that does not come close to keeping them out of poverty and the threat of retaliation from employers hostile to them joining or forming unions. The Fight for $15 movement has grown since a few hundred fast-food workers went on strike in New York in late November 2012 to push for a ""living wage"" of $15 an hour. In August 2013, fast-food workers launched their first national day-long labor strike, in 60 cities, and their outcry has increasingly resonated in national politics. Advocates of higher hourly pay say full-time workers are kept below the poverty threshold for a family of four at the current wage. Opponents say the protests are tainted because they involved major labor organizations. Fast-food chains say their locations are largely owned by independent operators who are responsible for pay rates of employees.","Mexican immigrant Maribel, a mother of two from Los Angeles, launched crusade against fast-food giant's minimum wage .

"A brawl involving three women erupted on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong yesterday when two of them complained to a mum that her baby was making too much noise. The women, all believed to be Chinese, were warned that the pilot would be forced to turn back and make an emergency landing if they didn't stop fighting. The dispute arose on an Air China flight  that took off at 9am after two women were awakened by the baby's cries and complained to 27-year-old mother, Chan Juan Sung. Scroll down for video . One of the women appears to have her head pushed into the overhead lockers as a brawl broke out . As the situation escalated, the two women reclined their seats fully backwards, which aggravated things  further. A scuffle ensued, with one of the women hitting on her head on the overhead locker, until cabin crew managed to step in and separate the women. Passenger Xiong Wan, 45, said: 'I was sitting right next to them when they started telling the woman to shut the baby up. 'She started shouting back at them and before I knew what was happening she leant over the seat and punched one of them. 'They then started hitting her and all hell broke loose. 'They were fighting, the baby was now screaming and other passengers were shouting. It was like some bizarre film.' The pilot on the Air China flight threatened to turn the plane around should the violence continue (File Photo) Thankfully for the other passengers on board, the flight landed at its scheduled time of 10:52am. Hong Kong police were waiting to interview passengers about the incident. Air China spokesman Daio Weimin said: ‘Passengers cannot behave like this. ‘Each and everyone must adhere to aviation laws to ensure a safe and comfortable flight for all.’ The past few days have seen an alarming number of incidents on Chinese planes. A man on board a Chinese domestic flight caused panic when he opened the emergency exit just before take-off as he 'wanted some fresh air.' Thai Air Asia says one of its flight attendants had a cup of hot water and noodles thrown in her face . The passenger was on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu, and although cabin crew managed to diffuse the situation quickly and the flight took off on time. Only days before, a Chinese man had opened the emergency exit and deployed the slide after wanting to 'get off quicker' from his China Eastern flight that landed at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan. Prior to this, a Chinese woman scalded a flight attendant by throwing a cup of hot noodles after finding out she wouldn't be sat next to her boyfriend. The incident occurred on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, and passengers were on hand to pull out their smartphones as the mid-air drama unfolded in front of them, snapping pictures as the injured flight attendant covered her face and shouted in pain.","Fight erupted on board flight from Chongqing to Hong Kong .

"Maureen Broadbent, 59, died from a blood clot just two days after medics sent her home from hospital saying nothing was wrong . A grandmother died from a blood clot just two days after medics sent her home from hospital saying nothing was wrong despite showing danger signs in tests. Maureen Broadbent, 59, from Leeds started suffering shortness of breath and heart palpitations after undergoing a knee operation in April last year. She was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary by her GP in June 2013, but staff said her blood tests were normal and sent her home where she collapsed and died from a pulmonary embolism. Her family have instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate after a coroner ruled in November this year that a risk assessment was 'inadequately completed'. The inquest at Wakefield Coroners' Court found there were 'subtle signs' of pulmonary thromboembolism - a blood clot in the artery that carries blood to the lungs - when she was admitted to the hospital. Daughter Michelle Pickup said: 'The anger does not let us move on. We still have no answers as to exactly what happened or why it went wrong. 'It was not her time and it shouldn't have happened. She was not ill, her death was because of something which could have been avoided.' Mrs Broadbent had a knee replacement operation at Chapel Allerton Hospital in April last year. The surgery was a success but a few months later she started to experience symptoms including heart palpitations and shortness of breath. She visited her GP twice and after the second visit in June 2013 she was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary for further tests. The next day, she was told her test results were normal and was sent home. But two days later she collapsed at the home she shared with her partner Derek Bell and could not be saved. Coroner David Hinchliffe said a risk assessment was 'inadequately completed' and the results of a blood test should have led to further procedures which would have diagnosed the condition. He said this was a 'missed opportunity' and that Mrs Broadbent should not have been discharged home because treatment may have prevented her death. Her family have instructed medical negligence lawyers to investigate after a coroner ruled in November that a risk assessment at Leeds General Infirmary was 'inadequately completed' Mrs Pickup said: 'Our mum is irreplaceable - to say her death came as a shock doesn't even come close. 'It has totally devastated our family, and to think that she could be with us today if she'd been given the proper medical care makes it even more difficult to cope with. 'We don't know what the hospital have implemented or what changes have occurred. We also want to ensure that any lessons are shared across the NHS so that no other families have to suffer like ours has.' A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are extremely sympathetic to the family of Mrs Broadbent and fully understand the distress they must be feeling. 'A detailed investigation was carried out by the trust following Mrs Broadbent's sad death. This identified lessons to be learned, which have been shared with staff and have been subsequently audited to ensure they are being complied with.' Katie Warner, a specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's, said: 'Maureen's entire family are understandably very distressed by their loss and have asked us to investigate whether Maureen's death could have been avoided if appropriate and timely treatment had been provided. 'We would like to thank the Coroner for taking the time to investigate the circumstances surrounding Maureen's death. 'We will continue to investigate the processes and procedures used at the hospital as Maureen's family are keen to ensure that lessons are learnt so that no other families have to lose their loved ones in such tragic circumstances.'

"A nine-year-old boy has become a victim of internet censors in China after writing a letter to the country's President telling him to lose some weight. A note  written by a primary school pupil Niu Ziru appeared on social media addressed to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, outlining his idea for the country to go on a space mission to Mars. But at the end of the letter, the student decided to give some health advice, saying: 'You could lose some weight. You don't have to look as skinny as Obama. Like Putin is okay!' Schoolboy Niu Ziru, nine, has been censored by the Chinese authorities after a letter he wrote for homework, in which he said the country's leader 'could lose some weight', was posted online . The note, which was done as part of a homework assignment, was never posted, but it was uploaded to Chinese sites by the child's father, and went viral. Users reposted the note across social media, and it eventually appeared on the sites of Zhengzhou Evening News and the state-owned Xinhua news agency. The boy's parents and his school in Zhengzhou said they did not expect his letter to receive so much attention. His teacher, Eileen Wang, told Sky News: 'It was weekend homework, for his Chinese assignment. A letter [written] to anyone or anything. He is a good student. 'At our school, students are welcomed to speak up... so they have crazy ideas like this.' Niu wrote the letter to encourage Chinese leader Li Jinping to create a space mission to Mars, but ended by saying he needed to go on a diet, adding: 'You don’t have to look as skinny as Obama. Like Putin is okay' However it seems that the Chinese authorities have failed to share the joke. The story is now missing from all news websites, while links to the stories on other websites appear to be broken or deleted. On blogging site Weibo a search for Niu Ziru brings up no results, while search engine Baidu is also unable to find either the story or the boy. Niu told the Zhengzhou Evening News that he had seen Xi and other leaders during the recent Asian leaders summit, and thought Xi had 'made Chinese people proud, except that he's a bit fat.' Dear Grandpa Xi Jinping, . Greetings! I’m a pupil from Zhengzhou, Henan Province. Today I want to talk to you about space. Everyone believes the next big challenge is space. I think so too. The moon, for sure has rich minerals, but it doesn’t have air and water and is definitely not suitable for human life. This is not a good place for a long stay. It’s time for China’s aerospace program to change directions. Let’s have a look at Mars. It has both air and glaciers, it's just as good a place as Earth. Eventually, the United States and Russia will no longer use the international space station and the US and Russia are planning full force to land on Mars. Even the European Union and India are joining the fun. Let’s also hurry up! Okay, let's move on to some lighter subjects. Xi Dada, you could lose some weight. You don’t have to look as skinny as Obama. Like Putin is okay! Best regards, . Wishing you good health . Niu Ziru .","Niu Ziru wrote letter to leader Xi Jinping as part of homework project .

"A grandfather who sawed off his hand while building a Wendy house for his two granddaughters has regained near perfect movement in his hand thanks to emergency surgery. Stan Smith, 60, from Hull, nearly lost his arm when his sleeve got dragged into a saw and chopped off his hand last summer. His panicked wife Gail had to hunt through the grass to find it and put it in a plastic bag for paramedics, as he desperately tried to stop blood gushing from the stump. After multiple surgeries, the DIY enthusiast's hand is back in almost perfect working condition. He has even put the Wendy house project on hold so he can build a 32m kitchen extension. Stan Smith, 60, managed to chop off his hand with a saw when he was building a Wendy house for his granddaughters. He was rushed to hospital for a seven hour operation which saved his hand . The inside of Mr Smith's wrist (pictured) bears just a few scars. He says he can now do most of the things he did before with his hand, although he has lost some dexterity . Mr Smith has had three operations in total and his hand is almost in perfect working condition. He has even bought a new saw so he can carry on doing DIY . Mr Smith said: 'At first, there was just all this gushing blood and I didn't know what had happened. 'Then I realised I didn't have a hand anymore. 'But you can't let little things like this stop you so I bought another saw as soon as I could. 'My wife wasn't quite so happy about that. Mr Smith had gone out into his garden to work on a wooden Wendy house as a surprise present for his two granddaughters Madelaine, seven, and Jasmine, five. Feeling a bit cold, he decided he needed a jumper and went back into the house to fetch one. But once he was back at the saw, his sleeve became trapped and the blade sliced off his hand. Keeping calm, Mr Smith, who teaches electrical engineering, managed to put pressure on his gushing wound and wander into the house to let his wife know that she needed to call 999. 'She knew exactly what I had done by the way I was holding my arm and she went into shock,' said Mr Smith. 'If I'd fainted, it could have been fatal as my wife was inside the house doing the cleaning and wouldn't have known a thing about it. 'I was calm and I stayed outside on the patio. When the ambulance arrived, I asked my wife to go and find my hand and put it in a plastic bag.' Just 20 minutes later Mr Smith arrived at Hull Royal Infirmary, with his hand in a bag. Plastic surgeon Alastair Platt explains that the situation was life threatening. 'Stan Smith was taken to the major resuscitation area of Accident and Emergency,' he told MailOnline. Plastic surgeon Alastair Platt, assisted by orthopaedic surgeon Niloy Roy and associate specialist Sameh Bibawy, of Hull Royal Infirmary, battled for seven hours to save Mr Smith's hand. From the moment he was rushed into hospital they were working against the clock, as the muscles in the hand can die within four hours. They carried out a complicated replantation procedure, which took seven hours. First, Mr Roy re-attached Mr Smith's bones with plates and screws. This is so the plastic surgeons have a stable surface to work on while they reattach the blood vessels, tendons and nerves. Mr Platt re-established the blood supply to the hand by reconnecting the blood vessels as soon as possible. This meant the hand was pink, and the tissues kept alive. Then, he reconnected 25 tendons and three major nerves using a microscope. The next day he performed another five hour operation to repair more tendons, and Mr Smith was sent home after a week. After a year of physiotherapy, Mr Smith had gained 70 per cent of movement in hand. Recently, he had a simple operation to repair some of the tendons, to give him a better grip. Mr Platt said Mr Smith's case was exceptional. He said: 'It's very variable whether you see full movement again. There are lots of factors that people cannot control, such as some people just have more scar tissue. 'Some you can control, however - the quality of the physiotherapy and the patient's determination. 'In this case we had good quality physio and a very determined patient. 'This is one of the cases I’m most proud of and I'm very satisfied I’ve got such a happy patient.' He advised anyone who has cut off a body part to wrap it up in cling film to keep it clean and to bring it to hospital immediately. 'It was life threatening because of the loss of blood. So doctors were working to keep his blood pressure stable and make sure he was getting fluids. 'You only have a short period - four hours - before the muscle in the hands start to die so we needed to operate soon.' They rushed Mr Smith into an emergency operation, called a 'replantation' procedure. Assisted by orthopaedic surgeon Niloy Roy and associate specialist Sameh Bibawy, Mr Platt battled  for seven hours to reattach his hand. First, Mr Roy re-attached Mr Smith's bones  with plates and screws. 'This is so we have a stable surface to work on to reattach the other bits,' Mr Platt said. MR Platt then worked to re-connect the blood vessels to restore the blood supply, so the muscles in the hand didn't die. Once this was done he reattached the tendons and the nerves. Mr Platt said: 'There were 25 tendons to repair and three major nerves. That's why it took so long. And a lot of it was was done down the microscope.' After another five-hour operation the next day, Mr Smith spent just five days in hospital before returning home, desperate to get back to his garden to carry on work. Incredibly, physiotherapy meant that within a week of being home he could wiggle the tips of his fingers and was back driving after three months. And less than a year later Mr Smith was back working his garden, this time on a kitchen extension for his home. He said: 'This hasn't put me off at all - you can't sit back and let accidents like this worry you - you've got to get on with life. 'I kept the tendons stretching and the muscles tensing and the movement has come back - it's 70 per cent of what it was originally and it came back naturally. 'People have said that I'm a medical miracle - my surgeon Mr Platt said the operation was remarkable and he was very proud of his work - and I do realise how very lucky I am. 'At the time I just understood what I'd done and what I had to do. 'There were times since when I thought I would never get the use of my hand again but, fortunately, because the treatment I've had, I can do most of the things I did before. 'The hospital and rehab teams have been absolutely fantastic. 'I've just had another operation to give me even more flexibility. 'Some more intricate things are harder to do because I don't have the same dexterity but I'm fine with lifting and carrying.' After the accident Mr Smith (left) went into the house to ask his wife Gail (right) to call an ambulance. She also had to find his hand and put it in a plastic bag before paramedics came to take Mr Smith to hospital . Mr Smith has put the 7ft Wendy house he was building (pictured) on hold, but has started a new project: building a 32ft extension for his home . Amazingly, the inside of Mr Smith's wrist bears just a few scars. There are hardly any signs of the accident, which occurred in May 2013,  on the back of his hand. Now, he has even bought a new saw. He said: 'My hand was still on the saw before Gail went to fetch it so we threw that one away. 'I bought another as soon as I could - I can't do my DIY without it. 'Gail wasn't too pleased. The whole experience has probably been more traumatic for her than me. 'But it's like falling off a horse, you need to get straight back on again..' 'Obviously my granddaughters were worried when they found out even though they were very young. 'The Wendy house is still waiting to be finished because I've been busy with a much bigger project - the extension - but I'll be onto it as soon as the weather picks up a bit. 'I'll just make sure I roll my sleeves up before I start.'","Stan Smith was building a Wendy house for his two granddaughters .

"Worriers can be kept awake at night replaying the day, or imagining all the possible worst case scenarios in their lives. But they can at least take comfort in the fact that this behaviour could be a sign of intelligence. More than 125 students were surveyed about their mood, anxiety levels and intelligence levels - and those found to worry the most, were also the smartest. Researchers from Ontario's Lakehead University scored 126 students on both the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Those who ranked high for anxiety on the CTAS were also the most verbally intelligent, according to the WAIS. Stock image pictured . The research was carried out at Ontario's Lakehead University, led by Alexander Penney. The researchers surveyed 126 students about their anxiety levels, depression, overall mood, social skills, rumination and intelligence by gauging their responses to set questions. People who are verbally intelligent are better at reading and writing, and have stronger verbal reasoning skills. By comparison, non-verbally intelligent people are better ‘hands-on’ learners and pick up skills using non-verbal clues. Experts believe verbally intelligent people spend more time relaying past and future events, trying to make sense of them, for example. This means they remember events, conversations and fears in greater detail than non-verbally intelligent people. People who are non-verbal tend to pick up non-verbal clues, and live more ‘in the moment’ so have little need to replay situations. The majority (77 per cent) of participants were women. Based on their answers, each of the students were then ranked on the both the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The higher scores on the respective tests indicate more severe test anxiety, and higher verbal intelligence. People who are verbally intelligent are better at reading and writing, and have stronger verbal reasoning skills. By comparison, non-verbally intelligent people are better ‘hands-on’ learners and pick up skills using non-verbal clues. In the study, those who ranked highest on CTAS were also the most verbally intelligent, according to the WAIS. However, the students who scored highly for non-verbal intelligence were found to worry less. Experts believe verbally intelligent people spend more time relaying past and future events, trying to make sense of them, for example. This means they remember events, conversations and fears in greater detail than non-verbally intelligent people. People who are verbally intelligent are better at reading, while non-verbally intelligent people are better ‘hands-on’ learners. Experts believe verbally intelligent people spend more time replaying  events, but people who are non-verbal tend to  live more ‘in the moment’ and so have little need to replay events in their heads . People who are non-verbal tend to pick up non-verbal clues, and live more ‘in the moment’ so have little need to replay situations. ‘It is possible that more verbally intelligent individuals are able to consider past and future events in greater detail, leading to more intense rumination and worry,’ said the researchers. ‘Individuals with higher non-verbal intelligence may be stronger at processing the non-verbal signals from individuals they interact with in the moment, leading to a decreased need to re-process past social encounters.’","Researchers surveyed 126 students about anxiety and intelligence .

"A single ISIS militant is suspected to be alone responsible for gunning down at least 150 women and girls, including some who were pregnant, because they refused to marry jihadists. Abu Anas Al-Libi executed the women before burying their bodies in mass graves in Fallujah in the Iraqi province of Al Anbar, the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights said in a statement. It is thought he killed the women, most of whom were Yazidi, because they refused to enter into sham temporary marriages with Islamic State fighters, where they would effectively be treated as sex slaves. ISIS fighters holding the Al-Qaeda flag with 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' written on it. A single militant from the group is believed to be alone responsbile for gunning down 150 women . 'At least 150 females, including pregnant women, were executed in Fallujah by a militant named Abu Anas Al-Libi after they refused to accept jihad marriage,' the statement said. 'Many families were also forced to migrate from the province's northern town of Al-Wafa after hundreds of residents received death threats.' The statement went on to say that the militants then turned a mosque in Fallujah into a prison, where they held hundreds of men and women. Al- Libi is not the extremist with the same name who is alleged to have helped carry out East Africa's embassy bombings in 1998 that killed 224 people in Kenya and Tanzania. ISIS fighters have taken thousands of women and children as captives, especially around 2,500 women from the minority Yazidi sect in Iraq. It is thought that most of the executed women were from the Yazidi sect in Iraq (pictured) A UN report last month said these women were then taken as far as Raqqa in Syria and sold to ISIS fighters, or given as gifts to their leaders. Some of them, it claims, were then used for sex. It was recently revealed that ISIS has published a shocking guidebook for its fighters on how to rape women and girls they had taken into slavery. The Arabic manual, titled Questions And Answers On Taking Captives And Slaves, instructs ISIS fighters on how to buy and sell women and girls who have been captured in war as booty.

The document, published by the Research and Fatwa Department of ISIS, gives its fighters the green light to turn captured women into slaves and concubines, and even give them as gifts to one another. It was circulated on the Twitter accounts of senior IS leaders and was distributed by masked IS fighters outside a large mosque in Iraq's second city Mosul, which is controlled by the group. The document says that all 'unbelieving' women, including Jews and Christians, can be taken as captives and sold as slaves. However, it prohibits the enslavement of Muslim women, even if they have become apostates. ISIS controls  parts of Iraq, as well as large swathes of northern and eastern Syria. This week, the bodies of 230 people killed by the militant group were found in a mass grave uncovered by their relatives in Syria's Deir Ezzor province. The discovery brings the number of Shaitat tribal members slain during the jihadists' summer advance in Deir Ezzor province near Iraq to more than 900, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based group said it had 'learned from trusted sources that more than 230 bodies have been found in a mass grave in the desert near Al-Kashkiyeh in the east of Deir Ezzor'. The 'vast majority' were civilians, many of them executed in cold blood after the tribe rose up against the Islamic State after it had driven out rival jihadists and rebels from the area.","Abu Anas Al-Libi is alleged to have executed the women in Fallujah in Iraq .

"A jailer's girlfriend is believed to have shot and killed herself with a gun the deputy handed to her following a heated argument in their bedroom. Nikki Guined took the 9mm-Glock pistol from Dwight Buchanan, 20, while partying in their Monroe, Georgia, home and pulled the trigger during the drunken row last Wednesday. The 20-year-old cashier repeatedly asked Buchanan, who has trained with the U.S. Army infantry, to hand her the weapon while saying: 'Don't you trust me?' Nikki Guined, 20, (left) took the 9mm-Glock pistol from Dwight Buchanan (far right) following a party in their Monroe, Georgia, home and pulled the trigger after a drunken row in bed . The cashier repeatedly asked Buchanan, who has trained with the US Army infantry, to hand her the weapon while saying to him: 'Don't you trust me?' Initially Buchanan took the magazine out and gave her the gun unloaded, but Guined told him to put it back. According to WSBTV he put one round in the chamber, which is when she grabbed the gun shot herself in the jaw. The deputy told police that Guined had threatened to leave him earlier in the day as they partied with another couple and a visitor, but the pair had reconciled and went to the bedroom. When investigators arrived, they found the house covered in beer cans. A report by Deputy J. Ricks stated that Guined had been drinking while Buchanan could not remember the basis of the fight. Three people were said to have been in the house at the time but the group only heard the gunshot and not what the pair were arguing about. Buchanan had been employed as a jailer for 13 months and has a good record but has now been placed on paid administrative leave following the incident. Sheriff Joe Chapman and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation are now looking into the concerning shooting to find out whether it was accidental. Investigators found the home the pair shared with another couple covered in beer cans following the shooting. According to the police report, Guined had been drinking all day . He said: 'That is why we're having the GBI look at this. We want to make sure everything is …transparent and I want the family of the girl to know we are doing everything we can so they don't have any questions. 'Alcohol was involved, you just don't know what led up to it. We don't know what she was thinking. I can't sit here and say that he was at fault in any way or wasn't at fault. 'We’ll look at all the evidence and all the facts and we will determine what his future holds.' Authorities are also looking into the background of the gun as jailers such as  Buchanan are not issued a service weapon. On Facebook, Buchanan posted pictures of himself training with the U.S. Army Infantry in Georgia.

"Boko Haram militants are reported to have  kidnapped 185 women and children, after slaughtering 32 people in an attack on a remote village in northeast Nigeria. Two officials, who requested anonymity, said the group gathered the women and children together and took them away in trucks after burning most of the village with petrol bombs . 'After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters,' said Mukhtar Buba, who fled Gumsuri to the Borno state capital Maiduguri. Scroll down for video . An image grab made on October 31, 2014 from a video obtained by AFP shows the leader of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram Abubakar Shekau (Center) delivering a speech . Details took four days to emerge because the mobile phone network has largely collapsed in the area roughly 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Maiduguri, and many of the roads are impassable. Gumsuri is located on the road that leads to Chibok, where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls from a school in April. One of the local officials said the village had previously been protected against Boko Haram violence by a strong vigilante force, but that they were overpowered in Sunday's attack. 'For the past one year, the insurgents have made several attempts to attack Gumsuri but were resisted by the gallant youths of the village,' he told AFP. 'It is sad that on Sunday, the village was subdued,' he added. Militant Islamists Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls  in April from a school in Chibok, which - like Gasmuri - is located in the northeast of Nigeria . The military and police were not immediately available for comment. Boko Haram has repeatedly attacked the vigilante forces which have formed across the northeast, describing them as legitimate targets for siding with Nigeria's military. Nigeria on Wednesday sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny, assault, cowardice and refusing to fight Islamic extremists. The court-martial charges all were connected to the soldiers' refusal to deploy to recapture three towns seized by  Boko Haram in August, according to the charge sheet. The lawyer for the condemned men, Femi Falana, said the 54 soldiers were convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad. He said five soldiers were acquitted. They all were accused of 'conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of 7 Division, Nigerian Army,' which is on the front line of the fighting in the northeast of the West African nation. Twelve soldiers were sentenced to death in September for mutiny and attempted murder of the commanding officer in the counter-insurgency. They blamed him for the deaths of an unknown number of soldiers ambushed and killed after they were ordered to drive at night on a road frequently attacked by the militants. Troops regularly complain that they are outgunned by Boko Haram, they are not paid in full and they are abandoned on the battlefield without enough ammunition or food. The other local official said the insurgents 'stormed the village in a convoy of vehicles (armed) with petrol bombs' and heavy weapons. Buba, the resident, said more than half the village had been destroyed. 'The terrorists mercilessly attacked us and killed at will,' he told AFP. Borno is the epicentre of Boko Haram's five-year uprising aimed at creating a strict Islamic state in northern Nigeria. Thousands of people have been killed in the five-year Islamic uprising that has driven some 1.3 million people from their homes, with tens of thousands fleeing across borders into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Boko Haram has seized a string of towns and villages and in August declared an Islamic caliphate along Nigeria's border with Cameroon. In recent weeks, Special Forces have been deployed and have recaptured at least four towns with help from air raids, traditional hunters and vigilantes. The turnaround comes as Nigerians prepare for Feb. 14 presidential elections that are expected to be the most closely contested since decades of military dictatorship ended in 1999. President Goodluck Jonathan, 57, is being challenged by former military dictator Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, 72. Buhari is being touted by an opposition coalition as more likely to succeed in curbing the insurgency and in fighting corruption that Jonathan is accused of fueling. Attacks similar to Sunday's violence in Gumsuri have escalated over the last 18 months, with the insurgents taking control of more than two dozen towns and villages in the region. Kidnappings have also increased, part of a campaign by Boko Haram to boost its supply of child fighters, porters and young women who have reportedly been used as sex slaves. The military has offered repeated assurances that the uprising will soon be contained, but so far there have been few signs of progress. Gumsuri is located in the northeast of Nigeria, roughly 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Maiduguri .

"Steph Harper, 34, from Flint in North Wales said she nearly died when an ectopic pregnancy ruptured hours after she was sent home from hospital . A mother claims she nearly died when an ectopic pregnancy ruptured hours after she was sent home from hospital. Blaming delays in receiving treatment, Steph Harper said she fears the ordeal has rendered her infertile. Surgeons were forced to remove a fallopian tube after the 34-year-old lost four pints of blood during emergency surgery at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales. After suffering excruciating stomach pain, the mother-of-four called an ambulance. Within an hour a paramedic arrived at the family's home in Flint. With no double-manned ambulance crews available to transport Mrs Harper to hospital, the paramedic drove her in his rapid response vehicle. There she faced delays of around an hour because of a backlog of patients waiting in ambulances to be admitted into the A&E department. Doctors told the 34-year-old she was likely suffering an ectopic pregnancy or a urinary infection. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants itself outside the wombm usually in one of the fallopian tubes. Mrs Harper was sent home the following morning and asked to return for a scan. But within hours the pain had become so bad, the Mrs Harper had collapsed and could no longer speak. She was rushed back to hospital but once again delays admitting patients into A&E meant she was left waiting in an ambulance. When her condition deteriorated, a triage nurse assessed in her the back of the vehicle, before rushing her to the gynaecology ward where surgeons took her straight into the operating theatre. Mrs Harper claims doctors told her she was just an hour from death when she received treatment, and warned she may never have another child. Scroll down for video . She said: 'I began to have awful stomach pains. I called an ambulance and an hour later a paramedic car turned up at our house. 'They did the usual observations and gave me gas and air to try and ease the pain. 'After 45 minutes the paramedic still couldn't get an ambulance so he had to take me to Glan Clwyd in the back of his car.' Her husband Colin, 35, was with her throughout her ordeal. He said when they arrived at the hospital, there were six ambulances queuing outside, waiting to hand over patients. Mrs Harper was transferred to an ambulance but it was several hours before she was admitted into A&E. She added: 'It was a cold night but the heater had to be turned off as it was fuming out the neighbouring ambulance. 'I was very frightened as I didn't know what was happening to me – why I was in so much pain.' After a long and uncomfortable night, Mrs Harper was booked in for a scan, given antibiotics and sent home early the following morning. But within hours, the pain had become unbearable and Mr Harper dialled 999 again. He claims he was told that someone would ring him back and 20 minutes later took a call from a nurse who told Mr Harper to take her to hospital himself. He said: 'Steph took a dozen steps towards the stairs and started to feel faint so we rushed her back to bed and phoned 999 again to get an ambulance. 'The ambulance turned up along with a rapid response vehicle 10 minutes later. 'Three paramedics came upstairs and tried to ask Steph questions but she was in too much pain to speak. 'Steph's mother told them she needed to go back to hospital for a scan for the ectopic pregnancy but one of the paramedics was adamant she only had a water infection and told us to either take Steph ourselves or ring the GP for stronger painkillers. 'The GP told the paramedic to take her straight to hospital.' Mrs Harper claims she was twice forced to wait in ambulances outside Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl before being seen by medics in A&E. She claims the delays are to blame for her condition becoming so severe. The hospital said it is investigating the circumstances . After arriving at A&E, the couple said they were forced to wait in the ambulance again, because there were no beds available. Mrs Harper's blood pressure began to drop and she quickly began to lose colour. A triage nurse came out to see her and had her taken immediately to the gynaecology ward where she was soon rushed into theatre. She added: 'I am very angry as if I was diagnosed earlier it could have prevented such an extreme operation, and I wouldn't be left unable to have more children or other abdominal surgery. 'They also told me that another hour and I could have been dead. It is terrifying and these problems need to be highlighted.' Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said in a statement: 'We have received correspondence from Mrs Harper on this matter and are investigating the concerns she has raised to establish whether the treatment provided was appropriate in relation to the symptoms that she presented with. 'We will respond to her as soon as this is completed.' Sonia Thompson, interim head of operations for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) area, said: 'We were very sorry to hear about Mrs Harper's experience, and take matters such as this extremely seriously. 'Although Mrs Harper has not contacted the Welsh Ambulance Service with her concerns, we will work with our colleagues at BCUHB to investigate the issues raised.'","Steph Harper was 6 weeks pregnant  when she suffered awful stomach pain .

"When Michael Ware's 15-year-old daughter killed three friends in a tragic Labor Day weekend car crash, her father told police that she took the SUV without his permission. It's now been revealed that Ware was lying, and actually encouraged his unlicensed daughter to go for the joy ride to a local barbecue restaurant with five friends - as long as she brought him back a sandwich. Now both father and daughter are facing charges for the crash that killed 15-year-old Pennsylvania boys Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney and Ryan Lesher the morning of August 30. Responsibility: A 15-year-old girl from Westchester, New York killed three boys of the same age in a car crash last labor day weekend.  It was originally reported that the driver, who did not have a license, took the car without permission. It has since been revealed that her father, Michael Ware, let her driver her friends in his SUV that day and even asked her to bring him back a breakfast sandwich . Victims: Michael Ware was arraigned Wednesday on several charges related to the August 30 crash which claimed the lives of 15-year-old Pennsylvania boys Cullen Keffer (left), Shamus Digney (center) and Ryan Lesher (right) On Wednesday, Ware was arraigned in court on charges of involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of children, welfare endangerment, making false reports and allowing an unauthorized person to drive his SUV. He is out on $100,000 bail. His daughter, who turns 16 on Saturday, was also arraigned this week, but since her case is in juvenile court, the charges have not been publicly released. Ware and his daughter were charged after two of the friends who survived the wreck, came forward to tell a different story than what was originally reported at the crash scene. A 16-year-old girl who was vacationing with the Wares says the father allowed his daughter, who was not licensed at the time, to drive her friends in the 2001 Chevrolet Suburban to a local barbecue restaurant. She says Ware's dad walked them out to the car and even asked them to bring back a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich while seeing them off. Furthermore, she says her friend drove most of the journey from their suburb north of New York City to the Poconos  house. The teen says that morning, she and Ware's daughter went to Dunkin' Donuts around 9:30am and then returned to the house. The girls then went to pick up the boys staying at Lesher's house. Lesher had friends Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney, Ryan Lesher and another 15-year-old male friend from Council Rock South High School in Newton, Pennsylvania spending the weekend with him. Classmates: Keffer, Digney and Lesher were all sophomores at Council Rock South High School in Newton, Pennsylvania . On the way back from the restaurant, the teen was speeding when she rounded a corner and lost control of the SUV, which went off road and then flipped to land on the driver's side. The driver, her female friend and Lesher's other high school friend were able to escape the vehicle while Lesher, Keffer and Digney were trapped. Witness Marie Drobnicki, who lives on the road where the crash happened, told police that she heard boys' voices yelling 'slow down' before she heard the SUV flip. Lesher's friend who survived the accident also confirmed that the driver was 'flying' and that he and his friends told her to 'slow down,' according to court documents. Drobnicki ran to the scene and says she found one boy lying in the road, another pinned under the SUV and one who looked dead, lying on her lawn. Keffer died at the scene while Digney and Lesher passed away later that day at the hospital. Michael Ware arrived at the scene soon after the crash and told police that he was cleaning his home that morning when his daughter took the car without his permission. His daughter overheard the statement, and says she and her friend 'thought they were supposed to say they had the car without permission so as not to get him in trouble'. His daughter even dramatically admitted to speeding and asked police to arrest her. 'I was driving too fast ; arrest me,' she told police according to court documents, while holding her hands out in front of her 'as if waiting to be handcuffed'. Police found a breakfast sandwich in the vehicle, the one Michael Ware asked for, but didn't realize the  'evidentiary value' at the time. 'This was a horrific tragedy and, unfortunately, one that could have so easily been prevented,' Wayne County District Attorney Janine Edwards said in a press release, reported by Calkins Media. 'The law must be followed in order to prevent such a tragedy in the future.'","A 15-year-old girl from Westchester, New York was driving her dad's SUV the morning of August 30 when she lost control and the vehicle flipped .

"Vladimir Putin on Thursday admitted he is in love, fuelling rumours over a relationship with Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva. Denying he had 'completely gone wild' in his romantic life, the divorced strongman revealed  that he 'loves' and is loved in return, but refused to disclose the identity of his mystery partner. If true, it could mean that Russia's 'most eligible man' is no longer available. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin (left) has told journalists that he 'loves' and 'is loved' by someone, fueling rumours that he is in a relationship with gymnast Alina Kabayeva (right) though he refused to reveal a name . Putin has been leading bachelor's life for more than a year since he split with wife Lyudmila after 30 years of marriage. The subject of Putin's private life has been seen as taboo in Moscow but yesterday he was asked by a journalist at his annual press conference if he had time for the opposite sex. The 62 year old replied: 'I do, I tell you'. By contrast, when reports first emerged six years ago linking him to Kabayeva, now 31, he angrily denounced 'those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others' lives'. It is more than a year since he broke from Lyudmila, mother of his two grown-up daughters who are never seen in public. Milady: Dashing Putin shakes hands with Miss Kabayeva during a meeting with athletes in 2004 .

"Airlines affected by a massive disruption at London airports are to be financially compensated after they were forced to cancel flights and pay for hotel rooms for stranded travellers, who are being denied compensation of their own. Last Friday’s air traffic control computer glitch created chaos for passengers as 120 flights had to be cancelled and a further 500 were delayed by an average of 45 minutes while London airspace was shut. It was all due to an 'unprecedented' computer failure at the headquarters of UK air traffic control company Nats at Swanwick, Hampshire. Scroll down for video . More than 100 flights were cancelled and a further 500 were delayed during the disruption . British Airways provided hotel accommodation to passengers who were caught up in the disruption . In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, Nats did not say how much the airlines will receive. The agency said: ’NATS confirms that there will be a financial consequence for the company from the delay caused by the technical problem at Swanwick on 12 December 2014. ‘Under the company’s regulatory performance regime, customers will receive a rebate on charges in the future. ‘The amount is being is calculated and will be notified to customers in due course.’ The disruption was caused by an 'unprecedented' computer failure at the Swanwick headquarters of Nats . Cancellations and delays were reported across the UK, and Heathrow was the worst-hit airport with 100,000 passengers affected. Passengers whose flights were cancelled or delayed are set to be denied compensation because of an EU loophole that allows airlines to claim the disruption was 'beyond their control', The Mail on Sunday reported. But Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said passengers should be entitled to compensation. British Airways provided hotel accommodation to passengers who were caught up in the disruption. And passengers who were scheduled to travel last Friday evening from Heathrow, Gatwick or London City Airport were offered the option to either rebook their flight for a later date or claim a full refund. Heathrow was the worst-hit airport with 100,000 passengers affected by last week's computer glitch . Passengers queue for information at London City Airport after airspace over the capital was closed . Nats’ announcement comes a day after the agency’s bosses appeared before the House of Commons Transport Committee to explain the computer failure. Nats chief executive officer Richard Deakin apologised to travellers and said his company’s contingency and back-up plans worked well. He told the committee: ‘Any complex system will have failures,’ adding that it would be ‘unrealistic’ to expect there would be no failures. Mr Deakin appeared alongside Nats operations managing director Martin Rolfe and Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has already launched an independent inquiry into the computer failure and is expected to report back by the end of March. Mr Rolfe told MPs that the piece of equipment that failed last week dated from the mid-1990s and had dealt with 20 million flights and had been upgraded continually. Earlier this week, the committee heard testimony from Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who described the flight delays as ‘unacceptable’ and promised a ‘highly independent’ inquiry. Passengers whose flights were cancelled or delayed last Friday are set to be denied compensation . Asked if he agreed that the failure was ‘unacceptable’, Mr Deakin said: ‘For the passengers who got caught up in all this, yes, it was unacceptable, and by implication it was unacceptable for us as well. ‘We are not proud of what happened. We are proud of how we responded.’ There have been calls for Nats chief executive officer Richard Deakin to lose his bonuses . Mr Deakin denied a suggestion that he was ‘very, very complacent’ over the matter. MP Paul Flynn is among those who have called for Mr Deakin to lose his bonuses. During questioning Mr Deakin confirmed that he received a £1.05million pay package, including a £272,000 bonus, for the 12 months ending last March. But the bonus was cut by 12 per cent due to a flight disruption caused by another Swanwick problem in December 2013. He said bonuses are linked to performance and Nats’ remuneration committee will decide if this year’s bonus will be cut over last week’s disruption. He told the committee: ‘I can guarantee that this particular problem will not happen again but I cannot honestly sit here and say we will never have a computer glitch again.’ Mr Deakin said the latest figures showed 99.7 per cent of flights using UK air space face no delays. Of the 0.3 per cent that do, the average delay is 26 minutes. Mr Rolfe, meanwhile, disagreed with a suggestion that Nats’ systems were ‘fundamentally flawed’. Following last week’s disruption Business Secretary Vince Cable had questioned Nats’ investment levels. Mr Deakin said there was no question of putting profit before investment and that investment levels were between 1.4 and 1.9 times higher than before the company was privatised. He denied any suggestion that Nats’ systems were ‘ancient or antiquated’. He said: ‘Just because technology is “old”, it does not necessarily mean that it is not fit for purpose.’","Nats has announced that airlines are to be financially compensated .

"Sentenced: Marckenson Chery, 29, of North Lauderdale, Florida, has been jailed for 12 years for having cyber-sex sessions with a 15-year-old girl via Skype . A 29-year-old retail worker has been sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for having cyber-sex sessions with a 15-year-old girl on Skype. Marckenson Chery of North Lauderdale, Florida, first met the victim from San Francisco on the anonymous online chat site Omegle before they started video conferencing. The girl's horrified father became suspicious, confiscated her smartphone and discovered the '143 pages' worth of sexually-explicit conversations the pair had. He then handed the information from exchanges Chery and his daughter had over two months to federal agents who subsequently arrested him. Using the screen name 'Swag likeus Robinson', he told the girl he was 21. However, according to the Sun-Sentinel she constantly reminded him that she was only 15. Authorities said that Chery would convince the victim to get undressed and masturbate, while she would watch him perform sex acts on himself. Following an investigation involving Homeland Security, Chery was arrested in April. He pleaded guilty to one count of enticement of a minor in September.

"A tourist visiting Disneyland in California had a lucky escape after a rain-sodden section of hotel roof collapsed on her bed while she was asleep. The un-named woman was in the Anaheim Alamo Hotel when a section of the ceiling fell onto her bed. According to eyewitnesses, the woman suffered facial wounds and was bleeding from her mouth. She was taken away to hospital by ambulance. Scroll down for video . The ceiling section collapsed on top of the bed at the hotel, pictured,  in Anaheim, California on Wednesday . The female victim was taken away in an ambulance after she was struck on Wednesday morning . Paulo Ang, pictured, from Birbeck, California said the ceiling collapse was 'a very scary situation' The victim was visiting California from Vancouver in Canada for a trip to Disneyland. Paolo Ang from Birbeck, California said: 'We were sleeping and I heard a noise, like a huge bang. It was like someone had just dropped over from the bed. 'It was really loud and the daughter's mom came over to our room and knocked on the door and we saw that her chin was like badly bruised. It was a scary situation.' Anaheim Fire Department attended the scene after the roof collapsed around 2am yesterday. The woman was taken to UCI Medical Center for treatment. It is understood that the hotel roof had become waterlogged after two days of heavy storms in Southern California. The water seeped through the outer layers of the roof and soaked the dry-lining beneath. After several hours, a section of the ceiling failed and fell without warning on the bed below. Footage from the scene shows a section of ceiling about four feet wide and three feet long failed during the storm. Anaheim Police Lieutenant Bob Dunn told Metro: 'It is very unusual. It doesn’t rain much here in California so we don’t have instances like this occurring frequently.' The ceiling collapsed at the Alamo Inn in Anaheim, California  in the early hours of Wednesday morning . Part of Route 91 in Orange County California had to be cleared when mud and rocks slid onto the roadway .

"There are a host of amazing things to see beneath the sea - as young photographer Bertie Gregory's stunning images prove. Documenting life beneath the waves of the Red Sea, Bertie's images show the startling variety of life that can be found in the world's oceans. Since graduating in Zoology from the University of Bristol in July, Bertie's 'day job' has been stalking big cats with renowned photographer Steve Winter. Scroll down for video . Bertie Gregory captured some spectacular sights in his Red Sea dive, including this open-mouthed lionfish . The avid photographer and diver was on hand to capture octopuses hunting deep in the Red Sea, with fish cornered and eaten . Documenting life beneath the waves of the Red Sea, Bertie's images show the startling variety of life that can be found in the world's oceans . However, when it came to taking a break he decided to indulge his passion for marine wildlife and signed onto a 'liveaboard' diving trip, which saw him spend a week onboard a boat far from land diving up to four times a day. Bertie said: 'For me the best thing about underwater wildlife photography is the intimacy. In the majority of cases when I'm photographing on land the animals don't know I'm there. I'm hidden in a hide, shooting them from a distance with a long telephoto lens. 'Under the water I don't have the luxury of sitting in a hide and waiting for hours on end for an animal to turn up. Furthermore, the more water there is between me and my subject the less clear and colour rich the image. So to get great images I have to have close-up, in your face encounters with these weird and wonderful creatures.

A diver explores the tile filled cargo hold of the Chrisoula K wreck during the exhilarating Red Sea dive . 'Some say that taking a camera down on a dive takes away from the experience. You're so engrossed in flash settings and shutter speeds that you miss things. I couldn't disagree more. 'Because getting 'the shot' takes time and experimentation, on a typical dive I might spend time with just two or three subjects, rather than zooming round on a whistle-stop tour. 'Taking a camera down with me and spending a lot of time in one place enables me to spot things I might have otherwise missed.' According to Bertie a classic example of this happened while he was following a lionfish and suddenly spotted a tiny fish poking its head out of a host anemone.

He added: 'I had the wrong lens on to really get the best out of the opportunity, but even so I put my little finger in the shot to give a sense of scale. It was only after 2 or 3 shots that I then noticed the equally tiny eel, posing in its hole just to the left of the anemone'. Meanwhile, his decision to hang around and watch a stationary octopus paid off when it began to hunt. 'My patience paid off as it soon began to hunt: instead of swimming, it crawled across the coral purposefully using its eight muscular tentacles. 'Fish were fleeing in all directions but some foolishly chose not to run but instead, hide in little crevices. The octopus then stabbed its tentacles into every escape hole in the rock before expanding the membrane between its arms forming a huge balloon. 'Once cornered like this, the fish's fate was sealed, quite literally, sucked into the octopus' beak in the centre of its arms.'","Bertie Gregory took on the dive after graduating recently in zoology from Bristol University .

"For families planning a ski trip in Europe this Christmas, they are being urged to compare costs before they book. Doing so could save a family of four as much as £328 on a week's ski passes - simply by opting for Germany as opposed to France. The latest research shows substantial savings in other countries, as well: €58.50 (£46) will buy a six-day pass for a child in Italy, but in France, the same child's pass will run €200 (£159). Families can save over £300 by opting for a German ski getaway (pictured)  instead of heading to France . Outside of the Eurozone, the best bang for your buck can be found in Pamporovo, Bulgaria (pictured) The latest research from leading travel money provider, International Currency Exchange (ICE), has also found that a family of four (two adults and two children) could wind up paying just €486 (£385) for six day ski passes in Germany. A great deal, when compared to the €900 (£713) it would cost in France for the same time period. This is a saving of €414 (£328) or 85 per cent. Germany comes out on top for value within the Eurozone, while Pamporovo in Bulgaria, though outside the Eurozone, is the cheapest of all resort costs studied. France is the priciest of many European ski resorts with six day ski passes for a family of four topping €900 . By opting for Germany instead of Courchevel (pictured), a family of four could save up to 85 per cent . In Pamporovo, a six day ski pass will come in at just €114 (£90) - less than half the cost of a pass in France or Switzerland. Koko Sarkari, chief operating officer of ICE said: 'Ski pass costs are simply part and parcel of any skiing holiday but can make a big dent in the holiday budget.'","Research shows that four six-day ski passes will run €486 in Germany .

London is the most popular place to be for the final countdown, followed by Edinburgh and Amsterdam.

The only long-haul destinations to make the list are Dubai and New York. The only long-haul destinations to make the list are Dubai, which came sixth, and New York,  at eighth .

However, at an average of £241 on 31st December, Hogmanay price hikes are significantly higher than those for the Fringe Festival.

With their average age of 71, the women have gone one better than Calendar Girls movie stars Helen Mirren and Julie Walters who were in their 50s when the film was shot. Grandmother Jenny Stephens, 72, of Denbigh, North Wales, said: 'At our age, everything goes south but I don't care. Life is too short to worry. 'Between us all we have racked up 1,053 years but I think we all look fabulous for our age.'

"A Russian tourist has been hospitalised with severe lacerations to his leg, after being hit by a speedboat while swimming in Phuket. Sergey Kuzennyy, 55, was swimming outside of a dedicated swimming zone when he was struck by the blades of a parasailing speedboat's propeller on Wednesday, said Phuket Marine Office Chief Phuripat Theerakulpisut. Mr Kuzennyy suffered five deep lacerations to his left leg and remains in Mission Hospital in Bangkok. Sergey Kuzennyy, 55, was hit by a parasailing speedboat's propeller near Kata Noi in Phuket . Speaking on behalf of Mr Kuzennyy, Maria Lukashevich said: 'I was contacted by Mr Kuzennyy and his wife to help them translate, but I was not there when the accident occurred' 'Mr Kuzennyy said that he was swimming at about 5pm on Wednesday at Kata Noi and that he had no idea that he was in an area that swimming was not allowed. 'I would personally like to ask Phuket officials to take action and prevent any further accidents. Incidents like this might prevent tourists from coming here.' The incident coincides with new rules for jet-ski and parasailing operators being rubber stamped by Phuket Governor Nisit Jansomwong. The Russian tourist was hit five times by the propeller and was taken to Mission Hospital in Bangkok . Kata Noi beach in Phuket Thailand where My Kuzennyy was stuck is a popular spot with holidaymakers . However, the plans, which were pushed through  last week, create clearly designated swim zones and jet-ski/boating zones only in  Patong, although there are plans to roll the rules out to other areas of Phuket too. 'The new rules will first be enforced in Patong. We will later introduce them at Kata-Karon and other beaches in Phuket,' Governor Nisit said. Marine Office staff concluded that Mr Kuzennyy was swimming in a speedboat zone but Mr Phuripat said that he would look at what safety measures could be taken in addition to those that were implemented earlier this month. Incident coincides with new rules for jet-ski and parasailing operators being rubber stamped in Phuket . Marine Office staff concluded that Mr Kuzennyy was swimming in a speedboat zone . Included in the new set of rules to eventually be applied at all provincial beaches is that boats and jet-skis not approaching or departing from the beach must be operated 300m from shore. Mr Phuripat did not elaborate on whether or not Mr Kuzennyy was swimming beyond the swim zone, or if he was swimming in a beach-approach zone. The victim and speedboat owner are planning to settle compensation outside of the legal system and nobody is pressing charges, Lt Col Ason Jiraksa of the Karon Police told the Phuket Gazette. The safest place for swimmers to enjoy themselves is on sections of beach marked with red-yellow flags said Kata-Karon chief lifeguard Uten Singsom following the accident. More than three million people visit Phuket every year and it is the largest island in Thailand . In the past decade, tourism has become the biggest earner for the area with more than three million people visiting every year. Phuket is the largest island in Thailand. At 540 square kilometres, it's about the same size as Singapore.

"It may look like a display of synchronised swimming but this pod of humpback whales is popping out of the sea in unison during a feeding frenzy. Nature photographer Jon Cornforth, from Seattle, captured the remarkable images during a tour of Alaska’s Inside Passage. The magnificent creatures broke the water’s surface to swallow large pockets of herring at the narrow passage of Chatham Strait, Alaska. Tourists watched the spectacular moment humpback whales gathered off the coast of Alaska to feed on a school of herring . Humpback whales breach the surface of the Pacific Ocean during a feeding frenzy in Alaska's Chatham Strait . Nature photographer Jon Cornforth, from Seattle, captured the remarkable images during a tour of Alaska’s Inside Passage . Humpback whales pop out of the water to swallow large pockets of herring at the narrow passage of Chatham Strait in Alaska . With a diet of small schooling fish and krill, Humpback whales can grow up to 50ft in length and weight up to 70,000lb . The pod used the technique of bubble feeding to catch the school of fish. In this situation, approximately a dozen whales worked together and used bubbles to trap the herring at the water’s surface. As they rise the whales swim to the surface with their mouths open to collect the herring - breaking head first into the air. John came across the fascinating scene while leading a small tour group through the breath-taking area in America’s ‘last frontier’. The pod of approximately a dozen whales used the technique of bubble feeding to trap the herring at the water’s surface . As they rise to the surface the whales swim with their mouths open to collect the herring - breaking head first into the air . John Cornforth encountered the fascinating scene while leading a small tour group through the breath-taking area in America’s ‘last frontier’ He said: ‘I have observed humpbacks repetitively breach 25 or more times over the course of an hour, but most often they breach a few times and then stop. ‘The exciting thing about photographing the whales bubble-feeding is that they will feed every five to ten minutes for hours at a time, so they are constantly on the surface.’ Mr Cornforth says he frequently returns to Alaska to observe the whales and has 'experienced a few very close attacks' Alaska's government says visitors can find a high concentration of humpback whales, more than 500 in total, at Inside Passage . Jon Cornforth says patience is required while photographing humpback whales as they are 'unpredictable in their direction and behaviours' Mr Cornforth says he gets a thrill out of photographing humpback whales during a feeding frenzy because they are 'constantly on the surface' ‘They are unpredictable in their direction and behaviours, so I have to be very patient until they do something interesting or come surprisingly close. ‘Over the many years that I have spent observing them feed in Alaska, I have experienced a few very close attacks that are, shall we say, exhilarating moments, though, not usually photographically productive.’","Nature photographer John Cornforth captured the remarkable images at Alaska's Inside Passage .

"As many as four million Britons will head overseas over the festive period, with those staying behind facing jammed roads and disrupted rail journeys. Estimated by travel association Abta, the figure covers the period from Friday, December 19 to Saturday, January 3 and is slightly higher than the number who travelled abroad for Christmas last year. Heathrow, the busiest departure point, is expecting 116,700 departures this Friday, with nearly 700,000 passengers leaving from the London airport between December 19 and Christmas Day. Four million Britons will head overseas for Christmas, with the mad rush starting on December 19 . Abta said that between December 19 and January 3 Gatwick airport would be handling 800,000 departures and Stansted 430,000. In addition around 380,000 will leave from Manchester and 160,000 from Birmingham. Hundreds of thousands of people will also travel across the English Channel by ferry or through the Channel Tunnel, with 250,000 heading off on the high-speed trains of Eurostar. Abta said top winter sun destinations for Britons included the Canary Islands, Tunisia and Morocco, while top long-haul destinations include Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Egypt. In addition to the Christmas rush, a strike could affect check-in desks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester . Popular for New Year's Eve breaks are the cities of Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin and Dublin, while domestically Edinburgh and London lead the way. In the period December 12 to January 5 British Airways will be carrying around 2.7 million passengers. This Friday will be its busiest day, with 129,000 customers flying. The BA schedules include 267 flights on Christmas Day on which 37,000 turkey dinners will be served. Top BA destinations over the festive period are Dubai, Barbados, New York, Australia and Barcelona. Ryanair is carrying more than 3.5 million customers between Saturday December 20 and January 6 - an increase of 500,000 customers over the 2013/14 holiday period. Popular destinations include the Portuguese Algarve, the Canary Islands, Cologne and Prague. This Saturday sees the start of a 16-day part-closure of London Bridge station for work on the Thameslink . Those travelling within Britain will have to contend with disruption caused by a £200million engineering programme over the holiday period. Although a lot of the work is being done on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, there will be major disruption on the West Coast main line due to work at Watford in Hertfordshire and between Stafford and Crewe. The West Coast line will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Monday December 29. It will also be closed between Stafford and Crewe after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Sunday, December 28. Unite union has called for peace talks to avoid labour disruption at airports on December 23 and 24 . Also, work at Reading in Berkshire will mean restricted services in and out of Paddington station in London right through to January 5. This Saturday sees the start of a 16-day part-closure of London Bridge station for work involving the £6.5billion Thameslink programme. From Saturday, December 20 to Sunday January 4, Southern and Thameslink trains will not call at London Bridge and cross-London Thameslink Bedford-Brighton trains will not return until 2018. From next Monday until Christmas Eve some Southeastern Charing Cross services will not call at London Bridge in the morning peak.

"A man was charged Wednesday with killing and dismembering his mother and stepfather, whose body parts were found in trash bags and containers inside their home. Frederick C. Harris is facing two counts each of criminal homicide and abuse of a corpse in the deaths of 73-year-old Olivia and his stepfather, 76-year-old Lamar Gilbert. Police say some of the elderly couple's body parts were not recovered. Neighbors told police that Harris had been living in the couple's Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, home recently. Olivia Gilbert's daughter asked police to do a welfare check on the couple Tuesday afternoon after they hadn't been heard from since Saturday. Scroll down for video . Charged: Frederick C. Harris, pictured, is facing two counts each of criminal homicide and abuse of a corpse in the deaths of 73-year-old Olivia and 76-year-old Lamar Gilbert . Crime scene: Trash cans inside the Gilberts' home contained a man's torso with stab wounds, the victims' heads and two sets of feet and hands, police said . After the daughter forced open the door, police found Harris unresponsive under the covers and in bed, they say. Authorities say they took Harris to a hospital, where doctors found nothing wrong with him and police discovered an unusual note in his pocket: . 'Hello Fred Thanks for house sitting and fixing up the place while we are on vacation. See You soon, tell everyone hello. Mr and Mrs Gilbert Lamar PS Don't answer the door for anyone.' After Harris was hospitalized, Penn Hills police found remnants of a carpet that appeared to be blood-stained and more than a half dozen garbage cans in the garage, four of which appeared to be new. Among other things, the trash cans contained a man's torso with stab wounds, the victims' heads and two sets of feet and hands, police said. Investigators didn't find a woman's torso or arms - nor did they find a man's arms. With search warrants, detectives found receipts for four garbage containers purchased Monday and Tuesday afternoon and a section of the laundry room floor that appeared to be wiped clean, police said. Surveillance video from a Home Depot store showed Harris buying the garbage cans, police said. 'Five bloodied large kitchen knives were also recovered. The blades were bent and in some of the knives the handles were broken,' according to the criminal complaint. Crime: Police said that surveillance video from a Home Depot store showed Harris buying the new garbage cans . Investigation: Authorities who questioned Harris said he 'sat upright in the chair with his eyes closed and refused to speak or acknowledge detectives' 'It's hard to believe something like that can happen. It can happen anywhere I guess, you know, so, it's a bad time for the holidays, that's all I can say,' neighbor Robert Irish told CBS Pittsburgh. Authorities who questioned Harris said he 'sat upright in the chair with his eyes closed and refused to speak or acknowledge detectives.' Police also noticed a fresh cut on Harris' right palm. CBS Pittsburgh reported that Harris was briefly an Allegheny County Human Resources employee in 2000, though he did not complete his probation period. Harris is scheduled to be arraigned early Thursday; online court records don't list an attorney for him. Investigators told the affiliate station Harris attempted to choke his father, was forced out of his house, and then starting living at his mother and stepfather's home. Additionally, sources told CBS Pittsburgh the missing body parts were included in trash that had been collected - meaning investigators might never find them. Harris was convicted of insurance fraud in 2009 and of harassment in 2012, according to online court records. Details of those cases weren't immediately available. At the time of his arrest, Harris was also wanted for a parole violation in a 2011 squatter's case in neighboring Westmoreland County. He received five to 23 months in jail after pleading guilty to criminal trespass in Murrysville, where police say he removed a for-sale sign from a $500,000 home and moved in without permission.","Frederick C.

"Vietnam Airlines has suspended a pilot and his crew after he reportedly pressed the wrong button in the cockpit and accidentally triggered a hijack alert while attempting to request an emergency landing. The mistake sparked panic on the ground as air traffic controllers believed that the passenger jet had been overtaken by terrorists during a domestic flight. It occurred on Tuesday night while the pilot was attempting to enter an emergency code (7700) after the plane suffered a technical fault while flying from Ho Chi Minh City to the northern town of Vinh. The incident sparked panic as air traffic controllers feared the plane had been overtaken by terrorists . Instead, the captain entered the hijacking code (7500) and inadvertently placed the flight under a heightened state of emergency. Passengers were unaware that a hijack alert had been sent, but there were some tense moments in the cabin as oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling due to a sudden drop in cabin pressure. The plane was forced to  descend from an altitude of 35,000ft to 13,000ft. Vietnam Airlines says the hijack alert had nothing to do with the plane's emergency landing in Hanoi . The technical problem forced the Airbus A321 to make an emergency landing at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi. The plane landed safely and there were no injuries to its 135 passengers, who were delayed for nearly three hours, or seven crew. Vietnam Airlines said the emergency landing had nothing to do with the hijack alert. There were tense moments on the plane as oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling (file photo) Airline spokesman Le Truong Giang told Thanhnien News that Czech captain Pechanec Marek, co-pilot Do Hoang Nam and five other crew members have been suspended. They are barred from returning to work until the conclusion of an investigation by the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV). Investigators have downloaded information from the plane’s flight recorder and interviewed the flight crew to learn more about what happened. In a similar incident last month, Austria’s military deployed two fighter jets to escort a Turkish Airlines plane after its pilot inadvertently set off a hijack alarm. It occurred when the plane lost cabin pressure and the pilot attempted to declare an emergency. The plane was flying from Frankfurt to Istanbul, and was forced to make an emergency landing in Vienna.","Incident occurred as Airbus A321 was travelling from Ho Chi Minh to Vinh .

"It has long been seen as a relaxed holiday destination where the sun shines on Krabi and 'Full Moon' parties fill the popular beaches of Phuket with happy revellers. But the image of Thailand as an easy-going travel hotspot is under threat amid a growing number of cases of tourists being stopped and questioned by officials in Bangkok. Overseas visitors exploring the country's exotic capital city have been increasingly complaining of harassment from police officers on the main avenue Sukhumvit Road. Visible presence: Thailand has been under martial law since a military coup d'etat at the end of May . The Sydney Morning Herald has reported incidents of Australian tourists being pulled over at this busy heart of the city, and asked to show their passports. Others have been subjected to random searches, being told to open their bags and take out their belongings – or even asked to submit a urine sample for drugs tests. Disturbingly, there are reported cases of travellers being given on-the-spot fines that have to be paid immediately, and in cash. The Bangkok Post also reported the concerns of one unnamed tourist who witnessed the random search policy at first hand. At the heart of the matter: Sukhumvit Road is the key artery in the middle of the Thai capital Bangkok . 'They were thoroughly searching tourists and their belongings, asking them to produce passports,' the unidentified traveller said. 'Many of these unfortunate souls were then detained, and I saw them paying money to officials. One girl was reduced to tears and was very obviously upset.' The reports add to fears that Thailand is becoming a less hospitable country for tourists. The country is currently under martial law in the wake of a coup d'etat which saw the military take control of the government last May. Immensely popular: The Sukhumvit district of Bangkok is home to numerous bars which cater to tourists . The takeover was preceded by a wave of protests and demonstrations, particularly in Bangkok, which has been a regular scene of upheaval in the last five years. In November, Paiboon Koomchaya, the current Thai Justice Minister, announced that martial law could stay in place indefinitely. Martial law gives the Thai officials wide-scale powers, including the right to stop and search. Flashpoint: Bangkok has been the scene of sometimes violent political demonstrations in recent years . 'We are not saying that martial law will stay in place for 50 years,' said General Paiboon. 'No, this is not it. We just ask that it remain in place for now, indefinitely.' 'Am I happy? No, I'm not,' he continued. The longer [martial law] is in place, the more unhappy I become. Yet, it's necessary. 'Today, priority must be given to the future of the country. Conflict and social disparity must be stopped.' Conflagration: An anti-government protester pictured in front of soldiers in February - before the coup d'etat . The issue of travellers being targetted by police has not escaped the attention of British officials. Mark Kent, the British ambassador in Thailand, tweeted last week that he has raised the issue with the tourism authorities in Bangkok. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises British tourists to take care in Thailand. 'Martial law is in place and provides an enabling framework for the Royal Thai Army to take action it deems necessary to enforce law and order,' it explains. 'Before the military coup, there were large-scale demonstrations and protests in Bangkok and other cities. You should avoid any political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.' Clampdown: Former army officer Prayuth Chan-ocha has been the Thai prime minister since May's coup . Potential visitors are also warned that freedom of speech is very much constrained in Thailand under the current regime. 'A number of media outlets have been taken off air and some internet sites remain blocked,' the advice continues. 'It is illegal to criticise the coup, and you should be wary of making political statements in public. You should monitor local news and social media for developments. 'Before travelling to Thailand, check with your insurance provider that they will continue to cover for claims arising from the current political situation. 'Some travel insurance policies exclude cover following a military coup or the imposition of martial law, and your insurance may be invalid.'","Rising number of reports of Thai police being heavy-handed with tourists .

"For those looking to book a holiday this festive season, Christmas may have come early. Over half of the top 20 best value getaways have fallen in price since last year, mainly due to the strength of the pound. And for the best value deal this Christmas, you'd do well to head to Europe - in particular, Belgium. For the best value traditional Christmas getaway, head to Belgium. Pictured: the Christmas market in Bruges . Research from M&S Bank has found Belgium to be the most affordable traditional Christmas destination this year. With its colder climate and festive activities, such as sleigh rides, Santa's grotto, Christmas markets and outdoor ice skating, Belgium is a great option for families looking for a quick winter break. With costs of just £420 per person, the country also sees an almost 5 per cent decrease in price since last year. Germany is not far behind, costing just £453 per person, which is almost four per cent cheaper than this time last year. Germany is also a good-value traditional option, with costs for a week holiday coming in at £453 per person . 1. Belgium - £420 per person . 2. Germany - £453 per person . 3. Sweden - £466 per person . 4. Estonia - £601 per person . 5. France - £690 per person . 6. Austria - £702 per person . 7. Iceland - £902 per person . 8. Finland - £1,078 per person . 9.

Thailand - £3,984 per person . Prices to Sweden have seen the largest drop since last year - down 7.1% - to a cost of £466 per person . But it's a jaunt over to Sweden that has seen the largest annual price decrease - 7.1 per cent and a cost of £466 per person. More expensive traditional Christmas holiday destinations include Finland as well as long-haul locations, such as New York and Canada. For those looking for winter sun, however, the news isn't quite as cheery. Only two warm-weather destinations are included in the top ten most affordable holiday list: Cyprus and the Canary Islands. For those looking to soak up the winter sun, Cyprus tops the list for best value destinations . Spain's Canary Islands is another more affordable winter sun getaway option at £1,248 per person per week . While you may be guaranteed mild weather in the Canaries - average December temperatures top 19 degrees Celsius - it will come with a high price tag of £1,248 per person. For some serious winter heat, Thailand has the highest temperatures - and the highest cost per person, with prices having risen by £293 in the last two years. The Bahamas also boasts pleasant temperatures at this time of year, with an average of 22 degrees Celsius in December. However, it is the second most expensive winter sun destination, with a cost of £3,029 per person. Mexico has seen the biggest price increase overall (2.1 per cent, or £114 in total), but at a cost of £1,377 per person it is still the third most affordable winter sun destination out of those researched. The most expensive winter sun locale? Thailand has both the highest December temperatures and prices . Paul Stokes, head of products at M&S Bank, said: 'Families looking for a more traditional Christmas holiday will find plenty of savings to be had, with prices falling across the board, largely thanks to the strength of the pound against the euro. 'However, those hoping for some winter sun this year will have to pay a premium for higher temperatures, particularly to long-haul destinations. 'Travellers can often get a better rate on their currency if they plan ahead, helping to ensure their spending money goes that bit further.'","M&S Bank: more than 50% of best value getaways have fallen in price .

"A football player has spoken out about  his agonizing recovery seven months after a near fatal beating outside a bar. Isaac Kolstad, a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, suffered a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury in a bar fight that happened last May near his school. After months of therapy Kolstad learned to speak again and giving an interview on his 25th birthday this week, he told the Star Tribune in halted speech: 'My story is somewhat crazy because I have been through a lot.' Scroll down for video . Isaac Kolstad, a football player who suffered a near fatal beating outside a bar is making a slow, but steady recovering in re-learning how to speak . Isaac Kolstad and his wife Molly. After months of therapy Kolstad began to speak again and giving an interview on his 25th birthday this week,  he said: 'My story is somewhat crazy because I have been through a lot' 'I can feel myself getting better through therapy. That is my favorite part.' His wife Molly said she has been encouraged by his progress since being told when he was in ICU that her husband had a three percent change of recovery. Molly says then when the father-of-two started to speak this summer, he hoped he was going to keep playing football and it wasn't until later he realized his football players days were over. The couple have two daughters - Malia was born while her father was in rehab . She wrote on Kolstad's CaringBridge page: 'Isaac is traveling three days a week to the cities up and back for his continued outpatient therapy at Courage Kenny. He will continue speech, occupation, and physical therapy sessions there at least until late spring. 'We were hoping that he would be able to reach the limit of 8mph on the treadmill and we are happy to report that he did!!! Isaac maxed out the treadmill and is the first of their knowledge to do so. 'But in doing that, we wore the poor thing out and they ended up needing a new one! 'Hopefully the new one that is being installed hopefully this week will be able to handle the speed and power of Mr. Isaac Kolstad!' Isaac Kolstad (above in yellow at a September football game), a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, see his team again . Baby girl: While he was in rehab his wife gave birth to a daughter, Malia (above with her father) Sportsman: Kolstad (pictured playing in a 2012 game) had to relearn how to walk . In September, Kolstad, who graduated in 2013, made an emotional return to the playing field with some of his former teammates, walking out before kickoff during the opening game of their season. He also became a father for the second time when his baby daughter Malia was born in June, less than a month after he was injured. Kolstand and his wife have another daughter, Haidyn. Rutgers University quarterback Philip Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault for the incident. Two: Kolstand and his wife Molly have another daughter, Haidyn (above) Arrests: Trevor Shelley (left) and Philip Nelson (right) have been arrested in connection with the incident . Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts. Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight. According to newly released witness statements taken by the Mankato police, Nelson was angry beacause his girlfrend had been kissed by a bouncer on the same night. Kolstad congratulated Nelson on his football career and wished him luck when the pair bumped into each other outside a bar. But it seems that Nelson mistakenly thought Kolstad was the bouncer who kissed his girlfriend and the pair got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer, the complaint says. Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'. 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.' He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance. Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint.","Isaac Kolstad suffered a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury in a bar fight that happened last May near his school .

"He was less than impressed when he heard that James Franco and Seth Rogen were planning to assassinate him in spoof Hollywood movie The Interview, but it seems there are some films that North Korea's Kim Jong-Un does approve of. But with titles like Urban Girl Comes to Get Married, A True Daughter of the Party, The Bloodstained Route Map and Sea of Blood, sitting through them might prove a challenge. Despite the uninspiring titles, North Korea boasts a thriving film industry, with the biggest film studio, which has sets that include a Chinatown and an English country village, just outside Pyongyang. Scroll down for video . Popular: Cinema is hugely popular in North Korea but all films are made by the regime and feature propaganda . Rousing: Most of the films have an inspiring message and feature views of North Korean capital Pyongyang (pictured) Heroic: Typically, films show North Koreans performing heroic deeds with South Koreans and Westerners often cast as villains . And action! Tourists often find themselves unexpectedly starring in films - the man waving is the North Korean version of Steven Spielberg . Starring role: Mr Lafforgue and his fellow passengers were asked to repeatedly walk down this set of airport steps before catching their flight . 'Although the film offer is usually quite poor, the people of North Korea are very fond of cinema,' says photographer Eric Lafforgue, who went behind the scenes at the Chollima Studios and even found time to star in a North Korean movie himself. 'So was their Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il, who described it as ""the most powerful medium for educating the masses"". In fact, he liked it so much, he even kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-Ok and his wife in 1978 and held them until 1986.' Despite the Shins escape, North Korea continues to make films, although most double as propaganda with tales of perfidious Westerners and heroic North Koreans dominating the script. Apart from within universities where films like Gladiator and Titanic are shown to language students, Western films are not allowed, although that didn't stop Kim Jong-Un from taking exception to The Interview. Indeed, so offended was Kim by his cinematic death, he declared it 'an act of war' while hackers allegedly funded by North Korea tapped into computers belonging to backers Sony and stole thousands of documents - including some extremely embarrassing emails. One saw producer Scott Rudin describe Angelina Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoilt brat', while another exchange saw Rudin claim to have no idea who actor Michael Fassbender was before going on to crack jokes about the star's manhood. Favourites: Popular titles include Urban Girl Comes to Get Married and A True Daughter of the Party . Welcome: Those visiting the Chollima Movie Studios are greeted by this rousing fresco . Disciplined: Film shoots are run along military lines with everyone expected to know what to do and say at all times . Backstage: Extras leave their clothes and shoes in a single large changing room, staffed by a pair of dressers . On guard: A soldier left to guard the piles of clothes opts for having a sleep on them instead . Looking good: A pair of extras in traditional dress have their hair attended to by two of the studio's legion hair and make-up artists . Starring role: An elderly actor has his beard carefully neatened by a hairdresser - ironically sporting a cap emblazoned with the HP logo . Tidying up: The hair and make-up artist completes the job, slicking down the actor's beard with a little oil . Such theatrics would never happen in North Korea, says Lafforgue, where all actors are state-sponsored and tourists frequently find themselves becoming accidental guest stars. 'The actors have to reread their scripts just before shooting starts,' says Lafforgue of his day on set with North Korea's acting A-list. 'There's a real military atmosphere and discipline is very strict.' North Korea's love of film began with Kim Jong-Il who, according to the regime, once shot a film personally - about the founding member of the dynasty, Kim Il-Sung - and earned himself the title of 'Genius of Cinema' in the process. He also managed more than 600 visits to the Chollima Studios during his tenure and was instrumental in ensuring a film about the 2009 release of two American tourists held prisoner by the regime was made. The story of the release, which came during the visit of former president Bill Clinton, was given a North Korean twist and turned into an epic about the strength and power of a dynasty that could 'force' American leaders to do its bidding. Getting ready: Extras sit down en masse on a tarmac road cutting through one of the sets as the director explains their role . And action! The extras, who are playing the role of demonstrators, get to work as the camera (right) starts rolling . Protest: According to Lafforgue, this staged protest - set in Japan - was the only one that he saw during his visit to the country . Sharp: A group of young extras have their hats adjusted - overseen by a group of soldiers . Perfect: A regime official signs off an actress' hairdo as filming at the Chollima Movie Studio gets underway . All smiles: A group of extras, dressed in Victorian style garb and sitting in the London set, smile for the camera . Superstars: These photos are of North Korea's most talented stars but unlike Hollywood's talent, they are paid by the government . So important are these films to the North Korean regime, according to Lafforgue, visits to the cinema are completely free. 'People don't usually have to pay an entrance fee,' he confirms. 'It is seen by people as an opportunity to relax and have fun. 'Sometimes there is a real fight to enter the movie theatre as so many people who want to go at the same time. My guide told me that he sometimes had to stand up to see the film as all the seats are full.' Those who can't make it into the cinema cannot avoid the propaganda that accompanies the films, however. According to Lafforgue, Pyongyang and other cities are peppered with film posters, many of which are painted onto the walls and all of which push regime messages. 'Most of the time, the posters show North Korean heroes who suffered for their nation, not people smiling,' says Lafforgue. 'They look more like the usual propaganda posters than movie ads.' And while James Franco and Seth Rogen remain unlikely to ever find themselves adorning a North Korean wall, one much-loved Western figure can be spotted everywhere. 'Mickey Mouse is really popular,' says Lafforgue. 'They even use old Mickey Mouse movies to teach video editing techniques. Most of the North Koreans think Mickey is Chinese though.' Heroine: Films such as Sea of Blood and The Bloodstained Route Map focus on the heroics of North Korea's soldiers . Permanent: In Pyongyang and other cities, the posters are painted onto walls and remain in place for years . New releases: Film posters show some of the new movies available to watch, many of which offer a North Korean take on current events . Power: Others, such as this one about the country's rocket programme, emphasise the power of North Korea . Unsmiling: According to Lafforgue, it is rare to see a smiling actor on a film poster because most films are preoccupied with martyrdom . Loved: Old Mickey Mouse films are used to teach video editing techniques, although most of the students believe Mickey is Chinese . Looks familiar? This part of the Chollima Movie Studios is supposed to stand in for London . Home from home: The British countryside is also represented, in the shape of a series of picturesque period cottages . Free: Because of its use as propaganda, going to the cinema is completely free in North Korea . Knock-offs: Despite Western films ostensibly being banned, some Chinese copies - as well as local films - are available as copied DVDS .","Sony Pictures was hacked by North Korea after making film that features the assassination of Kim Jong-Un .

"The sites where US scientists secretly developed the atomic bomb before they were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 are set to become national parks. The national laboratories in Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and Hanford - which were all part of the Manhattan Project - will be opened to the public to the as a result of new legislation being passed by Congress. Officials from the National Parks Conservation have insisted that the sites in New Mexico, Tennessee and Washington will not 'celebrate' the creation of an atomic weapon. Instead the landmarks will look at the 'impacts, both positive and negative, that resulted from splitting the atom'. The sites where U.S. scientists developed the atomic bomb, including the Hanford Nuclear Reserve in Washington (pictured), are set to become national parks . Legislation being passed by Congress means areas like this one in Hanford (pictured in August 1945) will be protected and open to the public . The U.S Department of Energy that runs the Hanford site was fined $10,000 a week in 2014 for failing to removed radioactive sludge away from the site which remained following the research project . According to CNN, the bill is awaiting President Obama's signature. If passed the parks are due to be operational by 2021. The 1945 attack on Japan, credited by some for ending the Second World War, killed more than 100,000 people instantly in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki. More than 100,000 died in the aftermath due to the effect of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness. Most of those killed were civilians. To this day, the bombings remain history's only acts of nuclear warfare. By August 1945, the Allied Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory had devised two types of bombs. The 509th Composite Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces was equipped with a Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands, to the south of Japan. A uranium gun-type atomic bomb, code-named 'Little Boy', was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by a plutonium implosion-type bomb, called 'Fat Man' on the city of Nagasaki on August 9. Rob Smith, Northwest Regional Director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said: 'The complex stories of the Manhattan Project are ideal topics for the National Park Service – our country's premier story tellers to interpret. 'As only a small percentage of our national parks currently interpret science and technology, the Manhattan Project National Historical Park will continue to enhance our country's best idea, as we look towards the 2016 centennial celebration of our National Park System.' The 1945 attack on the two cities in Japan, credited by some for ending the Second World War, killed more than 100,000 people instantly in Hiroshima (pictured) An allied correspondent stands in a sea of rubble with the shell of a building that once was a movie theater in the distance in Hiroshima . The Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico is one of the sites earmarked to be opened. Two types of bombs were devised at the site before the attacks . Pictured in 1950, Los Alamos was one of two laboratories in the United States that were designated to work on nuclear weapons. The facility was established in 1942 . David Nimkin, Senior Southwest Regional Director for the National Parks Conservation Association, added:  'The National Parks Conservation Association has worked for several years with Representative Hastings and Congressional leaders from New Mexico, Washington, and Tennessee in efforts to make this park a reality. 'We believe that this national park will allow visitors to consider the project's many ethical, cultural, and scientific implications. The sites will not celebrate the creation of atomic weapons, but put into context the impacts, both positive and negative, that resulted from splitting the atom.' Clarence Moriwaki, the President of the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial Association who lost family when the atomic bomb was dropped, says there is 'no glory' in its use, but agreed that it is an important part of American history and should be remembered. As part of the legislation, six other landmarks will become protected. They are: The Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the Coltsville National Historical Park in Connecticut, The Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in New York, the Valles Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico, the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument in Nevada and the National World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. Another 15 will be extended. This aerial photo shows the shuttered K-25 uranium enrichment site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, before a major cleanup began in the late 1990s. It was set up on isolated farmland especially for the Manhattan Project .

"Mario Balotelli has been hit with a one-game ban and £25,000 fine for breaking the FA’s social media rules. The Liverpool striker accepted an FA charge last week and submitted written mitigation for an image he re-posted on Instagram on December 1, which on Thursday was deemed to be abusive or insulting by a three-person independent panel. Balotelli, who did not request a personal hearing, will now miss Sunday’s Barclays Premier League clash with Arsenal. He must also attend an education course and there is a strong possibility he will face disciplinary action from Liverpool. Mario Balotelli has been fined, suspended and ordered to attend educational classes after a  social media post . Balotelli's  ban comes after the Liverpool striker uploaded a controversial post  to his Instagram account . Balotelli immediately received criticism upon uploading the post, and rejected the responses . But Balotelli wrote an apology on Twitter the day after, claiming it was meant to be 'anti-racist' And Balotelli apologised again for the incident on Twitter as his punishment was announced . The written findings into the case have yet to be published but Balotelli has ruled out an appeal. He said: ‘Following the recent events related to my Super Mario post, the FA decision has made it clear that I was wrong. ‘I am sorry that my team-mates and supporters of Liverpool FC have been penalised for something I did and have now come to regret. ‘It is my intention to comply with the decision of the FA and make sure that it never happens again.’ Balotelli could now face internal action from Liverpool for the occurrence of the incident . The Italian firebrand has come under scrutiny after failing to score a Premier League goal this season . A Liverpool spokesperson said: ‘The club acknowledges the decision reached by the independent panel and due consideration will be given to the written judgment once we receive it from the FA. ‘Any further action in relation to this matter is between the club and the player.’ It is understood that the three-person commission looked on Balotelli in a positive light, given he co-operated fully with them throughout the process and swiftly took down the offending image. The furore started when Balotelli reposted a picture of the video game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’ Below the picture, it added: ‘Jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’ Balotelli has struggled to win Liverpool fans over, scoring twice since signing for the club in August . Balotelli holds a 'No to Racism' pennant ahead of Liverpool's Champions League clash with Real Madrid . Balotelli subsequently apologised on Twitter and insisted the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’. His statement read: ‘I apologise if I have offended anyone… I now understand that out of context it may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money. ‘I used a cartoon done by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive.’ When first asked for his observations by the FA, the 24-year-old submitted evidence that he had been racially abused on social media. That, however, did not stop the FA charging him. A statement from the governing body read said: ‘The posting was considered to be an “Aggravated Breach” in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.’ Meanwhile, Balotelli’s future at Liverpool has been thrown into greater doubt after it emerged manager Brendan Rodgers has reservations about the Italy striker’s technical ability.
