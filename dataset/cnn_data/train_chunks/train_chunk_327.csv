"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- An explosion killed at least two people Monday in a city in southern Thailand, a police official who is familiar with the investigation said. The blast occurred around 6 p.m. (6 a.m. ET) in a market in Muang District, which is the main city of Narathiwat Province, said the police official, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. The explosion happened at the market's busiest time of the day. Initial reports indicate two people were killed and nine hurt, the official said. The explosion happened as Malaysia's prime minister is to begin a three-day trip to southern Thailand, where a Muslim insurgency has caused violence for years.

"(CNN) -- A tense thriller and a family-friendly sequel bumped ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" from the top of the weekend's box office. ""No Good Deed,"" starring Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson, stormed to victory in its opening weekend, grossing an estimated $24.5 million at domestic theaters. That's nearly twice what the thriller cost to make. Elba plays an escaped murderer who arrives at Henson's doorstep while her husband's away and she's taking care of her small children. A psychological and physical faceoff ensues in the first big-screen pairing of these two well-established actors. ""Dolphin Tale 2,"" which also debuted over the weekend, continued this year's trend of family-oriented sequels failing to perform as well as their predecessors. The latest ""Dolphin"" installment opened in second place with an estimated $16.6 million -- more than 13% off the first film's opening in 2011. Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman all returned for the second helping of feel-good fare. Meanwhile, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" arrived in third place with an estimated $8 million. The latest Marvel movie has led the box office four of the past six weekends and has crossed $300 million on both the domestic and international charts. Down the chart, the comedy ""Let's Be Cops"" continues to be a winner for Fox: Its domestic haul of nearly $73 million is more than four times its production budget. And a surprise in moderate release, ""The Drop"" made an estimated $4.2 million after opening in just 809 theaters over the weekend, giving the drama starring Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini the highest per-screen average in the top 10 except for ""No Good Deed."" Domestic weekend box office estimates are from Exhibitor Relations Co. (final numbers available Monday afternoon): . 1. ""No Good Deed"" -- $24.5 million (debut) 2. ""Dolphin Tale 2"" -- $16.5 million (debut) 3. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" -- $8 million ($306 million total) 4. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" -- $4.8 million ($181 million total) 5.

"(CNN) -- A top U.S. evangelical leader is accusing Sen. Barack Obama of deliberately distorting the Bible and taking a ""fruitcake interpretation"" of the U.S. Constitution. James Dobson says Barack Obama is distorting bibical teachings to fit ""his own confused theology."" In comments aired on his radio show Tuesday, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson criticized the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for comments he made in a June 2006 speech to the liberal Christian group Call to Renewal. In the speech, Obama suggested that it would be impractical to govern based solely on the word of the Bible, noting that some passages suggest slavery is permissible and eating shellfish is disgraceful. ""Which passages of scripture should guide our public policy?"" Obama asked in the speech. ""Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is OK and that eating shellfish is an abomination? Or we could go with Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount? ""So before we get carried away, let's read our Bible now,"" Obama said, to cheers. ""Folks haven't been reading their Bible."" He also called Jesus' Sermon on the Mount ""a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our Defense Department would survive its application."" In the comments aired Tuesday, Dobson said Obama should not be referencing antiquated dietary codes and passages from the Old Testament that are no longer relevant to the teachings of the New Testament.  Listen to Dobson blast Obama's biblical interpretations » . ""I think he's deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own world view, his own confused theology,"" Dobson said, adding that Obama is ""dragging biblical understanding through the gutter."" Responding to Dobson's comments Tuesday evening, Obama sharply disputed the suggestion he was distorting the Bible. ""Someone would be pretty hard pressed to make that argument,"" he told reporters aboard his campaign plane. ""It is a speech that affirms the role of faith not just in my life but in the life of the American people, that suggests that we make a mistake by trying to push faith out of the public square."" ""I do make the argument that it's important for folks like myself, who think faith is important, that we try to translate some of our concerns into universal language so we can have open and vigorous debate rather than having religion divide us,"" Obama said. ""And I do suggest that the separation of church and state is important. But there's no, no theological work being done in that speech in terms of the Bible."" Joshua DuBois, Obama's national director of religious affairs, said the Illinois senator is ""committed to reaching out to people of faith and standing up for American families."" ""A full reading of his 2006 Call to Renewal speech shows just that,"" DuBois said. ""Obama is proud to have the support of millions of Americans of faith and looks forward to working across religious lines to bring our country together."" DuBois had earlier called Focus on the Family to suggest a meeting with the group ahead of the Democratic Party's convention in late August, according to Tom Minnery, the organization's senior vice president for government and public policy. Minnery wouldn't say whether any such meeting is planned but said the group is open to it. Dobson also takes aim at Obama for suggesting in the speech that those motivated by religion should attempt to appeal to broader segments of the population by not just framing their arguments around religious precepts. ""Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion-specific values,"" Obama said. ""It requires their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason."" Dobson said the suggestion is an attempt to lead by the ""lowest common denominator of morality."" ""Am I required in a democracy to conform my efforts in the political arena to his bloody notion of what is right with regard to the lives of tiny babies?"" he asked. ""What he's trying to say here is, unless everybody agrees, we have no right to fight for what we believe. ""What the senator is saying there, in essence, is that 'I can't seek to pass legislation, for example, that bans partial-birth abortion, because there are people in the culture who don't see that as a moral issue,' "" Dobson said. ""And if I can't get everyone to agree with me, than it is undemocratic to try to pass legislation that I find offensive to the Scripture. Now, that is a fruitcake interpretation of the Constitution."" According to Minnery, Dobson was particularly offended by a portion of the speech in which Obama mentioned evangelical leader and the Rev. Al Sharpton. In the speech, Obama said, ""Even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's or Al Sharpton's?"" In response, Minnery said, ""Many people have called [Sharpton] a black racist, and [Obama] is somehow equating [Dobson] with that and racial bigotry."" Dobson's comments follow the Obama campaign's recent efforts to increase its appeal among evangelicals, many of whom have expressed reservations about supporting Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Dobson himself has said he will not vote for the Arizona senator. Minnery said he doesn't expect Obama to make inroads into the reliably Republican voting bloc. ""Evangelicals are people who take Bible interpretation very seriously, and the sort of speech he gave shows that he is worlds away in the views of evangelicals,"" he said. Minnery also said Dobson will probably continue his criticism of Obama. ""Given our fact that religion seems to be such a relevant topic in this election again, we will defend the evangelical view vigorously,"" he said.","NEW: Obama fires back at Dobson, clarifies what he said in speech .

"(CNN) -- Ray McDonald, who plays for the San Francisco 49ers, was arrested August 31 on felony domestic violence charges involving his pregnant fiancee. The San Jose Police Department said McDonald's fiancee had ""visible injuries,"" and the Sacramento Bee reported that police were previously called to his house in May. McDonald is out on bail while the case is under investigation by the district attorney's office. He is due in court on September 15 and has yet to be charged. But none of this stopped McDonald from playing on Sunday in the 49ers season opener, a decision the San Francisco Board of Supervisors just denounced. They've called for McDonald to be sidelined (with pay) pending the outcome of the September 15 court appearance. Do we need cell phone video of every assault to make the NFL pick up the ball? Apparently we do. There's Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers, who was convicted in July on domestic violence charges. Think he's in jail or suspended indefinitely like Rice? Nope -- under NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's leadership, he's on the field. And there are many other examples where the NFL looked the other way or was way too lenient. Ray Rice has been punished for his despicable elevator assault on Janay Palmer, who's now his wife. Now it's time for the NFL to be punished for its despicable handling of it. The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, must go. With Goodell in charge, nothing is going to change the next time another player is charged with felony domestic violence. And next time is already here. Under his leadership, the NFL and the Baltimore Ravens have handled the incident so horrendously that they're guilty of abusing Janay Rice too. Only TMZ rubbing Goodell's nose in this pile of dung forced the NFL to react. Without TMZ releasing the video of Rice's assault, current and former NFL players wouldn't have gone nuts condemning him on social media. Without the video, Ray Rice was going to play 14 games this season, earn commission as a character in the Madden '15 video game, and enjoy lucrative contracts with endorsers like Nike -- and that was just fine with the commissioner and the Ravens. You might wonder why the NFL didn't see the surveillance video. Goodell told CBS (the network that broadcasts NFL games) that he ""didn't know what was on that tape."" But he knew Rice hit her unconscious. He knew there was surveillance inside the elevator. Perhaps he didn't care to watch it. He wanted to get back to what's important: playing football. The NFL abused Janay Rice when it didn't suspend Ray Rice immediately. NFL officials abused her by allegedly having him present as they interviewed her for their ""investigation,"" putting her in an impossible situation. Then the Ravens put her in the position of defending her abuser. They held a press conference where she apologized for the ""role"" she played. Ray Rice also apologized ""to everyone who was affected by this situation that me and my wife were in,"" but not to his wife. You saw the video. Would you rat out the man who cold-cocked you while he's sitting next to you? Want to be the one ""responsible"" for making him lose his job? They abused her yet again when the Ravens' official Twitter account tweeted ""Ray Rice: 'I won't call myself a failure. Failure is not getting knocked down. It's not getting up.'"" And the NFL sent Janay Rice a very clear message when it handed her husband a two-game suspension: ""This wasn't that serious, honey -- stand by your man."" Head Coach John Harbaugh welcomed Ray Rice back to the team, as ""a heck of a guy."" Six months after being assaulted, Janay Rice should be allowed to focus on healing. Instead she's now reeling from yet another punch -- this latest one from, surprise, the NFL. She deserved better -- from her husband, from the Ravens and from the NFL. Of course she's lashing out and blaming everyone but Rice for this ""nightmare."" She's a battered woman. Imagine if the NFL had handled this the right way back when the original assault took place. It would have sidelined Rice, pending an investigation. It would have talked to Janay Palmer privately, with a trained advocate present, and made it comfortable for her to be honest. It would have handed Ray Rice a suspension for the season and supported him through counseling. One more thing: For the women in the media, like Taylor Marsh, who are calling Janay a ""delusional"" victim -- shame on you. You show a stunning lack of knowledge about domestic violence and the reasons why victims feel so paralyzed. By blaming her, you isolate her and make it harder for her to leave. I suggest you try searching for the now-trending hashtag #WhyIStayed to educate yourself about what victims go through and why battered women's syndrome makes them stay. Ray Rice has been dealt with. The Rices' marriage and his career will be tested over time. Ray McDonald was charged in August with felony domestic violence charges and is still playing football, and that's okay with Goodell. Greg Hardy was convicted of domestic violence charges in July and he's still playing for the league. Think the NFL takes domestic violence seriously? Neither do I. Goodell -- it's time you go. Where's Adam Silver when you need him?","Mel Robbins: NFL let other players charged in domestic violence return to field .
Robbins: Ray Rice punished, once there was video -- why not others? Goodell must go .

"(CNN) -- Everything Kim Dotcom does is mega. He's a mountain of a man with an imposing multi-million dollar fortune, amassed through a series of Internet ventures, which is now being spent on ambitious bid to unseat the current New Zealand prime minister. Dotcom's story starts in 1974, when he was born Kim Schmitz in Germany. He first attracted the attention of authorities in his early 20s when he was convicted of a number of offenses, including computer fraud. He's now wanted by the U.S. for alleged copyright infringement on a grand scale. According to indictment filed in 2012, Dotcom -- who legally changed his name -- and six associates are accused of being members of ""a worldwide criminal enterprise"" dubbed the ""Mega Conspiracy."" OPINION: Dotcom: Why New Zealand is a slave to U.S. interests . The allegations . Through a number of websites, including cloud storage company Megaupload, they're accused of reproducing and distributing copies of copyright works including ""motion pictures, television programs, musical recordings, electronic books, images, video games, and other computer software."" The enterprise is estimated to have made $175 million, and deprived copyright owners, including Hollywood production houses, of more than $500 million in revenue, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Dotcom maintains Megaupload was merely a file storage site, and the company should not be held responsible for the content users were uploading. ""I should never have been charged criminally for a civil case. The charges are outrageous and wrong. The case against me is a contract prosecution for Hollywood,"" he told CNN. 'Hollywood' raid . In January 2012, New Zealand police, acting in conjunction with the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice, launched a Hollywood-worthy raid on the sprawling property Dotcom was leasing in Auckland, New Zealand. According to a New Zealand police statement, officers swooped on ""Dotcom Mansion"" in two marked helicopters, and had to cut their way into a safe room where the multi-millionaire had taken refuge -- a version of events that was later contested in court. Dotcom has called the raid ""needlessly theatrical"" and a further attempt by U.S. authorities to smear his image. He and three associates were arrested and are all still fighting efforts to return them to the U.S. The next hearing is scheduled for early 2015. READ MORE: New Zealand's dirty election . Lavish lifestyle . During the raid, officers seized 18 luxury vehicles, including ""several top end Mercedes, a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a 1959 pink Cadillac,"" the police statement said, adding to the image cultivated by Dotcom of being a big-spending lover of luxury. The estate he was leasing and later bought -- one of the most expensive in New Zealand -- is a monument to wealth. According to a journalist who visited the property in 2012, it was a ""$24 million suburban castle with ponds, a tennis court, several pools, a Vegas-style stairstep fountain, and a hedgerow labyrinth."" On his Twitter profile, Dotcom describes himself as an ""entrepreneur, innovator, gamer, artist, fighter, father of five."" This year he separated from his wife of five years, Mona Dotcom, who was recently photographed in an Auckland nightclub with Prime Minister John Key's 19-year-old son, Max. She told the New Zealand Herald that the teenager happened to be at the same club. ""I didn't know him and had never met him before. He's kind, and we had a fun night together,"" she said. On Wednesday, Dotcom tweeted to his 366,000 followers: ""Mona Dotcom parties with John Key's son. Can my life get more bizarre? Where's the guy who says ""You've been punk'd?"" Anti-establishment . The 2012 raid on Dotcom's property set off a wave of legal proceedings, pitting the entrepreneur against New Zealand authorities, who had responded to a U.S. call for help to find the alleged fugitive. At issue was the legality of police search warrants and the FBI's seizure of electronic information. This year, a New Zealand appeals court ruled the raid was legal, however the seizure of electronic data was not. Months after the raid, an investigation by the Inspector-General of Intelligence found that the nation's spy agency -- the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) -- had conducted illegal surveillance on Dotcom before officers moved in. At the time of the raid, the GCSB only had jurisdiction over foreign nationals; Dotcom was granted residency in 2010 and should have been protected, the prime minister said in a public apology. ""I apologise to Mr Dotcom, I apologise to New Zealanders because every New Zealander that sits within the category of having permanent residency or is a New Zealand citizen is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him,"" Key said. The law has since been changed to make such surveillance legal, a development which has, in part, prompted Dotcom to join the political realm. The Internet Party . Earlier this year, Dotcom launched his own political party, the Internet Party, which aims to ""modernize New Zealand, give the Internet generation a voice in politics, become a leader in the Internet economy and fight for Internet Freedom,"" he said. It's teamed up with Maori nationalist campaigners, the Mana Party, to contest the national election on September 20. Because he's not a citizen, Dotcom can't stand as a candidate but he's put his financial clout -- some $4.5 million -- behind what some see as an unlikely coalition in attempt to chip away at Key's political power. In an opinion piece for CNN.com, Dotcom said under Key's leadership, the country had ""quietly morphed into the political equivalent of an American slave, responding more readily to the interests that motivate the United States than to the concerns of Kiwis."" On Monday -- five days before the vote -- Dotcom has promised to reveal potentially damaging information on Key and the country's role in international surveillance. However, he said he's not confident the revelations will dent Key's popularity. For his part, Key has said he's ""not losing any sleep"" over potential revelations from his new political rival. New Zealand can decide for itself on Monday, when Dotcom is scheduled to address the media. Whatever the reaction, it is clear Dotcom intends to remain a thorn in the side of the New Zealand government for some time to come.

"(CNN) -- The evidence gathered after Tony Stewart's race car struck and killed another driver who was walking on the track will be given soon to a grand jury, a district attorney in upstate New York announced Tuesday. Michael Tantillo, the Ontario County District Attorney, said the matter will be presented in the ""near future."" He said New York law precludes him from specifying when the grand jury will meet to decide whether Stewart should be indicted on a criminal charge. He also didn't say who he will call as witnesses, but Stewart might be asked to testify. Last week, the Ontario County Office of Sheriff announced it had finished its investigation into the death of Kevin Ward Jr., who died from his injuries after he was struck by a race car driven by Stewart during a spring car race in August. Stewart, a three-time NASCAR top series champion, was driving a dirt-track car when the right rear tire hit Ward, who was walking on the track during an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in Canandaigua, New York. Ward, 20, died of massive blunt trauma before paramedics could get him to a hospital. ""I respect the time and effort spent by both the Ontario County District Attorney and the sheriff's office in investigating this tragic accident,"" Stewart said in a statement. ""I look forward to this process being completed, and I will continue to provide my full cooperation."" One of the pieces of evidence gathered during the investigation was a forensic video enhancement done by the New York State Police Laboratory. There were at least two videos of the incident that police have obtained, but the release didn't say what the lab used for the enhancement. One of the videos from that night at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park race shows two cars coming out of a turn, with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks determinedly on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. Authorities said that the 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Ward, from Port Leyden, New York, was in his fifth season in the Empire Super Sprints series. Stewart missed three NASCAR races after the incident. When he returned to racing at Atlanta, he gave a brief statement to the media. ""This has been one of the toughest tragedies I've ever had to deal with, both professionally and personally. And this is something that will definitely affect my life forever,"" Stewart said at the speedway in his first public appearance since Ward's death. While the incident hit him hard, Stewart said he knows ""that the pain and the mourning that Kevin Ward's family and friends are experiencing is something that I can't possibly imagine.""

"(CNN) -- Manchester City just can't stop spending money as the English Premier League champions have forked out a reported $53 million to sign France international defender Eliaquim Mangala from Portuguese club Porto. Mangala's transfer, confirmed Monday, comes just three months after City was heavily sanctioned by European football body UEFA for breaching new rules on Financial Fair Play. Whatever the deal's financial implications, City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes the 23-year-old Mangala has ""all of the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe's very best defenders."" Pellegrini added on the City website: ""Eliaquim is a player I believe will make an immediate impact in the Premier League, thanks to his physicality, his reading of the game and quality on the ball."" Mangala, who began his professional career at Belgian club Standard Liege, was part of France's 2014 World Cup squad but did not play in any games. ""For me, it was an important step to leave Porto and join Manchester City in order to continue my progress. I want to win titles and I believe I can do this. I am ambitious and this is why I am here,"" Mangala told the City website. In May, the English champions accepted a UEFA fine of â‚¬60 million ($82 million), a restriction on transfer spending and a reduction in the club's squad size for the European Champions League. Mangala is City's fifth permanent signing since last season, following his former Porto teammate Fernando -- who cost $20 million -- to England. Argentine goalkeeper Willy Caballero joined for a reported $10 million from Pellegrini's former club Malaga, while compatriot Bruno Zuculini was acquired for $5 million from Racing Club. Mangala's fellow France World Cup teammate Bacary Sagna moved from Arsenal on a free transfer, while veteran midfielder Frank Lampard will play on loan from City's American feeder club New York City FC. City's only sale since last season has been midfielder Jack Rodwell's $16.7 million departure to Sunderland, while veteran midfielder Gareth Barry joined Everton on a free transfer.

"(CNN) -- The financial world was thrown into a tailspin this week as credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's first downgraded Greece's debt rating to junk status, and also lowered the ratings of Portugal and Spain. Behind the headlines stand the firms that make the calls on the market, which begs a closer look at these powerful players in the global economy. Who are the credit ratings agencies? The ""big three"" are Standard's & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. All originated in the United States, although Fitch has dual headquarters in New York and London. What do they do? They are designed to provide independent analysis of the credit worthiness -- the ability to pay off loans or investments -- of companies, countries and financial products. They rate them on a sliding scale ranging from AAA to D. In the case of government bonds, anything that slips to BB+, as was the case with Greece this week, is considered a ""highly speculative"" investment: Or ""junk bonds"" in the parlance of the markets. Why do they wield such power? Investors across the world look to credit ratings agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market. For governments, the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds: cash given to governments like Greece by investors that, over time, will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults. The downgrade of Greece signaled Standard & Poor's belief that Greece has a higher likelihood to default on investments. It caused investors to lose their appetite to invest in bonds from Greece, which imperils the nation's ability to pay down its deficit -- which now stands more than 13 percent higher than the total economic output of the country. What Greece's debt rating downgrade means . The decisions of credit rating agencies also have a ripple effect through the market: In the wake of the Greece downgrade, investors across the globe started rethinking investment in other governments' bonds and began selling off more risky investments. How are they paid? Historically, they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings. In the 1970s, however, credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings. In 1975, U.S. legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products. What are the complaints against the firms? Critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments -- especially in light of AAA ratings given to mortgage-backed securities that imploded when defaults on U.S. home loans shot up, triggering the financial crisis. Lawmakers in the United States, the European Union and other countries around the world are now reviewing regulations on the credit ratings agencies. Credit ratings agencies, too, have revamped their procedures and have argued their ratings are merely opinions -- it's up to the markets to decide.","Greece's debt rating lowered to junk status, Portugal and Spain also drops .

"(CNN) -- A week after claiming a hacker had posted a lewd photo to his Twitter account, U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner on Monday apologized for lying about the incident and admitted carrying on inappropriate relationships with several women he'd met online. Weiner, a New York Democrat, said he is not resigning his seat, nor is he planning on separating from his wife. But he said he took ""full responsibility"" for his actions -- both the relationships and for lying about sending the photo last month of his bulging underwear on his Twitter account. ""To be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it. I'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused my wife, and our family, my constituents, my friends, my supporters and my staff,"" he said, claiming he'd posted the Twitter photo accidentally as a ""joke"" and then ""panicked."" ""I lied because I was ashamed at what I had done, and I didn't want to get caught."" An emotional Weiner described his actions as ""dumb,"" ""destructive"" and ""deeply, deeply hurtful"" -- both for his admitted coverup and for repeatedly engaging in ""inappropriate conversations conducted over Twitter, Facebook, e-mail and occasionally on the phone"" with women he'd met online, mostly via Facebook. The congressman claimed that he never met any of these women in person, and that his wife Huma only learned he'd been lying about the Twitter picture on Monday morning. ""I have made terrible mistakes,"" Weiner told reporters. ""I have not been honest with myself or my family. ... I should not have done this, and I should not have done this particularly when I was married."" Weiner claimed he does not believe he used any government resources, while he ""exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years."" Some of those relationships began before his 2010 marriage and some happened, and continued, afterward. Still, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi announced that she would call ""for an Ethics Committee investigation to determine whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred."" Weiner issued a statement saying he would ""welcome and fully cooperate"" with the probe, which other Democratic leaders also rallied behind. But one Republican source called the move ""hollow,"" saying Pelosi should have insisted that Weiner resign -- as former Rep. Chris Lee, a New York Republican, did in February amid reports that the married man had tried to solicit women via Craigslist. The seven-term congressman said during his press conference that he'd talked with Pelosi briefly that day, saying she was ""not happy"" but ""also told me that she loved me and wanted us to ... pull through this."" He hails from New York's solidly Democratic 9th district, which includes parts of the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. He handily won re-election last November, besting his Republican challenger by 22 points. If Weiner were to resign or be compelled to leave office, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, would determine the timing of a special election to replace him. Monday afternoon's admission came hours after images were published on BigGovernment.com, a conservative website run by Andrew Breitbart, that purportedly showed Weiner shirtless. Before the congressman spoke at his scheduled 4 p.m. press conference, Breitbart -- who claimed he just happened to be staying at a hotel a few blocks down -- unexpectedly took over the podium to challenge Weiner and the media and defend his site's story. ""This is an ongoing story, this is a compelling story,"" said Breitbart, bristling at reports he orchestrated the issue for political purposes and was responsible for hacking Weiner's account. ""I did not like that he doubled down that this is about Breitbart."" The conservative blogger also claimed that he had, in his possession, another ""X-rated"" photo allegedly from Weiner that he said he wasn't releasing because he hoped ""to save (Weiner's) family."" ""I'd like an apology,"" a defiant Breitbart said. ""This was his strategy, which is to blame me for hacking."" During his press conference, Weiner apologized ""to everyone that I misled in the media"" -- including Breitbart -- but most of all to his wife. ""This was me doing a dumb thing, and doing it repeatedly, then lying about it,"" Weiner said. Breitbart's website was the first to publish an incriminating photo, sent May 27 via Twitter from Weiner's account of a man in his underwear. Weiner initially released written statements claiming that he was the victim of a hacker and a prank. Then, during a testy press conference, he dodged questions about whether the photo was of him and why he hadn't asked law enforcement to investigate if his account had, indeed, been compromised. The following day, in a series of interviews, he said he could not say with ""certitude"" if the photograph was of him. He has also deflected recent questions from CNN, saying he had hired an attorney at the firm of Baker Hostetler to look into the matter. The woman who received the Twitter photo in late May, Gennette Cordova, denied on her own account that she was one of the six women who Weiner admitted having an ""inappropriate relationship."" But ABC News reports that Meagan Broussard, a 26-year-old single mother from Texas, provided them with dozens of photos, e-mails, Facebook messages and cell phone call logs related to her relationship with Weiner. In a posting on BigGovernment.com, Broussard said she was a U.S. Army veteran and full-time college student who, on April 20, went to Weiner's Facebook page and commented that the congressman was ""hot"" on one of his videos. She said the two began corresponding ""within an hour,"" adding that she didn't know if he is a ""horrible person"" but decided to speak out after hearing he'd ""hired an investigative firm to go through all of his files."" CNN has attempted to contact Broussard, but she could not be immediately reached for comment. Many Democrats first rallied around the liberal congressman. But members of the House Democratic leadership have talked repeatedly in recent days to try to get him to end what has become an unwelcome political distraction, a member of the party's leadership told CNN before Weiner's press conference Monday. ""It's frustrating because we'll talk to him, and say clean it up, and then he goes out and does stuff,"" said the member of the House Democratic leadership, who declined to speak on the record about private discussions with Weiner. ""He's got to put the period at the end of the sentence,"" the Democratic source said before Weiner's confession. ""It's painful."" Whatever voters might decide in 17 months when he's next on the ballot, CNN contributor and longtime Democratic insider James Carville said that Weiner has hurt himself considerably among fellow members of his party. One big reason is that his wife, Huma Abedin, had been a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- with former President Bill Clinton even officiating the couple's nuptials last July. ""Right now, the Democrats are furious at this guy,"" said Carville. ""He is married to one of the most popular people in the Democratic party."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: Carville says Democrats are ""furious"" at Weiner, whose wife has ties to the Clintons .

"(CNN) -- Better late than never. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger didn't sign a forward or striker in this year's January transfer window when his team was very much still in the Premier League title race, instead relying on unproven 21-year-old Yaya Sanogo to back up French international Olivier Giroud. The move backfired, with Arsenal -- as in years past -- slipping away in February and March. Wenger and Arsenal, though, ventured into the market Thursday and landed Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona. The 25-year-old agreed to join the Gunners from Barcelona on a ""long-term contract"" for an ""undisclosed fee,"" Arsenal said on its website. That fee is about $51 million, according to reports. Sanchez impressed for Chile at the World Cup in Brazil with his finishing -- scoring twice -- and work rate. He netted 47 goals in 141 games for Barcelona, the Catalan club said, and he won a league title and the Spanish Cup in his three years in Spain. ""I'm so happy to be joining Arsenal, a club which has a great manager, a fantastic squad of players, huge support around the world and a great stadium in London,"" Sanchez told Arsenal's website. ""I'm looking forward to meeting my new teammates and to be playing for Arsenal in the Premier League and Champions League. ""I will give my best to Arsenal and want to make all the supporters happy."" Wenger called Sanchez a ""fantastic"" footballer. ""Alexis will add power, creativity and much quality to our squad and we are all looking forward to him joining up with us in a few weeks,"" Wenger told Arsenal's website. ""He has consistently produced top-quality performances at the highest level for a number of seasons now and we are all excited to see him integrate into the Arsenal squad. ""I'm sure all Arsenal supporters will join me in welcoming Alexis to our club."" As excited as the Arsenal fans are bound to be, many will be hoping for more signings. Arsenal hasn't won the Premier League title since going unbeaten in 2003/2004 and only narrowly ended its nine-year trophy drought by beating Hull in extra time in May's FA Cup final. Sanchez's departure from Barcelona could yet be another sign that Luis Suarez is close to joining Barcelona from Liverpool. ""FC Barcelona thanks Alexis Sanchez for his professionalism and dedication for the three seasons that he has been in the first team squad, and wishes him all the best for the future,"" Barcelona said on its website.","Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez agrees to join Arsenal from Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez is set to join Spanish giants Barcelona after Liverpool and the La Liga club announced they had agreed terms for a sale. And later Friday, Suarez's lawyer said he would be appealing the four-month ban from any football activities Suarez received for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Barcelona confirmed that Suarez will be traveling to the Nou Camp next week to undergo a medical before signing a five-year contract. Despite a reported transfer fee in the region of Â£75 million ($128.5 million), Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said it was with ""great reluctance"" that the 27-year-old is being sold. ""The club have done all they can over a sustained period of time to try to keep Luis at Liverpool,"" Rodgers said in a statement posted on Liverpool's official website. ""It is with great reluctance and following lengthy discussions we have eventually agreed to his wishes to move to Spain for new experiences and challenges. We wish him and his young family well; we will always consider them to be friends."" Suarez joined Liverpool in January 2011 from Dutch club Ajax for Â£22.8 million ($39 million), scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances. He played a pivotal role in the Reds' title challenge last year, netting 31 times in 37 appearances. Liverpool came up just short in the end finishing second to Manchester City but ensured Champions League football for the first time in four seasons. Suarez's time on Merseyside was also marked by two highly controversial incidents, resulting in lengthy bans. He was found guilty by the English Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra at a match in October 2011 and given an eight-game suspension. And at the end of the 2012/13 season Suarez bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic on the arm, resulting in another ban of 10 matches for violent conduct. It was the second time that Suarez bit an opponent. While playing for Ajax in 2010 Suarez was suspended for seven games after biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal on the shoulder. Then came the incident involving Chiellini in Brazil. Despite his disciplinary difficulties, Rodgers praised Suarez for his contribution while at Anfield. ""Luis is a very special talent and I thank him for the role he has played in the team in the past two years, during my time at Liverpool,"" Rodgers said. ""I think he would be the first to accept he has improved as a player over that period, along with the team and has benefited from being here, as we have benefited from him."" Appeal to CAS . FIFA upheld Suarez's suspension Thursday, with the player's lawyer calling the punishment -- which included a nine-game international ban -- ""blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist."" Swiss-based CAS represents Suarez's last chance of overturning his sanction. ""We hope they revoke this sanction that is blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist,"" Alejandro Balbi told Spanish radio station Cope. ""The right of a footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried about that. The nine (international) games may seem excessive, but the fact that he can't watch a game of football, or train or carry out his job, we are talking about unpleasant things. ""We knew that FIFA would uphold the ban because they are corporatists. We will not stop, we are going to go to the CAS and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available to us.""

"(CNN) -- England battled to a morale-boosting 1-0 win over world champions Spain at Wembley Saturday with their stand-in captain Frank Lampard scoring the only goal early in the second half. The home side were lacking regular captain John Terry and star striker Wayne Rooney, but were rewarded for a dogged display against a Spain side who had the bulk of possession but created few chances. Lampard took his in the 49th minute and can rarely have scored a simpler goal as he headed home into a gaping net after Darren Bent's header from a James Milner free-kick hit the post and rebounded invitingly for him. Spain, who had not lost to England for 10 years, continued to force the home side back, with Tottenham midfielder Scott Parker outstanding in a rearguard action, being named man of the match. Fabio Capello's experimental central defensive partnership of Joleon Lescott and Phil Jagielka also held firm throughout, but Spain still might have equalized. David Villa's volleyed shot hit the post with England goalkeeper Joe Hart beaten and substitute Cesc Fabregas sent a late effort wide from an excellent scoring position. The final whistle came as a relief to the capacity crowd of just over 87,189 and Lampard, who was substituted by Gareth Barry after his goal, said his team would not be getting carried away with their victory in the friendly. ""For everyone it is a lift, but we have to be realistic. We know they dominated the game for long periods,"" the Chelsea star told ITV Sport. ""The back four and Scott (Parker) were fantastic,"" he said. ""They are without doubt the best team in the world. It gives us something to build on but we know we have to improve."" Lampard's Chelsea teammate Terry, under investigation by the English FA for an alleged racist comment in a match against Queens Park Rangers, is expected to return for Tuesday's match against Sweden. But Rooney, who is appealing against a three-match Euro 2012 ban, has been left out of the squad as Capello experiments for next year's finals. In other international friendly action Saturday, Wales continued their fine recent form with a 4-1 home win over Norway in Cardiff. Tottenham's Gareth Bale and Craig Bellamy of Liverpool scored to put Gary Speed's men 2-0 ahead and two late Sam Vokes' goals made the game safe after Erik Huseklepp had pulled one back for the visitors. Mexico beat Serbia 2-0 with Manchester United's Javier Hernandez scoring the second to make the game safe for the home side.","England beat Spain 1-0 in a friendly international at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich wrapped up the Bundesliga title in record time on Tuesday night with a 3-1 win over Hertha Berlin at the Olympic Stadium. After being crowned champions with six games to spare last season, the Bavarians have gone one better this year, winning with seven still left to play. Bayern were 2-0 up within the first 15 minutes -- Toni Kroos netting in the sixth minute with Mario Goetze heading a second eight minutes later -- and looked to be coasting to a 24th Bundesliga title. Hertha did pull a goal back as Colombian striker Adrian Ramos netted a 66th-minute penalty, but when Franck Ribery came off the bench to score a third with 11 minutes remaining the celebrations for Bayern's traveling fans could begin. Pep Guardiola's side have now won their last 19 league games and have 77 points from 27 matches -- 25 points more than second place Borussia Dortmund with only 21 points now available from the remaining seven matches. ""I am just happy we have finally managed it,"" Guardiola said. ""It didn't matter when we got it just as long as we won the title for this great club."" The Spanish manager, who steered Barcelona to three consecutive La Liga titles, has built on the foundations laid by former coach Jupp Heynckes who guided Bayern to the treble (Bundesliga, DFB Cup and Champions League) last season. Tuesday's win also sees Bayern extend their unbeaten run of league matches to 52 -- their last loss was against Bayer Leverkusen on October 28th 2012. ""It's unbelievable to clinch the title on the back of an unbeaten record,"" said winger Arjen Robben. ""We're all unbelievably proud of the team and our achievements this season."" Guardiola's team still have plenty to play for with not just a Champions League title to defend -- they play Manchester United in the first leg of the quarterfinals on April 1 -- but more league records to try and break before the season finishes. Bayern need 15 points to overhaul last year's record haul of 91 league points and win five of their last seven matches to better the mark of most wins (29, set last year) in a season. Elsewhere in the Bundesliga on Tuesday, second-place Borussia Dortmund drew 0-0 with third-place Schalke while Braunschweig beat Mainz 3 - 1. Wolfsburg were also 3-1 winners against Werder Bremen.

"(CNN) -- He is the Chosen One MK II -- and he is hoping to make history of a more notable kind than his predecessor achieved. After waiting 27 years to appoint a new manager, Manchester United's attempts to fill the void left by Alex Ferguson now focus on Louis van Gaal -- who on Monday was named to succeed David Moyes, sacked in April after enduring a miserable campaign in charge. While Moyes' short tenure was marked by morale-sapping defeats against lesser teams United previously brushed aside, Van Gaal brings an authority earned by stamping his mark on some of the world's biggest clubs. ""It was always a wish for me to work in the Premier League,"" the Dutchman said in a United statement after a signing a three-year contract with the 20-time English champions. ""To work as a manager for Manchester United, the biggest club in the world, makes me very proud. ""I have managed in games at Old Trafford before and know what an incredible arena Old Trafford is and how passionate and knowledgeable the fans are. This club has big ambitions; I too have big ambitions. Together I'm sure we will make history."" While Moyes arrived at Old Trafford without a major trophy to his name, Van Gaal, who will step down from his role as Netherlands coach after the forthcoming World Cup, comes with real European pedigree. Making his name as a manager at Ajax, he led the Dutch club to three Eredivisie titles, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League. The 62-year-old enjoyed further success at Barcelona -- winning back-to-back La Liga titles -- while another Eredivisie title followed at AZ Alkmaar, before he claimed a German league-and-cup double at Bayern Munich. Van Gaal will be expected to take United back to the summit of English football after the club slipped from winning the 2012-13 Premier League title by a margin of 11 points to missing out on Champions League qualification this term, for the first time since 1995. ""In Louis van Gaal, we have secured the services of one of the outstanding managers in the game today,"" declared United chief executive Ed Woodward. ""He has achieved many things in his career to date and Old Trafford provides him with a fitting stage on which to write new chapters in the Manchester United story."" In his bid to restore the club to its former glories, Van Gaal has retained Ryan Giggs as his assistant manager. The Welshman is a veteran of over two decades at United, winning 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League crowns in 963 appearances, and took over as manager for the final four games of the 2013-14 season after Moyes was dismissed. ""I am thrilled to have the chance to serve as assistant manager,"" the 40-year-old said Monday, before announcing his retirement from playing. ""Louis van Gaal is a world-class coach and I know I will learn a lot about coaching from being able to observe and contribute at such close quarters. ""Manchester United has been a huge part of my life and I'm delighted to be able to continue that relationship in such a key role. ""Today is a new chapter filled with many emotions -- immense pride, sadness, but most of all, excitement towards the future. United fans I hope will share and echo my belief that the club, the management and owners, are doing everything they can to return this great club to where it belongs, and I hope to be there every step of the way."" Despite Van Gaal's impressive track record, his appointment is potentially risky. Former Germany international Mehmet Scholl, who worked with the Dutchman during their time together at Bayern, warned United players not to expect an easy ride. ""He's very strict and severe. So the players just have the chance to follow him or they are out, and he takes the next players,"" Scholl recently told UK newspaper The Guardian. ""(Players) are not computers. Sometimes the brain is full. And he still wants (you) to learn, to learn, to learn, high level, every day. Is it annoying? No. It's exhausting. They lose power. That's what happened at Bayern Munich."" Although Van Gaal impressed during his first stint in charge at Barcelona -- between 1997-2000 -- he lasted less than a year in the job upon his return in 2002, with a string of bad results proving to be his downfall. ""If you treat your people bad, they remember,"" Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano, who worked alongside the Dutchman at the Camp Nou, told Britain's Daily Telegraph. ""One day you make an error and they kill you. I've seen this in many clubs. Louis van Gaal has been a very good coach in many clubs but his style is very difficult. The same thing happened to him in Barcelona as in Bayern Munich. ""He is very tough, people don't like him, but he wins. And one day you don't win -- and when you don't win, everybody that is angry with you will come back to you and try to kill you. ""In the movies this works, in real life it doesn't."" Van Gaal, who had been linked with Tottenham Hotspur until the United job became available, will be given a large transfer budget as he attempts to bring success back to the club. The likes of Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos and Southampton's England World Cup defender Luke Shaw have been linked with moves to Manchester.","Louis van Gaal appointed as manager of Manchester United .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Tom Harkin supporters Joan and Gary Kiernan decided to throw the congressional candidate a fundraiser in 1972, they charged $2 for the ticket, picked up the costs for the steak, salad and baked potatoes and gave the funds raised to Harkin's campaign. Reported attendance: 20 people. Forty-two years, 37 Harkin Steak Fry events and countless pounds of beef later, the event that started as a small fundraiser for a little-known congressional candidate has turned into the most important political event in Iowa and a must-stop for Democrats thinking about a run for the presidency."" Harkin himself declared his candidacy for president at the event in 1991, putting the event on the presidential map. Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton came to Iowa the next year to address 5,000 excited Iowa supporters at the most attended event to date. In 2006, then-Sen. Barack Obama spoke at the steak fry, delivering a speech that helped catapult him into presidential contention. Obama was back in 2007, joined by Hillary Clinton and other Democratic contenders vying for the presidency. More than 15,000 people attended the 2007 event. Clinton went on to finish a disappointing third in 2008, a finish that was an early sign of things to come for her first presidential run. But she will be back this year for the final installment of the steak fry; Harkin is retiring from the Senate next year. Bill and Hillary Clinton are headlining Sunday's event, raising the specter that the former first lady and secretary of state will consider running for president in 2016. Clinton has admitted she is considering a run and this weekend will be the first time she visits Iowa -- the critically important first-in-the-nation caucus state -- in six years. Republicans are hoping to remind Iowans of that failure, but with 2016 hopes anew, Clinton's most ardent supporters are starting to organize in Iowa. Ready for Hillary, a super PAC urging Clinton to run for president and staffed by some of her former aides, has been running phone banks in Iowa and Washington, D.C., urging Democrats to buy tickets and attend the event. The night before the event, Executive Director Adam Parkhomenko said the PAC would make its first donation to a campaign. It will max its donation to Bruce Braley, giving the Senate hopeful $2,600 at a fund-raiser. The group has also purchased a billboard in Des Moines, plans to bus supporters from local colleges to the event and will hand out lawn signs and free T-shirts. ""Ready for Hillary and our supporters look forward to honoring Sen. Tom Harkin's legacy and continuing our work to support Iowa Democrats in 2014,"" the group said in an email to supporters, making no mention of Clinton's possible 2016 bid. But the group has also committed an undisclosed, sizable amount of money to promoting the event. Ready for Hillary will have 100 volunteers at the steak fry, some of whom have flown in from around the country. The PAC is committed to not only bus students from local colleges, but will also pay their entry fee for the event. There is a reason for this spending. While a spokesman for the group said they consider it ""an investment in Iowa and organizing here,"" Ready for Hillary also will receive the names of all the event attendees in a swap with the state Democratic Party. Those emails will in turn be used to organize future PAC events in the Hawkeye State. ""I think it is fair to say that this last steak fry was going to be an iconic event no matter what,"" said Jerry Crawford, who served as Hillary Clinton's Midwest co-chair during her 2008 campaign. ""But now with Bill and Hillary Clinton both there, it probably becomes the more important event in Iowa Democratic party history."" Crawford added, ""If people leave the steak fry thinking Bill and Hillary Clinton were very genuine, they will be the big winners."" Hillary Clinton is currently leaps and bounds ahead of other possible 2016 challengers. A CNN/ORC poll out Friday found that Clinton 53% of all registered Democrats contacted in Iowa said they would support Hillary Clinton if the 2016 caucuses were held today. That is more than triple the amount of support that any of her other would-be competitors would receive. Organizers anticipate 5,000 people will attend the steak fry but say they are planning for more in case the weather is ""gorgeous."" A ticket to the event costs $30, and the proceeds will be split evenly between Harkin's PAC and the state party. More than 200 journalists have requested credentials to cover the event. ""It will be a Tom Harkin weekend,"" said Teresa Vilmain, Clinton's state director in 2008 and a longtime Iowa operative. Held on an idyllic farm in Indianola, 30 minutes south of Des Moines, the event is part fundraiser, part pep rally, part barbecue. Nothing at the event is actually fried; the steaks are grilled. And while jokes have been made -- ""My only advice to you is don't eat the steak, get the chicken,"" said one political analyst, who requested anonymity to freely discuss the quality of the food -- the event has been more about raising funds for the state party and Harkin. Iowa Democrats this year have close races up and down the ticket, including for Harkin's seat in the Senate, where Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst are in a dead heat, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll. State Democratic Party Chair Scott Brennan said he expects -- and hopes -- the focus of the event will be on rallying the base ahead of November's elections. Brennan echoed the idea that Clinton won't address 2016 -- ""You never know,"" he added as a caveat -- but noted that Clinton's attendance will still help if she chooses to run. ""Whether it is raining or cold or hot, it is just the fact that people show up,"" Brennan said. ""These are the people who knock on doors, make phone calls. These are the people who work. It is important because you get a chance to connect with these core activists."" With the steak fry going away, there will be a noticeable gap in the Iowa political calendar every fall. Though many strategists argue that it is impossible to replace the steak fry given its reputation and history, some have pointed to Senate candidate Braley's annual ""Bruce, Blue and BBQ"" event that happens every fall. ""That would be a logical successor,"" said Brennan. Hillary Clinton to decide on 2016 presidential run around end of year . Bernie Sanders calls for 'political revolution' in Iowa .

"(CNN) -- It was one of the most memorable scenes in recent Champions League history -- Jose Mourinho running along the touchline to celebrate with his Porto side at Old Trafford after a late goal knocked out Manchester United in 2004. Ten years later Mourinho made another long dash on the touchline in the Champions League, this time after his Chelsea scored an 87th-minute goal through Demba Ba to take control against Paris Saint-Germain in the quarterfinals. He wasn't overly celebrating but instead giving instructions to his team on how to protect the lead in the dying stages. Chelsea did hang on, winning 2-0 at home to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit and advance on away goals in a battle of the rich versus the rich in European football. Mourinho thus will be managing a team in the Champions League last four for the fifth consecutive campaign. ""Demba made a crucial finish for us and I think (it was) very much deserved,"" Mourinho told ITV. ""The team that decided to defend was punished and the team that played with their heart deserved to go to the semis."" A Champions League winner with Porto and Inter Milan, Mourinho is seeking to achieve the feat with his beloved Blues. Chelsea will be joined in the semis by Mourinho's previous club Real Madrid, which survived -- barely -- without Cristiano Ronaldo against 2013 finalist Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund won 2-0 at home Tuesday but was eliminated 3-2 on aggregate. ""It was a night of suffering but at the end of it we are happy as we are through to the semifinals,"" Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told UEFA.com. The opening 25 minutes in London suggested the visitors would comfortably cope with Chelsea. But after Salvatore Sirigu had to scramble to get a hand to Frank Lampard's deflected free kick, the game changed. Andre Schurrle, only on the field after an injury to Chelsea's offensive star, Eden Hazard, converted from David Luiz's flick in the 32nd minute. Stamford Bridge awoke, and Schurrle and Oscar struck the crossbar seconds apart shortly after the break. Edinson Cavani skied over the bar in the 77th minute and substitute Ba made PSG pay for the miss when he netted into the roof of the net. Mourinho has openly criticized his strikers this season, with Ba not seeing much playing time, but the Senegal international finished impressively with his left foot while falling to the ground. ""I saw the ball and it was in the goal,"" he told ITV. ""I just do what I have to do when I get chances. I didn't have chances this season but tonight I took it."" Beaten in injury time last week to give PSG the two-goal advantage, Chelsea keeper Petr Cech preserved his team's passage Tuesday by pushing away Marquinhos' effort in added time. How PSG must have rued the absence of injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Dortmund, meanwhile, has history in engineering miracles in the Champions League quarterfinals against Spanish opposition, scoring twice in injury time last year to overcome Malaga 3-2 on aggregate. But things took a turn for the worse for Jurgen Klopp's men when fullback Lukasz Piszczek gave away a penalty for handball. Without Ronaldo, duties were left to Angel di Maria. Di Maria slipped, though still managed a good shot, but Roman Weidenfeller dived to his left to thwart the Argentina winger. The save ignited Dortmund, which had inspirational striker Robert Lewandowski back in its ranks following a first-leg suspension. Dortmund -- which ousted Real Madrid in last season's competition -- also got help from the Madrid back four. Pepe's poor touch meant for keeper Iker Casillas was intercepted by an alert Marco Reus and the German international held his nerve to make it 1-0 in the 24th minute. Another Real Madrid gaffe led to another Dortmund break: Casillas tipped Lewandowski's shot onto the post but Reus was there for the rebound in the 37th minute. Real Madrid coped slightly better in the second half, although Dortmund midfielder Henrik Mkhitaryan hit the post after rounding Casillas. Casillas -- not the starter in La Liga -- then had to be alert to stop Mkhitaryan and Kevin Grosskreutz, with Reus booked for a dive in the box. ""We were clearly the better side today and we really should have scored more goals, but because the game and our performance was so extraordinarily good I really will not make accusations to anyone today,"" Klopp told UEFA. On Wednesday, Manchester United visits defending champion Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid hosts Barcelona. Both ties are leveled at 1-1.","Chelsea overcomes 3-1 first-leg deficit against PSG to reach Champions League semis .

"(CNN) -- 1968 was a year of triumphs and tragedies. While America reached new heights by introducing the first 747 and orbiting the moon, all was not well down on Earth. The United States lost a Navy intelligence ship and two proponents of peace -- the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Here are eight events that made history during that unforgettable year. 1. January 23: North Korea captures the USS Pueblo . When North Korea captured the American surveillance ship USS Pueblo, it sparked an 11-month crisis that threatened to worsen already high Cold War tensions in the region. The trouble started with the Pueblo. It had been nearly 15 years since the Korean War between U.S.-led forces and the North. The Navy intelligence ship was monitoring North Korea from the Tsushima Strait, an ocean channel dividing Korea and Japan. Related: Fast facts about the Korean War . The Navy said its ship was operating in international waters, but North Korea said the Pueblo had entered its territory, and dispatched warships and aircraft to intercept it. Accounts differ on both sides as to what really happened. Eventually, there was an exchange of gunfire. U.S. crewman Duane Hodges was killed. The North Korean military boarded the Pueblo, captured its crew and brought the ship to port in North Korea. The Pueblo's 82 surviving crew members reported that while in custody, they were held at a POW camp where they were tortured and starved. North Korea staged a news conference during which the crew was forced to applaud the North Koreans for treating them kindly. During the news conference crew members laced their comments with sarcasm and extended their middle fingers in defiance. When North Korea learned later that the Americans had mocked them, the crew was severely beaten. After months of negotiations, North Korea agreed to free the crewmen after the United States. acknowledged that the Pueblo had been spying and promised not to spy in the future. On December 23, the crew was allowed to safely return to South Korean territory. Immediately, the U.S. retracted its acknowledgments. Related: What's life like inside North Korea?

In many ways, the bloody Tet Offensive signified the beginning of the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. The coordinated attack by 85,000 Viet Cong and North Vietnamese targeted 36 major cities and towns in South Vietnam. It caught U.S.-led forces by surprise. Related: Vietnam War fast facts .

Martin Luther King Jr. was standing on the second floor balcony of room 306 at the Lorraine Motel when he was struck by a bullet at 6:01 p.m. The 39-year-old civil rights leader was rushed to nearby St. Joseph's Hospital but never regained consciousness. He was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. Related: I was with King's widow the night her husband was killed . King's fellow civil rights pioneers made public pleas for a nonviolent response to honor his memory. But riots broke out in more than 100 cities across the nation. Related: King's last crusade . Two months later, James Earl Ray was captured at London's Heathrow Airport. Fingerprints that had been traced back to Ray linked him to the crime. He confessed but later attempted to recant. Then he pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of a death sentence. Later Ray tried to withdraw his guilty plea and obtain a new trial. He died in prison in 1998. Related: The case against James Earl Ray . Related: Conspiracy theories live on . On the night King was assassinated, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy arrived in Indianapolis on a campaign stop. Upon hearing the news, Kennedy informed a crowd of listeners about King's death. They reacted with gasps and cries. Kennedy urged the crowd against bitterness, hatred or revenge. He called on them to embrace King's message of love, wisdom and compassion toward one another. Kennedy's speech is believed to have prevented rioting in Indianapolis that night. 4. June 5: Robert F. Kennedy assassinated in Los Angeles . Just two months later, Kennedy himself was gunned down by an assassin at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The attack took place shortly after Kennedy had wrapped up a speech in the hotel ballroom. As he cut through a kitchen corridor on his way to another part of the building, a Jordanian born Palestinian named Sirhan Sirhan opened fire, hitting Kennedy in the head and back. Kennedy collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, where he underwent brain surgery. Twenty-six hours after the attack, Kennedy died. He was 42. Related: Witness says there was a second shooter .

September 30: Boeing introduces the first 747 ""Jumbo Jet"" When demand for air travel reached sky-high levels in the 1960s, the world's then-largest passenger aircraft -- the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet -- was a game changer. The ability to carry far more passengers than previous airliners suddenly made globetrotting a feasible option for would-be wanderers who previously thought they would never afford such exotic sojourns. The massive aircraft was indeed an aviation design milestone. More than six stories tall, it seated 374 passengers and weighed 300 tons. Related: Boeing through the ages . After its 1968 reveal, the 747 made its first flight on February 9, 1969, near Boeing's factory in western Washington state. That specific plane flew more than 12,000 test flights, but it never carried passengers for a major airline. Rather, it was a test plane for engine developments, various improvements and future jet airliners. The 747 is no relic. Amazingly, it remains a major player among global airlines more than 40 years after its unveiling. 6. October 16: U.S. athletes take a stand at the Summer Olympics . During the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two black athletes staged a silent demonstration against racial discrimination in the United States. For the simple defiant act of raising their fists during the National Anthem, the International Olympic Committee condemned American medalists Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Their protest shocked many people who felt it damaged the spirit of the Olympics and unnecessarily brought politics into the Games. As Smith and Carlos were awarded the gold and bronze medals for their performances in the 200-meter race, they bowed their heads and each raised a black gloved fist during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner. The protest didn't stop with their fists. They also wore black socks and no shoes. On their clothes were badges of the Olympic Project for Human Rights, a group dedicated against racial segregation and racism in sports. Also wearing the patch in support of Smith and Carlos was Australian 200-meter silver medalist Peter Norman. Related: Peter Norman, the forgotten Black Power hero . Spectators booed the medalists as they walked away from the ceremony. ""If I win I am an American, not a black American,"" Smith said later. ""But if I did something bad then they would say 'a Negro.' We are black and we are proud of being black."" Smith said his raised right fist symbolized black power in America. He also wore a black scarf, which he said represented black pride. He said the black socks with no shoes symbolized black poverty. Carlos, who had raised his left fist, said the gesture was a display of black unity and that the two men's fists combined had created an arch of unity and power. Carlos also wore beads, which he explained ""were for those individuals that were lynched, or killed that no one said a prayer for, that were hung and tarred."" He said they also were for those thrown off the side of boats that carried slaves across the Atlantic from Africa. Two days later, Smith and Carlos were expelled from Team USA. When they returned home, they were hailed as heroes by members of the African-American community. 7. November 22: ""Star Trek"" airs American television's first interracial kiss .

Shatner is reported to have purposefully ruined all the alternative takes so the network would be forced to air the kiss. Appropriately, Kirk has this line in the episode: ""Where I come from, size, shape or color makes no difference."" 8. December 24: Apollo 8 is the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon . On Christmas Eve, three astronauts circled the moon 10 times. Jim Lovell, Bill Anders and Frank Borman became the first human beings to travel to the moon. Launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Apollo 8 was a mission of firsts: . -The first photos of Earth taken from deep space by humans, including the now iconic ""Earthrise"" -A new rocket speed record of 24,200 mph, a velocity that, according to NASA, was necessary to escape Earth's gravitational pull . --The first time the lunar surface was broadcast on live television . -The first time humans had traveled to the far side of the moon . The weeklong mission was fueled by a Space Race rivalry with the Soviet Union and the nation's desire to fulfill President John F. Kennedy's wishes to land on the moon by decade's end, a goal accomplished by Apollo 11 seven months later. As Apollo 8 emerged from the mysterious dark side of the moon before heading back to Earth, a relieved Lovell announced to the world, ""Houston, please be informed there is a Santa Claus."" This amazing and joyous mission was a rare high note in a year filled with historically tragic events. According to ""A Man on the Moon,"" Andrew Chaikin's book on the Apollo program, the astronauts received countless telegrams after they returned safely home. But one stuck out from the others.

"(CNN) -- Luiz Felipe Scolari's second stint as Brazil manager didn't go nearly as well as the first. A dozen years after leading Brazil to the World Cup title in Asia, he resigned in the wake of the Selecao's capitulation in the semifinals and third-place defeat on home soil last week. Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the last four -- it was the first time a team scored seven goals in a World Cup semifinal -- before the host meekly lost to the Netherlands 3-0 on Saturday. ""Luiz Felipe Scolari and his fellow coaching staff surrendered their positions to the board,"" Brazil's football federation, the CBF, said in a statement on its website, adding that the resignations were accepted. ""Scolari and all his backroom staff deserve our respect and thanks,"" CBF president Jose Maria Marin told the website. ""They were responsible for returning to the Brazilian people a love for the national side, even if they did not achieve our highest aim."" Scolari's decision was fully expected, since he said he was ""responsible"" for the loss to Germany. Without injured talisman Neymar and captain Thiago Silva in the heart of defense, Brazil conceded four times in six minutes in the first half in Belo Horizonte, leaving fans in tears in the stands. There was no respite in the third-place game as the Dutch set the tone by netting in the third minute. Brazil's Tite, who last guided Corinthians in his 20-plus year coaching career, is the favorite to take over from Scolari. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and ex-Brazil striker Ronaldo are also among the big names linked with the job. Even with a team that was considered far from vintage -- especially compared to previous Brazil sides -- many expected Brazil to win the World Cup after defeating Spain in the 2013 Confederations Cup final. But the warning signs that Brazil were not exactly buzzing were there in the opening game of the group stages of the 2014 World Cup. Scolari's side were fortunate to top Croatia, benefiting from a dubious penalty. Since cutting ties with Portugal in 2008, Scolari hasn't had success with any of the sides he's managed, including Chelsea and Palmeiras.","Luiz Felipe Scolari resigns as Brazil manager after Brazil thumped in last two games .

"New York (CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy has weakened, yet her presence will be felt in the days and weeks to come as transportation systems assess impacts and try to resume schedules. Much of Tuesday's air and rail service has been canceled, and millions of public transit commuters are without service. Here's what to expect in many of the affected areas: . Transit upheaval . New York City's massive public transit network was crippled overnight. ""The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night,"" MTA Chairman Joseph J. Lhoto said in an online statement. Seven subway tunnels under the East River flooded in the course of the storm, the Metro-North Railroad lost power in sections of its lines and the Long Island Rail Road sustained flooding in one East River tunnel and evacuated its West Side Yards, according to the statement. The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel flooded ""from end to end,"" the Queens Midtown Tunnel also was closed because of flooding, and six bus garages were disabled. Lhota said MTA employees will restore service as quickly as possible ""to help bring New York back to normal."" In New Jersey, all NJ Transit services remain suspended until further notice. Transit service is also suspended Tuesday in Maryland, according to the Maryland Transit Administration. Transit officials in Philadelphia said they are optimistic that city and suburban services will be up and running sometime Tuesday but could not give an exact time. Southeastern Pennsylvania's regional rail commuter lines present a bigger challenge, said SEPTA spokeswoman Jerri Williams. Crews were out overnight and were walking the lines Tuesday assessing damage with the hopes of resuming commuter rail service Wednesday morning. ""But we already know it's going to be a challenge. We already know there's going to be disruptions and delays in the morning,"" Williams said. In Boston, most transit service was set to resume Tuesday morning, with some delays, according to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Amtrak extended Northeast Corridor cancellations through Tuesday. Bus routes connected to those trains were also canceled. Trains coming to and from Canada or to and from the South will still operate, but they will stop short of the storm-affected states. Consult Amtrak's website for more details. Thousands of flights canceled . There have already been more than 15,000 flight cancellations since Sunday as a result of Sandy, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. That number is expected to rise, since FlightAware.com reports that most airports in the New York City area are closed and haven't announced reopening times. ""It is unlikely there will be scheduled flight operations to/from NYC today and some airlines have begun canceling flights on Wednesday,"" according to a FlightAware.com statement. There have been 6,047 flights canceled for Tuesday, as of 8:50 a.m., FlightAware figures show. Philadelphia is leading the way with 1,085 cancellations followed by the New York-area airports with nearly 1,000 each. Airlines have already canceled 635 flights for Wednesday. More cancellations are expected Tuesday and Wednesday as airport staffs assess damage. American Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines (including its AirTran subsidiary), and US Airways announced cancellations Monday of all Tuesday operations to many Northeast locations, including the Philadelphia, Washington, Boston and New York City-area airports. United Airlines has canceled flights at the New York City airports and only expects to restart operations in the Washington area Tuesday night. Delta Air Lines said Monday that ""limited flying is expected to resume Tuesday afternoon at Delta's LaGuardia and JFK hubs with a full restart targeted for Wednesday, subject to conditions."" An airline spokesman says Delta also plans to restart operations Tuesday morning at other Northeast airports, including the Boston and Washington-area airports, conditions permitting. Most carriers will allow affected passengers to change their itineraries without penalty. Check the major airlines' advisories here: American Airlines, Delta, United, US Airways, AirTran, JetBlue, Southwest. Middle Eastern, European and Asian airlines also grounded flights in and out of the United States' Eastern Seaboard as Sandy approached. The good news is that the storm is happening during a slow travel season and airlines canceled many of the flights in advance, minimizing the number of stranded passengers, according to Farecompare.com Chief Executive Rick Seaney. ""Barring significant airport damage, flight patterns should be back to normal by the end of the weekend,"" Seaney said. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- In Madrid and Barcelona, they will be talking about this for many years to come. Of all the ways to break Barca's monopoly on Spanish league titles, going to the home of the champions and robbing them of their crown in their own backyard takes some beating. In the Catalan heartland Saturday, unfashionable Atletico Madrid produced a storybook ending to one of the most enthralling seasons Spanish football -- or indeed any European league -- has ever produced. But as Atleti celebrated, the soul searching began in Barcelona. Winner takes all . For the first time since 1951 (and only the third time ever), the destiny of the title lay in the hands of two teams facing each other on the final day. Barca entertained an Atletico team which hadn't won the domestic league since 1996 -- during which time Barca had added eight more La Ligas to the club's roll of honor. The equation was simple: win, and Barca would be crowned champions for a fourth time in five seasons; draw or win, and Atletico would take the title for the first time in 18 years, when current manager Diego Simeone was captain. In the end, it was deservingly, fittingly, gloriously Simeone's triumph -- and one that now propels the Argentine coach into the stratosphere, such is the epic scale of the revolution he has presided over since taking charge of ""Los Rojiblancos"" in December 2011. Champions of Europe? A team that rarely won anything, that only found new ways of losing, was at once transformed; Europa League triumph in 2012 was quickly followed by the UEFA Super Cup and then the Spanish Cup in 2013. Simeone had molded and inspired a group of disparate talents into a squad with a win-at-all-costs, never-say-die mentality. With the league now in the bag too, Simeone and his team have the chance to add the ultimate prize to their ever-expanding trophy cabinet when they meet arch-rivals Real Madrid in Saturday's European Champions League final in Lisbon. ""I would say that this win means something for everyone,"" said Simeone, who saw his team gain the 1-1 draw they needed despite losing the services of 27-goal striker Diego Costa and midfield mischief-maker Arda Turan inside the first 20 minutes. ""It shows that there is more than one way to win. It is one of the most important days in the history of Atletico Madrid."" Yet how few Atleti were there to celebrate such a seismic feat. Officially, 447 of their fans were present at the 98,000-capacity Camp Nou, though a few others were easily seen dotted around the gigantic arena. They managed to make themselves heard, however, especially when Diego Godin leveled just after halftime and again at fulltime. The Atleti stayed right where they were for at least an hour after the final whistle to sing and dance and acclaim their heroes. Those men must have looked tiny, like Subbuteo figures, from their position right at the top of the third tier behind the goal where Godin created history, but it didn't seem to matter one bit. And to their credit, Barcelona ensured Atleti would have even more treasured memories of their special day as they stayed true to their ""Mes que un club"" (""More than a club"") motto. 'They showed Barca is a great club' The home fans responded to the apparent ignominy of having their title taken away from them on their own turf by rising as one the very moment the game was over, proceeding to give Atletico's players the standing ovation their herculean effort deserved. Two minutes later and ""Atleti, Atleti"" reverberated around the amphitheater as Simeone and his gladiators, almost disbelievingly, looked up and soaked in the adulation. ""Barca players and coaches came to congratulate me immediately after the game,"" added Simeone. ""They showed Barca is a great club."" So what of this great club? For one so used to winning and for fans usually so quick to wave their white handkerchiefs as a way of registering their disdain, they seemed awfully accepting of their fate. The mood in the city all day was upbeat, yet strangely free from the tension that usually engulfs occasions of such enormity; don't forget, this was a title that coach Gerardo Martino had already conceded two weeks ago, before a succession of bizarre results handed his side one last unlikely shot at glory. It never felt like their title to win, though. With the heartbreaking trauma of ex-coach Tito Vilanova's tragic passing in April still fresh in the mind, and with several players mooted to be leaving this summer, even before Saturday the focus had shifted to next season and the future. An emotional month reached a crescendo as first long-serving goalkeeper Victor Valdes -- who has been injured since March -- said his farewells on Monday and then on Thursday club captain Carles Puyol, a mainstay of Barcelona since the mid-1990s, gave his final press conference before walking away from the Camp Nou. It is not so much half a new team Barca are looking for over the next couple of months as almost a replacement soul. What next for Barca? Former captain Luis Enrique, who played for the Catalans with distinction between 1996 and 2004 and managed Barcelona B from 2008-11, was appointed Monday as the club's new coach after leaving his post at Celta Vigo. Enrique led Celta Vigo to ninth place in La Liga in his only season in charge, after a difficult first senior appointment at Italian club Roma in 2011-12. Now that Lionel Messi -- arguably the world's greatest footballer and certainly its best-paid exponent -- has signed a new contract, Barca must try to rediscover what made them one of the most breathtakingly successful teams the sport has ever seen. ""I feel so bad, I feel disappointment and disillusionment,"" said midfielder Andres Iniesta on social media. ""Next year we will fight to give you the joys that you and this club deserve."" As for Atletico, whose fans celebrated long into the night at Neptuno Square in the Spanish capital and then took to the streets of Madrid Sunday as their champions paraded through the city on an open-top bus, the focus is rather more short-term. At the Stadium of Light in Lisbon on Saturday, they will seek to put their name on the biggest trophy of them all for the very first time, and in the process deny city rivals Real ""La Decima"" -- the 10th European Cup/Champions League title that has so frustratingly eluded the club since 2002. Simeone, a man who has the underdog spirit coursing through his veins, will already be licking his lips in anticipation.","Atletico Madrid wins Spanish league after drawing at Barcelona .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Myanmar's military rulers marked the country's independence day by commuting sentences and apparently releasing more than 30 prisoners, but opposition activists said Wednesday that the moves were unsatisfactory. The United States also urged the nation to make greater efforts to improve its human rights record. A decree by President Thein Sein, published Tuesday in a state-run newspaper, grants amnesty to prisoners ""for the sake of state peace and stability, the rule of law, national consolidation"" and humanitarian grounds. It reduces death sentences to life imprisonment; cuts sentences longer than 30 years down to 30; limits terms of 20-30 years to 20 years; and reduces shorter prison terms by 25%. Myanmar, also known as Burma, marks its 1948 independence from Britain on Wednesday. The southeast Asian country has been ruled by a military junta since 1962, and the generals have come under criticism for their human rights record in recent years. Sein, a former military official and prime minister, became president last year after an election criticized by democracy activists as a sham. Among the prisoners are more than 1,500 dissidents convicted of criminal charges over the years, including Buddhist monks and some journalists, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a nonprofit organization based in Thailand that supports and advocates on behalf of political prisoners in Myanmar. ""We have received information from Myanmar there are about 33 prisoners released yesterday,"" Aung Myo Thein, a spokesman for AAPP, said Wednesday. But he added that none of those released appeared to be high-profile detainees. He said the actions by the government were not enough, noting that some political prisoners had merely had sentences of more than 100 years reduced to 60 years. The National League of Democracy, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, said it was unclear how many of its jailed members may have been freed following Tuesday's announcement. ""At this stage, we received reports that there are about two to three NLD members"" released, Tin Oo, vice chairman of NLD, said Wednesday. But he said that the measures did not constitute a ""real amnesty,"" since they just entailed the reduction of sentences, with most of those released not political prisoners. Myanmar released about 200 political prisoners along with more than 6,000 other inmates in October. But the AAPP called the move ""disingenuous"" and ""unsatisfactory,"" noting that many prominent dissidents remained behind bars. The United States has tried to encourage an opening with Myanmar in recent years. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a trip there in November, and the Obama administration has built a policy of what it calls ""parallel engagement"" with the junta as well as the opposition. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday that more prisoners needed to be released before Washington will take ""significantly more steps towards normalization."" ""From that perspective, it's not a step of the magnitude that we would be interested in matching,"" she said.","Democracy movement says unclear how many members have been freed .
Activist group says more than 30 prisoners appear to have been released .
No prominent dissidents are expected to be freed as a result of Tuesday's decree .

"(CNN) -- They watched by the tens, if not hundreds of thousands. In cozy sports bars and cavernous sports stadiums. In living rooms and in public spaces. In front of computer screens and in front of big screens in downtown plazas. To echo the national team's mantra: They believed the Americans could win. Their team did not, however, exiting the World Cup in the knockout round after losing 2-1 to Belgium. But if anything can salve the wound of the U.S. team's elimination in the World Cup, it's how many in the country opened their eyes to soccer, as if for the first time. ""Our heroic display makes young Michael Jordans choose soccer over bball in High School now!"" tweeted Terrence Boyd, a late cut from the U.S. National Team. ""@ussoccer will be a real force."" Time will tell if more American athletes turn to soccer -- or football as it's known most everywhere else in the world -- over basketball, football or baseball thanks to the 2014 team. Still, over the past few weeks, there's no denying that the Americans' performance has galvanized and, quite likely, created legions of fans. While ratings weren't immediately available for Tuesday's match with Belgium, the Americans' first-round match against Ghana set a viewership record for ESPN's coverage of World Cup matches. Their game last week versus Germany was the network's second-highest rated World Cup match. It's not just that people watched, it's how they watched. Social media buzzed every game, with people seemingly living and dying by every goal-scoring chance and save by stalwart U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard. And then there were the thousands who ventured down to Brazil in their red, white and blue -- in their clothing as well as their faces -- to cheer on their team. The U.S. players repeatedly said they had noticed the groundswell of support, both in Brazil and back in the United States. It helped propel the team -- and, they hoped, will help contribute to their sport's growing popularity stateside. ""Watching some of the scenes back home has been incredible,"" said Howard, who was named ""man of the match"" after his tremendous, although losing, performance. ""It fills us with pride and inspired us to push forward and feel like we could actually could do something, special because the feeling, the passion back home, was second to none."" The growth of soccer in the U.S. On the world stage -- in economics, politics or whatever else -- Americans are rarely underdogs. Yet that was the case in the world's biggest sporting event, especially after the team was put in what many called ""the group of death."" The United States was one of two teams to advance from that group, leading up to its game with Belgium. The Red Devils prevailed thanks to two goals in extra time -- after 90 minutes of scoreless regulation -- in what U.S. head coach Jurgen Klinsmann described as both ""a thriller"" and ""a bummer."" ""The whole country and the fans that came down to Brazil; they can be proud of their team,"" the German-born coach said on ESPN. ""We take a lot, a tremendous amount away from this experience. We grew up a lot."" The same could be said of the U.S. soccer program, generally. In many ways, this growth has been a long time coming. U.S. Youth Soccer notes that there are more than 3 million registered youth players, compared to just over 100,000 in the mid-1970s. That's out of about 24 million players total, ranking the country second only to China in terms of participation by a single nation, according to FIFA. Major League Soccer has also seen a relative boom of late, with passionate fan bases in places like Seattle and Portland, Oregon, and games often attended by upwards of 20,000 people. Still, some see soccer as a niche sport -- followed passionately, yes, but not by mainstream Americans. The World Cup, though, may have changed that. Fans -- both new ones and diehards -- energized . You could see the support at Chicago's Soldier Field, where thousands, some of whom admitted that they'd played hooky from work, gathered to watch the game. The lakefront stadium is better known as home to the other game of football -- the NFL and its Chicago Bears -- but on Tuesday, its gates were opened to the public. Thousands of fans sat in the stands or stood on the gridiron, which was covered with a protective matting. ""National Watch Soccer Day,"" one fan said. Similar scenes played out in AT&T Stadium, home to the Dallas Cowboys of American football lore. Freedom Plaza in Washington was also packed with American fans. So was the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the attendees included President Barack Obama, who even started a cheer of ""I believe that we will win!"" Rival sports leagues and stars, like the NFL, also offered their support. Major League Baseball tweeted out pictures of Phillies, Astros and Twins players watching the U.S.-Belgium game. The Red Sox's Johnny Gomes rocked a tank top and shorts that doubled as American flags while taking batting practice. Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant tweeted his congratulations on Twitter, saying, ""Well done #USMNT mde our country proud. #USsoccerOntheRISE #WorldBWarned."" Bryant has made his love for ""football"" known for some time. But what got many in the U.S. soccer world so excited this summer was all those who usually don't care about the sport following the game -- like one man who posted to CNN.com's match blog, ""I hate soccer and yet here I find myself hanging on every post about the game."" A patron at Nevada Smiths sports bar in New York, John Paul Ovadia, remarked how soccer was once a marginalized sport in the United States, but not any more. ""I think every four years there's more and more interest,"" Ovadia said. ""And the further the U.S. goes, the more people are paying attention.""

"(CNN) -- Relatives of Osama bin Laden want proof that the terrorist leader is dead and are calling for an investigation into how he was killed, according to Jean Sasson, an author who helped one of bin Laden's sons write a memoir. ""They just really want some answers, and they would just really like to know what exactly happened, why they weren't called,"" said Sasson, who worked with Omar bin Laden to pen a memoir titled ""Growing Up bin Laden."" The United States says U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden during a May 2 raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he was hiding out. On Wednesday, a key lawmaker on Capitol Hill said the death of bin Laden presents an opportunity to ""break the back"" of al Qaeda. The forces collected a trove of intelligence from the compound and later buried bin Laden's body at sea. While the Obama administration has decided not to release photos of the slain bin Laden, some U.S. lawmakers will be allowed to view them. Bin Laden's relatives ""would like to have been able to have witnessed seeing the body, at least identified the body, because, you know how it is in the Middle East so many times: They really need proof or people start believing -- this has been discussed by a lot more people than me -- that many people will not believe that he's dead,"" Sasson told CNN Wednesday. Her comments come a day after a statement from Omar bin Laden and his brothers was provided to The New York Times. Asked about the statement, Sasson said Omar bin Laden -- who has publicly denounced his father's violence -- contacted her and told her he has some things to say. She said she prepared a letter for him and he approved it. Another family member had gotten an attorney to write a letter about what relatives were thinking and feeling and Sasson said it was decided to go with the attorney's letter. The statement published in The New York Times is from bin Laden's sons -- ""the lawful children and heirs"" of the notorious al Qaeda leader. It says that despite the extensive coverage of his death, ""we are not convinced on the available evidence in the absence of (a) dead body, photographs, and video evidence that our natural father is dead."" ""We seek such conclusive evidence to believe the stories published in relation to 2 May 2011 operation Geronimo as declared by the President of United States Barack Hussein Obama in his speech that he authorized the said operation and killing of OBL and later confirmed his death,"" they said. The statement argued that if bin Laden has been ""summarily executed,"" ""international law"" might have been ""blatantly violated"" and that U.S. legal standards were ignored. The statement cites the trials for late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, and notes that Osama bin Laden didn't get a ""fair trial"" or ""presumption of innocence until proven guilty by a court of law."" ""If OBL has been killed in that operation as (the) president of United States has claimed then we are just in questioning as per media reports that why an unarmed man was not arrested and tried in a court of law so that truth is revealed to the people of the world."" ""We maintain that arbitrary killing is not a solution to political problems and crime's adjudication as justice must be seen to be done,"" the statement said. Three other men, including one of bin Laden's sons, and a woman were killed in the raid, and bin Laden's 29-year-old Yemeni wife, Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah, was wounded. All three of bin Laden's wives and a number of children, some of whom were bin Laden's, were taken into Pakistani custody after the raid. A U.S. official identified the other two women as Khairiah Sabar, also known as ""Umm Hamza,"" and Siham Sabar, or ""Umm Khalid."" ""It is also unworthy of the special forces to shoot unarmed female family members ... killing a female and that of one of his sons,"" the statement said. ""In making this statement, we want to remind the world that Omar (bin Laden), the fourth-born son of our father, always disagreed with our father regarding any violence and always sent messages to our father, that he must change his ways and that no civilians should be attacked under any circumstances. ""Despite the difficulty of publicly disagreeing with our father, he never hesitated to condemn any violent attacks made by anyone, and expressed sorrow for the victims of any and all attacks. As he condemned our father, we now condemn the president of the United States for ordering the execution of unarmed men and women,"" the statement said. It also urged Pakistan ""to release and hand over"" the wives and the children of bin Laden. The authors of the statement called for a U.N. investigation into the event and said they will pursue justice in bodies such as the International Criminal Court if questions aren't answered. A senior U.S. official Wednesday angrily rejected the charge that international law was violated. ""There is an inherent right of self-defense enshrined in the U.N. charter within Article 51. This is a man who is a terrorist, who declared war on the United States, killed Americans and continued to plan operations against the U.S. and its allies,"" the official said. On Capitol Hill, one lawmaker was talking about the opportunity the death of bin Laden presents. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said that although al Qaeda is still alive and well, ""they are hurt, they are damaged. Their inspirational and operational leader has been taken off the battlefield, which is a huge opportunity for us. ""The confusion with them is opportunity for us and this is the time to step on the gas and break their back."" Rogers raised the possibility that there are Pakistani officials who knew about bin Laden's hideway in the country. He spoke of a ""confusing"" relationship with Pakistan, one which was cooperative at times, taking thousands of casualties battling extremists and helping arrest hundreds of al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, bomb makers, financiers and weapons dealers. However, Rogers maintained there are renegade intelligence officers and others in the Pakistani government who are sympathetic toward the Taliban and al Qaeda. The raid in which bin Laden was killed dealt a blow to the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. The revelation that bin Laden had been living in Pakistan has fueled suspicions that Pakistani officials knew the whereabouts of the terrorist leader, while Pakistan has complained about the U.S. military incursion. But while the ties between the CIA and Pakistan's intelligence agency are strained, they are not shut down, another U.S. official said. This official, who did not want to be identified for safety concerns, said both sides need to continue working together. ""Both sides understand the importance of the relationship,"" the official said. ""Cooperation is continuing, discussions are continuing, but there are issues to work through."" Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, plans to go to Pakistan soon, a Senate source familiar with his plans said Wednesday. He has visited the country at other times and has the trust and respect of many senior Pakistani officials. Most recently, Kerry visited Pakistan to help defuse tensions over the detention of Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor who was jailed in Pakistan after he shot and killed two Pakistani men in what he said was a robbery attempt. He was released from jail after compensation was paid to the victims' families. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration is encouraging Kerry's trip. ""We think it's important as part of the overall efforts by the United States government to continue our collaborative relationship with Pakistan and the cooperation that we have seen in the past,"" Carney said. ""While we don't see eye to eye on the issues, that cooperation has led to some very important successes in our war against al Qaeda. We are working at the administration level to continue our consultations with Pakistani leaders, to continue that kind of cooperation, and are glad to see Senator Kerry make that trip as well."" In the aftermath of the U.S. raid on bin Laden's compound, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN Tuesday that the United States will be given access to bin Laden's wives and children ""so they can interrogate them, they can interview them."" A senior Pakistani intelligence source had said earlier that the United States could question bin Laden's wives only if their ""country of origin has been asked for permission."" Malik did not say when or where the United States would be able to question the wives. Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said Tuesday U.S. and Pakistani officials were discussing the matter. Carney said the administration is optimistic that U.S.-Pakistani cooperation ""will continue with regards to"" access to bin Laden's wives ""and also to the materials that were collected by the Pakistanis after the U.S. commandos left"" the compound where they killed bin Laden. He described the U.S.-Pakistani relationship as ""important and complicated.""

"(CNN) -- Configuring your Facebook settings from a laptop is confusing enough, but try monitoring your Facebook privacy and security setting on a mobile phone. It's even more of a mess. There's some help on the way, however. On Tuesday, the nonprofit group MobileActive published its list of tips for using mobile Facebook more safely. About one-third of Facebook's 750 million active users worldwide access the service via mobile phones. MobileActive's mobile Facebook guide is written with activists in mind (especially in light of the key role that Facebook played in many Arab Spring uprisings), but it's useful for any Facebook user. Some Facebook-related mobile security risks have to do with how you use Facebook in general. Others relate to how your phone and its various mobile communication channels handle security when you're using a Wi-Fi connection rather than your carrier's data network. For instance, many people set their phone to use a Wi-Fi connection whenever possible, in order to curb their data usage, which can get expensive. If you use Wi-Fi on your phone, depending on how your mobile browser or Facebook app handles security, someone might snoop on your login credentials (""sidejacking"") and use them to impersonate you on Facebook. They could even lock you out of your own account. Sidejacking is a Wi-Fi-related risk for many online services, not just Facebook. The main way you can protect yourself is to always use a secure connection (URLs that begin with ""https"" rather than ""http"") when logging in to an online account from any device, including your phone. You can configure your Facebook account to always use ""https."" However, MobileActive cautions: ""Be aware that this setting is not applied when browsing from a phone! You may also notice that some applications warn you that you cannot access them using HTTPS. If you use such applications, be aware that they may turn the 'always use HTTPS' setting off -- you will need to go back into your account settings and turn it back on every time."" So this means that using Facebook's mobile website could be more secure than using a Facebook app -- when you're on Wi-Fi. And the same would be true for Twitter, Tumblr and other services. It's a good idea to bookmark the mobile websites for the services you use -- the URL versions that start with ""https,"" of course -- on your phone's browser. Then use those sites (rather than service-specific apps) when accessing them over an open or shared Wi-Fi network. Also, check that your mobile browser really can make a secure Web connection. MobileActive notes that some older or more primitive browsers (probably including many browsers that come pre-installed on feature phones) may revert the connection to ""http,"" which is not secure. So once you've tried to access a site using ""https,"" after the page loads, double-check the location bar in your browser to make sure it still says ""https."" If you prefer to use Facebook apps, it's safer to turn off Wi-Fi access on your phone while you're using them. Your carrier's data connection is more secure. This is especially important if you use your Facebook account to log in to additional sites, via the Facebook Connect service; it would be bad enough just getting your Facebook account hacked, let alone everything else you've connected that account to. MobileActive also notes that Facebook provides extra options to help you control which devices can access your account. ""Log-in notifications warns you every time your account is accessed from a new device (both computers and phones). Log-in Approvals takes things a step further by requiring you to enter a code sent to your mobile phone every time you access the site from a new device. And in the U.S., Facebook users can send a text message to a predefined number to request a one-time password."" MobileActive's guide did not address third-party services (such as PicPlz) that can be used to post photos or video to Facebook, Foursquare and other services. But in general, if you use these tools, be aware of the various audiences and level of privacy each service affords. Before you upload a photo, make sure it's getting cross-posted only to the services you wish to use.","Managing Facebook security and privacy is difficult from a mobile phone .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United fans are used to dramatic finishes, but not against Stoke City at Old Trafford. Alex Ferguson's recently published autobiography maybe full of tales of derring-do against more illustrious opposition, but these are wildly different days at United at present. United were a goal down inside five minutes when Jonny Evans attempted clearance rebounded off Peter Crouch and past David De Gea. Robin van Persie calmed United nerves with an equalizer two minutes before the break but the relief was short-lived when Marko Arnautovic restored Stoke's lead moments later with a well-executed free kick. And that's how it stayed until the 78th minute before Wayne Rooney came to the rescue with a header to bring United level before Javier Hernandez scored the winner two minutes later. Read more: Russian racism furore is latest headache for FIFA . The 3-2 win eases the pressure on David Moyes and keeps United, who have 14 points from nine matches, in touching distance of the league leaders Arsenal. Arsene Wenger's side dispatched bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace 2-0 at Selhurst Park in the day's early kick-off. The Premier League newboys, who are currently without a manager after Ian Holloway's resignation in midweek, were on equal terms after a competitive first half but Mikel Arteta's 47th minute penalty gave the away side a deserved lead. The Spanish international was later red-carded for a professional foul on former Gunners forward Marouane Chamakh, but Arsenal made sure of the three points when Olivier Giroud headed in Aaron Ramsey's deftly chipped cross. The win keeps Arsene Wenger's side two points clear at the top of the table with 22 points from nine games. Liverpool move up to second after thrashing West Bromwich Albion 4-1 at Anfield. Luis Suarez got the Merseysiders off to a flier with goals in the 12th minute and 17th minute before completing his hat-trick 10 minutes after the break. James Morrison pulled one back for West Brom when he converted from the penalty spot in the 66th minute, but hopes of a comeback were extinguished 11 minutes later when Daniel Sturridge scored a delightful fourth, chipping the ball over goalkeeper Boaz Myhill. Everton's superb early season continued with 2-0 away win against Aston Villa. Romelu Lukaku scored his fifth goal of the season in the 68th minute before Leon Osman doubled the lead 13 minutes later. The Toffees' fifth win in six league games sees them leapfrog Chelsea to go fourth. Jose Mourniho's men can return to second in the table if they beat Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Southampton's good form also continued with a comfortable 2-0 win over Fulham at St Mary's Stadium. First-half goals from Rickie Lambert and Jay Rodriguez lift Southampton to third in the table. Mauricio Pochettino's side have the best defensive record in the league with only three goals conceded in nine matches. Norwich City and Cardiff City drew 0-0 in the other league fixture played Saturday.","Manchester United make heavy weather of win against Stoke City at Old Trafford .

"(BudgetTravel.com) -- We know you don't want to fly halfway around the world to eat a Big Mac. But how about steamed cod with mustard sauce and chives, mixed vegetables, and parsley baby potatoes? That, for instance, is what's considered fast food in Germany. When we think of fast food in the U.S., we imagine mega-chains with thousands of restaurants around the world -- too many, in fact, for the brands to have much quality control. But in some countries, such as Brazil and India, the concept is just catching on, and the quality of the food you'll find passing as ""fast"" is all the better for it. Dining at white-table restaurants abroad is certainly a treat of travel (if you can afford it), but if you really want a glimpse into local culture, there's no better way than sampling the fare residents grab on the go. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the meals are as tasty as they are cheap. Here, then, are our picks for the best foreign fast-food venues overseas. Budget Travel: See the restaurants. Brazil: Giraffas . Signature Dish: Hamburger topped with a fried egg; black beans, white rice, and French fries on the side (10 reals, or about $6.50) Many older and traditional Brazilians frown upon eating food with their hands, so when the Giraffas chain debuted in 1981 and became the first quick-service restaurant to hand out steel knives and forks, it caught on quickly. Giraffas now has 358 locations across Brazil. As at other fast-food joints, patrons at Giraffas pick up their orders from a counter, but food is usually presented on open plates, not in cardboard boxes, for guests eating in-house -- another acknowledgment of national preferences. China: Mr. Lee . Signature Dish: Beef noodle soup (13 yuan, or about $2) In American Chinese restaurants, the menus are usually dominated by heavy fried-rice and lo-mein dishes, but in China simple noodle soup is the standard lunchtime fare. Locals seem to especially love the options at Mr. Lee, where patrons can customize their soup with condiments like dried-chili oil, soy sauce, white vinegar, and pickled greens. The soup is ordered from a counter and served in ceramic bowls, typically slurped standing up at the counter. The ""East meets West"" chain was founded in 1987 by Li Beiqi, a Chinese-American entrepreneur who previously created a chain of Beef Noodle King restaurants in California. The late Mr. Li's face is now emblazoned on restaurant storefronts in a style similar to Colonel Sanders at KFC. By 2010, the homegrown chain had 400 locations in 19 provinces across China. Budget Travel: 10 coolest small towns in America . Germany: Nordsee . Signature Dish: The Nordsee Plate, with steamed codfish fillets in a mustard sauce with chives, mixed vegetables, and parsley baby potatoes (8 euros, or about $11.50) While Americans don't usually think of steamed fish as a fast-food staple, most of the menu at fish-buffet chain Nordsee is made up of precisely that. Codfish, plaice, pollock, salmon, and other fish are the stars of the show (patrons choose whether they want the items steamed, grilled, or fried). An emphasis is placed on fresh fish sourced from well-managed waters, catering to the German preference for healthy, sustainable food. The appeal, though, is more universal: The company, now with over 400 locations across Europe, is the Continent's largest chain specializing in seafood. India: Kaati Zone . Signature Dish: Kaati rolls; Chicken Tikka (75 rupees, or about $1.65) and mixed vegetables (45 rupees, or about $1) are the two most popular fillings . Street-food stalls are a longtime standard in India, and most fast-food chains have struggled to compete there as a result. One of the first to break out, in 2004, was Kaati Zone, which specializes in kaati rolls -- unleavened flat bread that's been lightly fried and coated with egg, then stuffed with meat or vegetarian fillings and served with a side of fries sprinkled with tangy masala spices. (Typically, one roll counts as a snack, two as a meal.) Each Kaati Zone kitchen, restaurant, and kiosk has completely separate cooking and serving processes for vegetarian and meat dishes to accommodate local traditions. That kind of attention to detail may be why Kaati Zone caught on: The chain now has 15 locations, mostly in the city of Bangalore . Russia: Teremok . Signature Dish: Blini filled with red caviar or salmon roe (240 rubles, or about $8.30) Founded in 1998, Teremok has spread to 111 restaurants and 80 street kiosks in Moscow and St. Petersburg. While soups, porridges, and salads all appear on the menu, it's really all about the blinis. These thin, triangular-shaped, wheat pancakes are wrapped around various fillings (sweet or savory) and are baked to order at the counter in front of your eyes. In the U.S., we're not used to thinking of this tasty dish as a fast-food item, but in Russia it's available all day and evening. Down it with some kvass, a low-alcohol drink made from rye flour with malt, or else some Hmel'noy Med (a half litre of honey beer). Budget Travel: 10 popular travel scams around the world . Saudi Arabia: Albaik . Signature Dish: The four-piece chicken meal (mild or spicy) with garlic sauce, French fries, and bread (12 riyal, or about $3.25) Albaik was founded in 1974 in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah and quickly became one of the most beloved fast-food chains in the Middle East. (You might have spotted the business-class travelers on Emirates and Qatar Airways toting containers of Albaik along with their duty-free shopping.) Its claim to fame is its breaded chicken, which is pressure fried to keep the meat juicy. The enterprise has 46 permanent locations, which might sound like small potatoes, but when you consider how sparsely populated the Kingdom is, that's a huge accomplishment. The chain is so popular that the company operates a pop-up restaurant once a year in Mina (Makkah), which caters to hundreds of thousands of prayerful Muslims a day while they attend Hajj, a five-day religious pilgrimage that usually takes place in the fall. One passing observation: Only men are allowed to work behind the counters, in deference to local custom. Singapore: Toast Box . Signature Dish: ""Crispy grilled"" kaya (coconut jam) toast with slices of butter, a soft-boiled egg, and a mug of kopi (coffee) (Singapore $2.50, or about $2 U.S.) Founded in Singapore in 2005, breakfast-and-lunch purveyor Toast Box now has more than 30 locations in the city-state and 12 elsewhere in South Asia and the Pacific, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, and the Philippines. But the dish it specializes in has been served locally by roadside kopitiams (or coffee stands) since the 1920s. Toast Box brandishes one major weapon in the toast-and-spread war against longstanding roadside rivals: It has its employees dress in blue-and-white striped caps and aprons -- a direct appeal to Singaporeans' delight in snappy uniforms. Yet Toast Box wisely retains the familiar touches of a traditional kopitiam, such as Formica tabletops and natural wood decor. Budget Travel: 12 restaurants with spectacular views . South Africa: Steers . Signature Dish: Rib burger and chips (32.95 rand, or about $4.50) When McDonald's came to South Africa in 1995, locals laughed at its Big Mac; those three ounces of meat looked pretty puny next to the offering from local chain Steers: the Big Steer burger, which packs seven ounces of beef. In red-blooded, meat-loving South Africa, offering burgers of that magnitude is a sure way to gain fans. Steers has since maintained dominance as the national brand of choice, with 483 locations in South Africa today. Reminiscent of the Denny's chain in the U.S., Steers provides quick service and comfort food in a sit-down setting, though its restaurants also have to-go and drive-through menus. Burgers are the main item on offer, but pork riblets are a close second, served on a bun, as a rack, or as cut pieces. Budget Travel: 7 most common gas-guzzling mistakes .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola signed off in style on Friday, securing yet another slice of silverware for the Spanish club before embarking on his self-enforced sabbatical. A 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final saw the all-conquering Catalan coach take his haul of trophies to 14 during his four-year tenure, and even if he decides never to return he will have left an indelible print on the sport. His final match underlined his approach to the game; the manner of the triumph important as the result. Barca were 3-0 up inside 25 minutes as Athletic were forced to chase shadows, like so many teams that have gone before them. Guardiola has built on Barca's pure football principles with a totalitarian approach to ""tiki taka,"" a style reliant on short passing and dynamic movement, and the results have helped an already successful unit transcend a higher plane. Guardiola signs off in style as Barca win Copa del Rey . Guardiola's vision has been enshrined by fellow disciples of Barcelona's famed La Masia youth academy, players like influential Spanish pair Andres Iniesta and Xavi, as well as prolific striker Lionel Messi. They have helped him deliver three successive Spanish League titles, two European Champions League crowns, two Spanish Cups, two FIFA Club World Cup titles and five further trophies with a soulful swagger that has had many a pundit purring that this is one of the greatest club sides of all time. Guardiola's masterstroke has been to morph the basics of Barcelona's philosophy into a new style of soccer that has confronted convention, according to Spanish football expert Sid Lowe. ""What Guardiola has done to some extent is challenge some of the truisms and clichÃ©s of football, such as defending is about sitting deep and denying space for teams,"" Lowe told CNN. ""Barcelona have done the opposite, they've gone and looked for teams, defended with possession which teams perhaps haven't done before. Guardiola -- the greatest soccer artist ever? ""The challenge, for example, on the use of the word practical or pragmatic, to talk about what is essentially a long ball game, but what could be more pragmatic than winning what Barcelona have won in the last four years?"" Albert Ferrer played with Guardiola during a golden era for Barcelona, when legendary Dutch coach Johan Cruyff led the club to three consecutive league titles and their first European Cup triumph in the early 1990s. Ferrer believes Guardiola's innovative, progressive approach to the game was born during that period under Cruyff, himself a staunch defender of Barcelona's cherished attacking philosophy. ""Pep tried to play simple football,"" said Ferrer of his friend, also Catalan born and bred. ""He created the philosophy where if you can play an easy pass why would you play a difficult one? ""Barcelona are one of the few teams who always had 70-75% possession in games because of the players they had and the philosophy of keeping the ball. He was very demanding of that -- not giving the ball away. ""All the teams now defend against Barcelona and he had to adapt to those solutions. He didn't always play the same system -- with three defenders or four, playing with a '9' (a traditional striker) or without a '9' -- always making things difficult for the opposition. ""All the movements he created, with the two full backs pushed forward and the center backs very wide, all started with him."" Michael Cox, from the Zonal Marking website, attributes the development of Guardiola's coaching philosophy to how the former Barca captain's own playing career panned out -- where there was a general loss of faith in the deep-lying midfield position Guardiola used to occupy in favor of more aggressive midfielders . ""He had to leave Barcelona as a player and take quite a big drop down to Brescia (in Italy) because, frankly, no good club wanted a player in that mold. Everyone wanted big battlers deep in midfield, like Patrick Vieira, Edgar Davids, Roy Keane, Claude Makelele. ""Now, he's managed to construct a team featuring four players who looked up to him when they were in the Barcelona youth team: Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Fabregas. ""I think almost every big club in Europe has copied Barcelona's way of playing, to a certain extent, in recent years. It's remarkable that that is now the way to play football, considering his struggles towards the end of his playing career as a deep-lying passer."" As ever in the often fickle world of football, Guardiola has his detractors, who attribute his success as a masterstroke of timing, claiming his tenure conveniently began just as a clutch of great players rolled off the famed Barcelona production line. And while there may be truth in that argument, Lowe believes it was the way Guardiola allied the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Busquets and Fabregas to his own football philosophy that was more pertinent. ""Guardiola has been the most zealous defender of a certain type of identity -- he hasn't been the creator of that identity,"" said Lowe. ""There's an almost puritanical conviction about how you've got to do things. That mindset has its flaws but Barcelona stick to it. ""He was absolutely the right man at the right time with the right squad, the right players around him. It has been a culmination of circumstance but without that identity it wouldn't have been as clear or as unshakable."" This unflinching devotion to Barcelona's cause and the all-consuming nature of the job has taken its toll on Guardiola. As well as his own meticulous nature combined with the weight of responsibility that comes with being Barca manager, another explosive element -- Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho -- only added to the pressures on the 41-year-old. ""People close to him have said they've been worried about him for a long time,"" said Lowe. ""That he doesn't eat as well, he looks skinnier, he's lost his hair. ""Guardiola has struggled to understand the depth of tension that has been created by this rivalry with Mourinho over the last year. I think he has found that genuinely unpleasant at times and hasn't known how to deal with it. ""I think those things have all come together to put us in a position where Guardiola thinks, 'I've had too much, it just isn't enjoyable any more.'"" In typical Barcelona style, at the press conference to confirm Guardiola's departure, the club announced his erstwhile assistant Tito Vilanova, another pupil of the club's famous school, would replace him. Ferrer, who describes his former teammate as a relaxed individual, thinks Guardiola is calling time on his Barcelona tenure at just the right moment. ""He is the manager who has changed everything,"" he said. ""He's been clever in choosing the moment to leave because in Barcelona he will always be welcome and he can have whatever position in the club he wants."" Guardiola's self-enforced break may only be in its embryonic stages but for those fearful he will be lost to football forever, his comments prior to his final match should provide reassurance that he will be back to reinvent the wheel again before too long. ""For the next months I have to charge my batteries and charge my mind,"" he said. ""I am going to rest and I will wait. I will be ready once a club wants me, if they seduce me I will train again.""","Pep Guardiola has enjoyed a trophy-laden spell as Barcelona coach .

"(CNN) -- As senior World Cup photographer for leading agency Getty, Shaun Botterill has snapped pictures of every tournament since 1994. He has found himself in some pretty privileged positions, capturing compelling images of football's greats -- and poignant, intimate shots away from the on-field action. Sure, you have to be lucky to capture certain key moments when they happen, says Botterill. But he is also a firm believer in creating your own luck: being prepared when the magic unfolds on the pitch. ""I think knowledge of the sport is particularly important, because certain players have different styles,"" the Briton tells CNN's Sports Photo Masterclass series. ""A midfielder is more creative; he's always going to be looking for that pass. And you've got players like Ronaldo who will run a play -- he'll challenge plays, he'll make pictures. So that's where you get those big action shots. ""Generally the good players that just want to win and score make better pictures."" It's been said that eyes are the windows to the soul. Botterill says he's learned that focusing on players' eyes helps photographers to anticipate their moves. While covering the trophy ceremony at the 2006 World Cup in Germany -- a tournament he describes as one of his favorite events to have worked at -- Botterill caught a glimmer in Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro's eyes as he stood with his team for the presentation. ""Once Cannavaro got the trophy, he didn't just grab it,"" Botterill recalls. ""You could see he had something in his mind to do. Things seemed to slow down and I thought I knew what was going to happen next."" Cannavaro lifted the trophy high above his head, as the air around him and his teammates exploded in party tinsel. Botterill, meanwhile, had crawled his way through the legs of other photographers and knew he was in position to get the shot. ""You think you're going to be really tense at those moments but that's when you're almost laughing,"" he says. ""He lifts the trophy and you're looking at other photographers and laughing because you know you don't have to look at the back of the camera to make sure you got the shot."" Born in the English town of Northampton in 1967, Botterill got his first break at the age of 16 at the agency founded by renowned sports photographer Bob Thomas, working in the dark room. ""I loved photography and playing football at school and realized early enough I'd never be good enough to play professionally, so I thought the best way to get to the World Cup final and be near/on the pitch would be to combine the two,"" he recalls. He attended his first World Cup in Mexico in 1986 and, after a brief career break ""hanging out on beaches and scaffolding,"" he resumed his photographer career at Allsport, which was later acquired by Getty. The job took him not only to his first World Cup, in the U.S. 20 years ago, but to both the Summer and Winter Olympics. ""It's not all glamor -- I had cockroaches in my bag last night!"" he told CNN, post-interview, via email from Brazil -- where he is crisscrossing South America's largest country to cover the game he loves most. At the 2010 World Cup, Botterill was given access to the tunnel outside the dressing room before the quarterfinal match between Argentina and Germany in Cape Town. There he captured closeup shots of former football star and Argentina coach Diego Maradona, running down the line, kissing each player and firing them up before the game. Because few photographers are given that kind of access, there's a certain amount of pressure to deliver. ""Every time you're in that kind of situation, you know some of this has never been photographed before -- so there's pressure in one way, but it's also quite exciting,"" Botterill says. ""Because you know if you stumble across a picture and something happens, people are going to want to use it because it's never been shot."" Although amateur photographers may not have the same equipment as the pros, they can override this deficit by utilizing the same approach. ""The key is to work with the equipment you've got,"" Botterill advises. ""Don't try to look at the photographers on the other side of the pitch and go, 'Oh they've got a big lens...' because you can't take those pictures. ""Shoot the correct picture for the lens you've got. Maybe you have a different angle because you're in the crowd. Maybe there are people celebrating in the foreground. ""And if something that's happened looks great from where you are, nowadays with the internet, if somebody picks up that picture and it's a good angle -- hey you could be published all around the world."" Basic photographic techniques will help elevate your work. Botterill says any photographer can better their chances by first finding the best background and the best light before starting to shoot. And it's important to sometimes just wander in pursuit of rare photographic moments -- not all the World Cup pictures are on the pitch. If you don't move around and explore, he says, you're not going to find anything different. In South Africa in 2010, Botterill traversed the area around Johannesburg's Soccer City Stadium and stumbled upon fans silhouetted dramatically in front, blowing their vuvuzela horns. It was a beautifully artistic and unique shot that showcased the passion and flavor surrounding the tournament. And in Brazil, the country's renowned fervor for football means fans are out in full regalia everywhere, showing pride and support for their team. ""Those pictures for me are as important as anything,"" Botterill says. ""Those are the pictures that you really want to get. ""The more experience you have -- and the nice thing about doing a lot of World Cups -- is that you kind of back up and back away from the more obvious things and you take the time to go looking for those rare moments.""

"(CNN) -- The Champions League is back -- but do you know who the rising stars of this year's competition are likely to be? CNN asked one of Europe's leading scouting experts, Tor-Kristian Karlsen, to give us his top five young players to watch out for in this season's competition. But did Tor get it right? You can tweet him here with your own picks. Alen Halilovic . ""Barcelona's attacking midfielder Halilovic, who made his full international debut Croatia at the age of 16,is currently playing for the Catalan club's B side but is expected to make his way into the first team this season. Hakan Çalhanoglu . ""Çalhanoglu is a 20-year-old attacking midfielder who plays for Bayer Leverkusen. A supremely talented German-born Turkish international, the free-kick specialist is already starring for his new club following his €14.5 million move in July."" Ruben Neves . ""Next up is Neves, he's just 17 and is a central midfield player for FC Porto. The teenage sensation became the club's youngest goal scorer when he got Porto's first goal in the opening round of the Portuguese championship. He's an intelligent midfielder with wonderful vision and passing ability. Kingsley Coman . ""Coman is an attacking midfielder who plays for Juventus and he's just 18. He was snapped up by the Italian champions after failing to agree a new deal with Paris Saint-Germain. Quick, agile with excellent technique, his mesmerizing runs from midfield are a headache for any defense. Lucas Ocampos . ""Monaco's Ocampos, a 20-year-old forward, is equipped with great physique, brilliant ability on the ball and a wide range of skills. He can play on either wing or as a floating forward and is expected to break into the Argentina national team any time soon."" Who will come out on top? So those are the five youngsters to watch out for -- but which team will end up lifting the trophy on June 6 in Berlin? We asked our CNN sports team which team they fancied to triumph this season and here's what they think. John Sinnott: ""Football is a simple game,"" former England international Gary Lineker once said. ""Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win."" Which is why Bayern will be crowned Champions League winners. ""Coach Pep Guardiola has had a year to instil his philosophy and Bayern have arguably the strongest squad -- and by strongest I mean the best balanced -- in the competition. The addition of Xabi Alonso's experience and guile could prove a masterstroke. Tom McGowan: ""Already boasting the attacking talents of Lionel Messi and Neymar, Barcelona added the lethal Luis Suarez to an already potent strike force. With three of the best goalscorers on the planet, supported by the likes of Andres Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic, Barca have enough firepower to shoot down any opposition."" James Masters: ""Diego Costa is the final piece in the Chelsea jigsaw and Jose Mourinho boasts a squad strong enough to go all the way this time around. The addition of Costa has breathed new life into Chelsea with the striker having scored seven times in his first four league appearances. The 2012 champion will see anything but a place in the last four as a failure and given its impressive start to the season, it would take a brave person to bet against Mourinho's men."" Alex Thomas: "" They're not the best team defensively but you could have said the same thing about last season's Real Madrid side -- and it was still good enough to claim ""La Decima,"" a 10th European Cup. With Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez added to the squad, it can become the first club to retain their Champions League title simply by outscoring the opposition.""

"(CNN) -- They are two of the biggest names in motorcycle racing, and tensions were high the last time they were on the same team, but Jorge Lorenzo says rival Valentino Rossi's return to Yamaha is ""good news."" Rossi left the Japanese team in 2010 after Lorenzo won his first world MotoGP championship, ending the Italian's two seasons of dominance. Rossi, who won the world title four times with Yamaha and three with Honda, has struggled to be competitive since joining Ducati, managing just two podium placings in 28 races. The 33-year-old has agreed a deal for the 2013 and 2014 seasons, resuming a partnership which Yamaha described as a ""super team"" when the news was announced last Friday. Lorenzo extends championship lead with Italian win . ""I think our relationship has got better, though maybe it's got better because we were in different teams,"" Lorenzo said on the MotoGP website ahead of this weekend's Indianapolis Grand Prix. ""It's good news for Yamaha because we achieved a lot of good results together. It's a big motivation to have him back because I always like to have the best riders in my garage. ""Valentino is one of them. I assume trying to beat me will be a big motivation for him. For Yamaha, it will be a good thing, that's the most important thing."" Rossi won 46 races in his seven years at Yamaha, but his final season was blighted by injuries and Lorenzo took full advantage. The Spaniard lost his crown to Casey Stoner last year but tops this season's standings by 23 points from Honda's Dani Pedrosa with five wins and four second-placings from 10 of the 18 races so far. Rossi is eighth overall, but still ahead of Lorenzo's 10th-placed American teammate Ben Spies, who will leave Yamaha at the end of this season. ""Someone who has talent normally keeps it and doesn't lose it like this in two years,"" Lorenzo said of Rossi. ""He is still young enough. He is 33, he has won a lot of races. With the Yamaha a better bike this year, it will be easier for him. ""It's true that us younger riders are getting stronger, more experienced and more consistent, but we have to remember that Valentino has won a lot of races. We have to respect that and keep it in mind."" The 25-year-old missed out on a podium place at Indianapolis last year when Spies passed him to take third, but won the U.S. race in 2009 and has twice been third himself. ""I really enjoy riding the Indy track, and have good memories here from my podiums in 2008 and 2010 and my great win in 2009,"" Lorenzo said. ""Last year I really struggled with grip in the race so I hope we can improve that this year. I've had a nice break but also been training to make sure I'm fit for this weekend!"" Honda's Stoner and Pedrosa have won the last two Indianapolis races, and both are seeking to cut Lorenzo's lead following MotoGP's midseason break. ""In these two weeks I was able to relax a little, enjoy time with friends and get back into my training,"" Pedrosa said. ""At this time of year, Indianapolis is normally very hot so fitness is always key. I enjoy riding at this track and I've had good results in the past. I am really looking forward to this race and will fight to win and maintain the consistency we have showed in the first part of the championship."" Stoner is 32 points adrift of Lorenzo in third place despite winning four races this season, which will be his last as he plans to retire after the final race in Valencia at the relatively young age of 27. ""I'm not the biggest fan of Indy, mainly because we don't go on the historical track but the infield and in the wrong direction,"" said Australia's two-time world champion. ""The track is very flat and plain, also very tight. There are a couple of corners that can be fun but the majority are difficult, tight and there isn't any natural flow to the track.""","Valentino Rossi will return to Yamaha on two-year deal from start of 2013 season .

"(CNN) -- His first act as a teenage professional goalkeeper was to pick the ball out of the back of the net. But it would not take long before the football world was in the palm of Bodo Illgner's hands. ""I was a baby in the goal,"" Illgner tells CNN's Human to Hero series of his heroics for West Germany at the 1990 World Cup in Italy. ""The goalkeeper usually joins the national team at the mid-twenties, the late twenties, even over the 30s maybe. ""I was very, very lucky to have the confidence of Franz Beckenbauer our coach in 1990."" Illgner, aged just 23, became the youngest goalkeeper to win the World Cup. He more than justified Beckenbauer's belief in him as he famously denied England in a semifinal penalty shootout and then became the first goalie to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup final as the Germans beat defending champion Argentina 1-0. Captain of that victorious team was Lothar Matthaus -- the player who had fired a penalty past Illgner earlier when the 18-year-old came on as a substitute for Cologne in a Bundesliga clash with titleholder Bayern Munich. The man he replaced that day in February 1986, Toni Schumacher, was twice a losing World Cup finalist for West Germany -- but Illgner would not suffer such a fate. A Roman triumph . After waltzing through the group stages of Italia '90, West Germany would see off the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia and England before marching on to the final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome for a rematch of the 1986 final. ""It was tremendous, a tremendous World Cup,"" Illgner recalls. ""Italy is close to Germany, so you can imagine that thousands of German fans were .all along the streets when we were going to the games. ""Everything worked out perfectly, the atmosphere in the team was great, motivation was great, the coach did well. We had our freedom and we played very well and won it."" Legends were made that famous night in the Italian capital, but IIlgner had already etched his name into national folklore. A crucial penalty save from England's Stuart Pearce in the semis helped the Germans to advance to a third successive final in the most tense circumstances. He then recorded the first final shutout since the tournament began in 1930 as a late Andreas Brehme penalty gave West Germany a third title overall. ""I was just happy that we won this game,"" IIlgner says modestly when reminded of his exploits. ""I couldn't care less if it was 4, 3, 2, 1, nothing. I was just happy to hold this big and heavy trophy in my hand in the match against Argentina."" In fact, IIlgner recalls the final as one of his easiest games in the tournament. That's despite Argentina's side containing Diego Maradona, arguably one of the finest players to ever play the game and a key figure in the 1986 tournament. ""I couldn't see Maradona in that game, he did not even try a shot on my goal so I had a pretty easy job in that final,"" IIlgner says. ""I think I only touched it once or twice. We did a great defensive job of course but Diego Maradona was the danger for us. ""Lucky for us we had Guido Buchwald, who played one to one against him."" Germany had witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall less than a year before the 1990 final and the reunited country still had a feelgood factor from those momentous events. When the players returned they were swamped by well-wishers as they paraded through the streets of Frankfurt. ""The homecoming after the World Cup was almost as mad as going to each of the games,"" IIlgner recalls. ""I don't know how many million people were around the streets but it was exceptional."" IIlgner had watched on television the last time West Germany won the World Cup back in 1974 but he never thought he would be able to replicate the feats of legends like Beckenbauer, Gerd Muller and Bertie Vogts. Four years later, however, the World Cup of USA '94 would bring IIlgner and his countrymen back down to earth. A unified Germany team, featuring many of the 1990 side as well as those who would have previously qualified for East Germany, suffered a surprise 2-1 quarterfinal defeat at the hands of Bulgaria. ""The 1990 World Cup was a tremendous success and it was a very nice experience (but) '94 was not nice, not the same good experience within the team, with the coach,"" Illgner says. ""So I was very frustrated about how things were going during this World Cup. ""Everybody was more motivated to play against us. Our team spirit was not the same as four years previous and we had a different coach by then. Players got older, they were at the end of their career."" The defeat marked IIlgner's 54th and last appearance for Germany as he retired from international football after the tournament aged just 27. ""I planned it to step down at the World Cup (as a) winner again but it did not work out like that,"" he says. ""Maybe the biggest regret I have was to resign right after we lost in '94 against Bulgaria. Now I think I should have waited a little bit longer and think it over. I could have played another World Cup or even more international games."" Germany would bounce back to win the European Championships in England two years later but IIlgner's focus was elsewhere by then. Named European goalkeeper of the year in 1991 and Germany's top stopper from 1989-93, he had become hot property. As his compatriots walked the famous Wembley steps to lift the Henri Delaunay trophy, IIlgner was in Spain finalizing a move from Cologne to Real Madrid -- a club more known for spending big on the world's best attacking players. ""It was a tremendous success for me that one of the biggest clubs, Real Madrid, asked for my services -- and I was more than happy to sign for them,"" he says. ""They came out of a very poor season, signed a lot of new players, brought in a new coach Fabio Capello, who wanted me as his goalkeeper and we had a fantastic season. ""I had to fight hard with two Spanish goalkeepers to get in there, but in the end it was worth it."" At Cologne, IIlgner had come close to winning titles but his side never finished higher than second in the league. His debut season ended with Cologne just avoiding relegation. In Madrid, winning was the only option. Second was equivalent to being the first loser. With IIlgner in their ranks, Los Blancos would win La Liga twice, as well as two European Champions League crowns (although the keeper was an unused substitute for the second of these wins in 2001). ""I enjoyed my time at Real Madrid with Fernando Hierro, Roberto Carlos, Clarence Seedorf, Davo Suker, Mijatovic, Raul. It was fantastic,"" he says. ""I enjoyed to be with these players with this quality and nice, nice lads ... I enjoyed it very much."" Behind the mike . Today, IIlgner is still involved in football although he has turned his hand to commentary at North American broadcaster beIN Sports. Forthright in his opinions and insightful with his analysis, the transition from the pitch to the television screen has been a seamless one. IIlgner regularly covers the Spanish, Italian and German leagues for his employer and he feels more qualified than most to offer predictions on who to watch out for in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil starting next month. ""In Brazil, they expect to win this World Cup and that can weigh on your shoulders of course. We have to see how they deal with it, but i think they are the big favorites,"" he says. ""There's another three or four favorites. Germany of course, Spain of course as a World Cup winner (in 2010) and the dark horse might be Belgium or Chile. ""Argentina, not to forget with Messi, they have a very good strikers upfront and are very dangerous as well."" Unsurprisingly, Illgner will be rooting for his compatriots. ""We've seen a very solid and very good German team since Germany played at home at the World Cup in the 2006,"" he says. ""Fantastic football, different to the football that we are used to in Germany. ""We played with a lot of heart, there was a lot of power, but from 2006 on we played with a lot of technique, with a lot of spirit as well. ""This generation needs a title and I think it's the last chance. Some players are getting old now. Philipp Lahm is one of the best players on the right-back side, he's 30. ""Thomas Muller is one of the most talented players and he's still young, he can do more World Cups, but Bastian Schweinsteiger for example, in midfield, 30 almost as well. ""This team is getting old -- if they want to get a title it needs to be this season."" If Joachim Low's German team of 2014 are looking for advice, they could do worse than taking a tip or two from this World Cup winner behind the mike.","Bodo Illgner is a German World Cup winner and former Real Madrid star .

"(CNN) -- ""When I'm riding, it is like flying. My feet do not touch the ground -- and the world and all the stresses that can come with being blind just disappear."" Verity Smith has known her share of hurt, heartache and adversity, but it has not stopped her pursuing her dreams. A singer/songwriter, she has starred in her own stage musical, written a book and campaigned for guide dog awareness -- but she's most at home on a horse. ""It's like floating. It's magical,"" the 40-year-old tells CNN's Human to Hero series. Smith gradually lost her vision from the age of eight due to a rare genetic disorder, becoming registered as officially blind by 16. ""It's kind of like a big snowstorm in my eyes,"" she explains. ""I see light and dark in my left eye and within that sometimes I see shadowy movement, but apart from that, not a lot."" While she is a published author and has her own record deal, there is one aim she has not fulfilled -- her goal of competing as a dressage rider at the highest level. ""My dream was the London 2012 Olympics -- to compete at home, in my own country, for my country. It would've been my absolute dream but unfortunately we didn't go."" Rewind to 2011. Life was going smoothly -- she was riding well, singing beautifully and heading for a place in Britain's Paralympics team. But then Smith's dreams began to unravel at an alarming rate. In June that year, her competition horse Marcus died of cancer before his replacement was diagnosed with ""kissing spine,"" which meant it was unable to take part in elite competition. Worse was to come when her first guide dog was put to sleep. Smith's nightmare 12 months continued when a car she was traveling in -- on the way to pick up her new dog from the vet -- was hit by a truck whose driver fell asleep at the wheel. Smith suffered impact injuries to her chest and her spine was put out of place. She escaped without any broken bones but the accident ended her hopes of taking part at London 2012. ""I decided after that year of just horror, it was just an unlucky year,"" Smith says philosophically. ""Lots of people have them but it seemed like everything came at the same time. ""I was very, very disappointed, very, very sad. It was the one time in my lifetime, the Olympics was going to be in London and it looked like being such a beautiful, beautiful event."" With her dreams crushed, Smith may have been forgiven for wanting a period of moping and introspection. Instead, she did what she does best -- she got back on the horse. Aided by a new guide dog, Uffa, a Labradoodle who she describes as the ""number one man in her life,"" she began to regain her confidence. Slowly but surely after a year out of the saddle, she began to get her balance back, taking short rides every day. Once the confidence had returned, it was time to find a partner -- a new horse. Smith, who is now in France training with experienced coach Max Vendrell, describes the process as ""like speed dating but without the bell."" ""It was quite an experience,"" she says. ""It's like meeting your future husband. ""I was sitting on new horses in new environments, it's quite difficult."" It was through a recommendation by a former trainer that Smith traveled to Sweden to meet the horse she would eventually fall in love with. ""This horse is really, really special,"" was the thought racing through her mind as she sat on Szekit for the first time. ""He's an absolute gentleman. If he were a man, I would marry him."" While both took their time to get used to each other, with Szekit (or ""Kit"" as she calls him) slowly realizing his rider could not see, their progress has been immeasurable. ""He's a really good guy and even the short time we've been together, I've really begun to trust him,"" Smith says. ""I think he's getting the sense that there is something wrong with that person -- she can't see, she does bump into me sometimes -- but he's very accepting of that. ""I really believe that horses understand I cannot see. They are very sensitive creatures. They're just magic."" The two are now working together in a bid to qualify for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio. Such an achievement would be astonishing given her accident -- but her determination to succeed in dressage is obvious to all who have met her. Having started riding at the age of three, Smith competed in show jumping until her mid-teens. ""When my eyesight got to the point that show jumping and eventing were becoming a dangerous sport, I decided to look for a really good dressage trainer that could take me on and start me from scratch,"" she recalls. ""I've never actually seen dressage being performed. When I could see, I was obviously very interested in all the things that involved speed and obstacles."" Dressage, which Smith describes as ""ballet with horses,"" was originally used to train the animals during the Renaissance period. The ""piaffe"" is a signature move where the horse jogs on the spot, while there are also the ""flying changes"" -- where it skips on alternate legs. ""It is all about harnessing the horse's energy and channeling it in different ways, and the control comes from your seat,"" Smith explains. ""The horse has to be incredibly supple and incredibly strong. It's all gentle movements -- you're never going to get half a tonne of horse to do something by being strong. You have to ask them nicely."" At the Olympics and Paralympics, there are two controlled rounds, where competitors are marked out of 10 and awarded a percentage score, before showcasing their freestyle routine. Smith's favorite music is swing, with the big band sound of Glenn Miller enough to get her ""In the Mood."" But while the swing will hopefully turn to samba in time for Rio, Smith says she still faces a real challenge to qualify for the British team. ""We are working as hard as we can,"" she says. ""There's a lot of good people out there wanting to be in the British team so our goal is to work as hard as I can and train as hard as I can. ""Although we didn't do London, hopefully with a bit of luck, we'll earn our place on the team and we'll fly to Rio.""","Verity Smith is a blind dressage rider .

"San Diego (CNN) -- What do zombies and androids have in common? They're almost human, but not quite. That disconnect is creepy, in a way that scientists are searching to understand. The uncanny valley is the idea that as a robot's appearance becomes more and more humanlike, we don't always respond to it more positively. Rather, there's a point on the scale between robot and human where we are repulsed. If it's mechanical but not entirely human, a robot seems disturbing. Why would that be? It would make sense that as human likeness increases in a robot, so would our comfort with it. But on a graph showing that relationship, there's a ""valley"" where this familiarity dips down into creepiness, and then comes back up again with more human characteristics. You may have experienced feeling this while watching animated movies that incorporate humanlike forms. It's also the reason that you might get freaked out by clowns or by photos of people with extreme plastic surgeries who don't look quite real anymore. Our brains come to an impasse when we see something that resembles a member of our species but just doesn't make the cut. Meet the huggable, semi-robotic and semi-creepy pillow phone . Some animators sidestep the issue: in the movie ""WALL-E,"" for example, the main character has eyes but is not very humanlike otherwise; he is clearly a robot. His friend, EVE, looks like a white shape with eyes. Both express emotions clearly but don't try to mimic the human shape or form. And HAL 9000 from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is just a red camera eye, but it too conveys feelings. But when you get more humanlike, things get weird. Some reviewers were put off by the characters in the film ""Polar Express,"" for instance. Then there are the Na'vi in ""Avatar,"" who have many physical human characteristics in addition to morphed features and tails. But they are also blue, creating a sense of ""otherness"" that may have made them less distasteful to viewers -- in other words, they were sufficiently un-human. Ayse Saygin, professor at the University of California, San Diego, is using cutting-edge brain science to understand this strange quirk of human nature. Although the idea of the uncanny valley has been observed, there has not been much rigorous scientific experimental work on it, partly because it's hard to get at the heart of the matter objectively. ""Even if we don't actually define it in words, we may be able to find signals for it in the brain,"" Saygin said. Saygin and colleagues published a study last year using functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI), looking at what's happening in the brain that might explain the uncanny valley phenomenon. They hypothesized that, at least in part, the effect might result from a violation of the brain's predictions. When we anticipate one thing but see another, we get an error, and that error makes us shy away from the thing we're viewing. The researchers showed 20 participants some video clips of three ""actors"" moving in the same ways: a human, an android modeled after the human, and a stripped-down robot (the same android without its humanlike form). Although this is a small sample of people, it is typical for neuroimaging studies, which are expensive and time-intensive. Something interesting emerged in the results: ""The network that normally processes your body movements is more active when you view an android,"" compared with when you look at a stripped-down robot or a human, Saygin explains. This could be because the brain has to combine conflicting information, she said. ""Your brain's gonna be like, 'Hey, wait a minute, you told me this was a human, and now this area told me that this is not moving like a human. So, I have to really compute that,' "" she said. ""That's what we think the uncanny valley might be partially caused by, and we have seen some brain activity that looks like that."" The uncanny valley phenomenon was put forth in an article in ""Energy"" in 1970 by Japanese robotics expert Masahiro Mori. But before that, Ernst Jentsch wrote about ""the uncanny"" in a 1906 essay, and Sigmund Freud followed up 13 years later. Yet the idea is largely based on anecdotes, and researchers such as Karl MacDorman, associate professor of human-computer interaction at Indiana University, are working on experiments to hone in on possible explanations. MacDorman briefly worked with Saygin in Japan. Roboticist sees improvisation through machine's eyes . In his view, the uncanny valley effect has to do with a mismatch in features of a single animation or robot, with some parts appearing much more humanlike than others. For instance, when a very human-looking head is placed on an obviously mechanical body, that can be creepy. So can a human face with robotic eyes. ""When there are elements that are both human or nonhuman, this mismatch can produce an eerie sensation in the brain,"" MacDorman said. ""It's when different parts of the brain are coming to different conclusions at the same time."" There are other factors that may play in, however. The uncanny valley effect could have to do with uncertainty about whether a robotic character is truly alive or dead, and even play into our deep-seated fears of death. Alternatively, it may be part of cognitive dissonance, which happens when a person's beliefs are not in line with their behaviors -- for instance, a smoker who berates other smokers. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have developed an aversion to sickness, and a creepy-looking almost-human might tap into our internal system that warns us against sources of disease. In relation, we evolved to choose mates who are healthy, and weird robots may set off the same warning bells that told our ancestors to stay away from unfit sexual partners. MacDorman's current focus is on the uncanny valley with respect to empathy: that is, is the uncanny valley phenomenon related to a person's difficulty in identifying with particular computer-animated or robotic characters in films? Does it relate to the impression that these characters are somehow ""soulless,"" and in what ways? Saygin's ongoing studies make use of electroencephalography, or EEG, which measures electrical activity along the scalp. While fMRI tells where in the brain activity occurs, EEG is better for looking at when -- that is, when in viewing agents with different degrees of humanness do people's brain patterns change. EEG is also much more portable and less expensive. Rather than a big scanner, it involves a cap worn on a person's head. Researchers may be able to understand the EEG patterns associated with the uncanny valley effect, and people's comfort with various robotic forms. Eventually, this information could be used to help robot developers or animators who don't want their creations to scare people. Charming, compelling social robots and their creators . ""Instead of asking somebody, 'Do you like this robot?' we could get that information a lot more directly, and faster perhaps, if we can develop these technologies,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The man who made Formula One's bravest comeback has given his seal of approval to Kimi Raikkonen's dramatic decision to return to Ferrari. Niki Lauda -- whose return from life threatening injuries has been immortalized this year in the Hollywood film ""Rush"" -- won his second world title for Ferrari in 1977, just one year after the fiery crash that almost took his life. When asked by CNN's The Circuit what he made of Raikkonen's renaissance for Ferrari, Lauda, a man who does not mince his words, said: ""Very good. ""It's the right decision by [Ferrari president Luca di] Montezemolo because Ferrari has been behind Red Bull on the last four world championships, which doesn't make him happy,"" added Lauda. The Austrian three time world champion also predicted the arrival of the ambitious Finnish driver will give a ""kick"" to current Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso -- a suggestion the Spaniard denied ahead of this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix. Interactive: The Circuit's guide to Singapore . The Italian team will field the sport's most potent driver line up in 2014, pairing Raikkonen with Alonso, the man they replaced the Finn with for the 2010 season. Raikkonen raced to Ferrari's last drivers' world title in 2007 while the Spaniard has two world titles, won with Renault in 2005 and 2006, on his resume. Pairing two ambitious world champions on opposite sides of the garage is a risky move. It is also a departure from Ferrari's policy of running a No.1 driver -- a role Alonso held for the last four seasons -- with a driver playing a supporting role. Raikkonen has replaced Felipe Massa, who famously handed victory to Alonso at the 2010 German Grand Prix when the team implicitly employed team orders by telling the Brazilian over the pit-to-car radio: ""Fernando is faster than you."" Lauda predicts Raikkonen's arrival will be a wake up call to Alonso -- and one that should make the 32 year-old raise his game. ""With Massa and Alonso it was very clear that Alonso was the No.1,"" Lauda commented. ""With Kimi coming there, it will kick Alonso to go quicker. ""They are strong characters. It will need strong leadership from the top of Ferrari to keep them under control but for the team itself to suddenly get going, this was the right decision."" Lauda speaks with some authority. ""Rush"" adramatizes his arch rivalry with flamboyant British driver James Hunt and the Austrian is now drawing on his own experiences of managing on track rivalries as a non executive chairman of the Mercedes F1 team. The 64 year-old was instrumental in persuading 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton to partner Nico Rosberg at Mercedes from McLaren for the 2013 season. Hamilton's move was also considered to be a risk but it has paid off as he won the Hungarian Grand Prix, while McLaren is yet to score a podium, and Rosberg has also claimed two race wins. Lauda says pairing two talented drivers within the same team has helped Rosberg and Hamilton push harder. ""I got Hamilton last year, I convinced him to join the team and he made a hell of a difference,"" Lauda explained. ""Suddenly you have two drivers pushing each other and [who] have a good relationship, this is the most important thing."" Alonso does not necessarily agree with Lauda's assessment. The Spaniard told reporters in Singapore ahead of this weekend's grand prix that Raikkonen's arrival in 2014 will do little to change his work ethic for Ferrari. ""The motivation will be always similar,"" he said. ""I will do my best all the time. I don't think anyone will push me more than I push now. ""Two world champions - I don't think that makes any difference."" Money problems for Raikkonen . Raikkonen spoke to the media for the first time since being unveiled as a Ferrari driver and also rejected suggestions that he and Alonso would not be able to work together in 2014. ""I don't see the reason why it wouldn't work,"" said the 33 year-old. ""We are all old enough to know what we are doing. ""If there is something, I'm sure we can talk it through. It's not like we are 20 year-old guys any more. ""I might be wrong -- time will tell -- but I'm pretty sure everything will be good. For sure there will be hard fights on the race circuits, sometimes things go wrong... I'm pretty sure it will all be OK."" The Finnish driver, not known for his effusive answers when talking to the media, also revealed he decided to leave the Lotus at the end of 2013 because he is owed money by the team. ""The reasons why I left from the team is purely on the money side, that they haven't got my salary,"" Raikkonen explained. ""It's an unfortunate thing but like I said, I want to try and help the team as much as I can and I like to race.""","Niki Lauda says Ferrari has made a ""very good"" decision by signing Kimi Raikkonen for 2014 .

"(CNN) -- The streets of Berlin have turned black, red and gold as up to a million flag-waving fans gather in the German capital to welcome home the nation's World Cup-winning footballers. Germany's national side flew in from Rio de Janeiro -- where they beat Argentina 1-0 in extra time on Sunday to secure their fourth championship -- on Tuesday morning to a heroes' welcome. Mario GÃ¶tze (@MarioGoetze), who scored the winning goal at the Maracana, tweeted a photo of the team on the bus from the plane to the airport terminal, announcing that they had arrived home. Boarding an open-top Mercedes truck and trailer emblazoned with the years of their four World Cup victories -- 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014 -- the team threaded its way through the city along roads lined with tens of thousands of cheering fans. The players, dressed in black t-shirts, each bearing a large number 1, and proudly displaying their winners' medals, waved to those below, who held aloft cardboard signs proclaiming ""We are all world champions!"" Stars including a grinning Mesut Ã–zil (@MesutOzil1088) tweeted photos of themselves taken from the trailer and marveled at the huge number of supporters who had turned out to greet them: ""What a crowd!"" the Arsenal midfielder posted. ""Unbelievable!"" One enthusiastic fan displayed a banner announcing to the team's goalkeeper: ""Neuer, I want to have your baby."" Others rode their bikes alongside the vehicle, wearing German flags as capes and snapping photos on their phones as they cycled towards the city center. At the Brandenburg Gate there was a festive atmosphere, as the sea of supporters -- many of whom had taken the day off to be there -- waited patiently for hours for a glimpse of the team. ""We're so incredibly proud,"" one woman told CNN. ""It's a great day for Germany. I'm a waitress but I wouldn't have missed today - everyone is off work!"" For others, a trip to the ""Fanmeile"" fans' zone was ""The best lunchbreak of all time."" Some had traveled long distances to join in the celebrations. ""We've come from Frankfurt this morning,"" another fan explained. ""We arrived at 4.30 a.m. -- we just had to come. I'm proud to be German, I'm looking forward to seeing my favorite player Schweinsteiger on stage."" Those who couldn't be there in person took part on Twitter, with Alex (@pixxelrunner) tweeting from Hamburg that he had ""goosebumps"" watching the ""craziness"" unfold in Berlin. The crowds erupted in huge cheers as the team finally took to the stage -- several hours later than expected, because of their slow progress on the 11km route through the jammed city streets. Dancing, clowning around, playing air guitar and singing ""We are number one!"" the players thanked the crowd for their support. Captain Philipp Lahm showed off the trophy, passing it to his fellow players, including midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, draped in a German flag and beaming, despite the large plaster covering the cut to his face sustained in Sunday's final. Tweeting a photograph of several members of the team in front of thousands of fans, Ã–zil thanked the huge numbers who had joined the street party -- which looked set to go on throughout the day and well into the night.

"(CNN) -- ""Pain is weakness leaving the body."" It's written large in ink on his upper torso, and, at the age of just 23, Tai Woffinden knows all about pain -- and the strength needed to overcome it. As a speedway rider he has broken virtually every bone on the way to becoming world champion in what is surely one of the most visceral types of racing -- hurtling around a gravel track on a motorbike with no gears and no brakes. And on his skin you can see how just he has embraced the hurt that life brings. ""They say your body's a temple, so why not decorate the walls,"" says Woffinden, who looks like any alternative skater kid with his backwards cap, skinny black jeans and gaping gauge earrings. ""I just enjoy pain, I guess. I like the art,"" he tells CNN's Human to Hero series. His arms, hands, face, neck and shoulders are all adorned with tattoos, including the aforementioned quote about the departure of pain -- popularly attributed to a U.S. Marine Corps general -- emblazoned below his battered collarbone. His fingers bear the acronym ""DILLIGAF"" -- the calling card for rebellious teens across the Western world. But most revealing is the design on his back -- a portrait of his father and racing mentor, and one of the letters he wrote to his son before passing away in 2010. ""I have tried to take you everywhere with me. We have had some wicked times together,"" it reads, above the epitaph ""In God's Hands."" Rob Woffinden, himself a former speedway rider, did not live to see his 50th birthday. Nor did he see Tai fulfill his great promise last year, when he became the youngest world champion in the modern Grand Prix era. But his legacy lives on, and he will not be forgotten. Following his retirement as a racer, he took the Woffinden family from the industrial English town of Scunthorpe to Australia. ""It was purely just to give me a better upbringing,"" says Tai, in his distinctly Australian accent. ""I think it was a great decision that they made. But, you know, it's good to be back here and doing what I love."" It was in Perth where he took up speedway riding at the age of 12, having first got into motocross -- thrilling off-road racing that still has him hooked today. ""He didn't know if he wanted me to get into it, but we went ahead with it and I kept progressing and progressing, and when I was 15 and a half we made the decision to come back to Europe and show everybody how I ride,"" Tai says. ""We kind of left our whole life in Australia, we just stopped everything -- I mean, my dad was selling cars on a car yard."" Quickly making his mark as a teen prodigy, Woffinden rose up the ranks, breaking records on the way. ""My progression over the last eight years has been pretty crazy, really,"" he says, at the home stadium of his British team Wolverhampton. Thick English fog rolls in over the concrete terraces, still strewn with remnants of a preseason exhibition for fans the previous night. The bleak surroundings are a far cry from the blue skies Down Under -- bike engines roar from the pits as the mechanics get ready for training, while groundstaff smooth out the stoney circuit. ""There's only one year when I plateaued off,"" Woffinden continues, ""but apart from that, it was just upwards, upwards, upwards. I just kept going and going, every challenge that came in front of me, I conquered it."" That ""plateau"" came when his father succumbed to an inoperable tumor. ""I had a really tough season, so a lot of people doubted me,"" he says. ""My father passed away that year and I had a lot of problems in the team."" But his fortunes changed last year, when he was again given a wildcard entry into the Grand Prix series. ""The people that ran the series wanted a British rider in and there wasn't really any British riders qualifying -- it gave me the opportunity,"" he explains. ""At the start of the year I was 500-to-1 at the bookies. We were just aiming for a top-eight finish to secure me a spot for next year, because I didn't really want to be one of those riders that gets a wildcard every year."" Woffinden set his sights higher after an impressive start before breaking his collarbone in his home British GP. He returned to action just two weeks later, but broke it again in the penultimate round with the title in sight. ""There's times where you've got to dig deep and that was definitely one of the days where I did -- I was crying in between races,"" he recalls of the series, which involved 11 meetings across Europe after the opener in New Zealand. ""But I got another seven points and that was crucial going into the last round, and I clinched the championship in my second race. ""I didn't actually realize that I'd won the championship when I crossed the finish line, the TV presenter was hanging over the fence going, 'You've done it, you've done it.' ""When I saw him, the weight just came off and it was an amazing feeling."" That success has moved him up into the big league of the speedway world. His protective suit is covered in sponsors' logos and he is in big demand -- as well as Wolverhampton, Woffinden will also ride for clubs in Poland and Sweden, plus the Grand Prix circuit. It means he's training, racing and traveling seven days a week, and he couldn't be happier. ""Across Europe it's pretty big. You know, Poland they get 20-25,000 just to a league meeting. Sweden's pretty busy as well,"" Woffinden says. ""I ride Poland on a Sunday, England on a Monday and Sweden on a Tuesday. I can do Germany on a Wednesday or Denmark or Czech Republic on a Wednesday if I wanted to, but you can do too much."" Despite his Australian upbringing, Woffinden has been named captain of Britain's Grand Prix team this season, which kicked off domestically this month. ""I'm definitely more British. I was born here and I ride for my country, but Australia is always going to be home for me, I go there every winter in the offseason,"" he says. The challenge now is to retain his world title, something that only two riders have done in the past 20 years. ""I did everything I could to make it happen. I was training hard, I was eating properly, I had the best bikes I could have, the best engines, a good team around me -- even down to my mum and my girlfriend booking flights and keeping all the logistics,"" Woffinden says. ""It's like a thousand-piece puzzle and you've got to have every single piece to that puzzle. Last year I had it and hopefully this year I'll have it as well."" For someone of his age, he has a great awareness of his responsibilities -- to his teammates, his fans and his sponsors -- but when it comes down to it, he's still a kid going full throttle. ""Nothing comes close to it, except maybe skydiving. When you're at the start line just revving your engine up, and you've got the other boys on the inside of you and everyone wants to be there first ... going down the back-straight and you've got somebody inches away from you and your elbows are rubbing and you've got to get it into next corner ... it's just a great feeling."" And it makes all the pain worthwhile.","British speedway rider Tai Woffinden is defending his world title this year .

"Jersey City, New Jersey (CNN) -- When Hurricane Irene roared ashore last year, Jeff Spangler was hit hard. The slow-moving storm whipped up a powerful tidal surge that breached sea walls protecting Jersey City, a bedroom Manhattan community, and flooded Spangler's home to the tune of thousands of dollars in damage and months of home repair. This year, it happened again. Superstorm Sandy and its rare mix of converging weather set records as it barreled into the Northeast on October 29 -- but its local effects may not have seemed so rare to Spangler and others who had survived Irene. Experts warn of impending superstorm era . Just like in 2011, floodwater poured into the low-lying neighborhoods of Jersey City, knocking out power and filling Spangler's basement. Now, the father of three says he's considering cutting his losses and moving out. ""The more this flooding happens ... the lower property values will sink,"" Spangler said. ""I'll end up being underwater, literally."" Like many of his neighbors, Spangler rents out his building's first floor to help to pay his mortgage. Now, his tenants are gone, having left in Sandy's brutal aftermath. ""Not only are we dealing with repairs, now we're dealing with the loss of rental income and carrying the full mortgage until we can clean up the area,"" he said. New York residents sue utilities after Sandy . When Sandy unleashed its deadly torrent of wind and water, Spangler and his family rode it out inside their home as river wash leaked through his first floor and raised anxieties about how much higher it would get. A swollen Hudson River had expanded into his backyard. When it finally receded, the flood left an auburn-colored watermark on his basketball hoop backboard. The hoop was about 7 feet tall. Afterward, the dials on his electrical boxes filled with bubbling pockets of a brownish liquid that seemed to foreshadow the string of electrical problems that would follow across the region. Not forgetting the lack of electricity after of Irene, Spangler had prepared for Sandy, purchasing a generator just days before it hit. After the storm, he ran electrical cables across the street to his neighbors' homes, padlocking the generator to his wrought iron stoop out of fear of looting. ""I'm sure there were people watching and waiting for me not to be near that generator,"" he said. At the height of the crisis, Spangler said, police and fire officials told him to hide the machine at night because it would take them hours to respond to an incident in his neighborhood. "" 'We're just overstretched,' "" he quoted authorities as saying. That triggered shades of vigilante justice across his neighborhood, though Jersey City police could not be immediately reached for comment regarding the claim. ""I have neighbors across the street who have firearms who told me, 'Don't worry about it,' "" he said. "" 'Just call us (if there's a problem) and we'll be right outside with a gun.' "" Preparing for lesser disasters . Sandy triggered massive flooding across the Northeast, yet the effect of the floods may have been especially foul in Jersey City. That's because the city maintains a combined sewer and rain drainage system, meaning floodwater also spewed from pipes, swirled into basements and probably contained raw sewage, according to accounts from local residents and city officials. ""This happened with Irene too,"" Jersey City mayoral spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said. The sewage ""couldn't flow out because the water was at its highest capacity. ... So when the water came into (people's basements), it wasn't just water."" But any sewage overflow that occurred was considered minimal, according to the head of Jersey City's Municipal Utilities Authority. ""Did it occur on an extensive basis? Absolutely not,"" Dan Becht said. After paying a remediation company to sanitize his basement, Spangler disagreed. He and his neighbors point to the city's antiquated sewer system as a primary culprit. ""I had to get this whole area disinfected,"" he said, standing in his basement illuminated by floodlights. Last year, Jersey City's drainage system was the focus of a lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency, which said the city failed ""to properly operate and maintain its combined sewer system."" The city settled the suit in July of last year and pledged to invest more than $52 million in infrastructure repairs and upgrades. And yet those incremental updates may actually miss the bigger point, as many say that little done at the municipal level could have blunted the power Sandy unleashed on the region. The more pressing issue may be how to decipher ways to best protect the city from lesser, more frequent storms, while enlisting federal support for the kind of long-term infrastructure needs that lie ahead. ""Sandy was to some extent unavoidable,"" Spangler said. ""But Irene was a flood that never should have happened."" To rebuild or not . The gas shortages and massive power outages that plagued New Jersey after Sandy and a nor'easter that struck a week later are now starting to dissipate. The state lifted gas rationing orders Monday, and only about 4,000 customers across the state were still without power as of Wednesday. At the height of the storms, more than 3 million customers in New Jersey were without power. Yet restoring power to many of those still in the dark requires inspectors to go door-to-door to check individual electrical panels, to avoid triggering further damage, such as electrical fires. Opinion: Rebuilding after Sandy too big a risk . Still, the cost of rebuilding is in the billions. And Tad Drouet, 45, said he expects the damage to his Jersey City home after Sandy to be much higher than it was after Irene. ""Last year, our tab for fixing everything was about $15,000,"" he said. ""This year, it'll be twice that."" Others, like Spangler, say they are again shelling out for those home appliances and other items that they expected to buy only once or twice. ""I just spent money again on a washer-dryer,"" he said. ""I bought one last year too. These are the things you buy and expect to last 10 years."" Looming over many of these twice-battered storm victims is a basic question: ""How much is enough?"" And yet despite the chorus of post-Sandy voices that warn of a recurring rash of inclement weather in the region, others say market forces will still probably absorb the risks tied to waterfront property and prevent a downward price spiral in real estate. ""There might be temporary blips on the radar,"" said Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats, a New York-based real estate firm that specializes in rentals and home sales. ""But if history teaches us anything, people always rebuild and they always come back."" Football players help fellow Sandy victims .","Last year, Hurricane Irene flooded Jeff Spangler's Jersey City home .

"(CNN) -- The Iceman has returned to fire up Ferrari. The legendary Formula One team has re-signed Finn Kimi Raikkonen to partner Fernando Alonso in 2014. The Italian marque is replacing Brazilian Felipe Massa with its 2007 world champion as it seeks to end an era of Red Bull dominance. ""Scuderia Ferrari announces that it has reached an agreement with Kimi Raikkonen,"" read a statement on the team's official website. ""The Finn will join Fernando Alonso in the driver lineup for the next two racing seasons."" Raikkonen spoke of his pleasure at returning to the team which had employed him between 2007 and 2009. ""I am really happy to be returning to Maranello where I previously spent three fantastic and very successful years,"" Raikkonen said. ""I have so many memories of my time at Ferrari, memories which have stayed with me these past years. ""I can't wait to be driving a Prancing Horse car again and to reacquaint myself with so many people with whom I had such close links."" Old foes, new friends? Ferrari will be the only team to race two world champions next season, making it the most potent, but potentially risky, pairing on the grid. Commenting on his new teammate, Alonso said: ""I'd like to welcome my new traveling companion: together, starting next year, we will have to tackle a very demanding technical and racing challenge."" Raikkonen added that he considered the Spanish double world champion, ""a great driver."" Ferrari released Raikkonen in 2009 -- ending his multimillion-dollar contract a year early -- to make way for Alonso as its number one driver alongside Massa. Raikkonen said at the time he was ""very sad"" to leave Ferrari and he immediately quit F1 to pursue rallying. That backdrop feeds a fascinating dynamic between Raikkonen and Alonso as they work together as teammates next season. Pairing Alonso with another ambitious and capable driver is a risk -- a problem McLaren had to face when it signed the Spaniard alongside Lewis Hamilton in 2007. Alonso, who won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, left McLaren after a single season in which he and Hamilton fought over No. 1 status within the team. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo had said earlier this year he did not want ""two roosters in the same henhouse"" but that view softened at last weekend's Italian Grand Prix. Di Montezemolo gave Raikkonen the green light ahead of Massa and Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who had also been linked with a move to Ferrari next season. Massa, who was retained by Ferrari after recovering from a life-threatening head injury at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, announced his departure Monday. The 32-year-old revealed on his Twitter account: ""From 2014 I will no longer be driving for Ferrari. ""I would like to thank the team for all the victories and incredible moments experienced together. ""Right now I want to push as hard as possible with Ferrari for the remaining seven races. For next year, I want to find a team that can give me a competitive car to win many more races and challenge for the championship which remains my greatest objective!"" Raikkonen, who has won two races since returning to F1 with Lotus in 2011, will be determined to fight for victories -- something Massa has struggled to do alongside Alonso. The Brazilian, who has spent eight years at Ferrari, has not won a race during his tenure as Alonso's teammate while the former Renault star has won 11 grands prix since joining Ferrari in 2010. Raikkonen -- nicknamed ""the Iceman"" -- is not expected to be cowed by Alonso's strong personality or his abilities on track. Ferrari will hope their ""fire and ice"" combination will bring out the best in each other as it seeks to win its first team title since 2008. Team principal Stefano Domenicali chose only to focus on Raikkonen's comeback Wednesday, saying: ""I sense he is very happy to be returning to Maranello and very determined to tackle the work that awaits him in the best way possible."" Ferrari's late founder Enzo Ferrari had a reputation for encouraging rivalry between his drivers but Ferrari has preferred to adopt a policy of focusing on a lead driver since Michael Schumacher joined in 1996. Silent but deadly . Raikkonen is as renowned for his reticence as he is for his pure speed -- the 33-year-old simply prefers to do his talking on the track. But his occasional, pithy one-liners have earned him a legion of global fans. His comment to Lotus on team radio as he raced to victory in Abu Dhabi last year (""Leave me alone, I know what I'm doing"") was so popular it has appeared as a slogan on t-shirts and mugs. Back in 2001, Raikkonen was fast tracked into F1 by Sauber after competing in a mere 23 races in motorsport's junior categories. McLaren was the next team to recognize Raikkonen's natural talent, and snapped him up on a long-term deal in 2002. The following season, Raikkonen took Schumacher down to the final race of the season in a thrilling championship but he would have to wait for the German to retire before finally getting his hands on an elusive world title. Ferrari chose Raikkonen as Schumacher's replacement in 2007, hiring him for a reported $41 million. He soon earned his corn, bringing the drivers' title back to Ferrari after seeing off Hamilton by a single point. Ferrari has now returned to Raikkonen for a quick fix as the Scuderia desperately seeks to rein in the all-conquering Red Bull team. Raikkonen, who turns 34 in October, will not be able to offer a long-term solution -- but Ferrari chiefs are gambling on the fact that given the right car he will deliver, and deliver quickly.","Kimi Raikkonen has rejoined Ferrari to partner Fernando Alonso in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- As a shivering and nervous new recruit to the British Army in 2007 -- wearing three layers just to keep warm -- Semesa Rokoduguni began to seriously question why he had left the tropical Pacific Island of Fiji. ""Everyone just looked at me and burst out laughing,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. With limited grasp of the English language, Rokoduguni had to bite his lip and take his medicine to earn the respect of his colleagues in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, a tank regiment based in Germany. But fast forward six years and Rokoduguni has had the last laugh because when he is not patrolling the front line with the army in dangerous trouble spots such as Afghanistan, he is charging to the try line at the home of rugby union Twickenham. The skills he acquired playing barefoot as a child back home in rugby-mad Fiji -- where kids often use bottles because they have no ball -- earned him a place in the British Army representative side and it was not long before professional clubs took an interest. Still a serving officer, risen to the rank of Lance Corporal, Rokoduguni signed a professional contract with leading English Premiership side Bath at the start of 2012-13 season. Star rookie . Now 25, his swift and aggressive running has seen him impress despite his rookie status and he scored a fine try in a recent win over one of the most successful clubs in European rugby, Leicester. It's a highly unusual double life and he reminds his new teammates that although rugby is a tough and physical sport, the lifestyle is a world apart from active service. ""I've been telling the boys at Bath, we do four patrols a day and you have to do that for every single day, there's no Saturday or Sunday, where you get days off. It's a hard life."" But Rokoduguni also believes the teamwork ethic that is necessary for very survival in a theater of conflict such as Afghanistan can cross over to sports. ""Trusting the guys beside you it is basically the same thing out there and on the rugby field as well,"" he said. ""Team bonding is a massive thing out there, you have to trust every single one in front of you, left right and behind you."" Rokoduguni's performance for the Army against the Navy in the traditional annual match at a packed Twickenham last year -- running in a hat-trick of tries -- brought him to national prominence for the first time. Given his outstanding performances in the pro game with Bath, expectations were high for the 2013 edition last weekend. Record crowd . A record crowd of over 72,000 watched the match -- the increased interest echoing the hullabaloo which surrounds the Army-Navy clash in collegiate gridiron football in the United States -- and the Fijian ace did not disappoint. Another hat-trick of tries helped the Army team to another thrilling 43-26 victory over their arch rivals. Just setting foot for the first time on the turf at the ""Holy Grail"" of the sport was an eye opener for Rokoduguni, given the rudimentary facilities he had grown up with. ""I thought, 'Oh my god, this is Twickenham.' I've just heard about this place and watching it on telly, I never realized that I would set foot on a ground like this. ""I was thinking back to my primary school life, playing rugby barefoot, chasing people around, smashing each other up! "" Rugby is the national sport in Fiji -- a former colony of the British Empire, hence the tradition of young men from the Pacific Island joining its armed forces. Rokoduguni's uncle followed that route and inspired his nephew to sign up in the summer of 2007. His brother is also serving with famous Black Watch regiment in Scotland. Despite the relatively small numbers of Fijians in the British Army, they make a large contingent of the rugby squad and for Rokoduguni it's almost a home from home, and allows him to use his native tongue in private moments. Role model . Rokoduguni is following in the footsteps of Aposoli Satala, who also represented the British Army before playing in England's top flight with Gloucester and Sale Sharks. ""Watching him playing Premiership rugby, I thought one day I'll be doing the same thing but, I never realized it's going to be that soon,"" Rokoduguni said. ""When I got the call from Bath coach Gary Gold I was overwhelmed, to be honest. I thought it was a joke and hung up on him!"" But Gold was deadly serious and set about transforming Rokoduguni's raw talent into the finished product after an inauspicious start. ""On the first day of training, my passing was absolutely ridiculous, I mean I couldn't even pass on my left-hand side,"" he recalled. ""To get up to that level you have to work extra hard, it's the only way you can improve yourself, the extra time you put in, the extra effort you put into the game or into the training."" But if there is one thing that the Army has instilled in Rokoduguni it is discipline: ""You have to dress up correctly, be punctual at all times, uniforms ironed."" It was a culture shock after his self-confessed ""easy life"" back home -- where he admits a love for the local alcohol kava resulted in him getting a gold tooth after coming off second best in a drunken fight. ""Punctuality, shaving and haircuts, I just didn't care about that stuff ... Everything has changed a lot,"" he laughed. Like Satala, who has been a star of Fiji's world renowned seven-a-side team, Rokoduguni is also an expert of that version of rugby which relies more on speed and agility than the traditional 15-a-side game. Rugby Sevens will take its place in the Summer Olympics for the first time at Rio 2016 and Rokoduguni, who is already being tipped to have an international future, could be left with a dilemma. ""I'm not too sure whether it's England or Fiji,"" he said, while admitting he still thinks of Suva, the capital city of Fiji as ""home"" -- particularly at Christmas time when he longs for the warm weather rather than the British rain and chill. His wife and son are also back in Fiji with his parents until he can arrange for their travel visa. Soldiers supported . Fame and no little fortune may await Rokoduguni but his thoughts are always with his fellow servicemen and women who are risking their lives in Afghanistan. ""I was man of the match against Newport Gwent Dragons (scoring two tries on his debut in November) and as soon as they announced my name I was thinking of them straight away,"" he said. ""I dedicated the win to them to let them know that even though I'm back here, all my support is with them out there."" Rokoduguni pays regular visits to the rehabilitation unit at Headley Court, south of London, where severely injured combatants are treated. A Fijian comrade is currently recovering there, and Rokoduguni made him a promise ahead of the latest Army-Navy game. ""I asked the doctors and nurses to make sure that they got him a television so that he could watch this game and I said that if I scored a try that I would do a backflip for him, which is what I did."" Meanwhile, back home in Fiji, Rokoduguni's proud parents are keeping up to date with his progress by watching YouTube clips of his try-scoring exploits. Judging by his rapid rise to the top they will be glued to the worldwide web for many years to come as Rokoduguni terrorizes rugby defenses with his blistering pace and stockily built 94 kg frame. But he knows that at any time the call might come to join his regiment on a tour of duty in Afghanistan or another area of conflict where British troops will be deployed, and his sporting ambitions would have to be placed on hold.","Semesa Rokoduguni is an up and coming star of rugby union .

"(CNN) -- For all the cheers, roars and ovations in all the Olympic stadiums and arenas over all the years, perhaps the most significant Olympic sound heard in the last quarter-century was a yawn. Because a yawn, symbolically, was how the public greeted what might have been the most controversial change in rules that the International Olympic Committee ever instituted. The one firm rule that always governed the Olympic Games was that amateur athletes were permitted to compete. Professional athletes were not. That's what made the Olympics the Olympics. Until it didn't. And the fans, far from protesting in outrage at the change, didn't care. In fact, they seemed to like it a lot. In the Olympic eras before television, athletes who accepted money for their performances might as well have been lepers, in the eyes of the IOC. If it was discovered that you got paid for playing, or that you accepted commercial endorsements, you were shunned, banished, cast to the cold winds. In the most famous example of the inflexibility of the Olympic organizers, Jim Thorpe, perhaps America's finest athlete of all time, had his gold medals in the decathlon and pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics stripped, and his achievements nullified, because he had once accepted small amounts of money for playing semi-pro baseball during his college summers. It broke his heart. The medals were reinstated in 1983 -- 30 years after his death, 30 years after the moment could have given him any comfort. Torch starts final leg before London Olympics open . It may be hard for young viewers of this summer's London Olympics to imagine, but all the sponsorships, advertisements and marketing hoopla that are a standard part of big-dollar contemporary Olympic Games were thought to be an insult to the Olympic spirit not so long ago. The Olympics were supposed to be about love of sport, not love of money. Then came TV. The president of the IOC during the years of television's phenomenal growth was an American, Avery Brundage, and the guiding principle of his reign (1952-1972) was what was called the ""amateur code."" He was unbendable on the subject. In a 1955 speech, Brundage said: . ""We can only rely on the support of those who believe in the principles of fair play and sportsmanship embodied in the amateur code in our efforts to prevent the Games from being used by individuals, organizations or nations for ulterior motives."" Meaning: to make money. But once Brundage was gone, the floodgates opened. The IOC, after his regime, realized that commercial interests could turn the Olympics into a bottomless goldmine. And to bring in viewers, it was determined that an effective lure would be the presence of the greatest and most famous athletes in the world. Many of whom are professionals. ""The pros are there for a reason,"" the esteemed sports journalist Ron Rapoport, who has covered six Olympics, told me the other night. ""People will tune in to watch athletes they know. The pro athletes are pre-sold to the public, which means increased viewership."" What made it an easy sell was the suspicion that athletes from certain Eastern Bloc nations were de facto professionals anyway: They were supported full-time by their governments to train and compete. So, by the end of the 1980s, the move toward professionalization of the Olympics had gained full steam. Which seemed to be just fine with the fans. If the best athletes were paid for their skills, or for granting endorsements, why not? The concept of ""selling out"" -- once such a pejorative -- had become almost meaningless. Making a lot of money for being good at a sport was a badge of honor. When the Dream Team of National Basketball Association players from the United States went to the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, the transformation was complete. If you spent any time around the members of the Dream Team in the months leading up to the Olympics, you couldn't help noticing that they were not exactly a bundle of nerves. They were going to win, and they knew it -- Michael Jordan spent much of his time in Barcelona either playing in all-night card games or getting in 36 holes of golf a day. The Olympics were a very successful business trip for U.S. basketball interests; the real dream was the one realized by David Stern, the NBA commissioner. The 1992 Olympics were the best global marketing tool the NBA ever had. (Many people point to the fact that the Dream Team won their games by an average of almost 44 points as the most remarkable statistic of those Olympics. I've always thought that there was an even more extraordinary one: The Dream Team was so good that its head coach, Chuck Daly, did not call a single timeout during the entire Olympic tournament.) Of course the problem with the Dream Team, and its successors representing the United States in Olympic basketball, is that they are automatic overdogs. The world outside the United States would love to see them lose -- it's ""Break up the Yankees,"" on a planetary scale. The amateur U.S. ice hockey team at Lake Placid in the 1980 Winter Olympics -- the ""Do you believe in miracles?"" team -- was cherished because they won when they were said to have no chance. No Olympic team of U.S. basketball pros will ever know that feeling; the ""Do you believe in miracles?"" emotion will be reserved for teams who are trying to knock them off. The size and scope and riches of the 21st century Olympics are a far cry from how the games began, and there's no going back. Few people seem to want to. The spectacle is hypnotic. There would be a sure-fire way to restore what was seen as the purity, and the love of competition for competition's sake, of the early Olympics -- a way to drive the marketers and merchandisers and global sponsors away so that the Games would simply be games again. All the IOC would have to do is add a short sentence to the Olympic Charter: . ""The Olympic Games shall not be televised."" That would do it. Meanwhile, back in the real world, the opening ceremonies in London will be held on Friday. Rumor has it that they'll be on television. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: For decades, the Olympic Games banned professional athletes .
He says the decision to admit pros changed the nature of the games .
Greene: Having pro athletes compete increases potential for games to make money .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. court of appeals gave Facebook a thumbs up on Wednesday when it ruled that ""likes"" on the social network are protected as free speech under the Constitution. In 2009, six employees at the Hampton Sheriff's Office in Virginia lost their jobs after expressing support for their boss' opponent in an upcoming election for sheriff, some by liking and commenting on the opponent's Facebook page. U.S. Circuit Judge William Traxler found that ""liking"" something on the social network was the ""Internet equivalent of displaying a political sign in one's front yard,"" an act the Supreme Court has already ruled as protected speech. The decision from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, was a reversal of an earlier ruling on the case, in which District Judge Raymond Jackson said liking a Facebook page was ""insufficient speech to merit constitutional protection."" Other courts have ruled that posts on the social network are protected as free speech, but Jackson differentiated between making full statements and just clicking a button to like something. Two of the employees, Deputy Daniel Carter and Robert McCoy, claimed they were fired by Sheriff B.J. Roberts specifically for liking a Facebook profile for Roberts' opponent, Jim Adams. The two also posted messages showing their support on Adam's Facebook page. Eventually, McCoy said he removed his post on Facebook after co-workers asked him why he'd risked his job so close to retirement. Roberts allegedly confronted Carter and said, ""You made your bed, and now you're going to lie in it -- after the election, you're gone."" When Roberts won his bid for re-election, he did not reinstate a number of employees, including Carter. Facebook and the American Civil Liberties Union became involved with the case, both filing friend of the court briefs. ""The Constitution doesn't distinguish between 'liking' a candidate on Facebook and supporting him in a town meeting or public rally,"" the ACLU's Ben Wizner said in a statement.

"Orinda, California (CNN) -- As he lies in bed, Ryan Buchanan's eyes flutter open. He gazes into his room but fixates on nothing. A stuffed toy lies motionless in his left hand. Every two hours, a nurse turns him: first on his back, then to the right, then to the left. Fourteen medications course through his gastrointestinal tube, given at different hours of the day. His parents or nurses monitor his oxygen levels, change his feeding bag, clean the various tubes that help him survive. All this is happening in his bedroom, in the same home where Ryan grew up, learned to crawl, played with his dog and painted a California golden bear on his bedroom wall. This is also where his family hopes he will awake from his yearlong ordeal. The 17-year-old is in a persistent vegetative state after a beach accident deprived his brain of oxygen for more than 15 minutes. Ryan's parents, Bret and Janine Buchanan, turned their own bedroom into a hospital ward for their eldest son. Metal shelves in the room are stocked with adult diapers, splints, catheters and syringes. Increasingly, families like the Buchanans are bringing children with complex medical needs home for long-term care. In previous decades, children with neurological injuries would stay in hospitals or other facilities for the rest of their lives. Today, children are being moved through these institutions more quickly, said Dr. Ellen Elias, director of the clinic for kids with special health care needs at Children's Hospital Colorado. Part of the reason is that children with these and other health issues are living longer thanks to medical advances. Another reason for the change in care comes from the insurance companies' refusal to pay for long inpatient stays, Elias said. Children requiring long-term antibiotics, feeding tubes and/or ventilator support are now sent home with nursing care, rather than living months at a time in the hospital. ""It has changed dramatically. So many things we used to keep kids in the hospital (for), we can now take care of in the home instead."" Elias is the lead author of an article published in the journal Pediatrics in April that outlines ways to transition complex pediatric patients home from the hospital. ""We send very complicated kids home for their parents to take care of them,"" Elias said. ""This puts a huge amount of stress and responsibility onto parents. We realize this is an incredibly daunting task."" Home care places demands on parents' time and finances, as well as their emotional and physical well-being. The most complex patients can require 24-hour nursing shifts, a rigorous medication schedule and various treatments. The cost can be staggering: Ryan's monthly care is about $40,000. Home care costs less than lengthy hospital stays, but it's still a major expense. The state-funded California Medical Assistance Program, known as Medi-Cal, covers Ryan's home care. Ryan's condition requires nurses or caregivers around the clock to place his legs in and out of splints, change his feeding bag and bathe him. ""This is just a new life,"" said Ryan's father, Bret. ""I don't look at it as any different than taking care of a normal child."" Deeply religious, the Buchanans have faith that Ryan will recover and wanted to bring him home so he would be in a familiar setting. Throughout the day, his dad, mom and 15-year-old brother Jacob pop into Ryan's room. A stream of visitors from his high school, youth group and lacrosse team stops by during the week. Sometimes, his family watches football in his room, cheering for teams together. ""We never considered not bringing him home,"" Bret Buchanan said. ""Home is where his family and friends are and where he is most comfortable. Our goal has always been to bring him home when it was safe to do so."" The toll of caregiving can be intense, but parents are often willing to make the sacrifice. ""It's their child. They love them,"" said Elias, who has seen many parents take their children home. ""They want them to be part of their lives."" Ryan always had an easygoing swagger, said his mother, Janine. He aspired to study civil engineering and wanted to go to the University of California, Berkeley, like his dad. Fascinated by architecture, he would build model structures and houses. As an infant, he played baby Jesus in his local Nativity play, and as a teen, he would strum his guitar playing gospel songs for his church youth group. Teachers would rave about how much they loved him, said Jacob, who shared a room with Ryan for most of their lives. ""I feel like if I didn't have my brother (growing up), I'd be a mess,"" he said. ""He kind of showed me the ropes and everything. I always wanted to do everything my brother did."" In June 2011, the brothers and about 50 kids from their church went on a supervised youth retreat near Santa Cruz, California. On a Saturday afternoon, Ryan and his friends started digging a sand tunnel on Sunset State Beach. Scooping the sand with their bare hands and Frisbees, they created an underground passage about 10 feet wide and 7 feet deep. It was about 4 p.m. when Jacob heard one of his friends shout: ""Jacob, your brother is under the sand!"" The tunnel had collapsed, trapping Ryan underneath. There was no sign of him. Teens were screaming, and everyone dropped to the ground, frantically clawing at the sand with their hands to find Ryan, Jacob recalled. He dropped to his knees and prayed to God: ""Lord, if you can do anything, please take him out now. I don't want my brother to die."" By the time rescuers reached Ryan, he was unconscious. But his heart was beating. Weeks after the accident, the diagnosis became clear: Ryan was in a persistent vegetative state because he had been deprived of oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes. A month later, doctors asked the Buchanans whether they should resuscitate him the next time Ryan's life was in jeopardy. ""We have hope that he could still recover,"" his mother told the doctors. ""You're going to do everything you can for our son to keep him alive."" After months in hospitals and other institutions, his family brought him home in February. ""He seems more comfortable, relaxed at home,"" his dad said. Doctors say it's notoriously difficult to predict the outcome of neurological injuries, especially those stemming from oxygen deprivation. Without oxygen, brain cells die within a few minutes, causing extensive damage. The situation is dire in most cases, yet no one really knows why a very small fraction of patients emerge from comas. ""When it comes to neurology, there's so much unknown,"" said Dr. Ricardo Komotar, a brain surgeon and professor at Miami University who is not involved in Ryan's care. ""We don't have any statistics. It's very, very rare to be in a vegetative state for a long period of time and wake up."" Still, the Buchanans continue to hope. The uncertainties and caregiving responsibilities they face are often overwhelming, but the Buchanans say they believe that choosing to sustain his life and bringing him home was best for Ryan. Every day, Jacob pokes his head into Ryan's room, which is right next to the bedroom they used to share. Having ""Rye"" at home brings a ""sense of normalness,"" Jacob said. He usually recounts to his brother what happened during each day and even pokes fun of him like he used to. ""I look at him now, and I realize that's the same exact kid,"" Jacob said. ""Why can't he be like the way he was before?"" The Buchanans have set up a website, the Ryan Buchanan Trust, where you can learn more about Ryan and how to help. CNN's Emma Lacey-Bordeaux contributed to this story.","Ryan Buchanan was digging a tunnel at the beach when it collapsed on top of him .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood movies and high-fashion runways may seem a world away from a discussion about feeding the hungry, but Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry is joining designer Michael Kors in his work with the United Nations World Food Programme to fight hunger. In an interview with CNN's Alina Cho, the pregnant actress said that being a mother inspired her to act on behalf of hungry children because hunger often starts in the womb. ""Especially now, being a pregnant woman and already having a child ... it's so important what happens to the baby while they're in utero. And the first 1,000 days is fundamental,"" said Berry, who's showing only a small baby bump. The World Food Programme is considered the United Nations' front-line agency in the fight against hunger. It brings food to more than 90 million people in more than 75 countries. Late last year, Kors partnered with the World Food Programme to raise awareness and funds, and now he's bringing Berry on board. The actress has worked with the Jenesse Center in Los Angeles, which provides shelter and assistance to women and children suffering from domestic violence. The World Food Programme ""has been a natural segue for me,"" she said, ""because I care so much about women and children."" Halle Berry on pregnancy: 'Biggest surprise of my life' ""I'm a mom, and that's first and foremost, but it gives me another reason to exist, another purpose. And if I know that I'm helping one person every day in some way, that really makes me feel good, and that's a legacy that I can leave to my children,"" Berry said. For Kors, fighting hunger has long been a passion. He has worked with God's Love We Deliver in the New York area for more than 20 years to provide free, healthy food for men, women and children living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other serious illnesses. ""I'm a guy who likes to see results. And ... this is a solvable problem. The food is there. You can change someone's life immediately and with the World Food Programme. We're talking about doing what I've been doing in my backyard, but globally,"" Kors said. The World Food Programme ""can go anywhere, which is so spectacular,"" he said. ""You need to be able to shift on a dime, because there could be a hunger crisis in one part of the world and then suddenly it shifts, and it's becoming more of an epidemic somewhere else."" The World Food Programme says that $50 will feed a child for an entire school year and just $5 can feed a child in Africa for a month. The simple economics of those statements prompted the designer to get creative. Product with a purpose . Kors has designed a watch to help raise money for the World Food Programme. The Watch Hunger Stop Campaign involves the sale of four special-edition 100 series watches for $295 each. A portion of the proceeds from each watch will deliver 100 meals to hungry children through the World Food Programme. ""I wanted something that was direct,"" Kors said. ""You look at your watch, every time it says the 100 series watch, so you're reminded that there's the 100 meals. How fantastic is that? I'm not a scientist. You know, I'm a fashion designer. I wouldn't claim to be able to figure out a cure for an incurable disease. But I know we can make a difference with this."" The fashion designer and the actress say they just want to raise awareness about hunger, and their celebrity gives them a platform to ""make some noise."" And what about the baby? In addition to her new work with Kors and the World Food Programme, Berry is expecting her first child with fiancÃ© Olivier Martinez. ""I feel fantastic. This has been the biggest surprise of my life, to tell you the truth. Thought I was kind of past the point where this could be a reality for me. So it's been a big surprise and the most wonderful,"" said Berry, 46. Berry also has a daughter, Nahla, 5, with her ex-boyfriend, model Gabriel Aubry.","Actress Halle Berry joins designer Michael Kors and the World Food Programme .

"(CNN) -- The police chief of Mount Pleasant, New York, was arrested Thursday on charges of possession of child pornography, authorities said. Brian Fanelli, 54, was arrested at his home in upstate Mahopac after a months-long investigation by federal officials, said James Hayes, Jr., special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York. The chief allegedly used a peer-to-peer file sharing program to download more than 120 images and videos of child pornography, prosecutors said. Fanelli was released on $50,000 bond Thursday evening, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. A judge ordered him to home confinement with electronic monitoring. His computers and guns were confiscated, WCBS reported. Investigators identified Fanelli in October 2013 while investigating peer-to-peer networks being used to download sexually explicit content. ""We moved rather swiftly given his prominence in the community, his trust that had been placed upon him by those in the community and his close relationships with the community,"" Hayes told CNN. As police executed a search warrant at his home Thursday, Fanelli voluntarily told investigators that he began viewing child pornography about one year ago. Fanelli told investigators that he first started collecting the child porn as research for a sexual abuse awareness program he taught to elementary and middle-school students. But he said he later continued downloading it for personal interest , according to the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara. Fanelli had worked for the police department in Mount Pleasant, a town about 30 miles north of New York City, since November 1981, according to Joan Maybury, the town supervisor. He has been suspended as chief, a post he took in November -- one month after he became the target of the child porn investigation. ""The fact of the matter is the general public impression of people who commit these crimes is [that of] an unemployed pervert in his mother's basement,"" Hayes said. ""That's not our experience. We're finding that the people who commit these crimes are educated professionals, people in many different fields, and unfortunately this is not the first law enforcement officer that we've arrested for this crime."" Homeland Security investigators have been more involved in child pornography cases in recent years because they often involve the transmission of sexually explicit images of children from outside the United States, Hayes said. Fanelli faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 if convicted, according to the statement.","Mount Pleasant, N.Y., police chief arrested for alleged possession of child porn .

"(CNN) -- In addition to his unforgettable work as a comedian and actor, Robin Williams leaves behind close friends and family who loved him -- and also a tribe of fellow artists who hope to follow in his footsteps. As Hollywood and fans mourned the loss of Williams, who committed suicide at his California home Monday, a younger generation of comedic actors expressed their admiration for the legendary performer. And, like the rest of us, they tried to make sense of it. In a poignant essay published in The Guardian, actor and comedian Russell Brand gave this assessment of Williams: ""Hidden behind his beard and kindness and compliments was a kind of awkwardness, like he was in the wrong context or element, a fallen bird on a hard floor."" Yet there was so much talent. ""Robin Williams was exciting to me because he seemed to be sat upon a geyser of comedy,"" Brand wrote. ""Like he didn't manufacture it laboriously within but had only to open a valve and it would come bursting through in effervescent jets. He was plugged into the mains of comedy."" In some ways, Brand is the ideal person to write about Williams. The pair shared the willingness to shock and be unconventional in their stand-up work. But the British comic is not the only one benefiting from the trails Williams blazed. On Tuesday, all the late-night hosts -- Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and Conan O'Brien -- took time to honor Williams and share their memories. All expressed their joy in watching him perform and their sadness that he succumbed to his demons. ""I think it's particularly courageous for someone to be that generous of spirit in the face of that kind of depression,"" O'Brien said. Chris Rock, who is known for his edgy, political humor, told ABC that Williams was ""one of the funniest guys I ever saw in my life."" ""I remember the first time I saw 'Mork & Mindy,' "" Rock said. ""And I know this sounds weird, it was like watching, it was the first time I saw an actual human being be as funny as Bugs Bunny. You know what I mean? Like he wasn't human in a sense. When they (cast) him as an alien it was perfect because he was so from another world."" Hollywood can be competitive, but Rock said Williams was warm and always supportive of his colleagues. ""I never heard that guy trash, you know, comedians sit around and trash each other all day,"" Rock said. ""I never heard Robin Williams say anything remotely bad about any comedian. He has such a respect for the art form in general at all levels."" Like Williams, ""Let's Make a Deal"" host and comic Wayne Brady enjoys a career built on being the funny, approachable guy. Brady paid homage to the star who -- despite being an Academy Award winner -- took the time to do a duet with him on the improv show ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" ""Getting to work with him was a life high,"" Brady tweeted."" ""U don't get to meet the ppl you look up to very often, and I'm glad to say he never disappointed."" Mindy Kaling, ""The Mindy Project"" star who has made a career of exploring American culture, shared a special connection with Williams and his place in pop culture. ""I am named after a character from a Robin Williams TV show when my parents still lived in Africa,"" she tweeted. ""He meant so much, to so many, so far away."" ""Girls"" star and creator Lena Dunham tweeted that she had ""(just) shared a moment of silence on the set for Robin Williams, a man who brought so much laughter, joy and healing to so many."" ""Moved reading so many reminiscences of Robin Williams, the multitude of things he represented to diverse people of different generations,"" Dunham also tweeted. ""In an age of reality TV and TMZ it's a reminder of what entertainment can do: make us laugh, cry, feel known."" Williams' influence spread around the globe. Artists paid tribute to him at the Edinburgh festival, a major arts and cultural gathering held every summer in Scotland. American comic and satirist Will Franken told The Guardian that Williams mentored him. Franken said that upon finding out that his son had struck up a friendship with the legendary actor, Franken's father, a Vietnam War veteran, ""made sure I conveyed to Robin how much his performance in 'Good Morning Vietnam' meant to him."" ""In the short time I knew him, we used to share our experiences of those comedic demons of jealousy and envy,"" Franken said. ""Over coffee one afternoon, he told me that we were lucky we got to do what we did for a living, because a lot of people just had to sit with their own craziness. But we got to show off our insanity on the stage and get it out there.""","Young comics share their admiration of Robin Williams .

"Washington (CNN) -- With full military fanfare -- gun salutes, fife and drum corps, brass bands, a flyover and presidential praise -- the nation bid farewell to its top military man and honored his successor Friday. Adm. Mike Mullen has been Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, the president's top military adviser, since October of 2007. Army Gen. Marty Dempsey takes his place. ""As the new secretary of defense, I am confident of the future because we have the strongest military force in our history -- and it is strong because we can replace one great warrior with another,"" Leon Panetta said during the 90-minute Hail and Farwell ceremony on the Fort Myer parade ground across the river from Washington.. It wasn't just the October sun that brightened the day for Mullen. It was also the lengthy praise from the president and from the military he had served for 43 years, as well as the day's latest success in the terrorism fight -- the successful take-down of al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. Obama pointed to Mullen's leadership, from all the advice he provided in the Oval Office about the nation's two wars, to his crucial testimony to Congress that the country should end its ban on gays and lesbians serving open in the military. ""Mike, as you look back at your four consequential years as chairman and your four decades in uniform, be assured: Our military is stronger and our nation is more secure because of the service that you have rendered."" Mullen, the son of a Hollywood publicist, is a master of self-deprecating humor. He drew laughter from the crowd when he told a story of how he had been mistakenly identified at a party as the former general, and now CIA director, David Petraeus. And he said that White House meetings went better if participants didn't criticize the president's baseball team, the Chicago White Sox. ""And he really likes it when you laugh at his jokes. It just makes the meeting go better."" Mullen said. Mullen never misses a chance to make a point, hammering a favorite theme, that the American public must become more connected to its military personnel when they come home, giving them a chance, a job, an education. ""Welcome them back to those places, not with bands and bunting or yellow ribbons, but with the solemn recognition that they have done your bidding, they have represented you well, they have carried the best of you and of this country into battle,"" Mullen said. ""They have done things and seen things and bear things in their souls that you cannot know."" Panetta praised Mullen's hard work and dogged persistence. ""His leadership, his influence, his honest candor, his compassion and his outspoken concern for our troops have set an exceptionally high standard for the responsibilities and performance of a chairman of the Joint Chiefs,"" Panetta said. Dempsey becomes Panetta's and Obama's right hand man in navigating the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the hard choices about budget cuts. ""Marty's strategic vision is the right one for this time of transition as we craft a joint force that can defeat the wide range of complex security threats we face today, and into the future,"" Panetta said. ""In a speech he gave while leading the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, Marty said that the pace of change in today's world requires that we look at the future differently than we have in the past. Instead of trying to leap ahead decades into the future as we design our military, we must build a force able to handle the challenges we know it will face today, and one that can adapt to the future."" Mullen oversaw two wars plus the U.S. role in the Libyan conflict during his four-year term. But in recent weeks he found himself in a final skirmish inside the Obama administration itself over his statements that the extremist Haqqani network along the Afghanistan border was ""a veritable arm"" of the Pakistani intelligence service. He chose not to comment directly on that, saying only that in his advice to his successor, ""I urged Marty to remember the importance of Pakistan to all of this, to try and do a better job than I did with that vexing and yet vital relationship."" Mullen said Afghanistan will be Dempsey's biggest challenge. ""In seeing this critical transition through to its completion, in making sure that the security gains we have made are not squandered by the scourge of corruption or the lack of good governance that still plagues the country, our strategy is the right one,"" Mullen said. ""We must keep executing it."" The new chairman, the first Army general elevated to chairman since 2001, had the last word. ""Although you're a sailor and I'm a soldier, in the tradition of the horse cavalry, I want you to know that I will be proud to tell people that I rode with Mike Mullen during some of the most challenging times in our nation's history.""","Adm. Mike Mullen honored as he steps down as Joint Chiefs chairman .

"(CNN) -- Elisabeth Hasselbeck, co-host of ""The View"" and author of the new book, ""The G-Free Diet,"" spoke Wednesday with Larry King. Elizabeth Hasselbeck, of ""The View,"" says Bristol Palin is an ideal choice to speak about teen abstinence. Hasselbeck offers her thoughts on being the sole conservative on her show, Elizabeth Edwards dealing with her husband's infidelity, Bristol Palin being abstinence spokeswoman and her battle with celiac disease. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Were you surprised that ""The View"" made the most influential list of Time magazine? Elisabeth Hasselbeck: I sure was. I think it's truly a tribute to what Barbara (Walters) has done and the show that she created along with Bill Geddie, our executive producer. It's a great place for women to come to and listen -- men, as well. But, also, for us to get there every day and discuss everything from politics to motherhood and parenting. But it was a shock. I think any time you receive an honor such as that, it's shocking.  Watch Hasselbeck defend Bristol Palin » . King: As the definitive conservative in the group, do you feel like the outcast? Do you feel put upon? Hasselbeck: I never feel like an outcast there. If anything, I feel more included than ever. I mean, truly that is a table where respect is number one, in terms of we sort of have a vow to one another. And we couldn't come there every single day and talk about the things that -- that we discuss and have the debates that we do and get as fiery as we do and get back there the next day if there wasn't that respect at the table and true value for the others' opinion. I mean the more we tend to disagree, I think the more we sort of dig deeper into that relationship. King: So the anger doesn't carry over? Hasselbeck: No. I wouldn't even classify it as anger. I think it's passion, and I think it's passion with purpose. You know, we do believe different things at times. Occasionally, we agree. It may not be that interesting when we do, but there is passion. It is coming from different places, but we love that conversation. I love being able to hear someone else's opinion on a subject and maybe sort of, you know, push a button here and there and see what they think about what I have to say. King also talked with Hasselbeck about Bristol Palin, the daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, being a spokeswoman for abstinence. King: What do you make of that choice? Hasselbeck: I think she's the perfect choice. She has a tangible, living example of what this new responsibility is in her life. I believe that there is a sort of sadistic giddiness on the part of some true radical leftists, who are laughing behind-the-scenes about Bristol Palin's situation. Why are they so obsessed with her being a spokesperson for this? She's promoting a great thing -- abstinence. Find me something else that works 100 percent of the time. King: Elizabeth Edwards has gone public about her pain about her husband's infidelity. Yesterday on this show, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Joy Behar, your compatriot, called John Edwards a dog. Do you agree? Hasselbeck: You never understand the intimacies of someone's relationship with their spouse -- I mean or boyfriend, partner, etc. Those are places that only the two people truly understand. I think we're also looking at a woman of incredible strength, having looked at cancer and battled through. I believe that nothing, truly, can compare to that. And, you know, it's unfortunate. I think this alleged affair and, you know, disturbance, even in terms of allegedly funding his mistress' foundation, is even more complicating the matter. The idea of another child in the mix (is) disturbing as well. King: Elisabeth, Miss California USA Carrie Prejean -- first, the controversy over gay marriage statements and now scandal over semi-nude modeling photos of her. What do you think of the way she's being treated in the media? Hasselbeck: Well, I think there's a very specific witch hunt going on here because she expressed her opinion. So now we're going to dig and throw fear into the heart of any person who may want to freely express their opinion in the United States of America. That seems like a big bullying scheme to me. If she had answered the other way, would anyone have been searching for those photos? Would they want to vilify her or remove what she's been working for? I don't understand the pageant well, and I don't know what her responsibilities were. Was she to represent the state of California in her opinions and was she to represent the opinions of a young woman who believed in her heart one thing? That's her personal opinion. I'm not sure what her duties were or were to be. I do know this, though. I'm not sure this investigation into any sort of photos or background or family members that they're pulling out of left and right would have even occurred if she had given an answer on the other side. So it seems to me a bit of a bullying scheme, as I said before, and that disturbing. We should be able to have our opinions in this country and stand by them and at least be respected, at the very least. Later in the interview King talked with Hasselbeck about her new book, ""The G-Free Diet: A Gluten-Free Survival Guide."" King: Now, (when) we think of gluten, we think of wheat, right? Hasselbeck: Well, it's actually more than that. Gluten is a protein found in barley, oats, wheat and rye. It's more broad than most people actually think, so that is definitely a misconception out there. This has been a decade-long process for me. I have celiac disease, and I say out of diabetes came that low glycemic index diet and out of my celiac disease, I found this all-star diet. I call it my ""diet in the rough"" because it is something that, even if I didn't have celiac disease, like many others, I would follow this diet. You know, over 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with IBS, thyroid issues. I was having infertility problems. People suffer miscarriage after miscarriage, stillbirth. It eventually leads to intestinal cancer. This is something that needs to be treated. But the diet is actually, yes, for people with celiac disease, for millions with food intolerance that is up like 25 percent in the past five years (and) for people who just want a healthy lifestyle. I mean I'm on this diet before I'm pregnant, during pregnancy and when I'm trying to get back in my bikini to, you know, strut around in the summer.","Elisabeth Hasselbeck says ""radical leftists"" laughing at Bristol Palin's situation .

"(CNN) -- News footage of Black Friday sales, in which shoppers line up after Thanksgiving in search of steeply reduced merchandise, can resemble an episode of the classic nature show ""Wild Kingdom."" Shoppers wind neatly along the edges of big box stores like patiently waiting army ants. As doors open, sleep-deprived bargain hunters leap past one another like spawning salmon flinging themselves upstream. At close of business we see bare, dangling store shelves, reminiscent of the gnawed carcasses left behind by a pride of lions. To those who don't participate, Black Friday may seem like madness, an exercise in chaos to be avoided at all costs. But for the initiated, the country's biggest shopping day is something more: a jump start on Christmas shopping and even a ritual worth preserving. It's impossible not to marvel at the spectacle. CNN.com readers shared their own dramatic stories about the annual event in the comments section of a recent article. ""At about 10 p.m. Thanksgiving 2011, someone sat their Grandma at a bin in the aisle at Walmart with her hand on a DVD discounted from $19 to $5 until the clock struck midnight to make sure she got it,"" reader Mark Nelson remembered. ""People started disregarding the etiquette and just stashing items in their jackets instead of leaving them in the shrink-wrapped displays. People were shoving and screaming at each other,"" he wrote. ""A woman was brought to the front and kicked out for bringing a firearm into the store and brandishing it at a rival shopper. It was the grandma hoping to score the $5 DVD."" Black Friday: Shorter lines, but bigger checks . So what's the draw of risking life and limb for discounted DVDs? ""It feels like some kind of communal shopping experience, something we're all in together,"" said Brian Ginn, a friend of mine from college who has been braving the Black Friday crowds for a decade. He usually only makes four or five purchases on Black Friday, spending around $400. It's worth the effort, he said, to ""soak up the mad capitalist consumer energy of Black Friday!"" ""It's pretty exciting to see people shopping like crazy,"" Ginn said, ""even if my enthusiasm gets dampened by the long lines and occasional surly shopper."" For some, the retail spree is a family tradition. ""I started Black Friday shopping with my Dad,"" Ginn said. At first, they shopped for equipment and supplies for Brian's IT consulting business because of 40% to 50% savings. That was 10 years ago. Now 41 and a father, Ginn's Black Friday shopping strategy has branched out to include deals on toys for his son. This year's Black Friday will be a lot different, he said, since his father passed away in March. ""I'll definitely have breakfast at the Waffle House when I'm done, which is what we always did,"" he said. Jessica Collier, 31, also shops on Black Friday because of family tradition. ""The first memory I have of Black Friday shopping is from when I was about 6 or 7 years old,"" she said. "" My mom, grandma and I went to a large department store in Florida. I have been every year since then."" This year, her husband will join in the tradition, but the couple's daughter still has a few years to go before she can drink coffee and stay up all night for long lines and ""doorbusters."" Now that Collier and her mother live in different states, they can't always shop together. ""I always call her when I'm headed out,"" she said. ""I've become her wake-up call, usually around 2 a.m."" For Lori Elmore, a health policy analyst for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Black Friday isn't about family, but about the thrill of the bargain hunt. ""I tried to make it a family tradition,"" she said, ""but my family members dropped out after one time. They couldn't hang with me, they didn't have the stamina."" These Black Friday veterans acknowledge that some of their fellow shoppers turn into ruthless retail competitors mere hours after giving thanks during a dinner of turkey and pumpkin pie. ""I've been hit with a shopping cart, had people take things out of my cart, had people start fighting in line, had someone take something out of my hands before,"" Collier said. But often, the shopping means meeting new people, comparing lists and having fun. ""My experience has been that most people are helpful, patient and excited,"" Ginn said. ""That may be particular to the South, but I don't think so."" Collier and her mother even charmed a particularly long line into singing Christmas carols last year. ""My mom found one of those weird singing Christmas tree tats and wore it in line,"" she said. ""The tree lit up and danced while she sang at the top of her lungs. Of course, that story preceded us to the next store on our list, where total strangers were talking about it."" HLN: Confessions of a Black Friday shopaholic . ""I have learned over the years that you need to pack your patience and a sense of humor,"" when headed out on a Black Friday shopping trip, Elmore said. ""If you don't have either, you are in for a miserable experience."" Impatience can result in stampedes or fights, which retailers are taking steps to avoid this year. WalMart, for example, is offering Guarantee Cards, which allow shoppers to get iPads, LCD TVs and Blu-ray players at Black Friday prices before they get their hands on the items. Shoppers will get the items before Christmas, so sellouts are theoretically no longer a reason for crowds to lose their cool. The U.S. Department of Labor's OSHA group has issued Black Friday safety guidelines for retailers to avoid injury during the start of the holiday shopping season. And stores across the country are working with local law enforcement help to keep crowds safe and shopping. The National Retail Federation estimates 147 million people will venture out this Friday, Saturday and Sunday to take advantage of holiday sales. President Matthew Shay said in a recent press release, ""Though the Black Friday tradition is here to stay, there's no question that it has changed in recent years."" No longer do shoppers wait to find out Black Friday promotions in the Thanksgiving Day morning paper, he said. Now companies provide information through social media, mobile apps and specialized websites. Collier usually begins watching for Black Friday information online in mid-October. Blackfriday.com is a favorite of hers -- the site offers Black Friday ads and cash back on certain purchases -- but she won't forgo in-store shopping for online Cyber Monday deals. She prefers the in-person rush. A few years ago, with a large outlet mall as her target, Collier and her mother could not find a parking spot at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving night. So they drove out of the parking lot and found a hotel parking lot behind the mall where they could leave their car. ""The mall was at the top of a hill, so we started hiking, literally,"" Collier said. At the top of the hill, they were suddenly faced with the town's drainage ditch. In order to make it to the Coach store, which was offering everything at 50% off, ""we had to climb down the drainage wall and back up the other side,"" she said. ""We laughed our way through our desperation and got to the mall."" And at 5 a.m., loaded down with bags full of Black Friday loot, she and her mother climbed back up the stone drainage wall on hands and knees. Anything for a bargain. Like CNN Living on Facebook .","The communal aspect of Black Friday shopping can often outweigh the hassle .
Many families have turned Black Friday into a Thanksgiving tradition .
If you can't wait in long lines or shop patiently, Black Friday veterans advise: Don't go!"
"(CNN) -- Adventure travel isn't always about riding waves and ascending heights -- sometimes it's about heading inside, to explore the realm of our inner worlds. While it might be counter-intuitive to travel long distances to sit with a bunch of silent strangers, meditation retreats offer guidance to those on an internal quest. ""Every wise culture knows that there are times that are important to walk out in the desert or in the mountains, or go on retreat and listen,"" says Jack Kornfield, a meditation teacher whose books include ""The Wise Heart"" and ""Bringing Home the Dharma."" ""Quiet the mind and open the heart and listen deeply. In the cycles of our life, that serves almost everyone."" It's common to worry about a week without conversation, meat or sleeping in. But those who persevere are rewarded. ""It turns out in almost every case that they love it,"" says Kornfield. ""Things that seem like they might be difficult, such as silence, turn out to be right away a splendid gift."" Rules vary, but many dedicated centers will ask for a temporary vow of silence during most or all of your time as a visitor. A rule of thumb is to look for teachers with a good reputation and who come from a long tradition rather than a self-proclaimed guru. Be realistic about your physical needs and creature comforts. Austere conditions may prompt insight into the difference between what you want and want you need. A traditional Buddhist meditation retreat starts early in the morning; nonprofits will likely expect you to do a work period (cut those carrots mindfully) and to pick up after yourself. More than anything, says Kornfield, look for ""a place that's known for love, [with] a spirit of loving kindness and compassion in everything that it does."" Spirit Rock, California . Once San Francisco's northern suburbs give way to what looks like Tolkein's shire, the hills of Spirit Rock appear. Native Americans once used this land for spiritual rites; even the wild deer and turkeys are calm, without any need to flinch from humans. Residential retreats, held throughout the year, run as long as two months. ""Some come for healing, either the healing of the heart or the healing of the body,"" says Jack Kornfield, one of Spirit Rock's founding teachers. ""Some come because they are in life transition and need to listen deeply to what is the next thing that is asked of them or how to deal with some great change. ""As they quiet themselves, as they walk in nature, as they listen to their own breath and their own feelings and thoughts more deeply, they grow a sense of stillness and clarity. ""And we see it on their faces. We call it sometimes the vipassana [insight meditation] facelift. You look at the shining faces of people after a week of retreat, and they look like they are 10 years younger. They're brighter; their presence and spirit has been renewed."" www.spiritrock.org . Plum Village, France . For Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese monk whom Martin Luther King Jr. nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, cultivating lucidity is a means to connecting with yourself and others. ""When you are mindful of something, you are concentrated on it, and the power of mindful concentration can help you see things as they really are and you discover the nature of interbeing,"" he recently told Shambhala Sun. The monastery in southern France that he and about 200 monks and nuns call home welcomes visitors of all ages and features one lazy, unstructured day per week. www.plumvillage.org . Dalai Lama's teachings, Dharamsala, India . When the Dalai Lama teaches in India, where he sought refuge after fleeing his native Tibet, his talks are typically free and open to the public. Eleven Directions bridges the gap between the Nobel Peace Prize winner's talks and negotiating a week or so in Dharamsala, the center of the Tibetan community in exile and destination for many a spiritual pilgrim. Accommodation options include a guesthouse run by the Dalai Lama's brother. Shantum Seth, a Zen priest, advocates being fully open and aware when traveling, and is widely praised by Western Buddhists as the go-to guide in the Himalayas. His tour in Dharamsala is for those who want to connect with and discuss Tibetan culture and practices; other itineraries include ""In the Footsteps of the Buddha."" www.buddhapath.com . Mindfulness-based stress reduction at Glenview Hotel and Leisure Club, Ireland . In the 1970s, Jon Kabat-Zinn pioneered Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School for patients (and staff) to help manage the physical and psychological impacts of stress, pain and sickness. The approach strips away talk about dharma and karma to offer meditation techniques straight up. Their Center for Mindfulness hosts an annual conference for scientists on how meditation impacts health care and vice versa, and has contributed to scientific understanding of how meditation affects the brain and immune system. Mindfulness Tools for Living the Full Catastrophe is a five-day residential version of MBSR, which is taught around the world. This summer, Ananda hosts a session at Ireland's Glenview Hotel -- ideal for somebody who wants a location with all the typical traveler amenities. www.umassmed.edu . The Buddhist Retreat Centre, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa . Just a 90-minute drive from Durban, the Buddhist Retreat Centre's remote location in Ixopo feels fully rural. Former President Nelson Mandela awarded the center National Heritage status for its environmentally friendly approach to using indigenous plants and helping to save the endangered Blue Swallow. Accordingly, walking and bird-watching on the extensive property are encouraged. In addition to scheduled meditation retreats, people in search of solitude are also welcome to come and get away from the modern world on their own. Located in a traditional Zulu tribal area, the community here does outreach work with the local population through Woza Moya in the Ufafa Valley. www.brcixopo.co.za . Wat Suan Mokkh, Chaiya, Thailand . Starting on the first day of each month, this forest refuge offers 10-day meditation retreats. All levels are welcome, but the conditions are rugged; in the words of Ajahn Buddhadasa, who founded the hermitage: ""Live plainly, aim high."" At registration, you turn in your cell phone; beds are a straw mat and wooden pillow. The wake-up bell is at 4 a.m. The Garden of Liberation regularly attracts foreigners and is a good choice for those seeking an authentic forest monk experience with instruction in English. www.suanmokkh-idh.org . Ala Kukui, Hawaii . The idea for Ala Kukui, or ""Pathway of Illumination,"" was inspired by the events of September 11. This sanctuary is situated among hills and fruit trees on 12 rural acres in Maui, with views of both the Pacific Ocean and Haleakala. Various offerings throughout the year draw locals and long-haul visitors. Among specialties is a residential retreat for war veterans that acknowledges and aims to heal the extreme PTSD, grief and loss that soldiers often struggle with. Programs in hula, writing and yoga are also available. www.alakukui.org . Assisi Retreat Home & Hermitage, Assisi, Italy . If the Italian countryside gives you piece of mind, you can take comfort in the centuries-old farmhouse with four guest rooms. Morning and evening meditation periods are bookends for days spent exploring Assisi -- a ""spiritual walking tour of the ancient holy sites"" is an option -- or the Umbrian countryside. Retreats are conducted in English; kitchen space is provided to prepare your own meals. www.assisiretreats.org . Gampo Abbey, Nova Scotia, Canada . Gampo Abbey is geared toward monastic life in the Shambhala tradition. Residents typically make at least a yearlong commitment, but those with a regular meditation practice are welcome to come for a week during the summer in-house season. Those wanting to study with Gampo Abbey's principal teacher Ani Pema Chödrön (born Deirdre Blomfield-Brown in New York) can do so this year at the less austere Omega Institute in New York State. www.gampoabbey.org . Kripalu, Massachusetts . Located in the Berkshires just down the road from Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Kripalu is primarily a yoga center. The woodsy setting overlooking a lake is iconic New England, whether the branches are heavy with winter snow or bursting with the colors of spring, summer and autumn. Most visitors sign up for a course -- often a yoga specialty, including teacher training in Kripalu's signature method, which emphasizes personal expression. But many other programs, such as meditation, mindful running and couple's massage, are also offered. Yoga and dance for all levels are available several times per day for all visitors, and during school vacation periods, kid-oriented choices like CircusYoga are available. Keeping with the property's monastic history, living quarters are basic: many opt for dorm rooms with bunk beds and community baths. Some private rooms are available. Vegetarian-friendly meals are served cafeteria-style. (Breakfasts are silent.) New management has introduced Wi-Fi, coffee and all manner of chocolate. A vast menu of bodywork, including massage, facials and ayurvedic consultations, can be booked ahead of time or on-site. www.kripalu.org .","Spirit Rock in California was once used by Native Americans for spiritual rites .

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- Call him Charlie, Charles, Chuck -- whatever you want. It's all okay with him. Beaming a warm smile from beneath his push-broom mustache, the softly spoken 74-year-old doesn't strike you as a pioneering innovator -- the man responsible for a breakthrough that's now driving forward the world of manufacturing. But Chuck Hull -- ""in this kind of environment, it's usually 'Chuck',"" he says, as he sits down with CNN in Frankfurt, Germany -- is executive vice president and chief technology officer of 3D Systems, a company built on his creation: the 3D printer. In 1983, Hull was working for a small business that made tough coatings for tables using ultraviolet lamps. When he suggested a new way to use the UV technology -- to quickly turn computer designs into working prototypes -- Hull was given a little lab to play around in during his evenings and weekends. Hull experimented for months, on his own with a plastic-y gloop -- then one night, something emerged... CNN: When you began, what materials exactly were you using? Hull: The class of materials is called ""photopolymers"" and these are typically acrylic-based materials that would be liquid until they're hit with -- let's say -- an ultraviolet light. Then, they instantly turn solid. So, you have a vat of this liquid and a point of ultraviolet light, and you turn it into a solid piece of plastic. And that's the basic method? That's the basic methodology -- that's stereolithography. That's never changed. Who was the first person you showed it to? Er, my wife. I got a good part and called her up, got her out of her pajamas, told her to come down to the lab and see this. What did she say? ""This had better be good!"" (Laughs.) Explore: The 3D printing revolution . And then, when did you see 3D printing take off? Well, it's really blossomed just in the last few years -- in the sense of really rapid growth and recognition. There's a lots of things that contributed to that, I think: a lot of the medical applications catch peoples' imagination; certainly the maker movement, with low-cost machines getting hobbyists interested in inventing and building using 3D printing. How did the process develop into what it is today? One of the most significant [changes] is the basic accuracy you can achieve: because [the materials] cure from a liquid to a solid, they tend to shrink and they can distort. So as you build these 3D parts you get some inaccuracies and warp-age. But that chemistry has been vastly improved, so there's almost no distortion now. Also the physical properties: initially the materials were really brittle -- they would break easily. Nowadays you get really good, tough plastic materials. I hear the word ""democratization"" used about 3D printing. Is that important to you? The whole premise of this technology has been to foster creativity, and change in product design and manufacturing, and so forth. At the individual level, I think there's a great kind of pent up need: we've got into the computer age and everything is on a screen or remote, we've kind of missed the tangible result. This is a means to convert something on the computer to reality in a straightforward way. Could you have imagined all this? (Laughs.) Not at the consumer level. I was always thinking in terms of design engineers -- in terms of their expensive CAD computers and so forth. What do you think the industry is worth now? I think, well, in terms of the total goods and services, it's about $3 billion annually and it's actually growing at a rapid rate. Are there limits to what 3D printing can do? There's limits to everything. So, the kind of traditional limits of 3D printing have been: material properties, speed, making millions of things. But all the competitive companies are just constantly pushing those limits, so if you're projecting the future, it looks like these limits are going to be beat down over the next couple of years. What has surprised you most? To me, some of the medical applications. I didn't anticipate that, and as soon as I started working with some of the medical imaging people, it became pretty clear that this was going to work. But, you know, they told me, I didn't tell them. What does your wife say? (Laughs) She's probably more enthusiastic than I am, so she's very excited about this whole field. You made your discovery 30 years ago: how have you felt along these long 30 years? I mean, it's exploded hasn't it? Well, you know I'm old enough that I should have retired long ago, but it's so interesting that I don't. It's a really interesting journey.

"London (CNN) -- Imagine if you could paint a working light switch directly onto your wall, without any need for sockets, cables or wiring. A group of students from the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London has made that possible by creating electrically conductive paint. The paint acts as a form of liquid wiring. Unlike conventional wires, it can be applied to almost any surface, including paper, plastic, metal and even fabric. The product has the appearance and consistency of runny marmite, but dries quickly when exposed to the air. Its inventors, RCA graduates Isabel Lizardi, Matt Johnson, Bibi Nelson and Becky Pilditch, call their creation ""Bare Paint."" While they don't claim to be the first group to have invented a conductive ink, they are pioneering new ways it can be used. ""We started this project in earnest in 2009,"" says Matt Johnson. ""We were originally interested in trying to apply electronics to the skin ... so we arrived at this idea of applying them as a coating and eventually we got this idea of a conductive paint."" The team began by investigating how electronics were being used in the body. ""In 2008 -- and probably still today -- there was a lot of work around electronic textiles,"" says Johnson. ""And though we really liked the idea of having a jumper (a piece of clothing) that has some intelligence in it, we didn't like that it was so bulky and that once you took it off the functionality disappeared."" Around the same time there was a lot of ""extreme work"" being done by people who were injecting electronics beneath the skin. For their final project, the RCA students began work on making something less intrusive, looking for a substance that could be painted onto the body. Eventually, says Johnson, ""that idea transformed into the material we have now, which is very safe though it's not specifically intended for the body anymore."" After graduating from college, the team collaborated on a video for DJ and producer Calvin Harris. The resulting project was the ""Humanthesizer,"" a performance which literally brought the paint to life, with dancers whose movements triggered audio loops from Harris's song ""Ready for the Weekend."" ""Making a new material was a bit daunting for four designers,"" says Johnson. The team's solution was not to return to school to study chemistry for four years. Instead, they simply went on Wikipedia. According to Johnson, the online encyclopedia provided them with almost everything they needed to know about crafting conductive materials. Once the paint's formula was finalized, co-creator Isabel Lizardi says the team began to consider how it might be applied to real-world products. The first thing they launched was the paint in its raw form, which they made available to other garden-shed inventors. Today, Bare Paint jars and pens are sold on the Internet and stocked by Radio Shack electronics stores across the United States. Projects being done by Bare Paint users include everything from interactive color wheels to homemade electric toys.

"(CNN) -- Millions of fans on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border are mourning the death of Jenni Rivera, whose performances of soulful ballads sold out concert halls and made the singer a household name for many. Crews searched for the remains of Rivera and six others Monday amid the wreckage of a plane that crashed in a remote, mountainous area in northern Mexico on Sunday. ""The plane was totally destroyed. ... It is a great tragedy,"" her brother, Gustavo Rivera, told CNN en Español. There were no survivors, and the singer's publicist, lawyer and makeup artists were among those killed, he said. Family members were planning to travel to Mexico on Monday as investigators work to determine what caused the crash. Jenni Rivera is mourned, but still inspires . Another brother, Juan Rivera, seemed to hold out hope at a news conference Monday evening, saying: ""In our eyes we will have faith that our sister will be OK. We have no confirmation of her body being recovered, dead or alive."" The small Learjet plane that Rivera was flying in was 43 years old, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing the director of civil aviation for Mexico's Transportation Ministry. Collecting evidence at the scene could take up to 10 days, Alejandro Argudin said, according to Notimex. The wreckage, which includes personal items that belonged to the singer, was spread out over an area that spans up to 300 meters (more than 320 yards), officials said. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Monday that it was dispatching a team to help with the investigation. According to records from the U.S. agency, the airplane was substantially damaged during a 2005 accident when it struck a runway marker near Amarillo, Texas. At the time, the plane's pilot reported losing the ability to steer the twin-engine turbojet. As the investigation into Sunday's crash continued, fans, family members and entertainers said they were devastated to learn of Rivera's death. ""The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many,"" Universal Music Group said in a statement. ""From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Jenni was simply incomparable. "" Known to fans as ""La Diva de la Banda"" or The Diva of Banda Music, Rivera was well-established as a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. For fans, the nickname captured her powerful voice and the personal strength many admired. Flashback: Rivera reflects on her success . In recent years, she had been working to crack the English-language U.S. market and was reportedly on the verge of a crossover with a sitcom inspired by the success of ""I Love Jenni,"" a Spanish-language reality TV show on Telemundo's mun2 network. Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor Monday afternoon, Sen. Marco Rubio described Rivera as ""a real American success story."" ""She was a singer in a genre of music that's largely dominated by males, and she brought a powerful voice to that genre where she sung frankly about her struggles to give her children a better life in this country,"" the Florida Republican senator said. Rivera sold 15 million records, according to Billboard, and recently won two Billboard Music Awards, including favorite Mexican music female artist. But she started out small. In an interview with CNN en Español in 2010, Rivera spoke about how she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family's stand at a Los Angeles flea market. ""It is very flattering when they tell me that I'm a great artist, a great entertainer, that when I'm on stage I can get in the recording studio and come up with a great production,"" she said. ""But before all of that, I was a businesswoman. I'm primarily business-minded."" Rivera eventually became the owner of several companies, including Jenni Rivera Enterprises, which produced and marketed her music, a fragrance brand, a jeans factory and a television production company. Rivera was nominated for Latin Grammy Awards in 2002, 2008 and 2011. In October, People en Español named her to its list of the 25 most powerful women. She was beloved by fans as much for her music as her over-the-top lifestyle that was chronicled in ""I Love Jenni"" on Telemundo. Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera released her debut album in 1999, according to her website. She followed that up with two more albums, including the 2003 album ""Farewell to Selena"" -- a tribute to slain Tejano star Selena Quintanilla -- that increased her popularity. Her father, Pedro, and two of her brothers also are well-known performers in Mexico and portions of the southwestern United States. Famous for her music, she is also known for her tumultuous personal life. The singer was a single mom at the age of 15 and is the mother of five, her website said. In 2009, she made headlines when she was detained at the Mexico City airport with tens of thousands of dollars in cash. A year later, she made headlines again with the marriage to former baseball pitcher Esteban Loaiza, who played for the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. In October, she announced she was filing for divorce after less than two years of marriage. It was her third marriage. Owner of plane carrying Rivera linked to troubled businessman . She told CNN in 2010 that she wouldn't let scandals or personal tragedy stop her. ""Staying defeated, crying and suffering was not an option,"" she said. ""I had to get off my feet, dust myself off and press on. That's what I want to teach my daughters."" ""I Love Jenni,"" which began airing on mun2 last year, featured her life on the road, balancing the duties of motherhood and stardom as she toured Mexico and the United States. Rivera's openness about the problems she faced won her a devoted fan base, said Raul Molinar, a Dallas-based radio DJ who interviewed the star several times. ""She was a real woman,"" he said, ""and she would express her feelings -- onstage, off stage, anywhere,"" Rivera also was a judge on the popular TV show, ""The Voice, Mexico,"" which was scheduled to air Sunday night. In its place, Televisa aired a special report about the singer. A fellow judge on the show took to Twitter after news of Rivera's disappearance. ""My heart is devastated,"" wrote Beto Cuevas. ""All my prayers are with you, Jenni, and your family."" Fans and celebrities took to social media to mourn the singer and television star. ""Spent some time with Jenni Rivera recently. What an amazing lady ... Cool, smart, funny & talented. Such a travesty ... God Bless her family,"" actor Mario Lopez tweeted. Rivera performed at a concert in Monterrey on Saturday night before boarding the Learjet, which took off early Sunday and lost contact with air traffic controllers about 60 miles into the trip. Just hours before she died, Rivera opened up to reporters about her divorce and the inner strength she found, thanks to her family. ""I'm so happy. So many strong things have happened in my life. I can't get up in the negative, which destroys you,"" she said. ""I have brothers. I have children. I have nephews. And they keep me from focusing on the negative.""

"(CNN) -- For the son of a math teacher, rallying legend Sebastien Loeb is not too concerned by numbers. Age was no barrier when the Frenchman decided to pursue his motor racing career at 22 years old. The ""late starter"" went on to win a record nine world rally titles. Now, after conquering the ice-packed slopes, desert dunes and rocky roads in the globetrotting world of elite rally driving, Loeb says he feels like a kid again as he moves from rally's all-terrain adventures to the uncharted territory of the smooth asphalt of the racetrack. ""Rally driving is the most fun driving you can have, because you slide, you drive on every surface, you jump,"" Loeb told CNN's Human to Hero series, with a twinkle in his cool, blue eyes. ""But I needed to see something else. I needed to change. ""I'm like a young boy, even if I'm 39! I'm like a young driver again coming into a series and trying to improve."" After a decade of dominating the rally circuit, Loeb has now set his sights on winning the 2014 World Touring Car Championship with his longtime team Citroen. This championship for racing road cars is the third elite series, in addition to Formula One and the World Rally Championship, which is rubber-stamped by motorsport's governing body the FIA. It will test Loeb on classic circuits from Sonoma in the United States to Suzuka in Japan, and he has already been tuning up for his new driving challenge by racing a McLaren sports car in the 2013 GT Series, where his team is second overall ahead of this weekend's race in Slovakia. ""There are different types of racetracks: some are really fast, some are really twisty, some have more or less grip, so you always have to adapt,"" explains Loeb, who has also tested a Red Bull Formula One car but failed to get a race license with feeder team Toro Rosso in late 2009 and later said he was ""too old"" to start an F1 career. ""It's not easy to get used to the tracks, to get used to a different car, to another driving style, but I enjoy it. ""It's not like when I'm in the rallies and everyone is waiting for me to win and if I don't win they say, 'Oh it's terrible, he didn't win!' "" Loeb retired from fulltime rallying at the end of the 2012 season -- the championship already in the bag, of course -- while still at the top of his game. He chose to compete in just four rounds of the WRC this year, saying he had no interest in reaching a ""perfect 10"" of world titles. ""A lot of people ask me, 'Why not 10?' "" said Loeb, who won consecutive titles between 2004 and 2012. ""The answer is because I don't count! ""When I won my first championship it was the achievement of something, a realization. After that I said, 'OK, the rest is a bonus.' ""It became less about pressure and just driving for passion. It's not a question of numbers."" Loeb was something of a late starter when he began plotting his career growing up in the Alsace region of France on the border with Germany. He first flexed his muscles as a champion gymnast. At three years old he was following in the gym shoes of his late father Guy Loeb, himself a champion athlete as well as a gymnastics instructor. One year later, the junior Loeb was the proud owner of a red racing bike and soon showed signs of a competitive instinct, never missing any opportunity to go riding on the streets with his school friends. But Loeb did not get behind the wheel of a car until, like any other teenager in France, he began driving lessons. ""In my family there was no links to motorsport or even being fans of motorsport,"" he explained. ""So it was only when I had my driving license that I got to enjoy driving a car. Then I started car racing when I was 22 -- not so young."" At that time Loeb was earning his living as an electrician, a pursuit he describes as ""not my passion, just my job."" On the side, he twice entered the Youth Rally, an event for up-and-coming drivers organized by the French Motor Racing Federation. Although he narrowly missed out on the title, his performances attracted the attention of former amateur racer Dominique Heintz, who, in 1996, decided to help Loeb turn rallying from a hobby into a profession. ""The person that helped me most in my career is Dominique,"" said Loeb, who now runs his eponymous race team with Heintz. ""He gave me the opportunity to start in rallies and is someone who is now my friend."" If Loeb came to motorsport a little later -- most racing success stories are built on a junior karting career -- he soon recognized that he had a natural talent for driving. ""Since the start I was just natural,"" said Loeb, who now flies a helicopter as a hobby. ""For me, it's been more about talent than work. ""The first thing you need is to get a feeling with the car. You need to feel when you have to brake and what speed to enter the corner. ""In rally you need to try to be as close as possible to 100% without knowing the roads really well, so you need a lot of improvisation in your driving. ""The feeling in the car when you reach your limits, when you pull everything together to be the fastest, to beat the others, to be first, this is mainly the feeling I have driving the car and this was just my passion. I love it."" The combination of passion and raw talent attracted interest from French car manufacturer Citroen, and in 2001 Loeb stormed to the junior WRC title. Two years later, he competed in a full season of the senior WRC for Citroen, losing out on the title by a single point. Loeb had made his mark, and his unprecedented era of dominance began the following year. Numbers may not matter to the rallying superstar but, after nearly a decade at the top of the tree, Loeb concedes this time age did play a part in his decision to quit while he was ahead. ""I have other things to do in my life,"" said Loeb. ""It's not like when you start and you're 24 or 25 and you just want to do your passion. ""Now I have a daughter (Valentine) and a wife (Severine). I have a good life, I have everything I need. It's time to enjoy it and rest a bit. ""I never have a fear when I drive but I know it's dangerous, it's one of the reasons I decided to stop rallies. ""When you are in Finland, jumping at 200 kph (125 mph) in the middle of the trees, it's dangerous!"" Loeb may be happy to settle for nine WRC titles, but his driving ambition remains undimmed. Talk of retirement is for a distant time in the future -- a date to which Loeb has no intention of counting down. ""I don't know, (I'll keep driving) as long as I feel able to go fast, to fight for the win and as long as I enjoy it,"" he said. ""It will be a few years. ""I think I will retire from all rallies soon. I've really tried to prepare for the future to find something to do as a driver -- and now I think I've found it. ""Rallying is difficult but racing (on the track) needs other skills and I still have a lot to improve and a lot to learn."" For now, the son of a math teacher and gymnastics instructor is going back to racing school.","Sebastien Loeb is the benchmark in rally driving, winning nine world titles .

"(CNN) -- As Ashton Kutcher becomes the first to collect 1 million followers on Twitter and Oprah Winfrey sends out her first tweet, tech observers are debating: Does Friday mark a new peak for the microblogging service? Or the beginning of its demise? Ashton Kutcher told Larry King Friday that the battle was about proving one person can have a voice. Some bloggers and Twitter users have expressed concern that the once-cultish site is being overwhelmed by celebrities and media hype, while others are excited by Twitter's ever-growing reach. ""It's a big milestone. This brings Twitter mainstream,"" said Andrew Cherwenka, a Huffington Post contributor and Web developer at Trapeze.com, referring to Kutcher and Winfrey's Twitter breakthroughs. ""A lot of people are saying this is going to be the death of Twitter, and I don't understand that at all,"" Cherwenka added. ""It's just another stage in Twitter's acceleration."" ""The challenge for Twitter -- besides, of course, getting a business model in place to handle the infrastructure required to sustain this kind of growth -- is going to be maintaining the fact that it's the community at large, not the celebrity users, that's at the core of this service,"" said Caroline McCarthy, who writes a CNET News blog about social media. ""The power of Twitter is about the millions of people using it and how easily it is to filter and aggregate their thoughts and conversations,"" McCarthy told CNN. ""It can't be all about Ashton and Oprah."" In the much-publicized duel, Kutcher's Twitter account crossed the 1 million mark on Twitter about 2:13 a.m. ET Friday, narrowly beating CNN's breaking-news feed, which had 998,239 followers at the time. CNN passed the mark at 2:42 a.m. ET. On Friday, Kutcher went on ""Larry King Live"" to talk about the battle and why he felt the duel was so important. ""We now live in an age in media that a single voice can have as much power and relevance on the Web, that is, as an entire media network,"" he said. ""And I think that to me was shocking.""  Watch Kutcher discuss reaching one million milestone » . Early Friday Winfrey sent her first tweet from the Chicago, Illinois, set of her TV show. The all-caps message was sent at 10:10 a.m. ET and said, ""HI TWITTERS. THANK YOU FOR A WARM WELCOME. FEELING REALLY 21st CENTURY."" Winfrey drew more than 73,000 Twitter followers before she sent out her first tweet. By Friday afternoon her Twitter following had climbed above 100,000. ""Twitter has experienced watershed events over the last two years since we founded the company, and momentum continues to build,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said Friday in an e-mail to CNN. ""Certainly having Oprah and Ashton embrace Twitter so enthusiastically will be another big moment for us."" But Kutcher also acknowledged on ""Larry King Live"" Friday that while he was able to get so many followers because he is well-known, he was trying to show that anyone can have a voice and let their story be told. ""I think it's really important that Twitter is not about celebrities. It's not a platform for celebrities,"" he said. ""In all these interviews and things, it's been celebrity -- you know, people know have been on TV. It's really about everyday people having a voice. And I don't want it to be dwarfed by celebrity."" Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who joined Twitter and threw his support behind Kutcher, told Larry King that he views Twitter as an important medium for him to share who he ""really"" is, and give fans a direct line of communication to him. ""It's a chance for people to know the real me,"" he said. ""Due to my own fault there's such a persona of the Hamptons and the bling-bling and the ""Forbes"" list and who I'm dating. There's more substance to me than that. Over time I've just wanted to make sure that that has gotten out."" Kutcher told Larry King that initially, Twitter was a tool to feed his ego until he realized that he could use the service to make a difference. ""At the end of the day, we all have ego, we all have some level of ego,"" he said. ""But if we can use our ego to actually create good charitable things in the world in some way, and use our ego -- originally, I defined Twitter as an ego stream when I first saw it. But then what I realized is if we can transform that into something that's positive that can actually effectively change the world, that can be a really valuable tool."" Kutcher had challenged CNN to the Twitter race, saying he would donate 10,000 mosquito bed nets to charity for World Malaria Day in late April if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same. The battle between @aplusk, Kutcher's Twitter handle, and CNN's feed gained much attention on Twitter, with fans pulling for both sides. Web junkies watched Kutcher on a live video stream as he celebrated with champagne, surrounded by his wife, Demi Moore, and friends. ""We are over a million. CNN is still trying to get there. And that is just how it goes,"" Kutcher told the camera as his friends screamed. ""There are a million people that need to be thanked for this.""  See Kutcher celebrate his milestone » . No single Twitter account had previously reached 1 million followers, according to two Web sites that track popularity on Twitter, a site on which users post 140-character messages that are distributed to groups of followers. ""Kudos to Ashton and all those in the @aplusk camp. Now more than ever, the consumer is in the driver's seat and we couldn't be more gratified than to be part of this historic social media milestone,"" said CNN spokeswoman Jennifer Martin. CNN maintains more than 40 official Twitter accounts, with a total of more than 1.5 million followers. Kutcher was racing the network's breaking-news feed, @cnnbrk. That account provides only brief updates about breaking news, therefore CNN doesn't send a lot of alerts -- just those for major events the network believes its audience will want to know. ""We'd like to thank every one of our followers for helping CNN reach the 1 million mark, and we are delighted to raise our donation to 10,000 bed nets for World Malaria Day in recognition of them,"" Martin said. Not to be outdone, Winfrey said in a tweet Friday morning that she would donate 20,000 mosquito bed nets to charity. ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest, another popular Twitter user, also agreed Friday to make a donation of mosquito bed nets, which help prevent the biting insects from spreading malaria in tropical countries. ""Ashton's 'Twitter race' is an amazing example of how we can leverage new technology to battle an ancient disease,"" said Scott Case, CEO of Malaria No More, the charity expected to benefit most from the mosquito bed net donations. ""Not only is Ashton helping Malaria No More raise awareness ... he's also galvanizing his Twitter army to help end malaria deaths."" The online feud between CNN and Kutcher also drew attention to the popularity of Twitter, which has seen breakneck growth over the past year. Twitter saw 131 percent growth in March alone, with 9.3 million unique U.S. visitors that month, according to comScore. The group attributes the increase to media attention on the site. Cherwenka, the Huffington Post blogger, believes Kutcher may be one of the first people to leverage the power of online social networking for widespread social good. ""It's a turning point in media. He's one person who uses a free media platform to reach a large audience. And that really hasn't been done before,"" Cherwenka said. ""He didn't spend a penny on this. And that's kind of the point of any kind of social activity on the Web."" But will all this celebrity-driven hype turn off longtime Twitter users? Time will tell, observers say. ""I know some Twitter early adopters and loyalists are feeling a bit ambivalent about this influx of mainstream attention, and are likening it to when their favorite indie band gets big overnight,"" said CNET's McCarthy. ""They're excited to see this service really take off, but at the same time are concerned that it's turning into a sort of novelty fad."" CNN.com's Brandon Griggs and John D. Sutter contributed to this report.","NEW: Ashton Kutcher: ""It's really about everyday people having a voice""

"(CNN) -- A New York man who served nearly two decades in prison for killing his parents has settled his wrongful-imprisonment lawsuit against the state for more than $3 million. Martin Tankleff, 42, served 17 years in state prison after being convicted in the September 1988 murder of his parents, Seymour and Arlene. An appellate court vacated his conviction in 2007, with all charges against him dismissed the next year. The court ruled that he probably would not have been convicted if newly discovered evidence at the time had been presented at trial in 1990. The $3,375,000 settlement resolves a claim brought by Tankleff in 2010, Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said Wednesday. In a statement released by Tankleff's legal team, he expressed his satisfaction with the lawsuit. ""I'd like to thank my family and friends who have stood by me for the past 25 years,"" Tankleff said. Tankleff was 17 when his parents were found stabbed and bludgeoned to death in their Belle Terre home on the North Shore of suburban Long Island. When police arrived, Tankleff was questioned and told that his father had awakened from a coma and accused him of the crime. Suffolk County investigators, led by Detective K. James McCready, extracted a confession from Tankleff that was used to convict him. According to court documents, Tankleff ""repeatedly and consistently"" told police that his father's business partner, Jerard Steuerman, was responsible for the deaths. Steuerman owed Tankleff's father a substantial amount of money and was the last of a half-dozen card players to leave a high-stakes card game at the Tankleffs' home the night before the murder, according to documents filed when Tankleff was trying to get his conviction vacated. Steuerman maintained that he was not involved in the crime and dismissed the assertion as ""ridiculous."" ""If he did not do it, he deserves the three and a half million,"" Steuerman said Wednesday. ""Let him use it in good health, and that's all I have to say."" With the lawsuit against the state behind them, Tankleff and his legal team plan a lawsuit against Suffolk County and McCready, the former detective on his case. ""We have developed powerful new forensic evidence demonstrating Marty's innocence and showing that his parents were murdered by assailants who acted with efficiency and brutality,"" Barry Scheck, Tankleff's attorney, said in a statement. Said Tankleff: ""I hope to expose the misconduct that caused my wrongful conviction so that it does not happen to anyone else.""","Martin Tankleff served 17 years for killing his parents .

"(CNN) -- Ray Rice's original punishment for knocking out his then-fiancee inside the elevator of an Atlantic City casino was controversial, but appeared a done deal: a two-game suspension. Then, this week, TMZ Sports released footage of surveillance video from inside the elevator that shows the altercation and the knock-out punch. Suddenly things changed. The Baltimore Ravens fired Rice. The NFL suspended him indefinitely. The facts never changed -- Rice knocked Janay Palmer (now Janay Rice) unconscious. But the latest video moved the needle in a way that previous coverage hadn't. It has brought back to the forefront some key questions about the incident: . What did the NFL know, and when? The video is shocking and damning. It shows Rice and Palmer inside the elevator, where he punches her, and she lunges at the football player. Rice hits his fiancee again, and she falls to the floor. The Ravens had stood by Rice throughout the fallout, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell did not alter the two-game suspension, even after admitting he made a mistake. Both the league and the team changed their tune swiftly after this video was released. To the disbelief of many, the NFL said it had not seen the surveillance footage of inside the elevator until TMZ Sports posted it on the internet. ""We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including any video that may exist,"" NFL Vice President of Corporate Communications Brian McCarthy, said, specifically citing New Jersey State Police, Atlantic City police and Atlantic County prosecutor's office as places where the NFL inquired. ""That video was not made available to us and no one in our office saw it until (Monday),"" he said in a statement. Revel Entertainment Group, which owns the casino where the incident happened, said it gave copies of the video to Atlantic City police, the prosecutor's office, the Division of Gaming Enforcement and Rice's attorney. The company said it could not confirm if the NFL reached out to the casino directly to ask for the surveillance tape. The prosecutor's office and Atlantic City Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN inquiries about the evidence they had, or any requests from the NFL. NFL chief Goodell faces intense criticism after Rice video . Will Rice go to jail? After the incident, both Rice and Palmer were arrested and charged with simple assault. In March, a grand jury indicted Rice on the more serious charge of aggravated assault, a felony that could bring 3-5 years in jail if convicted. The next day, he and Palmer were married. While the casino said that prosecutors were given the video of inside the elevator, prosecutors have not confirmed whether it was shown to the grand jury. Rice pleaded not guilty, and the next step would have been a criminal trial. But instead, Rice was accepted into a pretrial intervention program for first-time offenders that could clear him of the charges if he successfully completes the requirements. ""This decision was arrived at after careful consideration of the information contained in Mr. Rice's application in light of all of the facts gathered during the investigation,"" acting Atlantic County Prosecutor Jim McClain told local media at the time. ""After considering all relevant information in light of applicable law, it was determined that this was the appropriate disposition."" The elevator video has renewed outrage, but the court says the prosecutor cannot reconsider or ask the judge to revoke the deal with Rice unless he commits a new crime or doesn't follow along in the program. ""There's really no appeal that's available at this point,"" CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan said. ""The prosecutor accepted and the judge accepted pretrial intervention."" It is rare to offer pretrial intervention in domestic violence cases, Callan said, but in Atlantic City -- with an elevated homicide rate -- this incident probably was not as big a priority. Ray Rice firing not enough, says senator who wants 'special scrutiny' of NFL . How has the narrative changed? The story itself hasn't changed. The fact that Rice struck and knocked out his fiancee was undisputed from the beginning. So why all the outrage now? The bad taste in many people's mouths comes from the way the incident has been described to the public by the parties involved. As more details emerged, culminating with the elevator video, the louder the accusations of an attempted coverup have become. immediately after the incident, Rice's attorney described the situation at the time as ""a very minor physical altercation."" After those statements, an initial video was released by TMZ, which showed the outside of the elevator, and the unconscious body of Palmer. When the grand jury decided to indict Rice on the more serious felony charge, Rice's attorney, Michael Diamondstein, had this to say as he entered a not-guilty plea: ""I can't try the case in the media. There's a significant set of facts that the public doesn't know about yet. As soon as those facts come to light, we believe the public will have a different opinion."" Palmer's lawyer also downplayed the incident. ""No party committed any crime,"" Palmer's lawyer, Robert Gamburg, told CNN at the time. ""This is part of the due process for Ray,"" Baltimore Ravens Director of Media Relations Chad Steele said Thursday of the indictment. ""We know there is more to Ray Rice than this one incident."" With the release of the latest video, many in the public certainly expressed a new opinion, but hardly in favor of Rice. Ray Rice video prompts stories of #WhyIStayed, #WhyILeft . What will become of the Rices? The couple is standing by each other. Janay Rice on Tuesday expressed outrage, too. Not at her husband, but at everyone making a big deal of her ordeal. ""No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family,"" Janay Rice wrote in an online post. ""To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing."" According to Janay Rice, waking up after her husband was cut from his team and suspended from the NFL was a nightmare. ""THIS IS OUR LIFE! What don't you all get,"" Janay Rice wrote. ""If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take all happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is!"" Ray Rice told CNN's Rachel Nichols, in a text message, that ""I'm just holding strong for my wife and kid that's all I can do right now.""

"(CNN) -- Gen. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a bespectacled college professor turned soldier in the defense of the Union, often returned to Gettysburg, that legendary battlefield where on a grim and terrible July day in 1863, Chamberlain and his regiment, the 20th Maine, held the extreme left flank of the Union army against an attack by near overwhelming odds, launched by equally gallant troops from Alabama. Chamberlain's regiment held the line. As the years passed, the Medal of Honor recipient would go back to Gettysburg with comrades to contemplate and to pray. He came to call that hallowed ground the ""Vision Place of Souls."" He wrote that where great deeds were accomplished, a ""spirit"" of greatness lingered. What would he and his comrades, and those who faced them beneath that hot July sun say to us today? For our ""Vision Place of Souls,"" are now off limits, forbidden lands, ""Verboten"" to all.

In what is described as a government shutdown, the Beltway around Washington is still jammed with the commuters to federal offices, White House and congressional staffers continue to work, but by a highly selective process, our national memorials to the living and fallen who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam are closed. Few veterans have the means to travel to remote islands of the Pacific, the beaches of Normandy, the woods of the Hurtgen and Bastogne to visit but one more time their ""Vision Place,"" where with family and comrades they can say, ""Here I fought,"" or say, ""Here is where my friend Charlie -- remember my telling you about him? -- here is where he died."" For them, the monuments have become their 'Vision Place,"" their gathering place, the place of remembrance, of pride, and of tears. To selectively close off such places is nothing less than vindictive, a national disgrace that We the People have allowed to continue for more than a week after its implementation. But far more egregious has been the closing of our military cemeteries overseas. England, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, in remembrance of the supreme sacrifice made by so many Americans, deeded to us in perpetuity the land where tens of thousands now rest beneath crosses and stars of David, row upon row. Those few acres are, forever, the soil, the very soul of America. It is fashionable for some to view current European politics and policies with disdain. But when it comes to the sacrifice in blood we gave for their freedom, believe me, there is still utmost respect on their part. When I travel there with veterans, they are greeted with respect, warmth, handshakes, embraces and tears. While we appear to have forgotten, they have not. I have traveled twice to Omaha Beach with a veteran of that assault. Most of you who read this have seen the movie ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the opening scene when Ryan, now an old man, walks into the cemetery and stops at the grave of his comrade and all but collapses. I have been there, I have seen that for real. I personally call the pathway from the parking lot, to where the walkway turns and suddenly you behold the thousands upon thousands of graves, the ""place of tears."" I call it that for the reaction of nearly all is the same. A slowing of pace as they turn the corner of the pathway and behold the cemetery for the first time. Nearly all stop for a moment, and so many (myself included) begin to weep. I will never forget my elderly friend, after checking into a small office to find the resting place of a friend amid all those thousands of graves, stoically pressed on until he found the grave he was looking for, and then the tears flowed. Now that place is off-limits to veterans, to families looking for the resting place of a loved one, for so many of us who just felt a heart driven need to come and offer our respect and thanks, we are barricaded off, denied, almost as if it is still enemy-occupied territory. A few acres of hallowed ground of American, that our own government now forbids us to visit. This is no longer a fight about a budget, about ""Obamacare,"" about the intransigence of a few in Congress, and I state that regardless of whom you might blame. This is about arrogance, about heartless disregard. It is about a shameful display of self-aggrandizing power that shouts ""I forbid,"" and We the People, descendants of our Revolutionary forefathers are expected to obey with heads bowed and turn away in obedience. The Constitution of the United States empowers the president to serve as commander-in-chief of our armed services. Mr. President, you have the power to take down the barricades to our ""Vision Place of Souls."" I challenge you, Mr. President, that there is a simple alternative to what is now transpiring. Detail but a few hundred military police to stand guard instead. There is not a man or woman in uniform who would not volunteer for such service, for the honor to stand watch over their comrades. Mr. President, tear down the barricades of dishonor. Let serving members of our military stand watch instead. Denying We the People our ""Vision Place of Souls"" is an act of dishonor that will not be forgotten ... or forgiven. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Forstchen.","William Forstchen: There's no excuse for closing military memorials .

"(CNN) -- The 911 tape is frightening. ""Help me, please. Please, help me. He's beating on me,"" a woman tells the dispatcher, followed by ""I hate you. I hate you."" ""I hate you, too,"" a man's voice can be heard in response. ""She says that she's in a domestic fight, and I can hear him hitting her now,"" the initial dispatcher tells the ambulance dispatcher. This is not an exchange involving a pro football player and his girlfriend. The woman on the call is Kelli Fuller. The male attacker is her husband, Mark Fuller, a U.S. district judge for the Middle District of Alabama. On a Saturday night at the Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta, Kelli Fuller called the police for help from a hotel room. The Fullers both admit to an altercation while blaming each other for the incident, according to a police report. If the NFL's pathetic handling of the domestic violence charges involving Ray Rice and Greg Hardy makes you angry, then you're going to blow a fuse over Fuller. He is poised not only to have this horrific scene expunged from his record but to return to the bench. The only body that can remove him is Congress, and no significant steps in that direction have been taken. Instead, a bipartisan group of 16 female senators sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that read in part, ""if you violently assault a woman, you shouldn't get a second chance to play football in the NFL."" Wait, it gets better. Twelve House Democrats who sit on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Goodell that marked the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act and included this gem: . ""Given the important role the NFL and the other major professional sports leagues can play in shaping public perceptions concerning domestic violence, it would appear to be in the public interest to have the highest level of transparency associated with reviews of potential misconduct."" So while members of Congress insist that an organization it has no authority over should permanently remove perpetrators of domestic violence, they have not taken a similar public stance regarding the domestic violence perpetrator whom they actually can do something about. Opinion: Wife-beating is not a private matter . In addition to writing letters to a pro sports team, the House has the power to impeach a federal judge who has done wrong. The Senate can try such cases. I guess jumping on a public outrage bandwagon is easier. No wonder more than 60% of the country believes this is the worst Congress ever. For the public to be fixated on the NFL's problem is justifiable considering the popularity of the league and the graphic video depicting Rice punching his then-fiancee in a casino elevator. Stories involving federal judges are not that popular. But lawmakers are not supposed to jump on the bandwagon; they are supposed to take the lead. Sending strongly worded letters to the NFL is not taking up a strong stance against domestic violence; it's a lazy publicity grab. If the 113th Congress -- particularly those members so concerned about the ""War on Women"" -- truly wanted to lead on this issue, it would roll up its sleeves and remove the man who allegedly pulled his wife's hair, threw her on the ground, dragged her, kicked her and struck her multiple times in the face. Police said that when Kelli Fuller opened the door, she had cuts on her mouth and forehead. When they entered the room, they found broken glass and hair on the floor, blood in the bathroom. It reeked of alcohol. The man involved is not a big-time NFL player, but does he have to be? The night of the attack is not accompanied with a TMZ video, but do we really need one? The public may not even notice his removal, but does that really matter? In sending two letters to the NFL regarding domestic violence, Congress has stated it expects a high bar to be set for professional athletes. Why should Congress' bar be lower for public officials whose job is to defend the law of the land? In other words, if Ray Rice should be banned from the NFL for life, then why not Mark Fuller from the U.S. District Court? Now, granted, removing a federal judge is not easy. Since 1803, only 15 have been impeached, and acquittals were granted in four of those cases. Three others resigned. It is a daunting task. But so is seriously addressing the cancer that is domestic violence. Anyone who looks at the Rice video can point a finger at him and the league. That's easy. And those members of Congress who signed those letters and have not had a conversation about Fuller's removal should be ashamed of themselves. Though, judging from polling numbers, that's one of many things this Congress should be ashamed of.","U.S. District Court Judge Mark Fuller allegedly attacked his wife in a domestic fight .

"(CNN) -- While tinkering in his garage, French electrician Andre Cassagnes dreamed up a drawing toy that kids could shake up and start over. Little did he know that more than 50 years later, the toy that became the Etch A Sketch would continue to delight children. Cassagnes died January 16 in a Paris suburb at age 86, according to a statement released Saturday by The Ohio Art Company. His cause of his death was not disclosed. Cassagnes created what would become the Etch A Sketch in his garage in 1950. The drawing toy was made up of a joystick, glass and aluminum powder. Initially dubbed the Telecran, the toy was renamed L'Ecran Magique, or 'The Magic Screen,' and made its debut at a toy fair in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1959. Fascinated by the invention, American Henry Winzeler, founder and president of The Ohio Art Company, licensed L'Ecran Magique for $25,000 and introduced it as Etch A Sketch in the United States in 1960. Winzeler connected Cassagnes with Jerry Burger, an engineer at the company, so they could collaborate to improve the toy's drawing capability. Among the changes made to the Etch A Sketch in 1960 was replacing the joystick with two white knobs in the left and right corners of the screen. The idea was to make the toy look like the hot new adult toy of the time: a television. It quickly became the most popular selling toy during the Christmas season that year, according to the manufacturer. Since then, the company has sold more than 150 million of them. A mainstay in popular culture . The toy has remained a mainstay in popular culture thanks in part to appearances in 1995's ""Toy Story"" movie and the 1999 sequel, ""Toy Story 2."" The toy was thrust into the political spotlight during last year during a highly publicized gaffe by Mitt Romney's senior campaign adviser, who compared his candidate's positions to an Etch A Sketch. ""I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes,"" the aide said. ""It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again."""" The Ohio Art Company seized on the publicity, manufacturing red and blue Etch A Sketches during the campaign season. The toy's ""magic screen"" was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1998, and it was added by the Toy Industry Association to its ""Century of Toys"" list in 2003. ""I remember making works of art of the Etch A Sketch as a child, in hindsight -- realizing that they were merely poorly drawn stick figures,"" said Larry Killgallon, the current president of The Ohio Art Company. ""Nonetheless, I, as well as many others, owe thanks to Mr. Cassagnes for a toy embedded in so many of my childhood memories."" Cassanges went on to become a well-known kite-maker, developing a series of ring-shaped kites to celebrate the Olympic Games. He is survived by his wife, Renee. Readers react . The news of the death prompted many to go to their basements and dig out their decades-old Etch A Sketch. CNN reader Lawrence Garcia said it was a toy ""I could always get lost in."" ""I would lay there on the floor in amazement of the device and wonder what it was made of,"" Garcia said. ""Remember, this was back in the day of true wonderment, and since we didn't really have a way to get instant info, we just made up whatever our minds could create."" Jane Labowitch, a 21-year-old art student in Chicago, said she has played with an Etch A Sketch since she was 4 years old. ""I love doing all kinds of art, but there is something really unique to Etch A Sketch,"" she said. ""It's one of those timeless toys that everyone seems to have some sort of nostalgic connection to."" So it was fitting that Labowitch would remember Cassagnes with an Etch A Sketch of him. ""I owe so much to this man,"" she said in a submission to CNN's iReport. ""He's responsible for countless hours of joy and opening doors in my life that I never knew existed.""

"(CNN) -- Flight-phobics, relax -- a list of the world's safest airlines has just been released. Top of the ranking from AirlineRatings.com of the safest carriers in 2013 is the Australian airline Qantas. Awarding it a full seven stars, the website cites the airline's fatality-free flying record from the beginning of the jet era in the early 1950s. Other airlines sharing the seven-star rating and winning a place among the top 10 safest airlines are, in alphabetical order, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Eva Air, Royal Jordanian, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. Safest industries . Commercial aviation is one of the most heavily monitored industries in the world and statistically the much-cited comparison bears out: you are much less likely to die in an airplane crash than in a car accident. Indeed, the number of fatalities last year was at a record low, according to the Aviation Safety Network (ASN). Many airlines go for years without experiencing significant safety incidents, let alone a crash. There is thus often little to distinguish the largest and most reliable carriers apart from a safety point of view. Of the 448 airlines AirlineRatings.com surveys, 137 have a top seven-star rating. Along with fatality crash records and audits from aviation governing bodies, the website takes into account the quality of the ""in-flight product"" airlines offer -- including in-flight entertainment, seating and food -- to determine their ranking. Concentrate on the movie . Nonetheless, it's useful know some of the airlines to consider booking if you'd prefer to concentrate on the inflight movie rather than rejigging your last will and testament in your head. Probably not among them, however, is Scat, the unfortunately named Kazakh airline that shares a one-star ranking with the Afghan Kam Air and the Surinamese Bluewing Airlines. All are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the EU. Quite what the one star is for isn't revealed -- perhaps just getting off the ground. It's certainly not for brand name development in the case of Scat. Of the carriers awarded two stars, three are from Indonesia and one each from Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Eritrea and Myanmar. The United States doesn't blacklist individual airlines, but it does make public a list of countries, including Indonesia, that it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards. Record year . Dubious names and rankings aside, nervous flyers should be breathing easier. Last year was the safest for flying since 1945, with 269 deaths from 29 accidents, the ASN records. That compares with a far higher 10-year average of 719 fatalities and 32 accidents annually (involving planes with a minimum passenger capacity of 14). ""The average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline,"" said the ASN president, Harro Ranter, ""probably for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organizations."" However, the picture is uneven worldwide. With one-fifth of all fatal airliner accidents but only around 3% of global aircraft departures, Africa remains the least safe continent for flying. Yet the worst accident last year was in Russia. A Tatarstan Airlines Boeing 737 from Moscow to Kazan crashed and exploded into flames on landing on November 17, killing all 44 passengers and six crew aboard. The Russian carrier receives only four stars from AirlineRatings.com because of its failure to complete the ""critical"" International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit. Airlines that have completed the audit have a 77% better safety record than those that haven't, the website reports.","Qantas tops list of safest airlines .

"(CNN) -- The recent NATO summit in Newport, Wales was initially meant to prepare the alliance for the post-Afghanistan era and pooling of resources at the time of defense cuts, known in NATO lingua as ""smart defense."" However, as often happens, the summit agenda was hijacked by more current and dramatic developments: the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Russia's push into Ukraine. Both these developments have reminded NATO that its core business -- the defense of its member states -- needs to be returned to the center of the alliance's agenda. Russia's annexation of Crimea and continued push into the south-east of Ukraine -- a NATO partner country -- has inevitably provoked fear amongst Ukraine's neighbors, all of whom have relatively fresh memories of Russian domination. These countries -- Poland and the Baltic states in particular -- made sure that the Ukrainian crisis would be at the center of the Newport agenda. This happened in two ways. The Central East European allies asked for measures that would reassure them by confirming NATO's engagement in the face of Russian aggression. In addition, the show of solidarity with Ukraine became a major focus of the summit, which was attended by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The outcome of the Newport summit has met these allies' expectations, at best, halfway. The biggest change came in the rhetoric and positioning of the alliance's key members. Until very recently, NATO has prioritized its partnership with Russia, taking great care not to offend it. When in 1997 the Alliance started the process of taking in new members from Central and Eastern Europe, it mollified Moscow by setting up a separate Russia Council and signing a partnership agreement that excluded the presence of a major Western force in new member states. Russia's actions in Ukraine have made the pretense of partnership ridiculous and as much was acknowledged by NATO states in Newport. On his way to the summit, U.S. President Barack Obama paid a visit to Estonia where he delivered a Reaganesque speech pledging full solidarity with the Baltic states. Meantime German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine and reasserted the viability of NATO's collective defense measures. Overall, the rhetoric of partnership with Russia -- which has dominated past meetings -- disappeared in Newport where it was replaced by the rhetoric of facing-up to an adversarial Russia. However, whilst NATO leaders were strong in words, the decisions they took in response to the Russian threat were at best modest. At the height of crisis during the Cold War the U.S. presence in Western Europe reached more than 277,000 troops. By comparison the U.S. said earlier this month that it had 57,000 active service members in Europe. Of these only a very small number are based in Poland and the Baltic States. Decisions taken in Newport have not changing these facts in a meaningful way. Whilst NATO announced a creation of a spearhead force, consisting of a Rapid Reaction Force, frequent exercises and logistical centers, this initiative will not change the strategic balance in Central and Eastern Europe. The units contributing to the rapid-reaction force will remain within the states that designate them, meaning their availability will be subject to political approval. The exercises that would bring together U.S. and European troops are meant to be frequent or even ""persistent"" but their scope will remain small. The logistical centers that are meant to be based in Poland and the Baltic states are perhaps the most concrete of the approved measures. If developed they would commence integrating Central and Eastern Europe into the NATO infrastructure. Overall, the reassurance measures for Central and Eastern Europe are not game-changers, but they are going in the right direction and could suggest a beginning of rebalancing of the current vastly unequal situation in the region. However, as far as Ukraine itself is concerned the summit offered Kiev close to nothing. The announcement that NATO would spend 15 million euros ($19M) on military aid to Ukraine did not impress the Ukrainians nor the Russians. NATO's decision to allow individual members of the alliance to sell arms to Ukraine has not changed anything, not least because since then a number of states have rushed to deny they intended to sell anything to Ukraine whilst the unstable situation there continues. In other words, after the summit Ukraine continues to be on its own vis-a-vis belligerent Russia. NATO's failure to send a clear signal to Russia by supporting Ukraine represents in itself a grave threat to the alliance's Central East European members -- who may be next on the list of potential Russian targets.","A NATO summit in Wales last week took place amid crises in Iraq and Ukraine .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a bellwether election of sorts. Gun-control Democrats in Virginia running for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general all won despite poor reviews from the National Rifle Association, a politically powerful organization headquartered in the state. ""I don't care what grade I got from the NRA,"" Terry McAuliffe said in the gubernatorial campaign's final debate. He received an ""F"" from the group, which is holding its annual conference in Indianapolis starting on Friday. Gun-control advocates cheered when the three Democrats prevailed. The gun-rights lobby soldiered on. Although McAuliffe's first effort at tougher gun laws in Virginia was thwarted in the legislature not long after he took office, it illustrated where the battles are being fought now that the issue has effectively moved from Washington, where the Senate a year ago failed to advance new measures following the horrendous Newtown school massacre in Connecticut. Battlegrounds in the states . Gun-control and gun-rights forces are now squaring off in the states and their efforts are funded by backers who are pouring millions into the fray. ""It's mixed in many ways,"" economist and pro-gun advocate John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said of the nation's newest slate of gun laws. ""Obviously, there's some states that have been pushing for more gun control and others are moving in the other direction."" According to an analysis conducted for CNN by the National Conference of State Legislatures, states have enacted more than 40 new gun laws since the start of the year. Roughly half are those considered by such gun-control groups as the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence as having ""minimal impact"" on existing law. They include provisions in a measure passed by the Democrat-controlled Colorado legislature allowing people, under certain circumstances, to renew their concealed handgun permits in a county different from the one in which the gun was originally registered. Gun-law reform in Colorado also was a closely-watched topic when tough new restrictions on expanded background checks on private sales and limits on ammunition magazines were signed into law. Several Democratic state lawmakers were recalled over their votes. Guns and mental health . The crop of state laws also includes measures that touch on issues debated passionately on the national scene. The Republican-controlled South Dakota state legislature passed a measure requiring that mental health records of ""someone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity"" be sent to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Statistics from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) show about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check over the past 14 years, or 10,180 people, were turned down for reasons related to mental health. Questions of mental health and gun ownership again made headlines this month when a soldier opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, killing three and wounding more than a dozen others before taking his own life. Authorities say Spc. Ivan Lopez was an Iraq war veteran under evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder. It's not clear if the second shooting of its kind on the sprawling military base will lead to changes in law. This week, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed legislation -- known by critics as the ""guns everywhere bill"" -- that allows residents who have concealed carry permits to take guns into some bars, churches, school zones, government buildings and certain parts of airports. New money, old fight . Shifts in direction are due in part to the influence of big money and organization. ""For many years, the gun lobby has had an advantage both in terms of funding and a well-organized and committed grassroots which it has used to hold back efforts to strengthen gun laws that are supported by the vast majority of Americans, including the vast majority of gun owners,"" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""For years, politicians felt that there was more to lose than to gain by supporting much-needed reforms to keep guns from dangerous people."" This month, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged $50 million to try to combat what he and other gun-control advocates see as the NRA's outsized political influence. NRA gathers as gun debate cools, shifts focus . His new group, Everytown for Gun Safety â€” an umbrella organization for his other groups: Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America â€” plans to borrow from the NRA playbook. Bloomberg's group hopes to build strong grassroots support, motivate membership and lobby effectively. But gun-control advocates say the playing field won't even out overnight. ""I think that at the federal level, it's going to take time,"" said Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The NRA and their allies have spent time entrenching themselves in Washington and it's going to take our national leaders time to recognize there are other players now."" For its part, the NRA says it is not backing down. ""The fight continues,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. ""It's not something that is over as the gun-control lobby and Mike Bloomberg have shown they lie in wait for the next tragedy to occur to try and push their agenda."" Quietly studying the issue . Quietly, the White House is preparing to fund gun violence prevention studies in some cases for the first time in nearly two decades. The effort, critics say, amounts to a politically-motivated use of taxpayer funds. ""We're seeing that money abused to promote politics and a gun-control agenda,"" Arulanandam said. The National Institute of Health previously announced it would award grants this fall. ""NIH has and will continue to fund research to inform prevention programs related to firearm violence,"" agency spokeswoman Renate Myles said. ""Studies designed to develop and evaluate firearm injury prevention activities are part of larger efforts to develop more effective public health education programs. ""This includes research about parental roles in preventing injury - including injuries from firearms - in the home and in other settings. NIH also supports research to understand the relationship between alcohol abuse and gun violence, as part of broader efforts to develop more effective interventions to help prevent violence,"" Myles said. Separately, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have vowed to block President Barack Obama's proposal to try to secure $10 million in federal funding to scientifically study gun violence through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has not received money to study the topic since the mid-1990s after the NRA lobbied to nix that type of funding following the agency's controversial study that found gun owners' homes had higher homicide rates. CNN's Kevin Bohn, Ben Brumfield, Leigh Ann Caldwell, Ed Payne and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report .","The fight over gun law reform is being waged in the statehouses and through well-funded lobbying .

"(RollingStone.com) -- U2 surprised the world Tuesday by releasing ""Songs of Innocence,"" their first album in five years, as a gift from Apple. It was available for free immediately to anyone with iTunes. The band made the announcement with Apple CEO Tim Cook at a Cupertino press conference for the new iPhone 6, capping the event with a performance of the album's first single, ""The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)."" After a standing ovation, Cook said, ""Wasn't that the most incredible single you ever heard? We would love a whole album of that."" Catch up on the Apple launch: The live blog . ""The question is now, how do we get it to as many people as possible, because that's what our band is all about,"" Bono said. ""I do believe you have over half a billion subscribers to iTunes, so -- could you get this to them?"" ""If we gave it away for free,"" Cook replied. And five seconds later, the album was unleashed in the largest album release of all time. ""We wanted to make a very personal album,"" Bono told Rolling Stone's Gus Wenner the day before the press conference in an exclusive interview. ""Let's try to figure out why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys â€” first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually. And that's hard. But we went there."" The band worked on ""Innocence"" for two years with producer Danger Mouse (a.k.a. Brian Burton), then brought in additional help: Flood, their collaborator since 1987's ""The Joshua Tree,"" plus Adele producers Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder. ""I think having them around really helped,"" Bono said. ""Some of the music out there now that people call pop, it's not pop -- it's just truly great. And we wanted to have the discipline of the Beatles or the Stones in the '60s, when you had real songs. There's nowhere to hide in them: clear thoughts, clear melodies."" Innovative album releases that shook the music industry . To begin, the band went back to its roots. Bono said the group listened to the music they loved in the '70s, from punk rock to Bowie, glam rock, early electronica and Joy Division. The album kicks off with ""The Miracle (of Joey Ramone),"" a loping pop song laced with distinctly punk-ish power chords. ""I found my voice through Joey Ramone because I wasn't the obvious punk-rock singer, or even rock singer,"" Bono said. ""I sang like a girl -- which I'm into now, but when I was 17 or 18, I wasn't sure. And I heard Joey Ramone, who sang like a girl, and that was my way in."" The driving, reggae-tinged ""This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now"" is a tribute to the Clash, with slinky guitars from the Edge that nod to Sandinista!. ""After we saw the Clash, it was a sort of blueprint for U2,"" Bono said. ""We knew we couldn't possibly hope to be as cool, and that's proven to be true, but we did think we could get behind a sort of social justice agenda."" There is also an intensely personal song about Bono's mother, Iris Hewson, who died when he was 14. ""Forty years ago, my mother fell at her own father's funeral, and I never spoke with her again,"" he says. ""Rage always follows grief, and I had a lot of it, and I still have, but I channeled it into music and I still do. I have very few memories of my mother, and I put a few of them in a song called 'Iris.'"" U2's 'Songs of Innocence': A track-by-track guide . The most joyous track on ""Songs of Innocence"" is ""California (There Is No End to Love),"" which unexpectedly nods to the Beach Boys in its intro. ""It's like the sun itself,"" Bono said. ""It's about our first trip to Los Angeles."" The darkest track, meanwhile, is ""Raised by Wolves,"" which tells of a deadly car bombing in Dublin. ""It was a real incident that happened in our country where three car bombs were set to go off at the same time in Dublin on a Friday night, 5:30,"" the artist said. ""On any other Friday I would have been at this record shop, just down the corner, but I cycled to school that day."" At times, ""Songs of Innocence"" feels almost like a concept album about Bono's early years -- there's even a track named after the street where the singer grew up, ""Cedarwood Road."" ""It has a lyrical cohesion that I think is unique amongst U2 albums,"" Bono said. ""I don't want it to be a concept album, but the songs come from a place. Edge laughed and said this is our 'Quadrophenia.' We could be so lucky."" See the original story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden's leaks of classified intelligence already have him being compared to Daniel Ellsworth of the Pentagon Papers and Bradley Manning of the WikiLeaks fame. Snowden felt compelled to leak valuable documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. The 29-year-old was willing to give up his $200,000 job, girlfriend, home in Hawaii and his family. He boldly pronounced, ""I'm willing to sacrifice all of that because I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building."" The uproar over the recent revelations about government surveillance programs has raised eyebrows and concerns across the political spectrum. Many on the left have been surprised that most of the same policies (now even the surveillance of U.S. citizens and phone companies) that President George W. Bush initiated, are being used, and expanded upon, by the Obama administration. Many on the right say it is government overreach and that Congress should have been briefed on the broad programs. Although the cause for alarm in political or policy circles might have merit, the exercise of these authorities by the executive branch does, in fact, appear to be legal. Once again, the war on al Qaeda is pitting national security against America's longstanding commitment to the promotion of civil liberties and human rights. Opinion: Edward Snowden is a hero . The current threat by al Qaeda and jihadists is one that requires aggressive intelligence collection and efforts. One has to look no further than the disruption of the New York City subway bombers (the one being touted by DNI Clapper) or the Boston Marathon bombers to know that the war on al Qaeda is coming home to us, to our citizens, to our students, to our streets and our subways. This 21st century war is different and requires new ways and methods of gathering information. As technology has increased, so has our ability to gather valuable, often actionable, intelligence. However, the move toward ""home-grown"" terror will necessarily require, by accident or purposefully, collections of U.S. citizens' conversations with potential overseas persons of interest. An open society, such as the United States, ironically needs to use this technology to protect itself. This truth is naturally uncomfortable for a country with a Constitution that prevents the federal government from conducting ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" American historical resistance towards such activities is a bedrock of our laws, policies and police procedures. But what might have been reasonable 10 years ago is not the same any longer. The constant armed struggle against the jihadists has adjusted our beliefs on what we think our government can, and must, do in order to protect its citizens. However, when we hear of programs such PRISM, or the Department of Justice getting phone records of scores of citizens without any signs of suspicious activities nor indications of probable cause that they might be involved in terrorist related activities, the American demand for privacy naturally emerges to challenge such ""trolling"" measures or data-mining. The executive branch, although particularly powerful in this arena, must ensure the Congress is kept abreast of activities such as these surveillance programs. The need for enhanced intelligence activities is a necessary part of the war on al Qaeda, but abuse can occur without ensuring the legislative branch has awareness of aggressive tactics such as these. Our Founding Fathers, aware of the need to have an energetic, vibrant executive branch in foreign affairs, still anticipated checks upon the presidency by the legislature. Working together, the two branches can ensure that both legally, and by policy, this is what the citizens desire of their government -- and that leaks such as Snowden's won't have the impact and damage that his leaks are likely to cause. As for Snowden, regardless of how any of us feel about the national security surveillance programs at issue, he must be extradited back to the U.S. for interviews and potential trial -- if for no other reason than to deter others from feeling emboldened to break the law in the same way in the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Glenn Sulmasy.","Edward Snowden leaked classified intelligence about government surveillance .

"(CNN) -- Beloved photo app Instagram turned 3 years old on Monday. In tech startup years, that's the equivalent of becoming a teenager. Like most teens, it seems it's time for Instagram to start pulling some of its own weight and earning money. Last week, the company announced it will begin dropping ads into photo streams in the United States. The advertisements will roll out gradually sometime in the next two months. Some people are upset about the commercialization of their favorite free Internet service. But either because it's difficult to complain in the form of desaturated photos, or because the announcement has been expected for quite some time, the outrage is muted. People have become used to free online services adding ads. The shock of Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr's ""selling-out"" by adding advertising have trained people to expect some sort of business plan to pop up eventually. If successful, ads could be quite a lucrative plan. Instagram could be pulling in more than $400 million annually from ads three to four years from now, according to Arvind Bhatia, an analyst at Sterne Agee. Facebook purchased Instagram a year ago for around $700 million in stock. At the time, some critics said the cost was too high for a company not yet making money. ""In hindsight, the Instagram acquisition was brilliant,"" said Bhatia. ""In today's market, if Instagram was still independent, they would have to pay much more for it."" Instagram will have to tread lightly with its ads. The mobile-based photo-sharing service has seen explosive growth in recent years and now has 150 million people checking in at least monthly. Still, there are plenty of eager new social apps ready to pick up any dissatisfied customers. ""These companies have to really worry about the user experience. Once you lose the user base you won't get any revenue from advertisers,"" said Bhatia. Instagram has experienced push-back from its audience before. Nine months ago, it updated its privacy policy and terms of service to include some new language that mentioned advertising. There was outrage and confusion over whether users' photos could appear in ads without permission. The company had to dial back the language and issue a clarifying follow-up post. Quality and volume of ads will be key to avoiding another uprising. Instagram is easing its audience into the new reality with some very lovely descriptions of what it will feel like to experience an ad on Instagram. People will see a handful of ""beautiful, high-quality photos and videos from a handful of brands that are already great members of the Instagram community,"" the company said in a blog post announcing the ads. Though they haven't been able to buy ads on Instagram, many brands, including Burberry, Nike and Starbucks, already use it extensively as a marketing tool. The quality of Instagram ads will likely be higher than what fills Facebook. The clip-art awfulness of many Facebook ads makes them easy to spot and dismiss. Ideally, Instagram ads will require advertisers to submit high-quality photos and videos that blend into the regular flow of sunset, baby, food and vacation photos in a stream. One out-of-place ""One weird trick"" weight-loss ad with cartoon art would be jarring. ""Our aim is to make any advertisements you see feel as natural to Instagram as the photos and videos many of you already enjoy from your favorite brands,"" said the post. You can already feel the warm glow of a gently served advertisement washing over you.","Instagram is turning 3 years old and introducing ads to its free service .
The company plans to roll out ads slowly in the U.S. over the next two months .
To avoid alienating users, the service will have to control the quality and amount of ads ."
"Beijing, China (CNN) -- About five to six men, armed with knives and cleavers, rushed into a college dormitory in southern China on Wednesday, wounding nine students -- one of them seriously, state media said. The pre-dawn incident is the latest in a series of knife attacks in the country in recent weeks. The men burst into a dormitory at the Hainan Institute of Science and Technology in Hainan province and hacked away at anyone they came across, the China News Network said. One student had his hand cut off, while eight others suffered varying degrees of injuries, the news agency said. The attack differed slightly from other recent attacks in that the victims were college students. Last week, a man was sentenced to death for attacking 29 kindergarten students and three teachers with a knife April 29, according to state media. Also last week, a man with a kitchen cleaver hacked seven kindergarten students and a teacher to death at a school in northwest China before returning home and committing suicide, state media reported. CNN's Jo Kent and Helena Hong contributed to this report.","About five to six men armed with knives and cleavers wound nine students .

"(CNN) -- Everything you thought you knew about Rosie Perez as the feisty and candid Puerto Rican actress will quickly dissipate after reading her recently released memoir ""Handbook for an Unpredictable Life: How I Survived Sister Renata and My Crazy Mother, and Still Came Out Smiling (With Great Hair)."" ""People make me out to be this super strong woman, but I have my tough days just like anyone else,"" Perez said in an interview with CNN. She opened up about surviving physical, mental and sexual abuse, how she successfully navigated the entertainment industry without sacrificing herself and finally reached a place of compassion toward her abusers. Here are nine things you might not know about the actress. 1. Rosie Perez wasn't raised by her parents . Her parents, Lydia Perez and Ismael Serrano, were both married to others when they met. Her father later told Rosie he couldn't help himself: He was drawn to her mother. ""It wasn't clear if (Lydia) knew that Ismael was married or not. He never really kept it a secret, but then again, he wasn't the first to volunteer that information either,"" Perez wrote. Perez was raised primarily in a Catholic children's home in New York, with regular visits to her mother and aunt. Her father tried to get custody of Perez while she was in the home, but was not successful. Her paternal aunt, Ana Dominga Otero Serrano-Roque, loved Perez unconditionally. ""I didn't include this in the book but once, when work was slow and money was tight, my aunt cut up some Slim Jim's -- she worked at the factory in Brooklyn -- and put it in the rice as meat for dinner. We looked at each other and I could tell she was embarrassed but just then she said, 'He, he, he' and we started laughing so hard,"" Perez told CNN. ""That same day, one of the neighbors came over to eat, as they often did, and she cut that portion in half and gave it to them. As you kid, you watch it, nothing has to be said. Her actions spoke volumes,"" Perez added. When she was older, Perez was invited to visit her mother in Brooklyn, but says she was always treated like ""the other."" Perez's hair, weight and resemblance to her father made her a target for teasing. 2. Perez earned an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for her role in ""Fearless"" The Brooklyn-native is perhaps best known for her role in Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" or starring alongside Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in ""White Men Can't Jump."" But few are aware of her two nominations for best supporting actress as plane crash survivor Carla Rodrigo in ""Fearless."" ""I knew deep inside that I could play this part with ease. I understood loss, depression, betrayal and how to pull yourself back together,"" Perez wrote of her character, who struggles with survivor's guilt but finds solace with another survivor Max, played by Jeff Bridges. After landing the part, she tried to quit, scared to explore the character's vulnerability. But when director Peter Weir tapped into her issues with success, she realized she felt guilty about making it out of the ward of the state system. She ended up living with her aunt instead of her mother and reconnected with her father. Weir insisted on not hiring anyone else and reassured her it was going to be great. 3. Perez is a three-time Emmy-nominated choreographer . Perez became a choreographer almost overnight after being offered a gig by A&R executive Louil Silas Jr. to teach his then-new artist, Bobby Brown, hip-hop moves for music videos ""Don't Be Cruel"" and ""My Prerogative."" That led to working with Diana Ross, Heavy D & The Boyz and LL Cool J. Those skills caught the eye of Keenen Ivory Wayans, who helped her land a gig as the choreographer for the Fly Girls on ""In Living Color."" That's where she was nominated for her first Emmy for choreography. She later earned two more Emmy nominations. 4. Perez was discovered by ""Soul Train"" and Spike Lee while dancing in clubs . She got her start dancing after being spotted dancing at clubs in Los Angeles and was asked to go on ""Soul Train."" But the show's creator and host Don Cornelius was critical of her moves and her looks. ""Don Cornelius gave me an incredulous look regarding my accent. I lessened it; he gave a nod of approval,"" Perez wrote in her memoir. ""Instantly, I felt ashamed. I had made my first conscious effort not to sound ethnic."" Cornelius also wanted her to dance more like a ""sexy vixen,"" drop her hip-hop moves and dress in ""tight-ass minis and high heels."" But one day, their disagreement got physical and Perez stormed out of ""Soul Train,"" but not before she threw a chicken wing at his head. Years later, the two made amends. It was not the first time she would be discovered out of confrontation. Before leaving Los Angeles, she went out dancing at the same club Spike Lee was having a ""butt contest to see which black chick had the biggest ass"" to promote his movie ""School Daze."" Disgusted by the contest, Perez decided to make a mockery of it. ""I jumped on the stage... and bent over shaking my ass... bouncers came over with this little skinny guy and told me to get down. My bravado vanished,"" Perez wrote. That skinny guy turned out to be Spike Lee. The director was amused with Perez, introduced himself, and days later, he asked her to audition for ""Do the Right Thing."" 5. Her father had a panic attack in the movie theater when he saw her nude scene in ""Do the Right Thing"" When Perez's first movie came out, her father invited everyone from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico -- including the family pastor -- to watch.  She didn't prepare her dad for her nude scene. It shocked him so much that he was rushed to the hospital with what he thought was a heart attack. ""When the ice cube scene came on, my father gasped, jumped up, grabbed his heart and fell out cold -- no lie! He was taken away in an ambulance. I felt horrible. I flew down immediately,"" she wrote. But that didn't stop her father from milking it as he asked Perez to ""do it with class"" next time and let him know if she was doing an ""artistic film."" 6. She almost didn't get the part in ""White Men Can't Jump,"" because the studio had an issue with her ethnicity . ""I went through several more callbacks. The studio, as I was told, had a problem that I was Puerto Rican; they were worried about the interracial aspect,"" Perez wrote. But Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson fought to get her the part. She wrote that she was ""grateful that they put themselves out there like that,"" because ""that's the only way things change -- when everyone joins the fight and you're not the only one rushing up the hill."" As Snipes predicted, the movie was a huge hit, which opened doors for Perez. Roles offered to her thereafter were less stereotypical. 7. Perez refused to take on stereotypical Latina roles . People told Perez to be quiet and stop pointing fingers at people that were going to give her a job because she would risk hurting her career. But she refused. ""Hollywood's racist. I knew something else would come along that I was OK with. Sometimes you pay a price by not working as much, but I felt good about myself in the morning,"" Perez told CNN. Perez measured her success in terms of stability, happiness and having a real life -- even if that didn't mean gobs of money and fame. 8. Perez was mentally, physically and sexually abused for much of her childhood and diagnosed with PTSD . Perez, along with other children at the group home where she was raised, were often subjected to the nuns' cruelty. She was also severely abused by her mother, who was mentally ill, she wrote. In her memoir, Perez also writes for the first time that her half-brother sexually assaulted her twice during her childhood while she visited her mother's house. When she told her mother, Perez writes that she was smacked and punished for lying. Nobody was prosecuted in the case, Perez said in an interview. She said she hopes her siblings are getting help to break the cycle of abuse, she said, because they were all victims. Indeed, it wasn't until she was an adult that she went to therapy. ""If someone was to punch you in the face for 18 years of your life, wouldn't you go to the hospital to get it treated? It's the same thing when it comes to mental and physical abuse as well,"" Rosie said to CNN. While not unique to Latinos, Rosie also said there's certainly a stigma in Latino culture about mental health. ""I've heard racist remarks that refer to getting psychotherapy help as 'being white,'"" Perez said. ""We (Latinos) are selling ourselves short. Like my therapist said, 'If you're diabetic, you take insulin.' Therapy is not a 'white thing.' It's a clinical thing."" 9. She was raised Catholic, but she doesn't know if she believes in God . One nun, referred to as Grace in the memoir -- her name was changed to protect her privacy -- was the only person Perez trusted other than her aunt. The nun said something to her that became a turning point in Perez's life. ""I don't know if I believe in God but I believe in something, and she was a definite gift from that something. I needed someone to grab my hand, look me dead in the eye and say, 'This is what you have to do to survive this and you can do it.' She meant everything to me and still does. I still think about her till this very day,"" Perez said.","Rosie Perez recently published a new memoir, ""Handbook for an Unpredictable Life""

"Washington (CNN) -- Three weeks until funding starts to dry up for bridge and road projects across the United States, House and Senate committees Thursday put Congress on track toward a deal to avoid construction shutdowns and to keep the federal Highway Trust Fund operating until early next summer. But even as Republicans and Democrats drew closer together, some in the transportation industry decried the nearly $11 billion proposals as short-term fixes that leave the nation's bigger infrastructure issues untouched. House and Senate day of action . Without an infusion of cash to the highway fund, the Department of Transportation has warned that road projects may have to start shutting down in August. After months of failed negotiations, key House and Senate committees passed proposals Thursday that were relatively close in scope and content. Previous drafts had differed in the source and size of funding, as well as how long that funding would last. Thursday both the Republican-led House Ways & Means Committee and the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee passed bills with the same central dollar figure, $10.8 billion. That's enough to keep the fund in business until roughly next summer. The two sides also moved closer on where to get the money. The Senate committee adopted a House idea, including something called pension smoothing, which allows employers to set aside less money for long-term pension funding. One key difference -- the House bill has a more expanded version of the money-raiser, bringing in three times as much money from pension-smoothing than the Senate. The bills are much closer on the amount of money they'd raise from an extended increase in customs fees. And they would each transfer $1 billion out of funds for underground storage leaks. Republican and Democratic senators stressed they had made compromises. Finance Chairman Ron Wyden had previously insisted on a long-term deal. ""Colleagues, I want it understood that (pushing for a longer-term solution) was my position at the beginning of the negotiations,"" the Oregon Democrat said to his committee. ""But it was clear that it would not be possible to reach a bipartisan agreement (for a longer-term deal)."" His Republican counterpart echoed the story of tradeoffs. ""While I won't say I've gotten everything I wanted,"" ranking Republican Orrin Hatch admitted, "" I will say I think we've reached a deal that can satisfy both Democrats and Republicans."" Differences remain . Both bills passed their respective committees on relatively easy voice votes Thursday. But even as they issued warm statements across the north-south axis of the Capitol, lawmakers warned of the remaining differences ahead. ""I commend Chairman Wyden and Senator Hatch for putting together a bill that provides roughly $11 billion, as we did,"" wrote House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp in a statement. ""However... it is inconceivable that the House would, as the Senate proposes to do, grant the IRS additional authority to audit and investigate taxpayers simply so Washington can spend more money."" Camp's office would not confirm it, but the Michigan Republican seemed to be objecting to a Senate provision that would increase the amount of time the IRS has to audit taxpayers who incorrectly estimate property values, from three years now to six years. That measure alone raises over $1 billion. Each bill is expected to pass its respective chamber, with the House planning to vote on its version next week. Then the two sides must quickly agree to a compromise bill if they want to keep money flowing and avoid construction slowdowns starting in August. Transportation group fires back . As lawmakers breathe a cautious sigh of relief and move toward avoiding another crisis, some in the road construction industry see little reason to celebrate. ""These actions are the latest 'punt and leave the stadium' strategy that has plagued the federal surface transportation program for far too long,"" wrote Pete Ruane, president of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. His group and others have been clamoring for a long-term fix, after 11 stopgap measures in five years. But the politics are a problem. The highway fund currently relies on six types of taxes, including the federal gas tax. And Republicans' anti-tax mantra has prevented all but a few from supporting any increase in those fees. Hence, what could be a rare ahead-of-deadline deal in Congress looks like continued instability and lack-of-decision to those in road construction. ""Our message to Congress is simple: your job isn't close to being done,"" Ruane concluded. Feds warn states: Road construction money running out .","The DOT has warned that without an infusion of cash, road projects might start shutting .
Key House and Senate committees pass proposals to avoid that .
But some in transportation industry decry short-term fixes instead of longer-range plans ."
"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled late Friday that about 1,300 gay and lesbian marriages performed earlier this year must be recognized by Utah. However, the judges stayed their order until July 21 to give the state time to file an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for emergency action. The justices would be asked to delay recognition of those same-sex marriages until the overall constitutional issue is fully decided by the high court, a process that may not happen for a year or more. The same appeals court late last month ruled Utah's voter approved Amendment 3 violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples. The law currently defines marriage only between one man and one woman. A group of plaintiffs then asked the court to order the state to recognize those marriage licenses already issued in December and January. About 1,300 same-sex couples obtained marriage licenses in the 17 days after a federal judge ruled on December 20 that Utah's ban was unconstitutional. Those marriages were stopped after a temporary stay was put in place by the Supreme Court. That was the issue in Friday's court action.

"(CNN) -- It may have more than a half-billion dollars in the bank and the backing of tech titans like Google, as well as the investors with some of Silicon Valley's deepest pockets. You've probably never heard of Magic Leap, a startup so secretive they're not even telling the public who is on their team. But they're promising to change the world -- or at least how we experience it. What's clear is that Magic Leap is working on augmented-reality technology. And they're claiming that the product they're keeping tightly under wraps will trump anything that's been offered by existing companies like Oculus, the virtual-reality company Facebook bought this year for $2 billion. Magic Leap is making ""what we believe will be the most natural and human-friendly wearable computing interface in the world,"" said CEO Rony Abovitz in a written release from February, when the company secured $50 million in investments. Now, Google and other major tech investors are preparing to pour $500 million into the Florida-based company, according to tech blog Recode. ""What is remarkable is how well the human body and mind respond when technology respects biology, so truly magical experiences become possible,"" Abovitz said. ""Our technology exists to unlock the creative spark found in all of us."" Not surprisingly, a company spokesman declined the opportunity to comment for this story. Abovitz was the co-founder of MAKO Surgical, a company that made a robotic arm that can be used to perform orthopedic surgery. That company sold for a cool $1.65 billion in December. But, as staffing at Magic Leap goes, we don't know much more. On the website's ""Team"" page, where most startups brag about the experience and talent of their employees, Magic Leap lists no names, just offbeat titles like ""artificial intelligence gurus,"" ""software ninjas"" and ""computing hobbits."" Those who have gotten a peak behind the curtain, though, are impressed. ""What Rony and the Magic Leap team have created is nothing short of remarkable and will forever change the way we interact with images and information,"" a member of the startup's board of directors and co-founder of special-effects and props company Weta Workshop. Visitors to Magic Leap's website are greeted by a high-definition, point-of-view video that shows a tiny elephant appear to stand in the user's hand before leaping into the air and floating. In July, the New York Times reported that one tool Magic Leap is using is called a ""digital light field."" The technology is more complex than existing augmented-reality tools and would create, in effect, 3D light sculptures before the user's eyes. Based on its website, Magic Leap appears to have trademarked the term ""Cinematic Reality"" for its technology. With Google reportedly investing so heavily, it's not hard to imagine Magic Leap being paired with Google Glass, the tech giant's entry in the wearable tech field that could hit the market as early as this year.","Mysterious Magic Leap plans ""magical"" augmented reality .

"New York (CNN) -- Police in New York are aware of child molestation allegations by a former relative against actor Stephen Collins, but due to the statute of limitations, he cannot face charges in that case, a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday evening. The woman, a relative of Collins' first wife, went to police in November 2012 and told them she was sexually assaulted by Collins when she was 14 years old while inside his Greenwich Village apartment, the official said. There are specific laws with child sexual abuse cases in New York that allow for an extension of the statute of limitations, but even with that, this case against Collins -- the father figure in the television show ""7th Heaven"" -- cannot be prosecuted, the official added. An investigation continues to see if there might be any other women with similar allegations, the source said. In New York, a person has five years from their 18th birthday to make an accusation of sexual abuse to authorities. TMZ audio recording . Earlier Tuesday, celebrity gossip website TMZ released an audio recording that purports to have been recorded during a November 2012 therapy session involving Collins and his estranged second wife, Faye Grant. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of recording. But Grant told E! News she had nothing to do with the release of the recording. ""I woke up today to learn that an extremely private recording I handed over to authorities in 2012 per their request in connection with a criminal investigation was recently disseminated to the press,"" she told E! News. ""I had no involvement whatsoever with the release of the tape to the media."" Following the revelation, Collins, who is involved in a contentious divorce with Grant, was fired from his job on the movie ""Ted 2."" He also resigned Tuesday from his spot on the national board of the Screen Actor's Guild, a source at the organization with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Accusations from court documents . According to divorce documents filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Grant says she learned Collins had ""been engaging in a long-term pattern of sexually molesting children."" She said Collins admitted to her that he molested three underage girls more than a decade prior, the court document says. Two of the girls lived in New York, one in Los Angeles, according to the divorce papers. Neither Collins' attorney nor his agent immediately returned any of CNN's numerous calls. Grant's representatives also didn't respond to requests for comment. Grant said in the court documents that she was unaware of Collins' behavior until he told her in January 2012. They separated the next month, after almost 27 years of marriage. In Collins' legal response to the divorce filing, his lawyer doesn't specifically address the claims made by Grant, though he does write that it ""is really an attempt to extort concessions in settlement."" The document says that the now-husband of one of the alleged victims called Grant in December 2012 and berated her for not turning Collins over to the police and threatened to sue her for Collins' actions. No charges . TMZ reported Collins made incriminating statements in the recording similar to the accusations in the court documents. New York police have not commented on the existence of the recording. No charges have been filed. A spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, Kim Royster, said there is a formal criminal complaint on file that is being handled by the Manhattan Special Victims Squad. Police in Los Angeles said the department received information two years ago regarding allegations of criminal behavior. The case is no longer active, LAPD spokesman Andrew Neiman said. ""No crime report was ever made and there was no verified victim,"" he said. ""We are reviewing that investigation to make certain that nothing was missed, and we are collaborating with New York to assist if we can. The case here has not been reopened. We are merely reviewing the case for accuracy."" Collins played the Rev. Eric Camden on ""7th Heaven,"" which centered on the Camden family. It aired from 1996 to 2007. He also appeared in ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" On television he played a doctor in at least six different shows. Recently, he has been a regular on ABC's ""Private Practice"" and ""Revolution."" He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for his supporting performance in ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles,"" a 1987 miniseries. According to the Internet Movie Database, he is 67. UP TV, which airs ""7th Heaven"" in syndication, said it was replacing the show in its lineup, beginning Tuesday evening. CNN's Megan Thomas, Sara Sidner, Lindy Hall and Rachel Wells contributed to this report.","NEW: Collins' estranged wife: I had nothing to do with the release of a recording to the media .

"(CNN) -- A Jewish human rights organization on Monday called for Thailand's Christian leaders to condemn a parade at the Sacred Heart School in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in which participating students wearing Nazi uniforms performed ""Sieg Heil"" salutes. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based in Los Angeles, denounced the event, saying it was ""glorifying Nazis."" Photographs of the parade show participants carrying a Swastika flag, performing Nazi salutes and wearing SS uniforms, while others dressed as Adolf Hitler complete with toothbrush moustache. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said the images made it clear that the event could not have taken place without the knowledge and cooperation of the school administration. ""It is difficult to calculate the hurt such a display inflicted on survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and the families of all victims of Nazism. There can be no justification for such an outrage to emanate from place of learning,"" he said. The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged those responsible for the school to take immediate action against the individuals who promoted and facilitated the event. Cooper said that a similar parade took place in 2007 at a school in Bangkok in which 200 students participated, and that more recently, members of Thai rock band Slur donned Nazi uniforms in a music video. On Wednesday, the school's website posted a letter by its director expressing an apology. ""We, the entire Sacred Heart School [personnel] are deeply saddened by this incident."" The letter explained that the sports day activity involved groups being differentiated by colors -- the ""Red"" group having used Nazi symbols.

"Washington (CNN)  -- U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan could someday be awarded medals for restraint that prevents civilian casualties in combat. The possibility is under consideration by the staff of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan, according to Lt. Col. Tadd Sholtis, McChrystal's spokesman. The idea of rewarding battlefield restraint was proposed by British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, who is in charge of the international forces in southern Afghanistan. Sholtis said the idea is still in its ""conceptual stage."" ""Although no decisions have been made on the award itself, the idea is consistent with our strategic approach,"" Sholtis said. ""Our young men and women display remarkable courage every day, including situations where they refrain from using lethal force, even at risk to themselves, in order to prevent possible harm to civilians. In some situations our forces face in Afghanistan, that restraint is an act of discipline and courage not much different than those combat actions that merit awards for valor."" Sholtis said troops would still have the right of self defense. ""Let me be clear. We absolutely support the right of our forces to defend themselves. Valuing restraint in a potentially dangerous situation is not the same thing as denying troops the right to employ lethal force when they determine that it is necessary."" McChrystal has placed a priority on reducing civilian casualties as a means of gaining support of the Afghan people. A number of recent high-profile incidents in which civilians have been killed have given the Taliban a propaganda tool against the coalition, U.S. officials said. McChrystal has instituted other rules to help minimize civilian deaths, including restricting the use of airstrikes in areas where there may be civilians, and limiting nighttime raids by U.S. forces.","Medal would honor troops for restraint that prevents civilian casualties in combat .

"(CNN) -- Why stay in a humdrum hotel when you can sleep in a sewer pipe in Austria? Or a salt palace in Bolivia? Here are 15 of the world's most memorable accommodations . 1. Jules' Undersea Lodge (Florida) Originally a research laboratory, this fully underwater hotel sits at the bottom of the Emerald Lagoon in Florida's Key Largo, and can only be reached by scuba diving down six meters. The lodge can accommodate two couples and has showers, a microwave and a fridge. The real attraction are the fish; the lodge is like a goldfish bowl in reverse, where you sit and watch angelfish, parrotfish, barracuda and snappers peering in at you through the window. Jules Undersea Lodge, Key Largo Undersea Park, 51 Shoreland Dr., Key Largo, Florida; +1 305 451 2353; rates depend on packages; single person overnight stay $675 . 2. Das Park Hotel (Austria) At Das Park Hotel in Austria can stay overnight in a concrete sewer pipe on the banks of the River Danube. The drainpipes are two meters in diameter and two and a half meters long, with a porthole, a front door to close and a cozy nest to snuggle into, which includes a low-slung futon, bedside lamp, woolly blanket and light sleeping bag. It's novel, it's bold, and the best part is that you pay as much, or as little, as you want. Das Park Hotel, Donaulände 21, 4100 Ottensheim, Österreich, Ottensheim, Austria; +43 650 841 5850; rates chosen by guests . There's a second location near Essen, Germany at BernePark, Ebelstraße 25a, 46242 Bottrop, Germany . 3. Hotel Kakslauttanen (Finland) Being suffused by the northern lights from the inside of a glass igloo is one of the more novel ways of admiring one of nature's most stunning phenomena. Located within the Arctic Circle, deep in the snowbound Saariselka area of northern Finland, the cabins are built from ice or glass; both are surprisingly warm, but somewhat lacking in privacy. Hotel Kakslauttanen, Saariselka, Finland; +358 1666 7100; from €300 ($444) 4. Dog Bark Park Inn (Idaho) For a prairie getaway with flair, visitors need not look further than the ""largest beagle in the world."" ""This is the only place one can sleep with 26 dogs and still get a good night's rest,"" says Dog Bark Park Inn owner Frances Conklin. Many people have been in the doghouse, but few can say that they've actually slept in one. Then again, the Dog Bark Park Inn, while shaped like a dog -- albeit a dog nine meters high -- is no kennel. Endearing dog-themed designs indoors -- 26 carved dogs, dog-shaped cookies -- create a comfortable atmosphere, belying the staggeringly large (for a beagle, that is) and vaguely Trojan exterior. The entire B&B consists of a single room with a queen bed and adjacent loft with two twin mattresses. Dog Bark Park Inn, 2421 U.S. 95 Business, Cottonwood, Idaho; +1 208 962 3647; $98 per night double occupancy, $10 per additional person, single occupancy $92 . 5. Sant'Angelo Luxury Resort (Italy) ""Four-star boutique cave-hotel"" is the proud boast of the Sant'Angelo in the city of Matera, which is famous for its sassi -- houses dug into the rock. Matera is the only place in the world where people can boast to be still living in the same houses as their ancestors did 9,000 years ago. The rooms have been fashioned from old sassi stables and workshops. There are two restaurants, a bar and an art gallery. Sant'Angelo Luxury Resort, Piazza San Pietro Caveoso, Matera, Italia; +39 0835 314 010; three-night package from $560 per person (two sharing) including some meals, a walking tour and car hire . 6. The Dovecote (England) Regarded as one of the most romantic hideaways in Britain, the Dovecote certainly fits the bill for most lovebirds. The former dovecote, which fell into disrepair in the early 20th century, has been restored and converted into a cozy self-catering place that can sleep up to four people, though it's ideal for two. Within the one-meter-thick walls are a glass-fronted balcony bedroom, glorious wooden lantern roof and a sauna. The Dovecote, Norman & Ali Armitage, 9 Blacknest Gate Road, Sunninghill, Ascot, BERKS, UK; +44 (0)1344 622 596; from £300-600 ($500-1,000) per week, shorter stays available . 7. Adrere Amellal (Egypt) Desert palace meets bedrock at Adrere Amellal. This extraordinary eco-lodge sits in the middle of the Saharan oasis at Siwa, eight long, dusty hours' drive from Cairo. Surrounded by endlessly shifting sand dunes 18 meters below sea level, and overlooking a shimmering salt lake, the lodge is built from salt rock and mud. Candles light up the rooms (there's no electricity) and staff float around in flowing hooded robes, completing the feel that you've just stepped into a biblical scene. Adrere Amellal, 18 Mansour Mohamed St., Zamalek, Cairo, Egypt; +20 (2) 2736 7879; $460 for standard single room . 8. Palacio de Sal (Bolivia) At the Palacio de Sal, the walls, floors, beds and chairs are made entirely of white rock salt. Set on the eastern shore of the Great Salar de Uyuni, a vast expanse of white salt 3,650 meters above sea level, it's great for stargazing and watching sunset colors reflect off the salt lake. The hotel has a spa and salty golf course. Not recommended for slugs. Palacio de Sal, Salar de Uyuni, Uyuni, Potosí, Bolivia; +591 6842 0888; rates from $100 for a single . 9. 1950s Bristol freighter plane (New Zealand) One of the last allied planes out of Vietnam has been converted into two self-contained motel rooms. Up to four people can sleep in the cockpit unit and another four in the tail unit. The plane is located within Woodlyn Park, where you can learn all about New Zealand culture. Woodlyn Park, 1177 Waitomo Valley Road, Otorohanga, New Zealand; +64 7 878 6666; NZ$180 ($140) for the cockpit, and NZ$170 ($133) for the tail . 10. Kadir's Tree Houses (Turkey) On Turkey's idyllic Turquoise Coast at the end of a pine-tree clad valley lies the village of Olimpos, where the hoteliers specialize in a different type of accommodation -- tree houses. These simple wooden bungalows set amid the branches have long been popular with backpackers in the region and are growing in popularity. Kadir's, one of the original lodges, now operates more than 100 bungalows, plus a few larger cabins and dormitories. Kadir's is unashamedly hedonistic -- people come to party, hard, with the potential for disaster offered by a potent combination of mass drinking and accommodation several feet off the ground just adding to the fun. Kadir's Yörük Top Tree House, Olimpos, Antalya, Turkey; +90 (0)242 892 12 50; from 35TL ($20) 11. Poseidon Undersea Resort (Fiji) Dropped 40 feet below the surface of the clear blue Fijian Lagoon, these 24 underwater suites are reached by an elevator. With all the comforts of a five-star hotel, most are surrounded by transparent acrylic walls that allow for spectacular views of the ocean and its fishy inhabitants. Guests are invited to interact with the surroundings -- at the push of a button the fish are fed, and the flip of a switch turns on sparkling underwater lights. Poseidon Undersea Resort; $15,000 per person for one-week package, including transportation, two nights in an underwater suite, scuba diving and wine tasting . 12. Kokopelli's Cave Bed & Breakfast (New Mexico) While a cave sounds like a questionable place to stay the night, much less pay to stay the night, Kokopelli's Cave Bed and Breakfast in New Mexico isn't about masochism or asceticism, or even being cheap. With prices starting at $260 a night, Kokopelli's Cave is no mere hole. Guests stay in a carpeted, fully furnished room 21 meters below the surface, dug into a cliff face of 65-million-year-old sandstone. There's a TV, DVD player and selection of movies, but guests might find themselves more fascinated with the walls, a ""geologist's dream"" with a ""360-degree view of cross-bedding, petrified and carbonized wood and plant fragments,"" according to the hotel. While reaching the cave (there's only one, with bedding for four) requires a short hike, these ""difficulties"" also mean maximum privacy ... unless you count the ring-tailed cats that are said to occasionally visit. Kokopelli's Cave Bed & Breakfast, 5001 Antelope Junction, Farmington, New Mexico; +1 505 860 3812; from $280 per night . 13. The Balancing Barn (England) This precariously perched hotel was built by Living Architecture, the brainchild of Swiss philosophical writer Alain de Botton, who wrote ""The Architecture of Happiness."" The group created a series of homes in the United Kingdom based on high-quality, modern architecture and de Botton's work on the connection between environment, architecture and happiness. On the edge of a nature reserve, the Balancing Barn in Suffolk sleeps eight people. Clad in silver tiles and with large windows giving great views, it's also won a series of travel and design awards. Living Architecture also runs a boat-shaped room where you can spend the night, perched on top of the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank. The Balancing Barn is sited three miles from the ancient village of Walberswick on the Suffolk Heritage Coast; nearest railway stations are Darsham and Halesworth (approximately 10-minute drive away); rates from £830 ($1,393) for four nights . 14. Hotel Saratoga (Cuba) In Havana there's no cooler place to stay than the Hotel Saratoga. Its rooftop pool has some of the best views in town and goes some way to offsetting the traffic noise and hustle of the Paseo del Prado below. It's one of the better hotels in town, though the food is mediocre. Hotel Saratoga, Paseo del Prado 603, esquina a Dragones, Havana, Cuba; +53 7 868 1000; deluxe patio rooms from $238 . 15. Great Orme Lighthouse, Wales . Built in 1862 and in full use as a warning to ships until 1985, this old lighthouse certainly has a room with a view -- a 180-degree view over the cliffs of north Wales and the Irish Sea. This isn't a place for luxury, but you'll get a warm welcome from the hostess and insight into the history of this living monument. Great Orme Lighthouse, Marine Dr., Great Ormes Head, Llandudno, United Kingdom; +44 1492 876 819; $129 per person per night .","The most memorable hotels don't always come with five stars .

"London (CNN) -- Recordings until recently locked inside a college library in the United States might help solve a decades-old murder mystery, but the release of those tapes threatens to damage the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. The investigation into the December 1972 abduction and killing of widow Jean McConville in Belfast was revived by authorities after the release of interviews made by Boston College as part of the Belfast Project. The interviews conducted with former Northern Irish paramilitary fighters provide an oral history of the decades of fighting. Participants in the project were told their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their deaths. Last year a U.S. court ruled that tapes of deceased interviewees that contained claims about the killing be given by Boston College to police in Northern Ireland. One of those featured in the tapes was Brendan Hughes, a now-deceased former commander of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a Catholic paramilitary group, who accused Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of involvement, an allegation he denies. On Wednesday, after recordings made by deceased members of the IRA were passed to police, officers arrested Adams in connection with the killing -- though he has not been charged with an offense. McConville, a mother of 10 children, was taken from her home in Belfast. She was reportedly killed by the IRA because the group believed she was a spy for the British army. Her family say they do not believe she passed information to the British. McConville's remains were found partially buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003. She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. ""They came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out,"" remembers McConville's daughter, Helen McKendry, who was then a teenager. In the tapes, Hughes told his interviewer about McConville: ""I knew she was being executed. I knew that. I didn't know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they call them now."" Adams denies any involvement in the killing. ""I believe that the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice,"" Adams, 65, said in a statement posted on his party website. ""Malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these. ""While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs. McConville,"" Adams said. Long associated with the IRA, once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein, Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. Today, Sinn Fein is Ireland's second-largest opposition party. Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein member and the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, told reporters in Belfast that the arrest was unnecessary, unjustified and politically motivated. He said he had seen the ""dark side"" of Northern Ireland policing ""flex its muscles in the course of the past couple of days"" and that the arrest was a ""'deliberate attempt to influence the elections that are due to take place in three weeks' time."" McGuinness said he was confident that Adams would be able to rejoin election campaigning shortly and would ""continue to lead our party in a very positive way."" Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and Protestant loyalists wanted to keep it that way. Catholic nationalists were fighting to force the British out and reunite the north with the rest of Ireland. Known as the Troubles, the conflict lasted 30 years, ending in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace. The agreement provided a political framework for power-sharing among the parties. Reminders of Irish 'troubles' rise to surface . The IRA admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as ""The Disappeared"" -- those who vanished during the Troubles. Police investigating these killings say they were alerted to the secret archive of interviews by the book, ""Voices from the Grave,"" written by Belfast Project archive manager Ed Moloney, which is based on transcripts from two of the recorded interviews. Hughes said in his taped interview that McConville was killed because the IRA believed she was working with the British Army. The McKendrys dismiss this claim though, saying she was too busy looking after her 10 children to be an informer. The Northern Irish police vow to ""follow the material in the Boston Archives all way to court if that's where it takes them ... they say detectives have a legal responsibility to investigate murders ... and follow all lines of inquiry."" The British government's then most senior politician on Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson told CNN in 2012 that no one person was above the law. ""We have to support the police to have complete operational independence in pursuing every line of inquiry in bringing those who committed crimes to justice,"" Paterson said. It remains to be seen if Adams will charged in a court of law. Former IRA man Richard O'Rawe recorded a statement for the Boston College archives and said lawyers had told him under UK law tapes of interviewees could never be used in court. ""I find it just imponderable, why the police are going down this road when they must know that there is no chance of obtaining any convictions at the end of this,"" O'Rawe said in 2012. Like many other Catholics, O'Rawe said he believed the police are biased against them, trying to settle old scores and bring Adams and others down. But for Helen McKendry, herself a Catholic, getting access to the tapes is about much more. For her, it's not only about justice but a release from the pain of never knowing the truth. ""They tried to destroy what life I have now,"" she said. ""They are the people who committed the crimes in this. They should be worried.""

"(CNN) -- Pro-military hawks must be pleased with President Obama's speech on Wednesday night about attacking ISIS. We're sure to hear many of them -- the same voices that have been hounding the President to take military action in the first place -- call for more extensive strikes and even American troops on the ground. What we won't hear enough of are the voices of the opposition -- those who argue that military action will not get rid of ISIS but make the situation worse in Iraq and Syria. There are strong reasons why many analysts think fighting ISIS is the wrong course of action, and that there are more effective alternatives. For one thing, the United States can pursue diplomatic and political solutions instead. Military action against ISIS is a bad idea because: . 1. U.S. intervention is what destabilized Iraq in the first place -- and more bombing will likely make Iraq less stable. Our invasion of Iraq and the installation of Nuri al-Malaki as prime minister reignited deep sectarian tensions and created a power vacuum into which ISIS stepped. You can't save a country by destroying it. A bombing campaign that is perceived as taking the side of Shia Muslims while undoubtedly decimating communities and killing civilians will only worsen Iraq's instability. 2. Airstrikes won't destroy radical ideology, they'll make it worse. Most would-be terrorists don't wake up one morning and suddenly decide to hate America. Often, there's a reason. In 2006, the classified National Intelligence Estimate found that the 2003 U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq helped create a new generation of terrorists and increased the overall terrorism threat against America. More American military action in the Middle East will just inflame more anti-American terrorists -- which perversely only strengthens the ideology that fuels ISIS and other terrorist groups. 3. There is no direct threat to the United States. When we see Yazidi refugees being slaughtered and American journalists being beheaded, of course our humanity calls for action. But those beating the drums of war have made assertions that ISIS poses a direct threat to American soil. This is simply not true. Even while playing up potential future threats to the homeland to justify military actions -- thus essentially embracing President George W. Bush's pre-emption doctrine -- the Obama administration reports ISIS currently poses no threat to the United States. If bombing isn't the solution, what is? The solution to destroying ISIS -- and mitigating Iraq's problems in general -- isn't military but political. Here are some key steps, according to analysts like Phyllis Bennis and advocates like Win Without War: . 1. Cut access to guns and money. It should be noted that ISIS has access to weapons because U.S. and Saudi weapons have been flooding the region for over a decade. The United States can take steps to shut down the weapons supply routes that ISIS is relying on. This is the opposite of what Obama has outlined as a strategy in Syria and Iraq. The U.S. also needs to re-evaluate its broader arms policy. In addition, part of ISIS' strength is due to its robust financial resources, a significant part of which relies on black market sales of oil now under ISIS control. The U.S. and allies can take clear steps, some of which Obama has proposed, to block the processing and sale of this oil. 2. Fix Iraq's political rifts. While ISIS allegedly has 20,000 fighters, there are 25 million Sunnis across the Middle East, and as long as they remain disillusioned with Iraqi and Syrian political leaders, they're a potential recruiting ground for ISIS to expand. This political crisis needs a political solution. Encouraging al-Maliki to step down and supporting a new, more inclusive Iraqi government is an important first step. The United States, along with allies, must help heal the sectarian rifts. And yes, that means serious engagement with Iran -- a traditional U.S. enemy which nonetheless shares our goal in stabilizing Iraq and has far more diplomatic influence in the region than we do. 3. Provide humanitarian assistance. While airstrikes won't help the Syrian and Iraqi people, humanitarian assistance will. Millions have been displaced and have become refugees. It would be nice if American politicians cheering on expensive and deadly bombing campaigns would be at least as enthusiastic, if not more so, about spending money on food and water and shelter for those in desperate need. The Obama administration recently announced an additional $48 million in such aid -- but that number is nothing compared with how much will be wasted in airstrikes. 4. Lead a truly international response. We don't need a coalition of the willing or a coalition of the killing. We need a coalition of nations that will help put Iraq on firm political and cultural footing and restart real negotiations in Syria involving all parties in the crisis there. The United States should work through the United Nations and seek diplomatic solutions through a broad coalition of nations. Obama's critics want him to act tough in the face of ISIS. But if acting tough by bombing ISIS doesn't solve the problem -- and makes the threat worse -- then acting tough is stupid. Diplomacy may not have the same sexy veneer as aggressive military action, but if diplomacy could actually help the Syrian and Iraqi people and make the world safer, isn't that what counts?","Sally Kohn: Pro-military hawks are pleased that President Obama plans to attack ISIS .

"London (CNN) -- Legendary track star and chairman of the London Organizing Committee Sebastian Coe congratulated his fellow Britons for a ""glorious"" Olympic Games on Sunday night. ""When our time came, Britain, we did it right,"" Coe told the 80,000 gathered at Olympic Stadium for the closing ceremony. Coe said these ""two glorious weeks"" would ""inspire a generation."" International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge declared the London Games officially over. He echoed Coe's sentiments. ""These were happy and glorious Games,"" he said. ""The legacy of the Games of the 30th Olympiad will become clear in many ways. Concrete improvements in infrastructure will benefit the host nation for years to come. The human legacy will reach every region of the world. Many young people will be inspired to take up a sport or to pursue their dreams."" As the Games came to a close, the United States led the medal count with 104 overall, 46 of them gold. China finished second, with 87 medals, with Russia third with 82. Great Britain finished with 65, its best total since 1908. Singers from all eras performed. There was rock great Ray Davies, pop heroes George Michael and Annie Lennox, and new boy-band One Direction. Even comedian Russell Brand joined in, singing The Beatles ""I Am The Walrus."" The crowd gave the Spice Girls a rousing ovation after they performed two of their hits. Other performers payed tribute to some of the artists who didn't attend or had passed away. Singers Jessie J and Taio Cruz teamed with rapper Tinie Tempah to sing ""You Should Be Dancing"" by the Bee Gees (born on Isle of Man). Ed Sheeran led a quartet with Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, Richard Jones of the Feeling and Mike Rutherford of Genesis in covering ""Wish You Were Here."" Later Monty Python actor Eric Idle led the crowd in singing ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" To close the music medley Jessie J also joined Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen, belting out ""We Will Rock You."" The Who closed out the ceremony with a medley of the band's hits, ending with ""My Generation."" In a new twist, the 10,000-plus athletes entered the stadium through the stands, some high-fiving members of the audience as they descended the steps to the field. There was also one final medal ceremony as Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda was awarded his marathon gold and listened along with the spectators to his national anthem. The White House released a statement that said President Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron congratulating London on an ""extremely successful"" games. One of the U.S. golds came as expected on the basketball court, but in a tougher contest than expected. Led by Kevin Durant's 30 points, the United States fought off a stiff challenge from Spain to win the gold medal 107-100. The Americans defended their title from four years ago in Beijing, also against Spain. ""This game was fun. It was a challenge, but we stepped up to it,"" Kobe Bryant told NBC, an official broadcaster of the Games. LeBron James had 19 points and Bryant scored 17 for the Americans, who led by only one point after the third quarter. ""We all respect each other,"" Durant said. ""We all know it's our common goal."" Russia narrowly edged out Argentina for the bronze. London itself took center stage on the last day of the Olympics on Sunday, with the men's marathon course running past the city's major landmarks from Big Ben to Buckingham Palace. Kiprotich won a thrilling race in 2:08:01, dueling for miles with early leader Wilson Kipsang of Kenya and his compatriot Abel Kirui. The Kenyans worked together to try to box the Ugandan in, but as the race neared its end, he blew past them to finish with a commanding lead, giving Uganda its first medal of any color in these Games. Read more: Nigeria's 12- year wait for Olympic gold . Kirui took silver and Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich took the bronze, with Eritrea-born American Meb Keflezighi coming fourth, about three minutes behind the winner. The hosts snatched yet another boxing gold medal later Sunday, with super heavyweight Anthony Joshua winning gold for Britain. Italy, whose Roberto Cammarelle won silver, launched an appeal after the fight ended 18-18. Joshua was awarded victory on countback -- using the scores of all five judges, not just the middle three scores. ""It was a tough first round. The judges will always do their job and I do my job,"" the champion said. ""I have had close decisions in other tournaments but I just take it on the chin."" The Italian said the decision was curious. ""I did everything I could. I don't understand the score,"" he said. ""Where did they get all the points they gave him at the end?"" Read more: Five things to watch at Olympics on Sunday . Team USA picked up another gold medal earlier, when Jacob Stephen Varner won the 96-kilogram freestyle wrestling contest. ""I came here to win a gold medal and that's what I've done,"" he said. ""I played more defense then I wanted to, but it's awesome for the United States."" Uzbekistan's Artur Taymazov became first man to win three consecutive freestyle wrestling golds, defeating Davit Modzmanashvili of Georgia. ""I wanted to get the third gold,"" said Taymazov, who also won a silver at the Sydney Games in 2000. ""There was also a time pressure, because I am 33. But it was my time."" At the 2000 Olympics, Greco-Roman wrestler Alexander Karelin won three straight golds and then a silver. ""I'm glad I have equaled his medal total,"" Taymazov said, ""but he has won more world championships than I have won so I must do more over the next two seasons."" In men's water polo, Ratko Rudic guided Croatia to an 8-6 victory over Italy in the gold medal match, a record fourth win for the a coach. Rudic has led three nations -- Yugoslavia, Italy and his native Croatia -- to gold as well as winning a silver medal in 1980 as a player with Yugoslavia.

"(CNN) -- In a headline that calls out for attention -- ""A Gender Reversal on Career Aspirations"" -- the Pew Research Center reports that two-thirds of young women now say ""being successful in a high-paying career or profession"" is one of the most important goals in their lives. While it may not be surprising that these women express more ambition than their mothers and grandmothers, it is surprising when they also display more ambition than their male peers. Is this a sign, then, that we are witnessing ""a gender reversal""? Or does it represent a kind of denial -- on the part of young women and men -- about the obstacles they will ultimately face at the workplace and in life? In the same poll, marriage and parenthood remain important life goals for all young adults, with 86% of women and 82% of men listing marriage as ""very important"" or ""one of the most important things"" in life. Children are even more desired, with 95% of young women and 90% of young men placing ""being a good parent"" in these same categories. Yet young people's actions, at least when it comes to family commitments, appear at odds with these stated aspirations. Young people are not only postponing marriage, they are also far more likely than earlier generations to believe it is better to stay single than to enter or stay in a dissatisfying relationship. Moreover, while young women see marriage as desirable, they do not believe it is essential to their own happiness or to becoming a parent. The gap between young women's high aspirations -- for relationships and parenthood along with paid work -- and their increasing tendency to remain ""on their own"" suggest that they are hardly naive. On the contrary, their career goals represent a realistic and cool-eyed assessment of how best to secure their own well-being, along with the well-being of any children they bear. In a world where women know they are likely to shoulder the responsibilities of supporting a family, often on their own, it is more dangerous to scale back ambitions than to give in to the obstacles they know they will likely encounter. Focusing on self-development at the workplace does not, however, mean jettisoning hopes for a rich family life. When I interviewed young people about their experiences and outlooks, I found that women and men alike overwhelmingly say they want to combine committed work with a satisfying lifelong partnership between equals. They are also rightly skeptical about their chances of achieving this high standard. Women are particularly aware of how hard it is to sustain a relationship, especially in the context of persistent work-family conflicts and rising financial uncertainty. An egalitarian partnership may be the ideal, but most young women see self-reliance through paid work as essential to their survival, offering the option to choose the right relationship, maintain a measure of autonomy within it and go it alone if nothing better comes along. So what about young men? Men's prospects have dimmed in finding the kind of stable jobs and careers their fathers and grandfathers took for granted. With the uncertainties of the new economy, where few jobs offer lifetime security, men's scaled back aspirations are as understandable as women's rising goals. Men, too, are caught on the horns of a dilemma, torn between the difficulty of establishing a steady career and strong pressures to define their worth by the size of the paycheck. As women's career aspirations rise and men's tumble, this declining gender gap should serve as a wake-up call. Younger generations want to combine the personal pursuit of challenging, well-rewarded paid work with the pleasures and responsibilities of a committed family life. In fact, earlier Pew surveys found 73% of Americans believe that women's employment has been a ""change for the better,"" while 62% say that sharing the responsibilities of paid work and rearing children is ""more satisfying than a more traditional marriage."" But as long as careers require unfettered, constant devotion and caretaking remains undervalued, privatized and penalized, the goal of striking their desired balance between paid work and the rest of life will remain illusive for young women and men alike. The answer is to stop worrying about a gender reversal and focus instead on the institutional and cultural changes -- such as flexible careers and supports for caretakers of all stripes -- that will make genuine equality possible. It is past time to finish the gender revolution that began with women's march into the workplace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Gerson.","Pew poll reports that young women have higher earning aspirations than young men .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A two-year legal battle over who was responsible for Michael Jackson's sudden death came to a dramatic close Monday as a California jury found Dr. Conrad Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Dr. Murray appeared to show no emotion as the verdict was read by court clerk Sammi Benson, but La Toya Jackson, the late pop icon's sister, let out a loud, but short, scream. A loud celebration erupted among Jackson fans outside of the downtown Los Angeles County courthouse, where emotions ran so high at least one woman fainted. Murray was immediately handcuffed and taken away by deputies after Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor denied bail. ""This is not a crime involving a mistake of judgment. ... This was a crime where the end result was the death of a human being,"" Pastor said in explaining his decision to remand Murray to police custody. ""That factor demonstrates rather dramatically that the public should be protected."" Sentencing was set for November 29, with Murray facing up to four years in prison on the conviction. Defense attorney Ed Chernoff told CNN the defense team's main job right now is to prepare for sentencing and limit the amount of time that Murray spends in jail. ""What matters most right now is trying to keep Dr. Murray from taking up a prison cell in this community,"" Chernoff said. ""That's what we're focusing on right now and we'll deal with an appeal after that."" When asked if he was shocked by the verdict, Chernoff said, ""No."" Another of Murray's lawyers, Nareg Gourjian, told CNN on Monday night the outcome may have been different had the defense been able to introduce additional evidence -- like on Jackson's past drug use and ""financial condition."" Gourjian described his client as ""devastated"" by the verdict, adding Murray is trying to stay positive with more legal options ahead of him. ""We're hoping that the appeals court will have something to say about this,"" the lawyer said. Murray served as Jackson's personal physician as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts, with Murray giving him the surgical anesthetic propofol to help him sleep nearly every night for the last two months of his life, according to testimony. Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was caused by ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with two sedatives, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled. The verdict followed about nine hours of jury deliberations, which began Friday morning in the downtown Los Angeles County courthouse. Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley thanked jurors ""for their hard work and thoughtful deliberation,"" and expressed gratitude that they recognized the ""overwhelming"" evidence against Murray in finding him guilty. Prosecutor Michael Walgren personally expressed his sympathies to the Jackson family who he said lost ""not a pop icon, but a son and brother."" Fans gathered outside of the courthouse ahead of the verdict with signs of support for Jackson including one banner that read, ""We miss Michael."" The crowd began celebrating once word of the guilty verdict reached them, chanting ""Rest in peace."" Passing cars honked their horns, as people nearby hugged, cried and yelled out in joy. An emotional La Toya Jackson on Monday thanked all those involved in the trial, calling the decision a ""victory."" ""Everybody was wonderful,"" La Toya Jackson told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell as she left the Los Angeles courthouse. Crowd outside erupts in jubilations . The seven men and five women on the jury heard 49 witnesses over 23 days, including Murray's girlfriends and patients, Jackson's former employees, investigators and medical experts for each side. A statement released by Jackson's estate Monday said that ""justice has been served."" Defense lawyers contended the matter was a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board. ""If it were anybody else but Michael Jackson, would this doctor be here today?"" lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff asked in his closing. Jurors were left to decide if the propofol overdose was infused into Jackson's blood by a steady intravenous drip, as the prosecution contended, or if Jackson injected himself using a syringe left nearby by Murray, as the defense argued. ""He was just a little fish in a big, dirty pond,"" Chernoff said, pointing the finger at other doctors who treated Jackson, and Jackson himself. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren attacked the defense for trying to blame ""everybody but Conrad Murray, poor Conrad Murray."" ""If allowed more time to argue, I am sure they would find a way to blame Michael's son, Prince,"" Walgren said in his closing rebuttal. Walgren painted Murray as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $150,000 a month to give Jackson nightly infusions of propofol in his home, something prosecutors argued an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers. Murray's license to practice medicine is now suspended, according to the Medical Board of California, which decides if a doctor can legally work in the state. In the light of the conviction, the board now will open an investigation to determine whether or not to fully revoke Murray's right to practice medicine in the state, spokeswoman Jennifer Simoes said. The main criteria in deciding whether to revoke, suspend or take other action against any doctor is assessing how substantial a crime is related to the practice of medicine. There is no timeline as to when the board might act regarding Murray, said Simoes. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","NEW: Murray's lawyer say the verdict may have been different if other evidence was allowed .

"Washington (CNN) -- If there's a student anywhere who would be able to answer a trivia question about President Abraham Lincoln, it would be on the marble steps of his memorial in the nation's capital. But a summertime visit there backed up recent test results that showed the majority of U.S. students don't know the most basic facts about the country's history -- Lincoln and all. Test results released in June showed that fewer than one quarter of all students are ""proficient"" in American history. Would you pass the tests? Take the quiz . Many of the fourth grade students asked about Lincoln on the tests could identify him, but few could say why he was an important president. At the memorial in Washington, students who saw the president's image on a postcard identified the tall, bearded man as Lincoln. When asked why the 16th president was important, some answers were spot-on, some were entertaining -- and some were disheartening. One student said he was important because he had a beard. Another said he was killed at a puppet show. Their answers aren't surprising. ""The Nation's Report Card: U.S. History 2010,"" the tests results report by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, showed 20% of fourth graders, 17% of eighth graders and 12% of 12th graders showed ""solid academic performance"" on the tests. The results reflected test responses of 7,000 fourth-graders, 11,000 eighth-graders and 12,000 12th-graders. Educators and reformers have several explanations for the low scores, including apathetic and disinterested students, poor teaching or problems with standardized testing. Some said that math, science and English get higher priority in schools because those subjects are tested under No Child Left Behind. History teachers say subject time is shortchanged . Some wonder whether schools should focus on history at all, when the ability to recall historic facts or themes might not help students land certain jobs later on. But others say knowing how we came to our current way of life is always essential. As another presidential election season approaches, knowledge of U.S. history is invaluable, according to Diane Ravitch, a New York University research professor of education. ""All of these students will be voters... and almost 40% were already eligible to vote when they took the assessment,"" Ravitch said in a statement released after the results of the study were published. ""They will be making decisions in the voting booth that influence our lives. They should be well informed and capable of weighing the contending claims of candidates, especially when the candidates rest their arguments on historical precedent."" Bad history scores, like low voter turnout, are nothing new, said Jack Buckley, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. ""This is a long-running story in American academic achievement,"" he said. ""There is a core group of kids who are outstanding. There is another small percent, somewhere between 10 and 15, that we would, our policy-makers would, probably deem proficient and there is big chunk of kids who are below that line and that has not changed much."" In Sudbury, Massachusetts, Will Fitzhugh publishes The Concord Review, a journal highlighting the work of that ""core group"" of gifted history students. The low history scores trouble him, but he said he hasn't seen many attempts to improve them. ""Nobody is doing anything to fix it,"" Fitzhugh said. ""History informs the present with lessons from the past and if you don't do any history than you are exploring without any background. ... Students are very smart about the way they spend their time and if they don't have to spend their time doing history they'll spend their time doing something else."" History professor: There's a better way to teach history . While politicians, educators, administrators or bureaucrats try to find ways to help students master history, the academic equivalent of varsity athletes -- the students Fitzhugh publishes -- have their own view. ""They really should try and find the fun that's present in learning history,"" said incoming Harvard College freshman Tianhao He, a student who was published in The Concord Review. ""When it comes down to it, history is all about people, and people like us who have shaped this nation's history.""","National test results show fewer than one-fourth of students are ""proficient"" in American history .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York graffiti art exhibit that drew visitors throughout the world was painted over early Tuesday morning despite efforts by artists and fans to keep the popular outdoor attraction open. The whitewashing of the renowned graffiti haven known as 5 Pointz, a hulking warehouse in the Long Island City section of Queens, appears to mark the end of legal efforts by supporters to save it and even a last-minute attempt to secure landmark status for the building. A federal judge last week denied an injunction to stop the razing of the building by developers Jerry and David Wolkoff, the warehouse owners, who plan to transform the site into high-end condos. ""I've been learning a lot in this whole battle,"" Jonathan Cohen, aka ""Meres One,"" the 5 Pointz art curator, told CNN affiliate NY1. He added, ""I guess I have a little less faith in the system."" Jerry Wolkoff told CNN that he decided to paint over the walls now because the building will take several months to tear down, and he didn't want the artists' work to be ruined in the process. ""I had tears in my eyes this morning when we painted over it,"" Wolkoff said. ""I have nothing but admiration for the work they've done."" Graffiti artists turn abandoned luxury liner into giant canvas . Wolkoff said the new buildings will have a ""60-foot high wall"" for the artists to paint on. He anticipates beginning the demolition in early 2014. The 5 Pointz is a massive canvass where ""aerosol artists from around the globe paint colorful pieces on the walls of a 200,000-square-foot factory building,"" according to its website. The exhibit has been featured in several music videos and documentaries. @5PointzNYC, the official Twitter handle for the exhibit, sent this out Tuesday: ""5 Pointz is gone, painted white overnight by the owner...with police protection.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Ola Kaso, who was born in Albania and came to America at the age of 5, described her predicament in a Senate hearing Tuesday. ""Despite my compliance with the law, there's no way I can achieve citizenship,"" said Kaso, now 18 and ready to start college in the fall at the University of Michigan. ""Despite aspirations and hard work, I face deportation in one year."" In short, she said, ""I am a DREAM Act student."" Kaso referred to legislation pushed by Democrats but opposed by Republicans that would give children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship through military service or college education. The measure passed the House of Representatives last year but stalled in the Senate due to a Republican filibuster. With Republicans now holding a House majority, the proposal has no chance of passing in this Congress. Democratic backers, stung by a failure to deliver any significant immigration reform since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, called the hearing to try to raise the public profile of the issue in the earliest stages of the 2012 election campaign. ""I ask my colleagues to consider the plight of these young people, who find themselves in a legal twilight zone, through no fault of their own,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, a leading proponent of the DREAM Act. ""They are willing to serve the country they love. All they ask for is a chance."" Another Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, cited a university study that estimated students who would come under the DREAM Act's provisions could contribute as much as $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy over a 40-year period. ""That's pretty compelling evidence that these students work hard, that they care, and that they want to be part of the American dream,"" Feinstein said, ""and to the best of my knowledge the American dream has never been an exclusive dream that only some people can share."" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called for comprehensive immigration reforms that include stronger border security, rather than focusing on one aspect of the issue through the DREAM Act. ""This bill, sadly, does nothing to fix our broken immigration system,"" Cornyn said. ""It may be worse that we're providing incentive for future illegal immigration. This bill does nothing for border security, workplace enforcement, visa overstays, which account for about 40% of illegal immigration in this country. In other words it does nothing to reduce the likelihood of future illegal immigration."" Cornyn described himself as a supporter of the goals of the DREAM Act and immigration reform, a claim disputed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""He's voted against comprehensive immigration reform every time"" the issue has come up in recent years, Reid told reporters. The DREAM Act would offer legal standing to immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and had lived in the country for at least five years. The bill would require, among other things, a high school or General Educational Development diploma, two years of college or military service, and criminal background checks. Advocates say the bill would give legal standing to young people brought to the United States by their parents who have bettered themselves and served their new country. Republican opponents equate the measure to amnesty, and have said it would signal to the world that the United States is not serious about enforcing its laws or its borders. They have also called the bill unfair to immigrants who, in many cases, waited years to come to the country legally. Regardless of the fate of the DREAM Act, the immigration issue remains politically potent. Obama won several Western states in 2008 -- including Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada -- partly on the rising power of the Latino vote. Democrats believe Hispanic voters might put traditionally Republican Arizona in play next year. In the long run, Democrats are also hoping to use their advantage among Hispanics to make inroads in core GOP states such as Texas. Obama won more than two-thirds of the nationwide Hispanic vote in 2008. His approval rating among Hispanics hovered around 68% during the first three months of this year, according to the most recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation polls. For their part, Republicans have depended on the immigration issue in the past to fire up conservative voters. Some analysts also believe that if Democrats push too hard and too fast on immigration, particularly in tough economic times, it could push swing voters toward the GOP.

"Washington (CNN) -- The House Ways and Means Committee is the oldest, and arguably the most powerful, in Congress with members responsible for writing the nation's tax laws. But a CNN investigation of all 39 Democrats and Republicans on the committee found that at least eight members have faced tax problems of their own. For example, New York Rep. Tom Reed has been late paying his property taxes at least 46 times since 2005. And he racked up more than $6,200 in penalties and interest on more than $100,000 in taxes, according to county records. On a stunning lake house in New York's Finger Lakes region and a home in Corning, Reed missed a combined 16 tax payments over nine years. On three other buildings in Corning and another in Bath Village, Reed had a total of 20 late payments over eight years. And on a mobile home park and two other commercial properties, Reed was late on his taxes 10 times since 2007, according to county records. So what happened? ""You know it's just like a lot of people, these are things that just happen and they were paid within the allotted time,"" Reed told CNN. But unlike a lot of people, Reed is charged with writing the nation's tax laws. Asked if he should be helping to write laws he has trouble following, the Republican lawmaker said, ""Well, I mean these are real property tax bills, which is different than what the Ways and Means does with income tax bills. And I mean we're paying them, we paid them within the allotted time and that's it."" Reed likened the late tax payments to missing a utility bill, saying that while he was late -- and paid penalties because of it -- the taxes never went unpaid. Steve Ellis of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense said that ""lots of Americans run afoul of tax laws, but you'd think the people who are actually writing it wouldn't get this wrong."" But they do. Take Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Renacci, for instance. He fought state tax officials for years, refusing to pay nearly $1.4 million in back income taxes, interest and penalties. Renacci declined several interview requests, but a spokeswoman issued a statement. Renacci was ""appealing an attempt by the new tax commissioner to impose a unilateral and retroactive tax on Ohio taxpayers. In a 3-2 split decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that the commissioner had the authority to impose the retroactive tax. At that time, while he strongly disagreed with decision to levy taxes retroactively, Jim Renacci paid the assessment in full, including interest and penalties,"" the statement said. But the Ohio tax commissioner categorized Renacci's battle differently, writing in his final determination that his fellow Republican ""failed to act in good faith."" Another Ohioan, Rep. Pat Tiberi, was criticized for not paying employment taxes on his campaign workers. Instead of hiring employees for the 2008 and 2010 campaigns, he hired consultants as independent contractors -- and avoided the payroll taxes. The Republican said he followed IRS rules. ""We have a tax lawyer. That's part of the reason why campaigns are so expensive because we have a CPA who does our filing,"" he said. ""We have tax lawyers that are on call to make sure that we follow the letter of the law."" But Ellis called the lawmakers' tax problems ""outrageous."" ""Nobody wants to feel like a chump when they're paying their taxes and if they see that their lawmakers, the ones who actually write the tax laws, aren't paying their bills, it's going to make them wonder why they're paying theirs,"" Ellis said. Some of the transgressions were relatively minor. For instance, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan had to pay a $59 fine after understating his income. And Indiana Republican Rep. Todd Young paid $1,500 in tax penalties after a mortgage escrow mix up. ""I accept full responsibility for past late payments, and have paid all taxes and fees I owed. I regret the errors and offer no excuses,"" Young told CNN in a statement. ""Since then, I have taken corrective action to ensure this doesn't occur again."" Tennessee Republican Rep. Diane Black's situation was a bit more complicated. A property that she and her husband own racked up almost $4,000 in penalties and interest after her husband's business paid the bill late. A spokesman explained that the company did not receive the tax notice, but paid the bill the day that company officials learned it was overdue. Florida Republican Vern Buchanan's run-ins with the IRS make him the frontrunner for most expensive tax problem, costing him $2.5 million. Buchanan fought the IRS contention that he owed an additional $1 million in taxes. In 2002, after years of fighting, he paid $1.2 million in taxes -- the amount he insisted he owed -- plus another $1.3 million in penalties and interest he racked up during the fight. Finally, there's New York Democrat Charles Rangel. He lost his chairmanship of the committee in 2010 and was censured in part for his failure to pay taxes on rental income from his swank villa in the Dominican Republic. Yet years later, both Rangel and Buchanan still sit on the committee. How Washington spends your taxes . CNN's Scott Bronstein and Curt Devine contributed to this report.

"(LifeWire)  -- After weathering a troublesome roommate situation for a year, Dave Sotelo, 26, was ready to move out. His girlfriend, Ngoc Nguyen, had the perfect solution: moving in together. It's better to find a new place to live than to move into one person's established home, says expert. ""Conveniently, an apartment in my four-unit building became available at the very same time,"" says Nguyen, 26. There are obvious advantages to cohabitation, both emotional (living with the person you love) and financial (sharing expenses like rent). The drawbacks are just as glaring, like adjusting to annoying personal habits and accommodating your loved one's passion for knickknacks that make your cringe. One thing's for certain, experts say -- the more you discuss before you move in together, the more likely your relationship will succeed. Sotelo's and Nguyen's certainly has improved in the year and half they've lived together. ""We're engaged!"" Nguyen says happily. The wedding is scheduled for August 26. The Albany, California, couple is in good company: According to The State of Our Unions 2007, a report by the National Marriage Project at New Jersey's Rutgers University, ""over half of all first marriages are now preceded by living together, compared to virtually none 50 years ago."" Get on the same page . But living together doesn't guarantee success. In fact, about half of all couples that move in together end up separating within five years, according to the Centers for Disease Control. There's no way to guarantee your relationship won't become another statistical failure, of course. But there are steps you can take to increase the chances for success. Before moving in together, discuss the ultimate purpose and how this might affect your relationship -- is it a matter of convenience to provide shelter or financial support, or is it the next step toward marriage? ""Are they going to truly commit to each other's well being on every level? If not, forget it,"" says Lee Richey, a marriage and family therapist based in Fishers, Indiana. Have a plan to merge possessions . Coordinate a plan of attack: Assess space constraints, sort out what you want and what you need, and get rid of duplicate items. Natural selection should take place: Keep whatever is cleaner, nicer and newer. If you're a pack rat like Nguyen or Sotelo, negotiate space for what's most important to each of you. ""He doesn't really like to let go of boxed-up old things, and I have more clothes than I could ever hope to wear,"" says Nguyen. ""It's a slightly tenuous cease-fire at the moment. We just try our best to keep the open areas clean and clutter-free."" The solution, Richey says: ""Discuss a limit on sentimental items before hand, given there will probably be limited space."" He advises starting fresh in a brand-new place as opposed to moving into one person's established space. Each of you will have your own quirks, so try to respect that. ""I get sensitive over an unclean bathroom shower; he gets touchy over a greasy stovetop,"" says Nguyen. ""We claim our territory ever so subtly."" In addition to being mindful of common space, carve out individual space so you can have some time alone if you wish. Be meticulous about money . It's not romantic, but take care when buying big-ticket items with your significant other, advises Frederick Hertz, an Oakland, California-based attorney and co-author of ""Living Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples."" ""If you're doing any significant purchase or credit where you can't afford to just walk away from it if your lover turns out to be a total sociopath, then have a written agreement,"" Hertz says. Other money matters: . • If you take out a credit card in your name, use it only for your own expenses. • If you buy a house together, make sure the title reflects your share of the financial contribution. • If you decide to open a joint bank account, understand that each person has full access to that money. • If one partner is financially supporting the other -- helping pay for graduate school, for instance -- there should be ""no expectation of payback, no strings attached,"" says marriage therapist Richey. ""If you don't feel completely comfortable supporting your loved one, then don't start."" If you separate . Even if a couple takes all of these steps, there's still a change that one day they'll part ways. If that happens, cohabitating couples have some of the legal protections of married couples if they meet their state's definition of common-law spouses or draft written agreements before the split, Hertz says. An agreement doesn't have to be drafted by a lawyer to be recognized by a court. In about 40 states, an unmarried cohabitant can make a claim based on an oral, written or implied agreement. The courts so far have extended the same rights and rules to both heterosexual and homosexual couples, Hertz says. Every state has different laws, so if moving in doesn't work out, you'll want to speak with a local lawyer. LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"(CNN) -- Islamic tradition is not often lauded for its influence on couture, but a Turkish fashion label has won a prestigious international art prize awarded to artworks inspired by Islam's heritage. Dice Kayek, established in 1992 by sisters Ece and Ayse Ege, triumphed over 270 entries from all over the world to claim the Jameel Prize, given biannually by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The sisters, who live and work between Istanbul and Paris, were the first fashion designers ever to be nominated for the art prize, which comes with a $40,000 award. They beat nine other finalists with their collection, named Istanbul Contrast, which was inspired by the Turkish city's architectural tradition. ""Every dress is a symbol and interpretation of Istanbul's diverse architecture. It's a city of contrast, where east meets west and modernity and tradition coexist"" explained Ece Ege. Dice Kayek's garments tell a story of Istanbul's rich history by weaving references to intricate Byzantine mosaics and opulent robes of Ottoman rulers, but their creations also have a modern, international edge. They are sold in 35 countries on five continents, and the label is a member of the prestigious Fédération Française de la Couture, alongside names like Chanel and Balenciaga. The brand's winning collection was created in 2009, and has already been shown in some of the world's leading museums such as Le Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, Amsterdam Museum and Istanbul Museum of Modern Arts. Martin Roth, Director of the V&A and chair of the distinguished panel of judges, which included Zaha Hadid and Thomas Heatherwick, lauded the designers' ability to translate the spirit of Islamic tradition for the modern era: ""We were struck by the way that Dice Kayek's work uses Islamic inspiration in a completely secular context, taking it into a new world, that of contemporary fashion."" Other shortlisted entries included jewelry, textiles, installations, and calligraphy, created by an eclectic group of artists from diverse backgrounds ranging from Saudi Arabia to France. An exhibition of work by the winner and nine short-listed artists and designers runs at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London until April 21 2014.

"(CNN) -- Most of us wake up from nightmares relieved that we're safe in bed. But a small fraction uncontrollably act out their dreams as they unfold, endangering themselves or others. The recent movie ""Sleepwalk With Me,"" about a struggling stand-up comedian and his issues with sleep, brings to light a rare condition called REM behavior disorder. This film is not a documentary, but lead actor and director Mike Birbiglia has said that many events, including the dangerous behaviors while asleep, are based on his real life. Matt Pandamiglio, Birbiglia's character, drives hundreds of miles to any comedy gig he can possibly get to, away from the girlfriend he isn't sure he wants to marry. In the midst of all this, Pandamiglio experiences dramatic episodes of acting out his dreams. For instance, while staying at a hotel alone, he jumps through the window of his room because, in his dream, he's being pursued by a missile targeting him. Although the film is called ""Sleepwalk With Me,"" Pandamiglio isn't sleepwalking per se -- he's kicking, running, climbing on top of things and falling off them. After repeatedly delaying a doctor's visit, he finally gets the diagnosis of REM behavior disorder, which affects less than 1% of the population, according to the American Sleep Association. Unusual patterns of behavior that people exhibit while sleeping are called parasomnias. Most of them are most likely to happen when a person is sleep-deprived and under stress, said Philip Gehrman, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. Sleepwalking and REM behavior disorder are two examples of parasomnias. Sleepwalking happens during non-REM sleep; it usually involves walking around and perhaps mumbling. Comedian Birbiglia on truth and fiction in 'Sleepwalk With Me' REM is a stage of deep sleep during which certain parts of the body are normally paralyzed temporarily. ""The brain sends out the signals to move, but at the level of the spinal cord, the motor neurons are inhibited,"" said Dr. William C. Dement, a pioneer in the field of sleep research and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. But that inhibition fails in REM behavior disorder, allowing the person to move in the way that he or she is envisioning in a dream. ""It can be very dangerous,"" Dement said. REM behavior disorder and sleepwalking are defined as separate disorders, but in reality there may be some overlap, Dement said. Dement and Dr. Rafael Pelayo, associate professor at Stanford medical school, said they have never seen patients who jumped out of windows, but some have punched windows. Dement appears as himself in ""Sleepwalk With Me,"" sitting in the passenger seat beside the struggling comedian while he's dreaming/listening to Dement's audio book in the car. (It's a little reminiscent of Cornel West's cameo in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" another widely known academic in surreal circumstances.) ""In the simplistic way of thinking, the brain is either awake, sleeping or dreaming,"" Pelayo said. ""But we know that the brain is complicated enough that one part can be awake while another part can be sleeping at the same time."" In sleepwalking, the rational part of the brain is offline, while the emotional part is activated, he said. Most people with REM behavior disorder are men, and they tend to be older, Pelayo said. The disorder can mark the start of Parkinson's disease. It's unusual for someone as young as Birbiglia, 34, to exhibit REM behavior disorder, Pelayo said. But it's possible that he has a combination of sleepwalking and REM behavior disorder, he said. The film portrayed Birbiglia's character exhibiting several risk factors: drinking alcohol, staying up late, sleeping in different environments and being under stress. Sleepwalking by itself is more common, especially among children. Research suggests that as many as 30% of children have experienced sleepwalking. Most people stop once they hit puberty, Gehrman said. Sleepwalking has occurred among nearly one in three Americans at some point in their lives, a study in Neurology found in May. As for whether someone should awaken people who are in one of these altered sleep states, it's more dangerous for others than for the sleepers, experts say. The sleepers' brains will not be impaired by waking up, but they may react violently. Sleepwalking among adults is not necessarily a problem. For mild cases, education about the phenomenon and reassurance are enough, Gehrman said. But if the person goes outside and gets into dangerous situations, he or she may need to sleep more and undergo stress management interventions. If that doesn't work, especially among people who have been sleepwalking for their whole lives, medications may be necessary. The drug that sleepwalkers tend to start with is the anti-anxiety medication clonazepam, Gehrman said. It's not clear why it works, but it may help people relax and sleep more deeply. Clonazepam is also prescribed for REM behavior disorder, although it is sometimes not appropriate in older patients because it may aggravate sleep apnea, Pelayo said. There's evidence that the hormone melatonin can be effective. Some people don't respond to any medications for sleepwalking, Gehrman said. It may help to put a bell on the door so that if they try to leave the bedroom, they will wake up -- or at least their bed partner will, he said. In extreme cases, people need restraints so that they can't get out of bed during the night, Gehrman said -- something that attaches them to the bed in such a way that only someone who is awake could undo it. Birbiglia has said in interviews that, as with his alter ego in the film, he takes medication and sleeps in a sleeping bag, and he used to wear mittens so that he couldn't open the bag. Gehrman hasn't had any patients who have tried the bag-and-mittens method but noted, ""You have to be creative sometimes."" Experts say there isn't a lot of research going on into sleepwalking or REM behavior disorder treatments since the available resources are sufficient in most people. The next step in REM behavior disorder is exploring the connection to Parkinson's disease, Pelayo said. It may be possible to identify patients for whom the sleep disorder is a risk factor for Parkinson's and treat them before the disease gets worse.

"(CNN) -- Over the past month, North Korea's 29-year-old leader, Kim Jong Un, has threatened to attack Washington with nuclear weapons, declared a state of war with neighboring South Korea and warned diplomats to evacuate the peninsula. The Obama administration has sent conflicting responses: first deploying bombers and new missile defense assets to the region, then appearing to back off and calling for dialogue with Pyongyang. This is a pattern the North has come to expect of all U.S. administrations. Historically, after major provocations, the United States has returned to the bargaining table with North Korea within, on average, five months of a provocation. And, of course, the North has typically cheated and raised further demands based on improved nuclear explosions and more capable missiles developed while leaders were in dialogue mode. We will not negotiate our way out of this one. On the other hand, sanctions and pressure have not deterred the North from its nuclear weapons path. Is the North Korea problem unsolvable? No. But U.S. policy must be based on realistic assessments of five factors: the North's intentions, the danger involved, the efficacy of dialogue, the approach to China, and the role of our alliances. 1) What does North Korea want? This answer should not be so hard to figure out. The North's highest national priority is the capability to threaten the United States, our Pacific bases and our allies with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. Almost nothing will knock it off this path. Do the leaders want respect, aid, lifting of sanctions and legitimacy? Of course: But the regime has determined that these come from owning nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The North's outrageous threats are designed to elicit compromise and restraint from the other powers in the region -- to frighten us away from imposing U.N. Security Council sanctions for the latest nuclear and missile tests. Pyongyang wants first to establish itself undeniably as the world's newest nuclear weapons power. The regime may then freeze one part of its program temporarily, or promise a moratorium to receive food, energy and money, but the pattern has been consistent in later breaking away from whatever agreement was reached. If nuclear weapons were just about deterring the United States, then a nonaggression pact or peace treaty might have some possibility. U.S. administrations, from those of Barack Obama to George H.W. Bush, have offered North Korea security assurances more than 33 times. But the regime needs these weapons to deter China, to keep its army loyal and to juxtapose its weapons status against rival South Korea's enormous successes on the international stage. In the regime's view, the weapons are indispensable to its survival. Opinion: North Korea endgame -- 3 scenarios . 2) What is the danger? North Korea can be deterred. The young Kim's use of nuclear weapons would destroy the regime. The North Koreans might have everything to lose, but we -- as rich and comfortable societies -- have much more to lose. That is the leverage the North seeks to exploit. Pyongyang's increasingly brazen threats could reflect the exuberance and inexperience of a young untested leader, but may also reflect the belief that threats can be made with greater impunity when backed by a handful of nuclear weapons. If the North is beginning to produce nuclear weapons not only from plutonium harvested from its Yongbyon reactor, but also from uranium, then it may soon be able to produce more than one nuclear device, if not weapon, a year. This could lead to even more dangerous threats and demands -- including a possible repeat of the threat to transfer nuclear know-how to other countries. The other danger stems from the North's brinkmanship strategy itself. For five decades, the North has mastered the art of manufacturing crises and then pulling back from the brink. A CSIS study found that within two months of a rupture in negotiations, North Korea ratchets up another crisis with a provocation -- only to be rewarded with regional powers' diplomacy efforts within five to six months. With increasing confidence in its nuclear and missile programs, will Pyongyang come closer to that line? Will Kim Jong Un feel pressure not to back down in order to prove his credentials as a marshall of the DPRK? Will he pick the wrong targets and invite a South Korean retaliatory strike? Nuclear weapons: Who has what? 3) The efficacy of dialogue . The history of this torrid cycle of crisis diplomacy suggests that sooner or later, the Obama administration will be back at the negotiating table to rent a temporary cessation of North Korean belligerence, just as previous administrations have done. But the definition of madness is to do the same thing over and over hoping that the outcome will be different. It won't. That is why the main track now has to be pressure. Not war, but serious and sustained pressure by all parties that constrains weapons development and proliferation. 4) The China calculus . Of course, sustained pressure is impossible without China's involvement. For the first time in years, there is reason to hope China may be more helpful. Beijing is clearly exasperated with the North. The new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is more decisive than his predecessor. His new foreign policy team views Pyongyang with a jaundiced eye after years of mopping up the diplomatic messes. Even sacrosanct assumptions, such as the North's role as a vital strategic buffer for China, are being hotly debated in Beijing. But we should not expect China to coerce its troublesome client. Beijing remains preoccupied with maintaining stability. Xi cannot push through the economic package he hopes to table in the fall without support from regime conservatives, especially in the military, who favor the status quo on the Korean Peninsula. Party chieftains administering the Chinese provinces bordering North Korea are critical to meaningful enforcement of tightened sanctions, but they care more about the flourishing border trade and investment opportunities in the North than implementing the will of the U.N. Security Council. Such constraints make it difficult for the senior leadership to -- as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry put it last week -- ""bear down"" on Pyongyang. This means the United States must avoid the temptation to make cooperation on North Korea a litmus test for U.S.-China ties. Doing so will only stiffen Chinese resistance and result in disappointment and increased bilateral friction. It also risks increasing U.S. ownership of the problem at a time when we want China to do more. Instead, we need to persuade China to drop its parochial approach in favor of cooperation that is strategic, farsighted and genuine, and part of the overall framework of our long-term security relationship. We must convince China that North Korea's actions are creating what Beijing most fears â€” greater U.S. military presence in the region and enhanced trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea. North Korea's missile capabilities . 5) Allies matter . A failure to stop North Korea's nuclear programs will irreparably damage our alliances in Asia. Not so much because it will lead to a nuclear Japan or South Korea, but because it will raise doubts about U.S. staying power and ability to provide security to the region. Any U.S. outreach to China about development of a long-term strategy for Korea must be grounded in deep trilateral planning and coordination with America's allies, South Korea and Japan. Indeed, all eyes will be on the new South Korean President Park Geun-hye as she lays out her vision to President Obama when they meet next month. Her brain trust has talked about quietly reaching out to change Beijing's view of its strategic equities on the peninsula. This argument will be more persuasive only if it is grounded in unprecedented levels of U.S.-Japan-South Korea cooperation on missile defense, intelligence sharing, military exercises,and missile defense collaboration in response to the North Korean threat. The allies are key to deterring the North and motivating China -- and to our longer-term position in the region beyond this North Korean footnote in world history.","Writers: North Korea's priority is being able to threaten U.S. and allies with nuclear arms .
It's a circular game, they say. North bullies, steps back; U.S. threatens, then talks .

"(CNN) -- A Native American chief has asked all tribal employees not to use FedEx until the Washington Redskins changes its team name. ""Until the name of the NFL team is changed to something less inflammatory and insulting, I direct all employees to refrain from using FedEx when there is an alternative available,"" Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear penned in his directive to all employees. The tribe also issued a news release saying that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder ""chooses to stick with a brand which dictionaries define as disparaging and offensive. FedEx chose to endorse that brand through their sponsorship of Mr. Snyder's organization."" It concludes, ""The Osage Nation chooses not to use FedEx services. We encourage other tribal nations to consider similar actions."" Standing Bear was not available for an interview, but Assistant Chief Raymond Red Corn said the tribe would ""stand-pat"" on the press release. ""It was not our intention to become a news item,"" he said, adding that ""ethics"" drove the tribe's decision. The Redskins play their home games at FedExField, to which the shipping giant purchased the naming rights in a 27-year, $207 million deal in 1999, Forbes reports. Fred Smith, FedEx's chairman, president and CEO, is part of the team's ownership group. Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx's senior vice president of marketing and communications, released a statement Wednesday saying that his employer values its sponsorship of the stadium and ""we are proud that FedExField is a venue that is used by a wide range of community groups."" ""FedEx has closely followed the dialogue and difference of opinion concerning the Washington Redskins team name, but we continue to direct questions about the name to the franchise owner,"" Fitzgerald said. Snyder has repeatedly defended the name and wrote in a March letter that the name ""captures the best of who we are and who we can be, by staying true to our history and honoring the deep and enduring values our name represents."" The team has employed Native Americans to defend the name and launched a site called Redskins Facts to promote its stance that the names honors Native Americans rather than disparages them. The team also has created a foundation to provide resources to tribal communities. The good deed hasn't stemmed the controversy as opposition to the name persists, and President Barack Obama said last year that if he were Snyder, he might change the name. In June, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled six trademarks belonging to the team, saying they were offensive. The team appealed the decision, saying it spent millions defending the trademark, and the patent office ruled the Redskins could use the logos until the years-long appeals process was complete. The National Congress of American Indians has spoken out against the use of Redskins and other Native American mascots, and the Native Voice Network, which represents numerous Native American organizations, has targeted FedEx in its effort to convince Snyder to change the team name. The Native Voice Network says use of ""R-word"" has a negative, dehumanizing effect on children, a major concern when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says suicide is the second-leading cause of death among Native American people between the ages of 15 and 24. Chrissie Castro, the Native Voice Network's ""network weaver,"" says her group ""definitely"" supports Osage Nation. ""We're very proud of their position and we'd love to see other tribal communities do the same,"" she said. The Oklahoma tribe has about 18,000 members and is situated in Osage County, the setting for the Meryl Streep movie, ""August: Osage County."" CNN's Devon M. Sayers contributed to this report.","Chief: Don't use FedEx until Redskins change ""disparaging and offensive"" name .

O'Mara died at a nursing home in Sussex, UK, according to her agent, Phil Belfield. ""Kate O'Mara passed away peacefully today at a nursing home in Sussex after a short Illness,"" Belfield wrote in a statement. ""She was a delight to know and an extraordinary woman and actress with a passion for Shakespeare and stage acting. ""A shining star has gone out and she will be sadly missed by all who have known and worked with her.""

To American audiences, however, she's probably best known as Cassandra ""Caress"" Morell, the glamorous, conniving sister of Joan Collins' equally conniving (and glamorous) Alexis Colby in ""Dynasty,"" the ABC prime-time soap about feuding oil clans. Caress appeared midway through the show's 1981-1989 run to battle with Alexis, threatening to tell all in a book called ""Sister Dearest."" But Alexis, as she so often did, emerged victorious, purchasing the book's publisher and making sure the work never saw the light of day. Collins remembered O'Mara on Twitter. ""Tragic news about Kate O Mara, we had great fun on Dynasty when she played my sister Caress who Alexis insisted on calling CASSIE ! RIP,"" she tweeted. O'Mara was a talented actress -- she kept her talent sharp with frequent stage appearances, including performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company -- but she was more recognized for her stunning looks. She was quick to acknowledge the role her beauty played in her career. ""Because my career has been based so much on my looks, when I finally pass my 'sell-by' date I think I'll probably pack it in,"" she once said in an interview, according to The Guardian. However, she kept acting almost until her death. Just last fall, she could be seen in London's West End theater district performing in ""An Evening with Kate O'Mara.""

"(CNN) -- At Nassau's Potter's Cay Dock, fresh conch is heaped on tables for sale by the pound. The quayside is chaotic with pallets of food and household goods being hauled into the mail boats. Mail boats are the life-support system of the Bahamas -- an archipelago of 700 scattered islands in the Atlantic. Some 14 to 18 mail boats operate out of Nassau; no one seems sure how many. They serve communities, such as Ragged Island (population 73), that are too remote or small to receive sufficient airfreight. The vessels are privately owned family concerns that supplement government-awarded mail contracts by running cargo. They also take on board paying passengers.

Despite their unpredictability, mail boats offer an adventurous, authentic travel experience away from the Bahamas' well developed beach resort scene.

""They were running in the 1940s but only one mail boat would serve all southern Bahamas monthly,"" he says. ""The government began issuing mail contracts in the late Fifties, then services became weekly."" Brozozog says he was born into shipping.

""If it arrived on a Sunday, even church was canceled."" Ernest Hemingway's boxing lessons . Bimini, which lies two-thirds of the way from Nassau to Miami, is another island served by the mail boats.

""Fuel costs have risen so much it's wiped out our profit from the mail contract, so we rely on private cargo"" he says.

The powerful system strengthened to a Category 4 storm early Thursday as it churned through the North Atlantic with wind speeds of 140 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported. The storm is expected to brush Bermuda on Friday, but Gonzalo's path could still vary enough that officials aren't ruling out a direct hit on the island. Bermuda is now under a hurricane warning. Gonzalo is expected to cause powerful, gusty winds, heavy rains of up to 6 inches and flooding as it closes in. The storm hit the Virgin Islands on Monday, causing some property damage and power outages. Meantime, Tropical Storm Ana in the Pacific also is on the radar.

"(CNN) -- Outside of superheroes, young adult adaptations have become one of the few thing studios can count on. From the ""Twilight"" series ($3.3 billion earned globally) to ""Harry Potter"" ($7.7 billion total) to ""The Hunger Games"" ($1.5 billion worldwide so far), franchises based on popular books made for adolescents have turned into a safer gamble. With the alluring promise of an eager, built-in fanbase, even stand-alone YA adaptations -- like ""The Fault In Our Stars,"" which opened at No. 1 in June -- hold the potential to be deliciously lucrative. Taking stock of the studio landscape, it isn't too surprising that ""The Giver's"" moment at the movies has finally come to pass. Based on Lois Lowry's best-selling, award-winning 1993 novel, ""The Giver"" actually struggled to make it into production, being ahead of its time with dystopian themes of an all-controlling government and a young boy who begins to rebel against it. That sounds de rigueur now, but in the '90s the book's popularity was only eclipsed by its reputation among some as too disturbing for the classroom. Lowry's story follows a 12-year-old named Jonas who is raised in what he believes is a utopia, a place where conformity isn't an option and being different can cost you your life. The residents' world is void of color and strong emotion, but they also don't suffer from war or pain, and have no memories to remind them of what they're missing. Grownups: Don't be ashamed of your YA habit . When Jonas is elected to become the Receiver of Memory, he learns from The Giver -- the wizened, silver-haired gentleman seen gazing out from the book cover -- all that's amiss in his world. Lowry's tale resonated with actor Jeff Bridges upon its release, and he initially pictured his father, Lloyd Bridges, playing the role of The Giver. But Bridges' road to getting the movie made turned out to be longer than he thought. According to Lowry, Bridges and his team first approached her about two years after ""The Giver"" was published. ""He was passionate about the book,"" Lowry said at the movie's August 11 premiere in New York. ""What sold me on it was his passion. I knew he wouldn't let the themes and ideas of the books be lost."" A brief history of young adult literature . But the actor's passion had to sustain him for 18 years as he lost the movie rights and regained them again. ""Originally I wanted to direct my father in the movie, and he is no longer with us,"" Bridges said of his dad, who died in 1998. ""But I was originally inspired by this old grisly guy on the cover of Lowry's book, and more and more I started to look like this old, grizzled guy,"" the now-64-year-old continued. ""And I thought, 'Oh, maybe I can play this part,' so I'm just thrilled we put together this wonderful team and after 18 years we finally got it up on screen."" With Bridges installed as The Giver, the movie tapped Australian actor Brenton Thwaites to play Jonas, who in the movie is already a teenager rather than on the cusp of becoming one. Young adult books that changed our lives . Jonas' older age is one of the tweaks the movie adaptation made to accommodate the story for the screen. For critics, the movie hasn't exactly lived up to the book, but for Lowry the movie's right on time. ""If they had made the movie 20 years ago, or even 18 years ago when they first optioned it, many things couldn't have happened,"" Lowry said. ""Jeff Bridges wasn't old enough to play the title role. Some of the kids in the movie weren't even born and the technology wasn't as good. They made a better movie because they waited.""

"(CNN) -- Arsenal overturned a two-goal deficit to beat Hull City 3-2 after extra time in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Aaron Ramsey's strike in the 109th-minute sealed an 11th victory in England's premier cup competition and a first trophy in nine years for Arsene Wenger's side. Unfancied Hull, who were playing in their first FA Cup final, raced into a 2-0 lead in a frantic opening to the match. In the fourth minute, James Chester redirected a Tom Huddlestone volley shot past Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabiański. Five minutes later Curtis Davies found the back of the net again, side-footing home after the Polish keeper had deflected Alex Bruce's header onto the post. Santi Cazorla halved the deficit with a superbly taken free-kick in the 17th minute, but Wenger's side remained second best for the remainder of the half as Hull successfully disrupted the north Londoner's usually fluent passing game. Steve Bruce's men continued to frustrate Arsenal who were becoming more potent in open play, but it was another set piece that ended up unlocking Hull's defense -- Laurent Koscielny turning the ball in from a corner kick in the 71st minute. Deadlock ensued for the remainder of normal time but as the game moved into the first extra period, it was Arsenal who grew in stature as Hull's players wilted. Aaron Ramsey finally delivered the killer blow, firing a low shot past goalkeeper Allan McGregor to send Arsenal ahead for the first time in the match. As the clock ticked down Hull searched gamely for an equalizer and nearly got one when Fabianski rushed out from his area, but substitute Sone Aluko's shot from a tight angle rolled agonizingly across the face of goal. ""I'm very happy for the players,"" Arsene Wenger told ITV Sport after the game. ""I think it is a turning point in the lifespan of this team -- to know that they can win in that way was very important today."" ""I have praised many times the spirit of this team and I'm very proud of them today,"" the 64-year-old added. ""Congratulations to Hull, they played fantastic for the whole game today. We won it in the end but they played very well.""","Arsenal's nine-year wait for a trophy is over following FA Cup triumph against Hull City .

"(CNN) -- Will they or won't they? After reports started swirling that 90s boy band *NSync might be staging a reunion at Sunday's MTV Music Awards, the Internet went a bit wild in the form of everything from reasons why it HAD to happen to gifs meant to display fans' reactions. But don't start tearing up your heart just yet. Band member Lance Bass had something to say about the rumors Tuesday night on his SiriusXM show, ""Dirty Pop with Lance Bass."" Bass said that in light of the fact that fellow band member (now solo phenom) Justin Timberlake is slated to receive the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the show ""... of course people are automatically going to think we're going to be there performing."" ""We all came down here [to Miami] except for J.C. [Chasez],"" Bass said. ""J.C. stayed in California, he had to work...Joey [Fatone], Chris [Kirkpatrick] and myself went to go see Justin's last show with Jay Z at the [Sun Life] Stadium last Friday, and I even took a picture of it, it's on my Instagram."" Bass said he believes that's what kicked off speculation that the group, who went on hiatus in 2002, would be getting back together. He said he expected the rumors, but has been amazed by how much interest was generated. ""It's amazing to see the reaction out there on Twitter and social media ... of how many people are supporting 'NSYNC,"" he said. ""It's so nice to see because when we ended things [over] ten years ago, there was no social media, there was no Twitter [fan base], but it's so cute to see how many people are supporting [us] and 'NSYNC was even trending."" But take heart, fans, because Bass stopped short of a complete denial that a reunion performance might happen. When ""Real Housewife of Miami"" Lea Black, who was on the show, pointed out that ""the fans should start demanding a reunion,"" Bass responded, ""That would be an amazing time.""","*NSync band member says he knew rumors were coming .

"Trieste, Italy (CNN) -- Nudging the border with Slovenia in Italy's far north-east, the mysteriously underrated city of Trieste is largely known for its stately, Habsburg-era architecture, exquisite coffee, and traditional regattas. But for a few days every year in July, it's also one of the most important places on the planet to discover the next best thing in the world of fashion design. Since launching in 2002, the International Talent Support (ITS) contest has invited students from 70 countries -- spanning a network of nearly 1000 schools and universities -- to compete for a breadth of awards, celebrating not just clothes, but jewelery, accessories and, for the first time this year, art. In doing so, it's become a ganglion for industry honchos who, if they're not otherwise adjudicating the awards, can be found trawling the vast exhibition hall for indications of the next Prada, Versace or McQueen. ""This is all about young creativity,"" says ITS director Barbara Franchin. ""They're the future, so of course we must offer them friendship and support.""

"(CNN) -- Jared Gabay is like many other college students. When he has a big test coming up, he turns to what's called a ""study drug"" for a little extra boost. ""I'm more driven. I don't focus on anything else,"" the Auburn University senior says about taking the drugs. ""If I have a paper, that's all I'm doing. No distractions, no socializing, just on with it. "" Gabay takes the prescription drug Adderall, designed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. He doesn't have ADHD or a prescription, but the drug is not hard for him to get. ""It's easy -- not sketchy or perceived in a bad way,"" he says. ""Maybe a simple text or a phone call. 'Hey mind if I get some Adderall? I've got a long night ahead of me.'"" After taking the pill he hits the books in his fraternity house room, pulling an all-nighter studying. It's a scene that is playing out at college campuses across the United States. Alan DeSantis, a professor and researcher at the University of Kentucky, has tracked study drug use there. ""It's abused more than marijuana and easier to get,"" he says. DeSantis' research found that 30% of students at the university have illegally used a stimulant, like the ADHD drugs Adderall or Ritalin. The numbers increase with upperclassmen. Half of all juniors and seniors have used the drugs, the study found, and 80% of upperclassmen in fraternities and sororities have taken them. Adderall is an amphetamine and can be habit forming. The federal government lists it as a schedule II drug. Drugs in that category have, according to U.S. law ""the highest abuse potential and dependence profile of all drugs that have medical utility."" Dr. Raymond Kotwicki, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University's school of medicine in Atlanta, says he worries about students who might take these drugs. ""They might produce euphoria, they might temporarily make it easier... but in the long run there are significant problems both in terms of thinking, mood problems, maybe even functionality."" Kotwicki, who also is the medical director at the Skyland Trail mental health treatment facility in Atlanta, says drugs like Adderall can produce jitters, headaches, stomach problems or even eventually lead to psychosis, a mental disorder that includes the loss of contact with reality. Additionally, he worries about pressure on students to be perfect, saying, ""If you're a student and you feel you are not good enough to be able to do things without the aid of external help, that's an idea that gets reinforced that can lead to a whole bunch of different problems."" Students apparently don't see it that way. Another telling statistic from DeSantis' research at the University of Kentucky is how dangerous the students think these cognitive enhancing stimulants are. They say they see Adderall as slightly more dangerous than the soft drink Mountain Dew and nowhere near as dangerous as drinking beer and smoking. Taking drugs without a prescription or buying the controlled substances is illegal and students who use the drugs could face prosecution. But for students like Gabay, use of study drugs is so common they don't see it as a problem. ""I would see how the law is there,"" he says. ""I consider it kind of an unwritten rule. It's accepted. ... It's OK if you're just getting it for one thing. If you're consistently using it and not prescribed that's crossing the line."" Some scientists say cognitive enhancement drugs should be carefully legalized and made available for this kind of use. In the journal Nature in 2008, a commentary by five researchers said, ""We should welcome new methods of improving our brain function."" They added, ""Safe and effective cognitive enhancers will benefit both the individual and society."" Gabay says the drug works for him. ""I'm just in a really good mood right now,"" he says, leaving a university building. ""I just did great on the test. I can still feel some of the effects, but they are starting to wear off."" He aced the test and got an A in the class. It's something Gabay has seen happen over and over since he started taking study drugs. He says he used to get Cs, but now with the help of Adderall, it's B's and A's.","Researcher finds 30% of students have illegally used ADHD drugs Adderall or Ritalin .

"(CNN) -- China's string of amazing hotel openings continues next month with the completion of the Sunrise Kempinski Hotel, Beijing. Due to open in mid-November, the eye-catching 97-meter-high luxury hotel has 21 floors filled with 306 guestrooms and suites. It's designed by Shanghai Huadu Architect Design Co. and sits on the shore of Yanqi Lake, about 60 kilometers from Beijing's city center. Behind the design . Though ""traditional"" is the last word that comes to mind when looking at the orb-like structure, there are a number of classic Chinese elements at play. For one, it was designed to look like a rising sun, which designers say is symbolic of China's fast-growing economy. The entrance to the Sunrise Kempinski is shaped like the mouth of a fish, symbolizing prosperity. From a side angle, the hotel takes on the appearance of a scallop, which represents fortune in Chinese culture. Spanning 18,075 square meters, the exterior glass surface is covered by more than 10,000 glass panels. The panels are angled so that the top portion of the building reflects the color of the sky, the middle reflects nearby Yanshan Mountain and the bottom section reflects the lake. At night, the hotel is lit up by hydroelectric-powered LED lights. ""We had an international team (of designers) because we needed a critical view from people outside of China to give their opinion on modern contemporary Chinese architectural design and to enable us to broaden our ideas on how we can use our design to showcase the Chinese culture to the world,"" said chief designer Zhang Hai Ao in a statement. Interiors were designed by U.S.-based DiLeonardo Design. The entire complex in which Sunrise Kempinski sits takes up 14 square kilometers -- it's the brand's largest property in China. Aside from the main hotel there are an additional 111 rooms at the Yanqi Hotel and another 178 spread across 12 boutique hotels on a nearby private island. The complex has 14 restaurants and bars, two spas, a private marina, pagoda, recreational and fitness facilities and a kids club. The company says it took 24 months to build with help from more than 9,300 construction workers. China now renowned for amazing hotel architecture . The Sunrise Kempinski is just the latest in a long line of incredible hotels to open in China in recent years. Arguably the most notable of the lot is the horseshoe-shaped Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort, which attracted global attention when it opened in August 2013. Just more than 100 meters high and 116 meters wide, it covers an area of 75 acres with a total floor area of 95,000 square meters. Designed by Beijing-based architect Ma Yansong of MAD architects, it's made up of ""layers"" of floors to create a ring that rises from the south bank of Huzhou's Taihu Lake.

"(CNN) -- Making the jump from model to designer seemed like a natural choice for Hiwot Gashaw. Growing up in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, the young entrepreneur always had a passion for fashion, drawing clothes from an early age. Thus, it was no big surprise when in 2012, having already worked as a professional fashion model and after graduating from a top design school, Gashaw took to making her own clothes with the launch of her label, Abugida Fashion. Fusing traditional Ethiopian designs with contemporary Western style, Abugida produces and sells a collection of clothes ranging from women's dresses and scarves to men's designer jackets and children's clothing. ""'Abugida' means learning something new,"" says Gashaw, who started her brand at the age of 22, ""and with fashion I learn something new every day."" Ethiopian garments are often created from woolen materials and they're usually traditionally hand stitched. Gashaw, who is involved in the entire process, from designing the outfits to adding the final embroidery details, has continued to use this trend in her intricate creations. ""What makes my clothes unique is [that] you can wear them anytime,"" says Gashaw. ""Also, I design and sew them myself, giving them a personal touch."" Read this: Luxury shoes put sparkle in your step . Based on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the company has six full-time workers -- former street girls and elderly beggars, who have all been trained by Gashaw herself. ""I work with these women who used to be in the streets,"" says the young designer. ""But now I trained them, they work with me and they are able to support themselves."" Gashaw cites expensive machinery and tracing raw materials as the main challenges for her startup but says that she will continue using fashion to change the lives of women in her community. Ambitious and determined, the talented designer has high hopes for her brand. ""I want Abugida Fashion to become a brand like Gucci and to be known all over the world,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- Prepare a pot of damn fine coffee and enjoy a slice of cherry pie: ""Twin Peaks"" is coming back. The offbeat TV series, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, will be returning to television in 2016, according to a strange (of course) video posted on Showtime's YouTube channel. The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me."" ""Dear Twitter Friends... it is happening again ... #damngoodcoffee,"" Lynch tweeted. According to a press release from Showtime, ""Twin Peaks"" will be a limited series of nine episodes. Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine. When it debuted, ""Twin Peaks"" was like nothing else that had ever aired on television. Lynch (then best known as the director of ""Eraserhead"" and ""Blue Velvet"") and Frost -- who had written for ""Hill Street Blues"" -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper, who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The murder mystery was only the entry point into a bizarre world, one that was alternately drily witty and brutally violent. The straight-arrow Cooper was fond of a diner's ""damn fine coffee"" and pie to an almost absurd degree. The show featured a one-armed man, a dancing dwarf, rumblings at the local lumber mill and a malevolent spirit named BOB. The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music. In addition to MacLachlan, the show starred Ray Wise, Lara Flynn Boyle, Peggy Lipton and Joan Chen. ""Twin Peaks"" started off a huge hit, but as the plot became more obscure and the mood became darker, the audience dwindled, especially in the second season. However, those who stayed with it were a hardcore bunch, enough to prompt the theatrical film so Lynch could tie up some loose ends (or not, being Lynch). Despite diverse reviews, the show remains one of the most influential in television history, with its involvement of a noted movie director, its willingness to take audiences to far-out places, its deliberate pace and its obsessed-about plot points and character tics. In many ways, it was ahead of its time. Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new ""Twin Peaks"" episodes. ""What more can I say -- 'Twin Peaks' with David Lynch and Mark Frost on Showtime in 2016!"" said Showtime President David Nevins. ""To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'""","David Lynch, Mark Frost bringing back ""Twin Peaks""

"(CNN) -- In fall 2012, Roni Tarver was in a bad mood. The 5-foot-6-inch teacher weighed 235 pounds and suffered back pain almost constantly. She was popping 10 to 15 ibuprofen daily, which took a toll on her stomach. It didn't help that she was on her feet most of the day and dealing with the stress and exhaustion of being a relatively new teacher. Her husband never once said anything about her weight, which made her feel worse about not taking care of herself. She had quit smoking, but knew she needed to get active because climbing stairs still left her winded. ""I really married the most sweet, wonderful, compassionate man in the world. He never made me feel bad about it, so I think I felt more guilty,"" said Tarver, 29, a high-school agriculture teacher who lives in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. She remembers thinking, ""Why aren't you taking the initiative? This man loves you for who you are."" She had never had the body she wanted. By that November, she had had enough. She was done being just the outgoing, funny girl. She was done being heavy. ""I found myself crying in bed one night over my weight, and my husband told me that he thought I was beautiful, but if I was so unhappy, I should do something about it,"" Tarver wrote on CNN iReport. ""This triggered something in me."" The very next day, she said, she began monitoring her calories and walking or riding the stationary bicycle six days a week. After two months, she was brave enough to step foot inside a gym. That was January 3, 2013. Soon after, she signed up for her first Zumba class. It was the beginning of her new life. Tarver started sampling every available evening dance class. As the daughter of an aerobic dance instructor, the movements came easily. By the third week, she wanted to be there all the time, dancing to exhaustion under the club lights in the gym's group fitness room. She supplemented classes with one to two nights working out on the elliptical machine and lifting weights. ""My instructors were amazing, and made me feel like they loved having me there,"" she said. ""I was having a blast exercising for the first time in my life."" One of her instructors, now a close friend, found her on Facebook and would message her if Tarver missed a class. She also offered to make her CDs with music she noticed Tarver liked in class. After 10 months, Tarver's teacher encouraged her to get certified to teach her own classes. Tarver has been teaching Zumba and other classes that combine fitness and dance for the past four months, in addition to the classes she takes. ""You really feel like you're in a club, dancing with people, but you don't have a hangover in the morning. At the end of it, you feel awesome, you're exhausted, and you can go back and do it tomorrow if you want. It's good for your soul, if you ask me."" Tarver knew exercise wasn't enough to really get healthy. She had to change her eating habits, too. She didn't follow a particular diet, but stuck to a few principles. The first few months, she rarely ate out, if at all, and cut out fast food in favor of salmon or grilled chicken with vegetables. At school, she ate a protein shake or bar for breakfast, a banana, apple, pear or some clementines for a snack, more fruit and a low-calorie frozen dinner for lunch. She used a calorie counter app on her phone to track her intake, sticking to about 1,500 to 1,700 calories per day based on how fast or slow she was losing weight. She also cut out dairy, which was probably the hardest sacrifice. ""I could drink a whole gallon of whole milk in two days. I really, really liked cheese and milk a lot,"" she said. ""It was difficult at first because I was so conditioned to eating cheese, but I felt better."" After a couple of months, she allowed herself one cheat meal a week -- two bacon and egg taquitos from her favorite fast food chain every Tuesday. She still has that ritual, but is a little freer with her diet on the weekends. When Tarver started her weight loss journey in November 2012, at 235 pounds, she wore size 22 pants and was about 42% body fat. Within 14 months, she was down to 135 pounds, a size 6 and 21% body fat. Her back pain is almost completely gone, she has her dream body and is ""the happiest I have ever been."" ""I can't believe how easy it was -- how fast the weight came off when I was doing the right thing,"" she said. ""I'm thrilled out of my mind with my body."" Her husband, Tom Tarver, says Roni has always been beautiful, but it's clear to him how much better she feels. ""I'm very proud of her, and I would choose the way she feels now over however she looks,"" he said. ""She's happier, and she is just a fun person to be around. It's the kind of person you want to be married to."" Tarver fluctuates between 130 and 135 pounds and considers herself to be in maintenance mode; she carries around some extra skin from the weight loss, but will happily accept the extra skin over the extra weight. ""If I could give one piece of advice to anyone struggling with their weight, it would be to find something active that you love doing, and don't give up,"" Tarver said. ""Consistency is key to making any lifestyle changes. Find a support system and tell people what you are trying to do for yourself. When you say it out loud, you become accountable.""","Roni Tarver had never been a skinny girl .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans will require the White House to provide a detailed plan for arming and training Syrian rebels to fight ISIS in exchange for giving it the OK to carry out the mission. The provision -- which is expected to be added to a must-pass spending bill funding the government through mid-December and could face a vote as early as Wednesday in the House -- would require the Secretary of Defense to explain how the Pentagon is vetting Syrian opposition groups. The administration would need to submit its plan to Congress at least 15 days before the Pentagon begins training fighters or supplying them with weapons. Regular updates, every 90 days, would also be required. Yet another beheading. What's the world going to do about ISIS? The House GOP plan also makes it clear that the new authority would not include approval for any U.S. combat troops on the ground. Even though House Republicans want to put restrictions on the President's announced plans to go after ISIS, members of both parties have also made it clear they don't plan to stay in town to pass a formal military use of force authorization like the one approved after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The tug of the midterm elections is strong, despite sentiment among some lawmakers in both the House and Senate who think it's critically important for Congress to sign off on the broader war effort. ""I think this is really serious and that it deserves our being in town and taking it up and debating it,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Who is doing what in the coalition battle against ISIS? The House bill approving training for the Syrian rebels would expire in mid-December, at the same time the government funding bill would need to be extended. That concerned Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee. ""That doesn't make sense to me,"" Menendez said. ""You want to send the message to the Sunni world, you want to send a message to those rebels you want to fight for you, that we're not going to cut it off in December."" A House GOP Armed Services Committee aide told reporters that Republicans would ensure the training and weapons program would be extended past December. Senior Obama officials will testify before the Senate this week. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey will testify before the Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, and Secretary of State John Kerry will be on Capitol Hill Wednesday and Thursday. Is Obama's plan for confronting ISIS legal? The Senate will quickly pick up the spending bill, with the accompanying OK to arm the rebels, as soon as the House passes it, according to a Democratic leadership aide. The vote could be this week or early next week when the Senate is scheduled to adjourn until after the election. Lawmakers and senior aides predict broad bipartisan for the measure in the Senate. ""I think, by and large, you'll see a big vote in the Congress for this,"" said Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, the third-ranking Senate Republican said on MSNBC Monday. ""Both sides recognize something has to be done. We've got to be aggressive. We've got to be decisive. And we've got to rally the world behind us."" ISIS Fast Facts . However, there are numerous outspoken detractors in both parties who are critical of the proposal for a variety of reasons. Some, like Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, would prefer to debate the broader mission and have Congress vote up-or-down on whether to go to war with ISIS. In a CNN interview he blamed ""wimpishness"" as a critical factor affecting his colleagues who would prefer to leave town without that tough vote. ""Congress is very risk adverse. When you put a difficult issue before senators and congressmen they don't want to be forced to decide. In this case they should be forced to decide. We should have a vote on this mission. The American people should see their representatives in Congress make a decision on a critical national security question,"" he said . Others, like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, oppose arming the rebels out of fear the weapons will fall into the wrong hands. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and other Senate hawks want a much more aggressive strategy to destroy ISIS than the one the President is pursuing. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid set the tone for many members of his party when he argued last week the President has the authority he needs to carry out the airstrikes underway against ISIS, and that it would be a mistake for Congress to be ""rash"" in its decision making. ""We have to be deliberate in what we do,"" he said. ""Let's just not rush into things.""","The House could vote this week on the arming and training of Syrian rebels .

"(CNN) -- A 35% increase in demand for air travel. A tripling of the region's airplane fleet. Up to nearly 13,000 new planes needed. Predictions for growth in the Asia Pacific aviation industry over the next two decades are impressive. But one question keeps recurring in the region and, indeed, around the globe. Will there be enough pilots to fly the new planes and enough technicians to maintain them? ""The airlines say, 'OK, we've just bought a bunch of airplanes and we've put in all our funding into the airplane,'"" says Bony Sharma, vice president of Mil-Com Aerospace Group, a Singapore-based aviation training company. ""Now where does the funding come in to train the pilots, to train the engineers, to train even the management people, to keep these airplanes operational and safe and flying? That's the biggest challenge that we're facing."" 100 flight schools 'still not enough' Mil-Com runs training for a number of Asia-based airlines, including the privately owned Vietnamese carrier VietJet Air. Earlier in February, the low-cost carrier signed a $6.4 billion contract with Airbus for 63 new single-aisle A320 planes, the lease of seven and the option to buy a further 30 aircraft. Like so many of Asia Pacific's low cost carriers, however, VietJet Air is struggling to recruit enough personnel to fulfill its lofty ambitions, due to what Sharma describes as an ""extremely serious"" shortage of pilots. ""All the airlines in Vietnam are heavily dependent on international pilots,"" says Sharma. ""They're competing from the same pool of pilots as the Middle East, with the growth of Singapore, the growth of AirAsia. It's that same pool that all these airlines are competing for, so it's a big challenge in Vietnam."" Mil-Com has been working with VietJet Air since it was founded in 2011, training engineers, technicians and cabin crew. At February's Singapore Airshow, Mil-Com and Eagle Flight Training of New Zealand signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Vietnam's Aerospace Engineering Services JSC (AESC), to open a flight school in Vietnam, focused on training pilots. ""Even if we set up 100 airplane flying schools tomorrow, it still wouldn't be enough,"" says Sharma. ""The shortage is that extreme."" Half a million pilots needed globally . Released in August 2013, the Boeing Pilot and Technical Market Outlook for 2013-2032 forecasts nearly half a million new commercial airline pilots will be needed to fly all the new airplanes entering the world fleet over the next 20 years. The problem is acute in Asia Pacific. There the Boeing report says the explosion in demand for air travel will mean 192,300 new pilots will be required by 2032, including 77,400, or 40% of them, in China. It's an issue the industry is working to address. ""What we can do is partner with governments, partner with training agencies, partner with airlines and focus a training curriculum that allows the training of those pilots,"" says Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. ""We're trying to get out in front of it."" Together with partner airlines, Boeing runs pilot training schools in Singapore, South Korea, Australia, Japan and China. Ground crew also in short supply . Boeing's chief competitor Airbus has a training school in Beijing and last week announced a new joint venture with Singapore Airlines to set up a $64 million facility, offering full pilot training in Singapore. Mil-Com works in China, too, with joint venture training centers in Xian in central northwest China and in Tianjin southeast of Beijing. As in Vietnam, the country is heavily dependent on foreign pilots because of the shortage of trained locals. Sharma says pilots in China are paid 25% more than anywhere else in the region, and even then airlines have problems holding on to them for any more than a couple of years. But he warns there's an even more pressing area of concern in the region. ""Everybody talks about the sexy industry of pilots,"" he says. ""Nobody talks about the poor mechanic who's in the hangar working day and night, in sweat, rain and humidity."" ""That's challenge number one -- attract the talent pool, because a lot of kids just say, 'Yeah I'd rather be an IT guy, work in an air-conditioned office, rather than be standing in these conditions working on an airplane,'"" says Sharma. ""So that's a big, big challenge to attract the right talent."" According to Boeing's Pilot and Technical Market Outlook, Asia Pacific will need 215,300 new maintenance technicians to service the new airplanes entering the region between now and 2032. That's 43% of the projected global demand for technicians. David Stewart is a UK-based aviation analyst for ICF International, a government and commercial consultancy based in the Washington, D.C. area. ""You can get a new pilot in 18 months,"" he says. ""You can take it from zero, to being in the right hand seat, in 18 months. It might worry some people, but that's the truth."" ""And if you're growing at Japan Airlines you can go and recruit out of a low-fare carrier because the pilot at the low-fare carrier wants to fly a bigger plane. So the people who've got the problem finding the pilots are the low-fare carriers, the bottom of the food chain. ""Mechanics take five years before you can sign off a plane certificate for release. So the supply chain is much more difficult there because it takes longer for it to react."" Same problems, new solution? Stewart says pilot shortages have been talked about for years, as has the shortage of mechanics in the United States, yet somehow the issue always gets sorted out. Boeing's Randy Tinseth agrees. ""The market's going to double over the next 15 to 20 years, but remember it doubled over the last 15 to 20 years that we've just come through,"" he says. ""It's something we can manage through, but we have to get out ahead of it."" Relatively hidden among the thousand-plus exhibitors at last week's Singapore Airshow was a small Florida-based company called DiSTI, which says it has the software to help contribute to the industry getting ahead. DiSTI does virtual maintenance training for military aircraft, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-16. During a demonstration, in what looks like a video game, a maintenance technician circles an aircraft, in 3D. DiSTI President Joseph Swinski says his company is engaging the digital generation by giving them a platform they can relate to, with real training value. ""The aircraft's always running just like it would be in the real world,"" he says. ""So if somebody goes and pulls the wire somewhere or breaks a wire, the whole aircraft will then function in the way that it does in the real world. It's a much more realistic training."" DiSTI global sales manager Christopher Giordano says by using software, you can train more cheaply, more quickly and more effectively. ""Stereotypical maintenance training right now is all done with hardware,"" says Giordano. ""Hardware's extremely expensive to build and it breaks a lot. So if you go into a virtual world and you break something, all you need to do is hit reset and you can continue your training."" The company hopes to break into the market for training commercial aircraft maintenance technicians, but concedes this could still be some years away. ""We find the commercial guys are a little bit slower to adopt things than the military,"" says Swinski. ""The military likes to try things out and then validate it."" ""The commercial guys seem to want to wait until the military's done all that, make sure it works right and then they take a look at it. So we're kind of at that point right now."" As technology improves, simulation-based pilot certification training is also starting to take on a greater role internationally. Asia Pacific has all the predictions for growth. Whether its support systems keep pace with demand remains to be seen. Charlotte Glennie is an award-winning journalist living in Singapore.

"(CNN) -- Two teenage girls accused of aggravated stalking in the case of a young Florida girl who jumped to her death no longer face criminal charges, lawyers said Wednesday. Attorney Jose Baez, the attorney for the younger of the two girls, said the state had dropped the felony charge against her in the bullying case of Rebecca Sedwick, who was 12 when she committed suicide in September. ""We are very pleased that the state attorney's office ... has decided to do the right thing,"" Baez said, adding that he was convinced that his client had never done anything criminal. Baez said the girl was deeply affected by Sedwick's death and had been bullied herself. The girl, 13, has been in counseling, he said. ""There is zero evidence of any stalking in this case,"" he said. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said he was ""exceptionally pleased with the outcome of the case."" ""We see the children are going to get the services that they need,"" Judd said, referring to counseling services. ""That's the best outcome for juveniles."" Another girl, 14, also had her charges dropped. ""My client and her family are relieved by the state attorney's decision today,"" attorney Andrea DeMichael said. ""She is hopeful about her future and is attempting to turn this tragic event into something positive."" A member of the state attorney's office said he could not comment on cases involving juveniles and referred CNN to defense lawyers.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A southern California woman turned herself in to authorities as the person who pepper sprayed video-game shoppers in a Walmart during Black Friday's shopping frenzy, Los Angeles police said Saturday. The woman has not been charged because detectives are continuing their investigation into the incident that required firefighters to treat 10 people for exposure to pepper spray, authorities said. The woman's name wasn't released Saturday, police said. ""We have her identity and we know who she is and where she is at. When appropriate action needs to be taken, we know where to find her,"" said Officer Bruce Borihanh, a police spokesman. ""She's a suspect, but she's not booked or anything, so we're not releasing her name. ""The detectives have a lot to do. They have to interview a bunch of witnesses, the victims themselves, and from there they will determine what action needs to be taken,"" Borihanh said. The woman turned herself in Friday night at the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire station in Northridge, California, Borihanh said. The pepper-spraying incident, which occurred in a Walmart in the nearby Los Angeles neighborhood of Porter Ranch, occurred Thursday night. Borihanh said he didn't have information explaining why the woman took about 24 hours to turn herself in. Black Friday shopping was marked by violence in at least seven states, including California. At the Walmart in Porter Ranch, the pepper-spraying incident occurred when a woman doused fellow shoppers with the spray as people were grabbing for Xbox video game consoles, police said. The suspect was able to pay for her purchases and leave the store before police arrived, authorities said. On Friday afternoon, police described her as a Hispanic woman, 32 to 38 years of age, 5-foot-3, 140 pounds and wearing black pants and a black sweater. Police said Friday that the woman's action didn't appear to be self-defense and that charges such as spraying a caustic compound would be determined later. One witness to the incident, Juan Castro, said he and other shoppers were hunting for ""deals,"" when a woman began using pepper spray. He was trying to buy a Wii video game at $20, marked down from a typical $60, he said. ""I don't know if she felt threatened or she felt she had to do that to get what she wanted,"" Castro told CNN on Friday. ""I didn't see her personally, but I sure got the scent of the mace. I got it in my throat. It was burning. I saw people around me, they got it really bad. As you see in the video, some woman was crying 'my eyes, my eyes,'"" Castro said. ""I tried to get away as quickly as possible because I didn't think it was worth it. No deal's worth that,"" he said. Violent incidents also occurred in South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, New York, Alabama and Connecticut, with most of the reported incidents happening at or near Walmart stores. Despite the reports, Walmart said the day's shopping frenzy had been remarkably safe for shoppers at its thousands of stores nationwide. ""There were a few unfortunate incidents but overall we have received very positive feedback from our customers,"" Walmart spokesman Greg Rossiter said. In 2008, crowds of frantic Black Friday shoppers trampled a Walmart employee in New York as he and other workers tried to unlock the door at 5 a.m. CNN's Sandra Endo and Michael Cary contributed to this report .","The woman isn't charged yet because detectives are still investigating .

"(CNN) -- Alfred Pennine, longtime proprietor of Pennine Funeral Home in Providence, Rhode Island, may have taken a secret to his grave. After Pennine committed suicide last month, another funeral director found six bodies in a garage detached from the Pennine Funeral Home, according to Providence Police Maj. David Lapatin. This week, a man found the bodies of two adults and an infant in a storage unit previously rented to Pennine in nearby Johnston, according to Johnston Police Maj. Frank Levesque. Investigators suspect that Pennine was telling families their loved ones had been buried or cremated, but then not following through and instead keeping the cremation and burial fees, Lapatin said. Authorities are asking owners of storage units across the state to look through their records to see if they rented to Pennine or whether anything suspicious has been found inside, Lapatin said. After Pennine committed suicide in July, another funeral director took the body to the Pennine funeral home and discovered five corpses and a fetus in a detached garage, Lapatin said. The funeral home was shut down by the local health department, Lapatin said. A man on Thursday discovered the bodies of two adults and an infant in the Johnston storage unit. One adult body was found in a cremation box while another was in a standard coffin, Levesque said. The baby was in what funeral homes often refer to as ""infant carriers,"" or a smaller coffin. The adults were so decomposed the gender could not be identified, Levesque said. The infant was believed to be a female. The bodies were found by a man who had purchased the unit, which was auctioned because there was no payment on it for six months, Levesque said. Authorities are not sure of the motive but suspect it was financial. Lapatin said that in some instances, relatives of a dead person were given ashes after a supposed cremation when the remains were still in the funeral home garage. The funeral home was not authorized to handle cremations on site. The bodies were brought to another location, where a fee was paid for cremation, Lapatin said. ""It looks like he said he was cremating the bodies and then pocketing the money,"" Lapatin said. Lapatin would not say if other funeral directors were being investigated but added that charges could be filed later. ""The scope is a lot wider than Mr. Pennine,"" Lapatin said. Pennine's brother told CNN affiliate WJAR the family had no comment. In July, Boston police discovered human remains in a storage facility belonging to a former Massachusetts funeral director after obtaining a search warrant for unrelated charges on the director, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office.

"(CNN) -- A late Martin Demichelis header salvaged a point for Manchester City against Arsenal in an entertaining 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. New signing Danny Welbeck hit the post early on for Arsenal but it was Sergio Aguero who opened the scoring for the visitors shortly before the half hour mark -- the Argentine striker lifting the ball over Wojciech SzczÄ™sny after some good work down the right from Jesus Navas. Arsenal, who suffered a humiliating 6-3 loss to Manuel Pellegrini's side at the Etihad Stadium last December, fought back in the second half with two goals in 11 minutes. First Jack Wilshere scored in the 63rd minute, delicately chipping the ball over goalkeeper Joe Hart after receiving a pass from Aaron Ramsey before Alexis Sanchez netted his second league goal since joining from Barcelona to make it 2-1. The Chilean striker made the most of a speculative header into the box from Wilshere, side-footing an exquisite volley past Hart from eight yards out. After suffering a shock 1-0 home defeat to Stoke before the international break, City were in danger of slumping to a second consecutive league loss before Demichelis popped up with an equalizing header from a corner kick in the 83rd minute. The Sky Blues were perhaps unlucky not to snatch all three points when Aleksandar Kolarov hit the woodwork in the 88th minute and despite six added minutes at the end of the match, neither side could break the deadlock. The result leaves City with seven points from their opening four games while Arsenal have opened the season with a win and three draws. Costa impresses again for Chelsea . Chelsea maintained their 100% record this season with another impressive display against Swansea City at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa netted his first hat-trick for the Blues as Jose Mourniho's side came from behind to beat Garry Monk's men 4-2. Swansea, who were the only other side in the league to have won their opening three league matches, took the lead in the 11th minute when John Terry put the ball in the back of his own net. And that's how it stayed until Costa leveled the scores on the stroke of halftime. The Spanish international scored two more in the second half before giving way to new signing Loic Remy who came on to score Cheslea's fourth in the 81st minute. Jonjo Shelvey scored a consolation goal with four minutes remaining but it couldn't stop Chelsea recording a fourth win leaving them top of the table on 12 points. Swansea stay in second with nine points from four matches. After two draws and a defeat in their opening matches, Everton finally bagged a first league win on Saturday beating struggling West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at the Hawthorns -- Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas netting goals in either half. Southampton registered their second win of the season beating Newcastle United 4-0 while Tottenham Hotspur drew 2-2 at Sunderland.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles judge on Thursday denied Shelly Sterling's request to prevent estranged husband Donald Sterling and his legal team from contacting witnesses in the couple's court battle over whether she controls the Los Angeles Clippers. Shelly Sterling has a pending court case in which she is asking a judge to uphold her negotiated sale of the couple's ownership of the NBA team despite her husband's objections. She and her attorneys accused her husband of making a death threat against one of her lawyers and leaving intimidating threats against two doctors who certified Donald Sterling as mentally incapacitated. On Thursday morning, Shelly Sterling and her attorneys asked for a court protection order for those individuals and other witnesses, but later in the day, Judge Michael Levanas rejected the request, saying that her assertions don't ""rise to the level of great and irreparable injury."" ""It is probably no surprise to anyone that this case might involve high emotions and some litigation posturing,"" the judge wrote. ""The court respectfully asks all parties and counsel to tone down the pre-trial communications between parties, witnesses and counsel as this case will be decided on the relevant and admissible evidence provided at the time of the trial."" Attorneys for Donald Sterling told CNN they opposed the motion for a protective order. A probate court trial is scheduled for early July on whether Shelly Sterling can sell the basketball team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. Shelly Sterling is asking the court to uphold her deal with Ballmer. The NBA ordered the sale of the team after Donald Sterling's recorded racist remarks to a companion were made public. Shelly Sterling: We're just business partners . Accusations of threats . In court papers filed Thursday, Shelly Sterling accused her husband of threatening one of her attorneys by shouting over the phone, ""I am going to take you out, O'Donnell!"" according to documents filed Thursday in a Los Angeles probate court. The attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said he took the remarks as a death threat. Donald Sterling also allegedly left threatening voice mail messages for two physicians who certified him as mentally incapacitated, according to court papers. The two physicians are witnesses in next month's probate court trial that was sought by Shelly Sterling. When asked for a response, Donald Sterling's attorney, Max Blecher, said ""Mr. Sterling means no harm and he just has a short fuse."" Shelly Sterling's maneuver to seek a probate court trial comes as three physicians say Donald Sterling, 80, is mentally incapacitated, O'Donnell has said. Court papers say her husband shows early Alzheimer's or other brain disease. But Donald Sterling allegedly left ""threatening voice mail messages last week"" for two of the physicians, Dr. James Edward Spar and Dr. Meril S. Platzer, who earlier examined Sterling and deemed him incapacitated, according to Shelly Sterling's legal documents filed in court. Donald Sterling's message to Platzer on June 9 stated, ""I'm gonna see that you lose your license"" and ""I'm going to sue you for a large sum, I guarantee you,"" according to court papers and an audio recording of the message provided by Shelly Sterling's attorneys. Donald Sterling left a profanity-laced message for Spar with threats to ""have you lose your license"" and ""get you fired"" and ""have your insurance company call me,"" according to documents. Donald Sterling's voice mail to Spar also stated, ""I'll show you what I think of you when I see you in court!"" according to court papers. ""I'm not competent. You're ... incompetent you stupid ... doctor,"" Donald Sterling allegedly said, according to a recording provided by Shelly Sterling's attorneys. ""There's an ethical issue here. ... How dare you give my records to a lawyer for the purpose of using it against me?"" On the audio recording, Donald Sterling states his name and leaves his phone number. But Donald Sterling waived all doctor-patient confidentiality and privacy in connection with his mental evaluation, Shelly Sterling's attorneys said in court papers. Another attorney for Donald Sterling, Bobby Samini, then sent a letter to each of the two physicians that accused them of being ""part of a conspiracy"" and threatening them with litigation seeking ""damages for your illegal conduct,"" according to documents filed by Shelly Sterling's attorneys. The documents said Samini demanded that the doctors stop communicating with anyone other than Donald Sterling about his medical condition. An 'upset' Donald Sterling . When asked about Thursday's legal filings, Samini told reporters that the public release of medical information is a distressing experience. ""He was upset his medical records were disseminated,"" Samini said. The two physicians who examined Donald Sterling didn't have his permission to talk to third parties, Samini said. Speaking about Donald Sterling's overall reaction, Samini stated: ""I was shocked by how tempered he maintained himself."" NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned the Clippers' co-owner for life and fined him $2.5 million after the comments went public. Sterling responded by suing the NBA for $1 billion.

"(CNN) -- I'm frustrated by the story of ""Django Unchained"" actress Daniele Watts' claim of racism after being detained by a police officer. I think it is true that police officers, in general, are more likely to be suspicious of black people than white people in specific circumstances, and I know the phenomenon of ""driving while black"" happens. I have clients who have been pulled over, questioned and detained without any obvious probable cause. It reminds me of an incident a few weeks ago in which Hollywood producer Charles Belk was detained by police officers for six hours until cops realized they had the wrong ""tall, bald-headed black male."" Such an event is demoralizing and humiliating, and it is evidence of how ingrained cultural biases affect law-abiding citizens. It's the kind of action that gives black people reason to be distrustful of cops. What happened to Belk is the kind of incident that can help white people understand how racial bias impacts other people's lives. White people, like it or not, receive the benefit of racial bias, although it's hardly ever very apparent when it happens. When I quickly catch a cab in Manhattan, I don't think, ""that was easy because I was white."" When I'm pulled over by police, I never think, ""I bet this would go better if I was black."" It's an unnatural thought process, but it's a thought process that keeps many whites from understanding an experience shared by many blacks. When such an incident happens to a high-profile personality -- such as a Hollywood producer or actress -- it provides an opportunity for people from both sides of the racial divide to connect and identify with the story. In a situation like Belk's, it has the potential to foster a broader understanding of our inherent cultural biases. That's a good thing; it's a conversation about race that has the potential to bring us closer together. But the details in the Watts' case could produce the opposite effects. Police responded to a very specific call: a white man and a black woman in a Mercedes involved in a sex act outside the CBS Studio. The officer explained why he had probable cause to ask for her identification. Her continued refusal to comply resulted in her being temporarily placed in handcuffs. When her boyfriend persuaded her to produce her ID, she was finally released. Here are some basic legal procedures: Police are allowed to ask you for your identification when they are investigating a particular event that may be a crime; it's part of their job. If they have probable cause to believe an actual crime occurred, they are allowed to arrest you. Asking for your ID is a polite first step to establish whether further investigation is appropriate and whether an arrest is warranted. I have analyzed and critiqued cops' behavior lately, and I think law enforcement everywhere in this country has to do better, especially when it comes to addressing bias in their police work. However, there are some basic rules to follow when interacting with law enforcement: respect them and their authority -- indeed, their obligation -- to investigate circumstances. If a cop acts inappropriate, file that complaint later, not during the interaction on the street. That is a battle you simply will not win. In Watts' case, the officer was doing his job, and it was Watts who was out of line. I think many people -- especially many white people -- are going to look at the Watts situation and come to the conclusion that she overreacted. In the best-case scenario, it detracts from the significance of cases like the Belk case, in which outrage is justified. In the worst-case scenario, Watts' reaction re-entrenches prejudices held by some that black suspects contribute disproportionately to the contentious relationship between cops and the black community. Either way, Watts' behavior and her accusations in this case are not conducive to advancing thoughtful discussions about race. If we want a constructive conversation, we need to engage in a way that brings us together, not pushes us further apart.","Actress Daniele Watts claimed racism after being detained by a police officer .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik was indicted on charges of making false statements to White House officials vetting him for the secretary's seat at the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Bernard Kerik served as New York City police commissioner from 1998 to 2002. Kerik, who served as commissioner from 1998 to 2002, allegedly gave false and misleading answers to Bush administration officials about his relationship with contractors who renovated his Riverdale apartment, according to the indictment handed up by a Washington grand jury. Prosecutors allege Kerik received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his home from contractors seeking to do business with the city of New York. In December, Kerik pleaded not guilty to another indictment in New York levying similar charges against him, but those charges were dismissed because the incident allegedly happened in Washington, officials said. Kerik's attorney, Barry Berke, called the Washington indictment ""the latest example of the Department of Justice's overzealous pursuit of high-profile public figures."" He said his client is confident he will be vindicated. Kerik , 53, is a longtime friend and former protege of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Then-President George W. Bush nominated him for secretary of Homeland Security after winning re-election in 2004, but Kerik withdrew his name amid allegations that he employed a nanny who had questionable immigration status.","Bernard Kerik faces charges of making false statements to White House officials .

"Rochester, New York (CNN) -- As the director of a leading research center on child abuse, I have seen all too often that what a parent considers legitimate discipline can quickly deteriorate into violence fueled by anger. Parents often say that they spank their children to teach them how to behave. The word discipline means ""to teach,"" but does spanking really teach children to behave, or does it teach them to solve problems with violence? At our center, we see many parents who spank their children to teach them not to hit their siblings. Spanking impressionable children may reduce undesirable behavior in the short term. In the long term, however, research shows that it offers children a poor example of how to solve problems or deal with difficult situations. The posting of the video of a Texas judge beating his 16-year-old daughter with a belt, and the controversy surrounding deaths purportedly associated with the pro-spanking book ""To Train Up a Child,"" have reignited the debate about corporal punishment. Even those viewing the disturbing video differ on whether or not it reflects the appropriate use of discipline. When does spanking cross the line and become physical abuse? Although corporal punishment has been widely accepted throughout the history of the United States, psychologists and other professionals here are increasingly concerned about the harm it may cause. Many other countries have outlawed the practice, including Austria, Germany, Greece, Kenya, Norway, Romania and Spain. Despite growing evidence against and opposition to corporal punishment in the United States, the practice remains accepted by nearly half of adults and is legal in all states. Among scientists, there is a consensus that actual physical abuse damages children, directly and over the course of a life. Although not all children who have been abused are affected the same way, decades of research show that child abuse initiates a cascade of negative social, emotional and health-related outcomes. ""Corporal punishment is of limited effectiveness and has potentially deleterious side effects,"" the American Academy of Pediatrics has said in a policy statement. A 2002 analysis of studies, published in the Psychological Bulletin, concluded that although corporal punishment can make a child obey in the short run, it also is linked with a number of long-term problems, including mental disorders and behavioral difficulties. Spanking in childhood also has been related to criminality. Too much corporal punishment can also damage the parent-child relationship, as the parent becomes a source of both nurturing and danger. Disconcertingly, spanking in childhood also is associated with approval of hitting a spouse and increased marital conflict. All the evidence and warnings, however, don't always stop parents from hitting their kids. Personal experiences and emotion continue to dictate whether or not parents choose physical punishment. The video of the judge beating his daughter is disturbing not only because of the physical violence, but also because of the emotional abuse that is clearly present. Rather than learning not to download computer files, this girl may be learning to hide her behavior from her parents, to avoid bringing them her questions and concerns. She may become more likely to resolve conflict with violence, to become involved with people who are abusive, and eventually to hit her own children. All parents surely want to raise well-adjusted children. Discipline and structure are key components of doing so. It would be naÃ¯ve to think that even the most dedicated parents do not sometimes become frustrated with defiant children. There are many ways of disciplining children that are effective and nonviolent. We need to show parents what they are, and to make alternative approaches more widely accessible if we are to avoid tragic outcomes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheree L. Toth.","Sheree L. Toth: Does spanking teach children to behave, or does it encourage violence?

"(CNN) -- Egyptian Muslims attended Christmas services Friday in a show of solidarity with Coptic Christians days after a bombing killed 23 congregants in the country's north. Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas Day according to the Julian calendar, and observed it on Friday this year. Security was tight around churches after the blast on New Year's Day outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria. Congregants were forced to empty their pockets before the start of the service as part of security measures set up after the bombing. ""Police plan a large-scale security operation for tonight to protect Egypt's Coptic Christians and their churches."" Col. Alla Mahmoud of the interior ministry said Thursday. Protests have broken out in Christian areas of Egypt every night since the car bombing outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria. Hundreds of officers -- outfitted in helmets with visors, body armor and carrying shields and night sticks -- lined the streets, leaving a path for demonstrators to pass. Egyptian authorities have released a sketch of a man they think is responsible for the attack. ""The man in the picture is unknown and authorities are trying to confirm his identity,"" Mahmoud said. The interior ministry used forensic technology to recreate the face of the suspected suicide bomber. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. Coptic Christians base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report from Cairo .","Police beef up security around churches .

"(CNN) -- Every day, you have a close personal encounter with methane, a key ingredient of something we don't usually mention in polite company: farts. Perhaps that's why methane is also called ""natural gas."" Unfortunately, neither propriety nor intestinal discipline can suppress its unpleasantness lately, because now not just us, but the Earth itself is farting. Recently, three new craters, one of which measured approximately 100 feet wide and over 200 feet deep, were discovered in the Siberian permafrost. The explanation for them is even more alarming than asteroid strikes: Apparently, after two consecutive summers averaging 5 degrees Celsius hotter than normal, frozen methane is not merely thawing, it's exploding. Scientists fear that, like chronic bad digestion, this phenomenon could be ongoing. Methane in the air surrounding these craters already measures 53,000 times the normal concentration. Then, just a week into a research trip, a team from Stockholm University found ""vast methane plumes"" shooting from the sea floor off the Siberian coast. Columns of gas bubbles, they reported, were surfacing around their icebreaker in waters saturated with 10 to 50 times more methane than usual. This was the marine equivalent of melting permafrost, the undoing of frozen crystals called methane hydrates, locked solid for millennia by the pressure and temperature of deep oceans. The U.S. Office of Naval Research calculates that methane hydrates hold trillions of tons of hydrocarbons, from two to 10 times the amount as all conventional deposits of fossil fuels, but they're probably too costly or unsafe to harvest. Now, as ocean temperatures rise, they've begun collapsing, spewing as much gas skyward as the thawing tundra. Airborne methane produces 86 times the heat-trapping greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide. Although CO2 remains in the atmosphere far longer, after 100 years methane is still 30 times more potent. With sea level increases from 3 to 6 feet already predicted by the century's end, such stunning global flatulence isn't merely embarrassing, but devastating for civilization. So what do we do? First, we recognize that the reason this is happening involves a misleading term: positive feedback loop. It's misleading because for us there's nothing positive about it. It means that as temperatures rise, warming land and seas fart (belch, if you prefer) more methane -- which then warms things further, so dangerous eruptions accelerate. Feeding back on itself, warming begets more warming. Second, we admit that this loop began with us. By now, the link between fuel that jet-propels our industrialized civilization and excess CO2 and methane in the atmosphere is challenged only by those who profit obscenely from it. Third, we stop compounding the problem by ceasing to pretend that energy derived by shattering our bedrock to squeeze even more natural gas from it is somehow ""clean."" Not only does burning methane crank planetary heat higher, but fracking wells also inevitably leak. At least 2% of their methane output, the EPA conservatively estimates, seeps into the atmosphere, thickening the gas layer that's already turning Earth into a hothouse. Nor will the other 98% go to heat our homes. Enormous pipelines are now proposed to transport fracked methane through New England's conservation lands and orchards, through northern Minnesota's prime tourism and wild rice lake districts, and across the Ogallala Aquifer-fed farms of our nation's heartland. Each will terminate at a port, where its gas will be exported, not used domestically. What will remain is scarred land and the methane that escapes or explodes (most recently on June 26, in East Bernard, Texas, into 150-foot flames). Such pipelines will be subsidized by rate-payers, not by vastly wealthy corporations that own them -- unless we refuse to let them be built, and instead commit our energy funding henceforth to truly cleaner options, like wind and solar. The last time there was this much atmospheric CO2 was 3 million years ago, when seas were 80 to 100 feet higher. Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric methane has more than doubled, and the amount now gushing from the seas alone is 34 times what we thought just seven years ago. Until we stop putting more carbon dioxide and methane overhead, prepare for more rude farts to foul your air, and our future. With coastal cities, fertile deltas and much of the world's rice crops threatened by floods or salination from encroaching seas -- and with grain harvests predicted to fall 10% for each added 1 degree C of average temperature -- passing greenhouse gases isn't merely vulgar -- it's deadly.","Recently, three mysterious craters were discovered in the Siberian permafrost .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Three members of NATO's International Security Assistance Force were killed in an attack in Kabul on Tuesday, the coalition said. Two were U.S. military personnel, and the third was Polish, a U.S. defense official said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing targeting a convoy of foreign forces in the Afghan capital, the militant group's spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said. A large plume of smoke filled the sky over Kabul, and the U.S. Embassy sounded its ""duck-and-cover"" alarm. Witness Sakhi Ahmad said the explosion took place on Kabul International Airport Road, near the Supreme Court compound. ISAF and Afghan officials are investigating the blast, the coalition said. It did not identify the names or nationalities of those killed. At least 13 Afghan civilians were also wounded in the attack, Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. He said 17 civilian vehicles were damaged in the blast. The explosion in Kabul came a day after a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform turned his weapon against ISAF members in western Afghanistan on Monday, the coalition said. ""ISAF continues to train, advise and assist the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces), and does not view these incidents as representative of the positive relationship between our forces,"" ISAF said.

"New York (CNN) -- Gigi Jordan showed no emotion as a New York prosecutor described to a jury a ""chilling and horrifying scenario"" in which the businesswoman who made a fortune in pharmaceuticals allegedly concocted a lethal cocktail of painkillers and anti-inflammatories and forced her 8-year-old autistic son to swallow it. ""Two fresh bruises on his nose, fresh bruises on his chin and chest suggest she got on top of him and, hopefully while he was asleep, filled a syringe with the poisonous concoction and pressed that plunger into his body,"" said assistant district attorney Matt Bogdanos, demonstrating how she might have squeezed his nose and pressed open his mouth to deliver the poison. ""His fate was sealed,"" Bogdanos said. ""He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die."" But on the first day of Jordan's sensational second-degree murder trial -- expected to last months -- defense attorney Allan Brenner painted a starkly different portrait. Brenner described Jordan as a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude Mirra by her two former husbands: One who had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left the boy with his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused Jude. In packed Manhattan criminal courtroom Wednesday, no one disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan was unable to reach her. At an autopsy, four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill Jude were recovered undigested from his stomach, prosecutors said. Orange juice and vodka were used to wash down the drugs. While Jude lay dying, Bogdanos said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account. Brenner said Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt. The prosecution sought to show the jury that the killing was premeditated and that Jordan expected to survive. Bogdanos said Jordan ""went to the bank, she transferred $8 million from savings to checking. She checked in (at the hotel) without a reservation and paid cash."" The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for eight to 14 hours, Bogdanos said. Police found a variety of drugs, which the prosecutor enumerated for the jury. ""Xanax, 1,000 pills; Prozac, 200 pills; Ambien 400 pills; Celebrex, a pain reliever, 250 pills; Trexone, similar to morphine, 300 pills; and hydrocodone 9"" were among the drugs found in the hotel room and part of the lethal mix that Jordan allegedly gave her son, according to Bogdanos. Still, Brenner told a spellbound jury that on that fateful day in 2010, Jordan acted out of love and desperation. She had been threatened by her first husband and former business partner, Brenner said. She had accused the man of raiding her bank accounts and defrauding her of millions in profits from their joint businesses. She filed a lawsuit against him in 2012, seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud. ""Gigi knew all the dirty deals,"" Brenner said. ""He knew that Jude was her soft spot."" Jordan ""believed he was going to kill her, leaving a sexual predator to exercise his paternal rights,"" Brenner told the jury. A lawyer representing her first husband did not returns calls and emails seeking comment. But her first husband filed a lawsuit in August 2013, claiming Jordan defamed him in interviews she gave the media in an effort to advance her defense. Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father -- a yoga instructor and undocumented immigrant who Jordan said she married to help him get a green card -- would get custody, according to Brenner. Jordan first learned that Jude had been sexually abused in December 2007, Brenner said. Jude was autistic and his vocabulary was limited, but in just a few words, he uttered: ""Dad bad, Dad bad, over and over again,"" according to Brenner. That was Jude's way of letting his mother know that he had been victimized repeatedly sexually and physically, Brenner said. ""He had been made to eat feces and subjected to the most degrading conduct imaginable,"" he said. Jude's biological father could not be reached for comment. A relative of the father did not return calls seeking comment. The boy's father has denied the allegations and has never been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. Brenner said Jordan told a therapist about the alleged abuse. The allegations were reported to local authorities, but no action was taken. Jordan then decided to seek the help of a nationally renowned expert on child exploitation in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After being interviewed by him for 30 minutes, Brenner said, Jordan was accused of being unfit and delusional, taken to a medical facility and separated from her son for several months before being reunited with the boy. ""Now she sits here forever brokenhearted, stranded and separated from the true love of her life -- her son,"" Brenner said. Jordan faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted. She is expected to take the stand. Utah mom admits to killing at least six of her babies . Maryland mother accused of suffocating kids, 1 and 3 .

"(LifeWire) -- When George Dello of San Diego was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he had at best five months to live, he didn't immediately begin the chemotherapy treatments his doctor recommended. Instead, he and his wife, Pam, drove up the California coast and spent a week among the redwoods north of San Francisco. Expert: Family and friends can help the terminally ill by spending time with them. ""These trees are 5 feet wide and 150 feet tall,"" said Dello, 43. ""They still have another 150 feet to grow and are going to stick around for another 1,000 years. When I thought about that, I'm just a flea on the bark. It's unbelievable."" The trip offered Dello, who worked in the auto repossession business, and his wife a chance to come to terms with the diagnosis in  August 2008, and to scratch the trip to the redwood forests off his life ""to do"" list while he was still relatively healthy. He died four months later. The idea that dying well is as important as living well gained cultural currency last year when Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, delivered a final lecture a month after learning that his pancreatic cancer had spread and was inoperable. The lecture was viewed millions of times on the Internet and adapted into a best-selling book. ""We cannot change the cards we are dealt,"" Pausch, who died in July at age 47, told his audience, ""just how we play the hand."" ""Die the way you live"" It's easy, experts say, for terminally ill patients and their loved ones to focus so much on their medical care and other important practical matters, including funerals and wills, that a ""good"" death eludes them. Health permitting, a trip like the one Dello took with his wife can help, as can visits from friends and family. ""You're going to die the way you live,"" says Fran Moreland Johns, a former hospice volunteer and author of ""Dying Unafraid.""  ""Laughter, music, all of the things that have been important in your life -- if you put them to work for making your end times better, you can actually affect your dying days."" ""That's where Randy Pausch has set a wonderful example. He brought all of his skills to bear on living until the moment he died."" Tony Wallace, a retired foreign service officer from Arlington, Virginia, went on a Caribbean cruise with his wife, Susan, after he learned in September 2004 that he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. As his illness progressed, Wallace, a former adjunct professor of public policy at George Mason University, put his teaching and writing skills to work by starting a blog, ""Navigating Through ALS,"" and using it as a platform to help others suffering from the disease. ""I'm not a compiler of life lists of things I never got to do and places I never got to visit,"" Wallace wrote in December 2007. ""I look back on my life to date and view it as a well-judged race -- like a NASCAR race in which you don't set the speed record, but you don't crash, handle the curves well, and deliver a respectable performance."" Wallace died September 4, 2008 at age 67. Susan Wallace, a part-time editor, says her husband's illness, while painful and difficult, offered an opportunity of sorts. ""If I had to choose between a long-term illness and an immediate death, I think I would go for a long-term illness, although it was hard on both of us,"" she says. ""But the last four years have been incredible years, probably the best years of our marriage. We became closer than we ever were."" For friends and family . Friends and family can help tremendously simply by showing up, says Kathy Brandt, vice president of professional leadership, consumer and caregiver services for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. Often, she says, people worry so much about what to say to someone with a terminal illness -- or about saying the wrong thing -- that they just stay away. ""We need to put aside our selfish fears,"" says Brandt. ""That may sound a little harsh, but it's not really about us."" One way to avoid saying the wrong thing is to steer clear of cliches, she says. ""'God has a reason' or 'tomorrow will be another day' -- those kinds of things are trite, but they're also impersonal,"" says Brandt. ""If the person wants to chat and talk, then just ask a question or two and let the person talk. If the person's not physically well enough to do a lot of talking, ask if they'd like to hear a story about something that happened at work, or saying, 'Would you like me to read a story to you?' It's all about figuring out where the person is at and meeting them where they are."" Visits can be used to tie up loose ends or resolve old conflicts, says Brandt. Susan Wallace says her husband had time to repair one particularly nagging rift before he died, and Dello also took opportunities to resolve disputes with friends and former co-workers. ""Most people at the end of their life need closure,"" says Brandt. ""If they've offended someone or had an argument with somebody, they can say they're sorry. Oftentimes they like the opportunity to say goodbye to people. They may not say those words, but that's what those visits can be with friends and loved ones."" In Johns' view, the biggest hurdle for most people is overcoming their fear of the unknown and realizing that, for most, death ""is not the worst thing that's going to happen."" ""We don't know what dying is,"" says Johns. ""Whatever your religious background, it's easier for us to ignore death and pretend that it doesn't happen than to accept it as an unknown with all the other unknowns -- in this day and age there are a lot of them -- and deal with what we can and not be so spooked.""

"Rome (CNN) -- The crippled Costa Concordia cruise ship reached the end of its final voyage. Refloated by salvage crews earlier this month, the rusting hulk docked at Voltri port in the Italian city of Genoa early Sunday. The cruise ship, which ran aground in January 2012 off Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, was eased into a dry dock at the port for salvage. It managed to make the four-day journey in a convoy of vessels from Giglio to Genoa without major incident, despite one night of storms. According to civil protection chief Franco Gabrielli, strong winds hampered the delicate maneuvering needed to get the ship into the dry dock. One person still missing . The ship will be searched for the remains of Russel Rebello, a 33-year-old waiter who is the only victim still missing in the tragedy. A total of 32 people were killed in the disaster. Searches for Rebello are also underway in Giglio at the site where the ship had rested for the past 30 months. 'We'll die without that boat' ""Hopefully this will be the start of closure for the family,"" salvage master Nick Sloane said from on board the Concordia. ""I hope they find Russel."" Environmental concerns prompted the decision to undertake the expensive and difficult process of refloating the Costa Concordia rather than taking it apart in the pristine Mediterranean waters where it ran aground. It's the largest salvage operation ever attempted, and the most expensive, at a cost of $1.5 billion so far. Dismantling to take 2 years . The lengthy process of dismantling the wrecked ship is expected to take two years. How the ship was righted . The first items to be removed will be passengers' luggage and personal effects that are still stuck on board. More than 80% of the Concordia will be recycled or reused, including copper wiring, plumbing pipes, kitchens and some of the plastic room fittings that can be repaired. The remaining 50,000 tons of steel will be melted down and sold at the market price to be used to make construction girders, cars and even other ships. Since the wreck in early 2012, 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture, dishes, food, personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed. Barbie Latza Nadeau reported from Rome and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","The rusting ship has docked at the Italian port of Genoa .

"(CNN) -- At the risk of propagating a dodgy cliché, Africa remains one of the last frontiers of travel. Non-air-conditioned travel, that is, i.e. the kind where you risk stubbing your toe occasionally or getting genuinely lost. From gorilla sighting in the Ugandan highlands to skiing -- yes, skiing -- in Morocco, it promises untold travel wonders. But new Africa hands should worry less about stocking up on viral jabs and safari suits than ditching their preconceptions. For a start ... Africa can be very cold indeed . It might straddle the equator but not everywhere in Africa is scorching. Mt Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) and Mt Kenya both have glaciers and nights can be dangerously chilly in the desert, with temperatures dropping to as low as -10C. It snows in places, too. You can go skiing in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, the Maloti Mountains, Lesotho and in the Eastern Cape Highlands, South Africa. Alongside desert, there are mountains and rainforests . Africa does have vast swathes of desert and flat savanna but also mountainous and exceptionally green parts. There are the sprawling rainforests of Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire) and the soft green hill country of Senegal, Guinea and Tanzania. For more cultivated greenness, South Africa's garden route, on the south-east coast, is so-named because of its lush vegetation and lakes. And not every desert is a stretch of barren wilderness. The Kalahari is known for its spring flowers, while the Namib, the oldest desert in the world, is home to desert-adapted elephant, rhino, giraffe and lion. More on CNN: Touring Nelson Mandela's South Africa . Hippos are the big killers . You should worry less about lions and Nile crocodiles and instead keep an eye out for hippos. They're the biggest people-killers on the continent. Found in sub-Saharan Africa, the animal is aggressive, unpredictable and can charge at 28kph. If you're in a boat (where many people will encounter them) hit the sides to signal your position. If on foot, keep your distance and never get between a mother and her calf. Hippos are most aggressive in the dry season when water levels are low and food supplies limited. Listen out for oxpeckers since the birds issue warning calls if hippo are around. You won't need every shot in the book . Your childhood vaccines should be up to date for an Africa trip but you don't need prevention against every disease going. A rabies shot is advisable -- but plan it in advance as it's a series of jabs -- along with injections against hepatitis A, meningococcal meningitis and typhoid. You may need yellow fever vaccination, too. For some countries, such as South Africa, it's an entry requirement. Consult with your doctor about your specific travel plans and medical history. Find out more about virus protection while traveling at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website. French is useful -- African French even better . Africa's countless ethnic groups mean there are several hundred languages, many with distinct dialects, you could come across. Former colonial languages -- English, French and Portuguese -- are common, but English may not be as widely spoken as you think. French is almost essential in West or Central Africa and will probably come in useful in Algeria, Burundi, Djibouti, Rwanda and Tunisia. African French, however, is very different from what you were probably taught at school -- while you should be able to make yourself understood, you might find it harder understanding others. The informal ""tu"" is used much more frequently in Africa than it would be in France, but if you're dealing with officials it's perhaps safer to stick with ""vous."" More on CNN: 10 of the best golf courses in Africa . You don't need countless visas ... If you're traveling in West Africa, consider getting a Visa Touristique Entente (VTE) which covers Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire all in the one document. It costs around $50, is valid for up to two consecutive months and should save you time and money. Embassies of Benin seem to issue these with the least amount of hassle, although theoretically they're available from any of the countries' embassies. ... But your car will need papers . If you plan to drive a hire car through Africa you may well need a carnet de passage or a triptyque (the former is for entry to multiple countries, the latter to one), although neither is required for Morocca, Algeria and Tunisia. Carnets are issued by national motoring organizations and act as a guarantee that import duties will be paid if a vehicle is taken into a country and remains there. Hire companies won't issue you with a carnet unless they have proof you can afford any duties, so you'll need insurance to cover this. Some southern African countries don't demand a carnet, although they'll insist you buy a Temporary Import Permit at the border. Find out more about vehicle documentation at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile website (page in English).

"(CNN) -- The way some Republicans talk about the Environmental Protection Agency, you would think it was created by a bunch of pot-smoking hippies communing at a nudist camp in northern California -- when in fact, the EPA was created by one of their own, Richard Nixon, in 1970. Much as Republicans don't like to bring up the huge tax increases instituted by their hero, Ronald Reagan, they prefer to sidestep their role in the EPA's humble beginnings and blame it on Democrats. They characterize the whole thing as an albatross hanging around the economy's neck. To be fair, Nixon did not ride into the White House as a conservationist, and he did veto the Clean Water Act. But he said he did so because of the price tag of the policy, not its purpose. After the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969 -- which at the time was the largest in U.S. history -- Nixon agreed with the rest of thinking society that clean water and air were a good thing. And his fingerprints are all over such tree-hugging initiatives as the Clean Air Act. Sadly, if he tried any of that funny business today, his own party would probably impeach him. That's how far down the oil well some in the Republican leadership have fallen. Rep. Michelle Bachmann said she would lock the EPA's doors and turn off its lights if she were president (thankfully there's no chance of that); Newt Gingrich said he would shut down the EPA and create a replacement to work with businesses to create jobs (making it more of a lapdog than watchdog); Rick Perry asked the president to halt all regulations, adding ""his EPA regulations are killing jobs all across America."" Many conservatives, such as Bachmann and Perry, refer to the agency as a ""job killer"" because of the regulations, and consequent operational costs, it imposes on businesses. I find the label rather odd, considering that research shows that poor air and water quality are people killers and without people, jobs are pretty much useless. The Sierra Club, a 120-year-old conservation nonprofit, estimates that legislation administered by the EPA prevented more than 200,000 premature deaths from air pollutants, cleaned more than 2000 polluted rivers and lakes, and was instrumental in phasing out dangerous chemicals such as DDT and PCBs along with the poisonous leaded gasoline -- one of the worse inventions of all time, according to Time Magazine. That doesn't mean it's an agency without controversy. The Sierra Club, in pushing for more progress, often criticizes the EPA for its shortcomings, and the agency was accused of suppressing a report that questions global warming. Still, how could anyone who has seen news coverage of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill -- the current worst oil disaster in U.S. history -- not want the federal government involved in protecting the environment? EPA critics such as Ron Paul suggest the states should be left to handle their own environmental issues -- an idea that could only come from people who have not had to stand in line at the DMV. Once you've dealt with that and other state offices, the last thing you would want is to let the states go solo in handling the safety of drinking water. And who did front-runner Mitt Romney cite to say that the EPA functioned better under George W. Bush than Obama? Oil and gas executives. Talk about a classic example of someone completely lacking in the self-awareness department. I guess for his next piece of news he'll tell us evangelical voters believe in God. Seriously, if Romney is so hell-bent on stating the obvious, he should bring up the provision in Bush's 2005 Energy Policy Act that excused natural gas companies from telling the EPA which chemicals they were using to mine with, and say it was a mistake. It's not like that would be stepping out on a limb, since it's been well documented that some people who live near gas-drilling facilities can now turn on their faucets and light the water on fire. I'm not making that up -- rent the documentary ""Gasland"" and enjoy the pyrotechnic show. If you can. I found myself getting angry as I listened to homeowner after homeowner share the details of trying to live a life breathing in toxic fumes because of the unregulated drilling. Think Karen Silkwood or Erin Brockovich. Or better yet, think Dick Cheney, the driving force behind W's energy policy. Why Cheney? Well, one of the companies making big profits from the natural gas drilling is his former employer, Halliburton. And yet Republicans like Romney -- who as a governor, proposed plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and as a presidential candidate, backed away from such plans -- and his rivals talk openly about their disdain for the EPA, while pushing for the Keystone XL pipeline extension. The pros and cons of building a system that funnels crude oil into the U.S. are worth exploring. But doing so while plotting to dismantle the EPA reeks of capitalism run amok. I severely doubt the EPA is running as efficiently as it should, and I'm sure there are some regulations that need to reviewed by the science community. But the Republican notion that a federal policing of our natural resources is a waste of money flies in the face of common sense. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Republican candidates have sharply criticized EPA, called for it to be limited or shut down .
LZ Granderson says they're ignoring the fact that it was created by a GOP president .
The EPA is credited with administering laws that have saved many lives, he says .

"(CNN) -- Hawaii had the lowest voter turnout rate in the United States in 2008, with fewer than half of the eligible population casting ballots. When I traveled to the state to find out why, I thought most of the problem might be apathy. The surfer thing, you know? That is part of it, to be sure. But there are many reasons America's 50th state doesn't vote as much as the other 49, plenty of them specific to Hawaii. Here's a bite-sized look at eight. If you want to be part of the solution, help us change the list by convincing these five people to vote for the first time, making a pledge to vote or sharing this ""Mahalo for Voting!"" image on Tumblr or Facebook. Background: Introducing CNN's Change the List . Hawaii: The state that doesn't vote . And, as if I'm not asking enough already, let me know what you think of this list in the comments section at the bottom of the story. If you have other ideas, I may add them. 1. Surfer apathy: I'll start with the obvious one. It's true that some people are so wrapped up in Hawaii's beaches and waves that they don't care about politics. One woman told me politics don't ""flow"" in oh-so-laid-back Hawaii. A state representative in Maui said he looks at swell reports before Election Day. If the waves are big, he said, he knows turnout will be low. 2. Ugly history: A fair number of Native Hawaiian people consider the U.S. to be illegitimately occupying Hawaii, and some don't vote on principle. One woman told me that part of her identity as a Native Hawaiian would be diluted if she cast a ballot. The U.S. apologized in 1993 for its unlawful takeover of the islands, but resentment remains. 3. When it's 6 p.m. in Hawaii, it's midnight in Washington: The Aloha State is six hours behind Eastern Time. By the time its polls close, presidents often have been declared. One woman who lives on the Big Island of Hawaii told me she was driving from work to her polling place when she heard the winner of a presidential race announced on the radio. She turned the car around and drove home without voting. In the bigger picture, the time zone issue -- and the thousands of miles of ocean that come with it -- leave Hawaii feeling detached from national politics. The U.S. and Hawaii are like ""apples and bananas,"" one man told me. The state feels like an afterthought. 4. It's basically a one-party state: Who wants to vote if it seems like there's no real choice to be made? Democrats have dominated politics in Hawaii for decades. Many races in the state are uncontested because the Republicans can't find candidates to run in them. Currently, there's only one Republican in Hawaii's state Senate. The state's electoral votes have gone to Republican presidential candidates only twice in history. 5. Polling places can't be trusted: That's the feeling at least on the Big Island of Hawaii. During the primary election this year, some polling places opened an hour and a half late because voter registries hadn't been delivered to the polling stations. The state is stepping in to try to make sure November elections are conducted with more professionalism. But I met a sous-chef in Hilo who said that's too little, too late. He doesn't trust the polls because he had so much trouble voting before. 6. People don't identify as voters: I found it fascinating that many people in Hawaii don't vote at least in part because they don't see themselves as the type of people who participate in civil society. A 36-year-old man told me he never voted until two years ago, when he found a website asking people to pledge to vote. It was that simple. Once someone invited him into the system, he participated. No one had asked before. He ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives in the primary election this year. 7. The schools are bad: I heard from many adults in Hawaii that the school system does not do a good job teaching young people about politics and how decisions made by politicians affect their day-to-day lives. There are exceptions, of course, like Jason Duncan's class at a high school near Honolulu. There, I met a young woman who said she didn't see the importance of voting until Duncan led a conversation on the topic. But the state should do a better job educating the next generation of voters. 8. Election laws make it too hard to register: There are plenty of available tools that would make voting easier in Hawaii, including same-day voter registration, which would let people walk into a polling place on election day, register and vote right then; and online registration, which Hawaii plans to implement in 2016. I heard time and again from non-voters that they didn't have a clue about how to register. States like Minnesota that have implemented progressive registration policies see higher turnout rates. That state topped the list, with a 78% participation rate. What do you think would help increase voter participation in Hawaii? Let me know in the comments. Your idea may be part of a future story on CNN.com.","Hawaii had the lowest voter turnout rate in 2008 .

An ugly history, Democratic dominance and time zones are to blame .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- When I left India to move to America 13 years ago, the President of the United States was George W. Bush, a man who was often internationally lampooned for mismanaging two wars and tainting Washington's image abroad. But moving back to India this month, I've been struck by the number of Indians who look back wistfully at the Bush years. For Indians, Bush is considered a better friend than President Barack Obama. In fact, right now, Indians don't see Obama as much of a friend at all. It didn't start off that way. In the early days of his presidency, in 2009, Obama marked India's Republic Day by saying Indians ""have no better friend"" than the people of the United States. A year later, when he visited New Delhi, he famously predicted India and the U.S. would form ""the defining partnership of the 21st century."" At the time, Obama won Indian hearts and minds as he chowed down kebabs at the city's famous Bukhara restaurant. The chefs created a special platter that exists to this day -- the Obama platter. (There was already a Bill Clinton platter, as well as a Hillary one.) Today, the platters have gone cold: New Delhi feels jilted. Instead of a defining partnership, Indians couldn't quite define where they stood. Talk of a G-2 -- a U.S. mega-alliance with China, an idea which didn't come from Obama -- inflamed old feelings of jealousy. Washington's impending pullout from Afghanistan, along with its generous aid to Pakistan, has stoked angst. But the real low point was reached late last year when an Indian diplomat in New York was arrested and then strip-searched for allegedly underpaying her nanny. Obama likely had no prior knowledge of the case or the arrest, but still, the perceived American high-handedness turned out to be too much for India to digest. New Delhi revoked privileges to U.S. interests in the country, and across India, there were anti-American protests. Regardless of the merits of the dispute, Indians wondered: If they had no better friend, was this the treatment they deserved? The sense of betrayal is mutual. Washington feels let down, too -- and with some good reason. When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine this year, India chose not to side with the United States but to abstain on a U.N. General Assembly resolution against the Russian action. (Russia is, incidentally, India's largest supplier of arms.) When Washington sought to coalesce support for stringent sanctions against Iran, the surprise spoiler turned out to be New Delhi, which said it needed Iranian oil. What happened to what was promised to be a close friendship between the world's two biggest democracies? One could look to history for answers. Since its independence in 1947, India -- scarred by centuries of invasions and interventions -- has been a reluctant global player. Its first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of nations that aspired to steer clear of great powers and their geopolitics. But 67 years on from its creation, India is now itself an aspiring great power, already among the top 10 economies in the world. Indian diplomats routinely express their hopes for India to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, joining the ranks of Russia, the United States, China, France and the United Kingdom. And yet India's foreign policy has remained aloof, lagging well behind its growth. The country has about the same number of diplomats abroad as Singapore, a country with a population 1/250th of India's. The United States, with a population one quarter of India's, has 10 times as many diplomats. How can India make or maintain friendships when it has always stayed at home? Instead of the past, Indians and Americans should look to the future and the potential it could bring. A recent Pew survey shows that despite recent troubles, Indians trust and like America. For every Indian expressing an unfavorable view of the U.S., four Indians are favorable. By another four-to-one margin, Indians say the U.S. is the world's leading economic power, not China. By a margin of 21 percentage points, Indians are more favorable to the United States than China. The data should not be surprising. India and the United States have more in common than they have differences. One may be a parliamentary system, the other presidential, but both celebrate and cherish democracy, however chaotic and frustrating it can be. At any given time, nearly 100,000 Indians pursue degrees in the United States. Many of them stay on and contribute to American society and business. Strategically, as Washington competes for influence in Asia with China, it will find a natural ally in New Delhi. Obama's early rhetoric was spot-on: The two countries share common ideals. But can they share a friendship and nurture it? Both sides need to take a long, hard look at the world around them and wonder what kind of role they want to play and who can help them do it. As Indians head to the polls Monday to elect a new government, foreign policy is not a campaign issue. It rarely is anywhere. People tend to vote for the things that tangibly impact them: the economy, taxes, infrastructure, education, health care. But whether Indians realize it or not, the next few weeks could offer a chance to rejuvenate a troubled relationship. Whoever India's next Prime Minister is, he or she has an opportunity to start afresh with the United States. Washington has already opened a door to this, suggesting that Narendra Modi, the current favorite for PM, will be allowed a U.S. visa. Modi was denied one in 2005 for his alleged complicity in Hindu-Muslim riots 12 years ago. More than 1,000 Muslims were killed. Modi was chief minister of Gujarat at the time, the state in which the riots took place. The last time Washington tried to hit the reset button -- with Russia -- things went awry. But the stakes are too high to not try again. If it gets this one right, Obama will be vindicated: This century's defining alliance may yet be the one between the two biggest democracies in the world.","President Obama predicted U.S.-India friendship would be defining alliance of 21st century .

"(CNN) -- Nearly nine months after it returned to the sky and its battery system was declared safe, new reports surfaced Tuesday of smoke aboard a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Tokyo's Narita International Airport. The incident ""appears to have involved the venting of a single battery cell,"" aboard a Japan Airlines 787, Boeing told CNN in a statement. A year ago, overheated batteries aboard two Dreamliners prompted aviation officials to ground all 50 of the planes worldwide. Tuesday's incident ""occurred during scheduled maintenance activities with no passengers on board,"" the Boeing statement said. ""The improvements made to the 787 battery system last year appear to have worked as designed."" Boeing said it was working with Japan Airlines to return the plane to service. Japan Airlines and the government's Japanese Aviation Bureau told CNN Tuesday night that the battery unit was removed from the aircraft to be handed over to manufacturers Boeing/Yuasa for further investigation. The airline told Flightglobal that the plane sustained no damage. JAL is monitoring their other 787s as a precautionary measure, Flightglobal reported. Boeing's stake in the Dreamliner is huge. Hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on the success of the 787, which represents a new generation of lighter, more efficient money making planes. When it began service in 2011, the Dreamliner boasted a new battery system that used new, lighter lithium-ion batteries. After the planes were grounded, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration collaborated on a new battery compartment. The compartment was designed to insulate the batteries in a ventilated armor-plated box to protect the rest of the plane in case of a fire caused by overheating batteries. The NTSB announced this month it plans to issue a final investigation report later this fall. Interactive diagram of the 787 . The National Transportation Safety Board said it was aware of Tuesday's battery incident in Japan. ""By international treaty, aviation accidents and incidents are investigated by the investigative authority in the country in which the accident or incident occurred. ""If the Japan Transport Safety Board opens an investigation into the battery smoke event, the NTSB stands ready to assist,"" the U.S. agency said in a statement. In July 2013, investigators blamed a fire aboard an empty Ethiopian Airlines 787 parked at London's Heathrow airport on a malfunctioning emergency beacon. Tuesday's incident comes nearly two months after Boeing warned airlines about another 787 concern: possible icing problems in its GE engines. The aircraft manufacturer alerted 787 operators after instances of ""ice crystal icing that resulted in temporary diminished engine performance,"" Boeing said in a statement. Although it said only a small number of the engines have experienced the ice problems, Boeing advised pilots to keep planes at least 50 nautical miles from storms that may contain ice crystals until General Electric can make improvements to the ""GEnx"" engines. The Dreamliner's development was marked by production delays and other problems. Then, a year ago this month, batteries were blamed for two overheating instances on a Japan Airlines 787 in Boston and on an All Nippon Airways 787 in Japan. No one was hurt in either case, but concerns about the incidents spurred the FAA to ground all U.S. Dreamliners. Officials around the world followed suit. Experts say every airliner experiences ""teething pains"" during its first few years of service, as minor problems are shaken out. But the FAA's decision to ground the Dreamliner put it under intense scrutiny. United Airlines is the lone U.S. operator of Boeing 787s. In an apparent show of confidence in July, United announced it was ordering 20 new 787-10 models, which are a longer version of the plane.","NEW: Japan Airlines hands over 787 battery unit to Boeing for investigation .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso -- this year has witnessed the evolution of some classic rivalries that bode for an intriguing 2013 sporting calendar. Will they become the new Nicklaus-Palmer, Borg-McEnroe, Federer-Nadal or Prost-Senna -- or will an apparent tendency towards friendliness dampen the sparks that are so vital in a true clash of competitive egos? The relationship between Woods and his heir apparent as golf's biggest star is already showing signs of an unexpected ""bromance"". ""I think it's sort of evolved since Abu Dhabi at the start of this year,"" McIlroy told CNN's Living Golf when the duo sat down for a joint interview. ""I'd played with him before but never really got a chance to speak to him in depth. I think we both have a lot in common -- we're both big sports fans and I think our relationship has evolved from there because we've played together quite a lot this year. ""It's been great for me to get to know him and maybe try and pick up a few things and learn from him too."" McIlroy wins PGA Player of the Year . Before the rise of McIlroy, golf's undisputed No. 1 player this year, Woods' previous big rival was Phil Mickelson -- and their relationship was notoriously frosty. They snapped at each other via the media, and Woods' former caddy Steve Williams ramped up the tension with some choice remarks to the press and and fans from which even his employer had to hastily distance himself. Friendly enemies . But Woods, now 36, seems much happier in competition with McIlroy despite the 23-year-old being poised to usurp him as Nike's biggest golf endorsement. ""We've battled each other a few times, but we have a lot in common,"" Woods said. ""Granted, there's an age difference but I had a huge age difference with my other good friend Mark O'Meara, but we had so much in common. ""I think our relationship will certainly grow over the years, but so too will our competitiveness -- I don't think that's going to change."" Magical McIlroy reigns in Dubai . However, while Woods is good friends with O'Meara, a man almost 20 years his senior, they were never really on-course rivals despite the older American's two major triumphs in 1998 -- a year of highs that he never repeated. But if Woods and McIlroy are to become truly great adversaries along the lines of Nicklaus-Tom Watson and Ben Hogan-Sam Snead then they can't afford to become too cosy, according to sports leadership expert Khoi Tu. ""At the extreme, the ability to defeat your opponent, to crush them, requires huge mental discipline,"" said Tu, whose book ""Superteams"" features the F1-dominating Ferrari/Schumacher era and the 2010 Ryder Cup-winning team captained by European golf icon Colin Montgomerie. ""As soon as you begin empathizing with your competitor, you may not have that killer instinct,"" Tu told CNN. ""Great sporting rivalries bring out the best in both players. Great sporting friendships is a great tactic for one and not the other. ""If Rory becomes a genuine rival as opposed to the rival of the moment, then I think Tiger will find it hard not to compete in every dimension possible. ""It's in his DNA, it's what makes him a great competitor. In many respects the best thing about it would be if they did become real rivals, if there was a sense of abrasion or friction -- a sense that sparks fly. It would do wonders for the sport."" Woods, McIlroy 'too tired' for $7`M Chinese tournament . As Nicklaus once said of Palmer: ""We are adversarial friends or friendly enemies. All our lives we've competed against each other. Arnold and I fight like the devil about stuff."" Tennis stars Murray and Djokovic have been friends since childhood, but they have still maintained a ferocious on-court rivalry that this year has reached towards the heights of predecessors such as Federer-Nadal, Borg-McEnroe and Navratilova-Evert. Roger Federer at first struggled when Rafael Nadal ended his complete domination of the men's game, but the duo now publicly insist they are firm friends following years of epic clashes -- despite an apparent spat this year over the Spaniard's desire for changes to be made on the ATP Tour. ""Great shared experiences build great bonds between people,"" Tu says. ""That bond is different than friendship. It's a bond of respect."" Bitter feud . For Woods and McIlroy there is every incentive to cast themselves as friends and rivals. Already they have been lured into playing a lucrative exhibition clash in one of golf's key markets, China, that led them to withdraw from a premier European Tour event in the same country later that week. ""They both just got huge paydays in China, they may be putting a slight front on that camaraderie,"" sports psychologist Dan Abrahams told CNN. ""In a sport like golf, having a spat with a rival isn't seen as being the right thing, whereas (in soccer) Alex Ferguson having a spat with (rival manager) Arsene Wenger, that seems to be quite normal."" Abrahams argues some of McIlroy's older European peers such as Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke -- who have won only one major title between them -- may have suffered from their on-tour friendship. ""Speaking with a lot of golf coaches, that generation have been perhaps a bit too friendly with each other,"" said Abrahams. ""If you compare them with Nick Faldo, he was renowned for keeping himself quite isolated, which was a catalyst for his competitiveness. I think keeping your distance from competitors can be a useful thing."" Faldo has questioned the apparent friendship of golf's two biggest names, but McIlroy played down the criticism. ""You're on tour long enough and you don't need enemies out there, you want to have friends,"" the Northern Irishman told CNN. ""Life on tour can get a bit lonely at times and you wanna have guys that you can go out for dinner with. You're seeing most of the guys each week and you've got to have someone to talk to. If that's what worked for Faldo then great, but I don't think it would work for me."" Ferrari drops Vettel appeal plan . In the high-octane world of Formula One, Alonso is known for his clashes with fellow drivers -- he left McLaren after only one season following a bitter feud with teammate Lewis Hamilton. However, this year the Spaniard has been much more respectful of Vettel, despite Ferrari's united front in downplaying the achievements of Red Bull's history-making triple world champion. Recalibrating sport . Rumors persist that the Italian marque wants to sign Vettel for the 2014 season, which would be an acid test for relations between the two drivers. ""When you get two No. 1 drivers together with no team rules, then the sparks can really fly,"" says Tu, who has worked with Ferrari and former F1 world champion Jackie Stewart. ""It's rare for them to be good mates. They may get along, they may trust and respect each other in a professional capacity, but hanging out is a different issue."" Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who has now retired for a second time, was known for his win-at-all costs approach at Ferrari but such an attitude is becoming increasingly unacceptable for sports fans, says Tu. Contrast the feelgood factor of the London 2012 Olympics with the demonization of Lance Armstrong, who has refused to contest allegations of systematic doping during his time as cycling's tour de force. ""There is, at the moment, a very fine line that sport is treading -- this desire and ambition to win, but not to do so at all costs,"" says Tu. ""Someone like Schumacher, his desire to win would take him to the dark side. That type of willingness to do whatever it takes is a feature of champions. Unmoderated, it's pretty dangerous for the game. ""We've just been through a period of excess and egregious behavior from many corporates -- but equally sporting teams as well. The desire to win, and the merits and rewards of winning, maybe outweighed the joy of winning. ""I think sport is recalibrating. That's why the Olympics made everyone so happy. There was a sense that winning was important, but not necessarily at all costs -- it's the sportsmanship sometimes that makes the bigger story.""","Golf stars Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods talk to CNN about their growing friendship .

"(CNN) -- Two journalists in Thailand have been released on bail in a controversial defamation case that has raised concerns over press freedom in the country. Australian journalist and editor of news website Phuketwan, Alan Morison and his Thai colleague Chutima Sidasathian, appeared in court Thursday over a report connecting military personnel to human trafficking. Phuket's provincial court ruled that the case should proceed and set the first hearing for May 26. If found guilty, the pair face jail time of up to seven years and a fine of around $3,000 each. The charges, which were brought by the Thai navy, relate to an article that Phuketwan, a small news website in the province of Phuket, published on its website in July last year. The report included information from a Reuters investigative piece that alleged some Thai security forces, including navy personnel and police, have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic Rohingya people fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar. Reuters won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the plight of the Rohingya Monday. The Royal Thai Navy filed criminal defamation and computer crimes charge against the Phuketwan reporters in December, accusing them of knowingly publishing false information and committing slander. But other Thai news organizations that quoted the Reuters reporting at the center of the case have not been charged, according to Phuketwan. The navy filed a criminal complaint against Reuters, but the news agency has also not been charged, a Reuters spokesperson said Thursday. ""To our understanding, the complaint is under review by the authorities,"" she said. The fact that Phuketwan appears to have been singled out for legal action has raised concerns among press freedom advocates that the lawsuit is an attempt to silence the small news site, which has been covering the Rohingya's movements in Thailand for a number of years. ""We're keen to get back to what we were doing and that was reporting the Rohingya as an issue,"" Morison told CNN Thursday. ""What's happened is that we've been diverted by this case to writing about ourselves. So we really haven't been able to cover the Rohingya issue the way we were once able to, and that's disappointing, and one of the ramifications of the foolishness of this particular lawsuit."" Morison and Chutima were detained in separate cells at the Phuket provincial court for around five hours Thursday while officials made arrangements for bail. ""We lost our freedom. That is a terrible thing,"" said Chutima after the pair were released. A local advocacy group, the Andaman community rights and legal aid center provided the bail of 100,000 baht (around $3,000) for each journalist. The case against Phuketwan has been condemned by the United Nations and prominent human rights groups, who say that imprisonment is a disproportionate punishment for defamation. Human Rights Watch said the navy should allow authorities to investigate the allegations of trafficking and other mistreatment of Rohingya migrants. ""The trial of these two journalists is unjustified and constitutes a dark stain on Thailand's record for respecting media freedom,"" Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch said in an emailed statement Thursday. ""The Thai Navy should have debated these journalists publicly if they had concerns with the story rather than insisting on their prosecution under the draconian Computer Crimes Act and criminal libel statutes,"" Adams said. Morison, 66, who is originally from Melbourne, has been in Phuket for 11 years where he produces Phuketwan and also freelances for international media, including CNN, The Sydney Morning Herald and the South China Morning Post. He worked for CNN as CNN.com Asia Deputy Editor from 2001 to 2002. Chutima, 33, has worked as a fixer for several international media organizations whose staff have traveled to Phuket and nearby regions to cover the Rohingya issue, including Reuters. ""These two journalists have done more than most to report accurately from Thailand the plight of Rohingyas. They have also rendered invaluable assistance to journalists at Thomson Reuters and other local and foreign media organizations attempting to report this humanitarian crisis,"" the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand said in a statement. ""The legal action also seriously damages the image of Thailand and claims it may make to supporting freedom of speech and fair comment."" Thailand ranks 130th out of 180 countries in the latest Reporters Without Borders press freedom index. Benjamin IsmaÃ¯l, the head of the organisation's Asia-Pacific desk described the case as ""absurd."" ""If the navy want to dispute the Reuters special report, which has just won a Pulitzer Prize, it can publicly give its version of events and demand the right of reply,"" he said. Phuketwan congratulated Reuters for their recent award but has been disappointed by the company's response to the defamation case. A Reuters spokesperson said Thursday that Chutima was employed ""in a very limited role to help make appointments,"" and she was not a part of the team who reported and investigated the stories that were awarded the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting. ""We oppose the use of criminal laws to sanction the press -- large or small, local or international -- for publication on matters of public interest, like the Rohingya,"" the spokesperson said. The Thai navy has denied any involvement in people smuggling. A navy official, who asked not to be named, told CNN in December that the navy did not intend to obstruct or threaten any media, but they were seeking to protect the organization from false allegations. The navy could not be reached for comment for this story. Morison is still hopeful that the Thai government will intervene and the case will be dropped before May 26 when he and Chutima are due to appear in court again. ""It all comes down to what constitutes democracy,"" he said. ""The media is a very important part of most democracies, and the military shouldn't be able to sue the media over this kind of issue."" Boatloads of Rohingya fleeing ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar have arrived in Thailand in recent years. Reports of Rohingya ending up in camps where they are held at ransom, beaten, killed or sold as laborers have been documented by NGOs and media organizations. The Thai government says it is committed to combating human trafficking but denies that the Rohingya are victims of trafficking. It says that they are migrants who consent to being smuggled.","Reporters in Thailand formally charged with defamation and granted bail .

"(CNN) -- There's no question that Maya Rudolph is supremely talented. The real question is whether the best home for those talents is on her own variety show. The ""Saturday Night Live"" alum tested that theory on Monday night with the hour-long NBC special ""The Maya Rudolph Show."" Critics weren't bowled over, but the ratings were nothing to sneeze at with 7.2 million tuning in. (It probably didn't hurt that ""The Maya ... Show"" premiered after ""The Voice,"" which had 11.5 million watching the first part of its season finale.) The concept for ""The Maya Rudolph Show"" is a callback to the variety specials of yore, with '70s programs like ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and ""Donny & Marie"" serving as inspiration. Monday's hour included song, dance, sketches and plenty of ""SNL"" cameos, but unlike Rudolph's former gig, the variety show wasn't live, late night TV. ""I always really responded to the familial aspect of it and how much fun they were having, which is what I miss more than anything about 'SNL' -- my friends and laughing,"" Rudolph previously told Entertainment Weekly. According to critics, Rudolph's special wasn't too short on laughs -- but it did lack cohesiveness and timeliness. ""To be honest, it was a bit of a mess -- albeit a wildly entertaining one,"" said The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon. ""It was a sometimes too-corny, sometimes too-raunchy, scattershot hour that was as gut-bustingly hilarious as it was completely baffling."" So while ""it's certainly admirable that NBC is attempting to bring the variety show back -- and they've made a genius decision in entrusting Rudolph to lead the way -- the question is whether anyone will follow, or even if they'd want to."" With audiences accustomed to watching entire networks devoted to precisely what they're in the mood for -- music, comedy or otherwise -- the variety show necessitates the sort of patience the average TV viewer may not have, argues NPR's David Bianculli. And with critics divided on whether Rudolph was magnetic enough to hold viewers' attention for an hour, it's unclear if she can single-handedly revive the retro format. (Bianculli, for one, thinks Justin Timberlake or Neil Patrick Harris would be able to do it better.) Slate's TV critic Willa Paskin agreed that ""The Maya Rudolph Show"" was ""pleasant without being particularly funny or memorable, odd without being urgent or edgy, scattershot without taking any big swings."" ""On the strength of last night's pleasant, listless example, maybe (the variety show) needs reviving even less than pop-up video."" New York magazine's Margaret Lyons, too, wasn't quite sold that ""variety is a format that makes sense on American TV in 2014,"" but she did think the first airing of ""The Maya Rudolph Show"" had its strengths. ""I hope this isn't the series' only outing because I have almost infinite positive regard for Rudolph, and I'd rather see a show like this find itself than watch another second of some hate-soaked but competent sitcom,"" Lyons reviewed. ""But I kept wondering what the mission of 'TMRS' is, what tone it aspires to, how it sees itself, how it's supposed to feel. ... Mostly, though, the show just needs to be more.""","Maya Rudolph's variety special aired on NBC Monday .

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Billy Graham was released from the hospital Tuesday after a two-day stay and returned to his North Carolina home, Mission Hospital said. Pulmonologist Daniel Fertel said doctors caught his bronchitis early, a vital factor in his quick recovery. ""Despite this illness he remains remarkably healthy for a 93-year-old man,"" the doctor said in a news release issued by the hospital. Graham was admitted to the hospital in the western North Carolina city of Asheville early Sunday morning. Graham said he received ""exceptional care"" during his stay. ""I am also grateful for the prayers and letters I received from people across the country and around the world during my short stay,"" Graham said in the news release. ""Such an outpouring of love and support is always a blessing but was especially appreciated during my hospitalization."" He was hospitalized with pneumonia last November, six months after being admitted to a hospital for the same condition. Since then, he has remained ""in good overall health ... though he continues to remain at home due to age-related conditions,"" according to the hospital and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Graham, a resident of Montreat, about 18 miles east of Asheville, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents, beginning with Harry S. Truman, and is the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The Charlotte native has preached to untold millions over six decades, beginning his missionary work in 1944 when he started speaking at rallies for the Youth for Christ/Campus Life ministry. Five years later, Graham was holding a ""crusade"" in tents in downtown Los Angeles. Originally scheduled for three weeks, the crusade drew so many followers it was extended to seven. His ""last crusade"" in June 2005 drew 230,000 people. Even with his advanced age and health issues, Graham remains ""actively involved in ministry and writing projects,"" his evangelistic association and the hospital said. That includes writing a new book, which is almost done, ""summarizing his Gospel message over the past seven decades of public ministry."" He also has weighed in on hot-button issues of late, including supporting North Carolina's constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, which voters passed earlier this year, and last month defending the president of the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain for his opposition to same-sex marriage. Also in July, in a letter released by his organization, Graham leveled deep criticism at the United States and ""its deceived people."" ""Self-centered indulgence, pride and a lack of shame over sin are now emblems of the American lifestyle,"" Graham wrote. But he saw hope. ""The wonderful news is that our Lord is a God of mercy, and he responds to repentance,"" Graham said.","Billy Graham is discharged from the hospital after being treated for bronchitis .

"(CNN) -- Billy Bean, a former major league player who announced after his career that he is gay, has been appointed as an ""ambassador of inclusion,"" Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Tuesday. It is the latest move as the major sports leagues in the United States ramp up efforts to promote inclusion and fight discrimination. As a consultant, Bean will work with teams in the majors and in the minor leagues to provide guidance and training against homophobia, prejudice and sexism, MLB said. ""As a young man, I silently walked away from baseball for all the wrong reasons, and today I am truly humbled that the commissioner's office has brought me back to lead the effort on inclusion,"" Bean said. A year ago Major League Baseball issued a policy to protect players from discrimination and harassment based on their sexual orientation. The code is posted in every locker room. Currently, there are no openly gay major leaguers. Bean, 50, played six seasons for three different teams: the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and the San Diego Padres. He played his last game in 1995. He told Outsports three years ago that he retired after his played in a game rather than attend his partner's funeral. In 1999, Bean told a columnist for the Miami Herald that he is gay, making him the second former player to come out. On Tuesday, MLB honored the late Glenn Burke, who was the only major league player to tell teammates during his playing career that he was gay. Three years after his career ended in 1979, he publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in an interview with Inside Sports magazine. He died in 1995. Lutha Burke attended Tuesday's tribute to her brother. She said her brother would be happy but would wonder about all the fuss ""because when you're just busy trying to live a life and be a decent human being, and play the sport as best you can, with all the respect you can, it should be a done deal or an easy deal for anyone."" The National Hockey League, which also has no openly gay players, began teaming with the You Can Play Project, an advocacy group for gays in sports, in 2013. The league has said the partnership will include education and training for fans, players and teams. The NFL, which saw Michael Sam become the first openly gay player drafted, has met with gay and lesbian groups and had a former player who is gay speak at an owners meeting. The league also has sessions on tolerance during sessions for rookies. Jason Collins became the first publicly openly gay player in a major U.S. sports league when he took the court for the NBA's Boston Celtics. That league has for years partnered with the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network.","Billy Bean came out in 1999, four years after his career ended .

"(CNN) -- The man accused of killing a bride-to-be and her fiance's best man when he drove the boat they were passengers on into a barge on the Hudson River was charged in an 18-count indictment unsealed Thursday. JoJo John, 35, is facing two counts of first-degree vehicular manslaughter, four counts of second-degree vehicular manslaughter, two counts of second-degree manslaughter, two counts of criminally negligent homicide, two counts of first-degree vehicular assault, four counts of second-degree vehicular assault and two counts of operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol or drugs. ""The defendant is accused of taking the helm of his boat while under the influence of alcohol, being unable to maintain situational awareness and striking a construction barge,"" Rockland County District Attorney Thomas P. Zugibe said. ""Drinking and driving is a lethal mix, as it appears to have been in this incident, which left several families shattered. My office will aggressively prosecute this case to ensure that justice is done."" John was piloting a 19-foot Stingray powerboat around 10:40 p.m. on July 26 when it slammed into one of three construction barges strapped together near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan, hurling Lindsey Stewart and Mark Lennon into the river, resulting in their deaths, according to the indictment. John and three others, including groom-to-be Brian Bond, were injured. Stewart and Bond were to be married two weeks later, according to family, with Lennon as best man. According to the indictment, John's blood alcohol level was found to be 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit of .08, and ""cocaine metabolites"" were found in his system. But John's attorney, David Narain, said the real cause of the disastrous collision was the result of insufficient lighting on the barges. ""The defense investigation has uncovered substantial evidence, including physical evidence and the testimony of numerous witnesses, that the cause of this tragic accident was the poorly and inadequately lit group of barges struck by JoJo John's boat,"" Narain said in a statement. ""We dispute the toxicology reports and look forward to challenging those findings,"" he added. James Mercante, who is representing John in civil matters, agreed: ""A boater should be able to cross a navigable waterway, impaired or not, without intrusion. The barges unduly interfered with that transit."" John was arrested while recovering at Nyack Hospital, court documents said, and an arraignment is pending.

"ELDORADO, Texas (CNN) -- Dozens more children and young women were removed Saturday from a Texas ranch that is home to members of a polygamist sect, as state workers investigated claims of physical and sexual abuse. Texas authorties used the bus in the background to transport children from a FLDS compound Friday. A total of 183 people -- including 137 children -- have been taken away since law enforcement officers raided the compound Thursday night, said Marleigh Meisner, a spokeswoman for the Texas Child Protective Services Division. The children -- most of them girls -- were being interviewed by special investigators, she said. ""We're trying to find out if they're safe,"" she explained. ""We need to know if they have been abused or neglected."" Eighteen of the girls have been taken into state custody. Authorities believe that they ""had been abused or were at immediate risk of future abuse,"" said Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar. The others were taken to a nearby civic center. Meisner described them as doing ""remarkably well."" Authorities continue to search the 1,900-acre YFZ ranch, occupied by followers of imprisoned polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, and at least one man is being sought by police. Law enforcement agencies raided the ranch Thursday night after receiving a report Monday that a 16-year-old girl had been ""sexually and physically abused,"" Azar said.  Watch buses take girls from compound » . Law enforcement and child welfare officials were at the ranch all night Thursday and throughout Friday. According to the search warrant, authorities are seeking Dale Barlow, 50, whom they suspect of having married and fathered a child with a 16-year-old girl.  Watch an Eldorado neighbor talk about the raid » . The warrant cited an ""immediate need"" for authorities to have access to the 16-year-old and an 8-month-old child with either the last name of Barlow or the girl's last name. It instructs law enforcement officers to look for any records showing that Barlow and the girl were married and any evidence of them having a child. The people living at the ranch are cooperating, authorities said. Jeffs, the 52-year-old leader and ""prophet"" of the 10,000-member church, was convicted in Utah last year and sentenced to 10 years on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001. He faces trial in Arizona on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy. Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bought the land near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch, which they call the YFZ Ranch. The letters are said to refer to the words Yearning for Zion. It is home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds. State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening, preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property, according to Randy Mankin, editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper. ""This came totally out of the blue,"" Mankin said. There were no indications of violence around the ranch, he said. When CNN crews have visited the ranch, it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders. When CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year, the crew saw a massive temple, the three-story housing units where Jeffs' chosen followers live, the water tower, the school and community center, the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill. The church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona-Utah state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona -- but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado, four miles to the south. Critics of the sect say that it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13 and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men. If male followers are excommunicated, the critics claim, their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN)  -- A 7-year-old Russian boy adopted by an American family last year was put on a return flight to Moscow this week because of violent and psychotic behavior, according to a Tennessee grandmother. The child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry Thursday, triggering an international investigation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a Russian TV channel on Friday that his country has banned future adoptions by Americans until the United States signs a new agreement to regulate them. U.S. diplomats have avoided such an agreement to set responsibilities for the adopting parents, Lavrov said, ""but this latest incident has exhausted our patience."" ""We are now investigating the circumstances of the boy's return to see if any crimes were committed,"" said U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Beyrle. ""We are also in close contact with the Russian government on all aspects of the case, and we know that he is being well cared for."" Nancy Hansen, the Tennessee woman who put Justin Hansen on the plane in Washington, insisted she did not abandon the child, but was following instructions from a lawyer she found online. Hansen told CNN that she was concerned about her family's safety after a series of violent incidents and threats. ""I still have energy and I love children,"" Hansen said. ""It wasn't that he was just energetic and wearing us down. It was the violent tendencies and he had to be watched at all time."" When her daughter, Torry Hansen, adopted the boy from a Russian orphanage last year, she asked the doctor there if he had any physical or mental problems, Nancy Hansen said. The doctor answered ""'He's healthy,' and turned and left,"" she said. Once the child learned enough English, he told his new family about the horrors of his previous life, including being beaten at the orphanage after his mother abandoned him, she said. He also told of an incident in which he burned down a building near the orphanage, she said. Russian Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said the child was ""completely healthy, physically and mentally"" before the adoption. ""Nobody withheld anything from her [Torry Hansen],"" he said. ""It's a lie."" Justin told Russian officials he was abused by the American family, Astakhov said. ""There was a grandmother who was at home with the boys,"" he said. ""She used to shout at [Justin] a lot. When I asked how the mother treated him he burst into tears and said she used to pull his hair."" Hansen said the child had a ""hit list"" of people he was targeting, including her daughter, who he said he ""wanted to kill for the house."" He threatened to kill her grandson for a videogame, she said. The final incident that convinced Hansen she should send the boy back to Russia was when she caught him starting a fire with papers in his bedroom last Monday, she said. She feared the child might burn down the house and kill her family, she said. Hansen and her family were set to meet with Bedford County, Tennessee, Sheriff Randall Boyce on Friday afternoon but their lawyer asked to reschedule the session for next week, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. ""I'm not sure there's been a crime committed,"" Boyce said earlier. He was asked by the U.S. State Department to investigate. A State Department spokesman said the U.S. government was ""very troubled"" by the incident. ""As parents, my wife and I were deeply shocked by the news of Justin Hansen, and very angry that any family would act so callously toward a child that they had legally adopted,"" Ambassador Beyrle said. Nancy Hansen outlined for CNN the process she followed after she decided Justin must go back to Russia. When the lawyer she found online advised her the adoption could be reversed, Hansen booked the flight and paid the fee for a steward to escort Justin through the airport, she said. She hired a driver in Moscow she found online to pick the child up from the Moscow airport, she said. She found ""safe references"" for the driver online, she said. She then prepared a letter for Justin to present to Russian officials, which included a photo of the driver, whom she identified as ""Arthur,"" she said. Justin ""had never been happier"" than when he boarded the plane for Moscow, she said. Russian child protection officials were not happy when the child arrived unannounced at their ministry Wednesday. Nancy Hansen said when they called her there was ""a lot of yelling going on."" But Hansen said after the call she believed the matter was settled and the boy was safe, until she also got a call from the U.S. Embassy. They told her she had set off an ""international incident."" The U.S. State Department spokesman on Friday said it was up to the Russian government to decide whether it will suspend adoptions by Americans because of the incident. Ambassador Beyrle said cases of neglect are rare among the ""tens of thousands of adopted Russian children who are living happily and lovingly with their American families."" ""But even one incident like this is too many, and we will get to the bottom of what went wrong,"" he said. The Seattle-based agency which Hansen said her daughter used to coordinate the adoption said it found out about Justin's return only Friday. ""We were alerted to this situation by our branch office in Moscow, Russia, and are shocked and saddened by this turn of events,"" said a spokeswoman for the World Association for Children and Parents. In the 1 percent of the cases where the dissolution of an adoption has been needed, the agency ""has always supported and worked closely with [adoptive] parents to assist the child in moving into a new adoptive family,"" she said. CNN's Carolina Sanchez, Dave Alsup and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Future adoptions to U.S. are banned pending new treaty, foreign minister says .

"(CNN) -- Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the ""D.C. Madam,"" was found dead in Florida on Thursday, according to Tarpon Springs police. Deborah Jeane Palfrey was convicted of running a high-powered prostitution ring. Palfrey hanged herself in a storage shed on her mother's property, where she had been staying, police said. Palfrey's mother, 76-year-old Blanche Palfrey, found the body, police said. Palfrey was convicted April 15 in connection with a high-end prostitution ring catering to Washington's elite. She had said in interviews that she would kill herself before going to prison. ""Blanche Palfrey had awoken from a nap and began to search the residence for her daughter,"" police said. ""When she went outside, she noticed a three-wheel bicycle had been moved that was normally kept in the shed."" The older woman then saw her daughter's body hanging from a metal beam under the shed's roof, police said. ""The mother's obviously distraught,"" said Tarpon Springs police Capt. Jeffrey Young. ""This is the hardest part in any type of situation like this, when you have a suicide. It's all the victims that are left behind."" Police earlier said ""handwritten notes were found on scene that describes the victim's intention to take her life, and foul play does not appear to be involved."" The Pinellas County Medical Examiner's Office will determine the cause of death, police said.  Watch police confirm death of ""D.C. Madam"" » . Palfrey's lawyers expressed sadness at news reports. ""I am devastated to hear about this,"" Montgomery Blair Sibley said before police confirmed the death.   Her court-appointed lawyer Preston Burton said, ""This is tragic news. My heart goes out to her mother."" She was found guilty of money laundering, racketeering and mail fraud and faced a maximum 55-year prison term at her sentencing, scheduled for July 24. Prosecutors estimated that she would have received a sentence between 57 and 71 months, about six years, because of sentencing guidelines and other factors that would have been taken into account. ""I'm looking at 55 years in a federal penitentiary, and at my age, that is virtually a life sentence,"" Palfrey told CNN Radio's Ninette Sosa in March. ""Realistically, we estimate between eight and 15 years. I'm also looking at the complete forfeiture of my entire life savings and work."" She said the government ""went after me. They found out that I'm not who they thought I was, and instead of dropping the whole matter they decided to press forward and, what the heck, she's a woman, she's weak, we'll intimidate her, we'll humiliate her, we'll pounce on this poor lady and she'll give in."" Palfrey told writer Dan Moldea, who was helping her write a book, that she would commit suicide rather than return to jail, according to Time magazine. ""She had done time once before [for prostitution],"" Moldea told Time. ""And it damn near killed her."" Palfrey had made similar comments to ABC News in 2007, saying, ""I sure as heck am not going to be going to federal prison for one day, let alone, you know, four to eight years."" A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, which prosecuted Palfrey, said, ""we extend our condolences to Ms. Palfrey's family."" At least one lawmaker, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, turned up in the phone records of her business, Pamela Martin & Associates. State Department official Randall Tobias resigned in May 2007 after confirming that he patronized Palfrey's business. Palfrey argued her business was a legitimate, legal escort service. ""There's no violence, there's very little if any drug activity. There's very little if any fraud. Basically a bunch of benign women who want to make a living. This is not racketeering by any means -- this is running a business,"" she told CNN Radio in March. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams slammed Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev for his ""insensitive, sexist and racist"" remarks in describing her and sister Venus as the ""Williams brothers"" on a late night TV chat show. The world number one gave her first public reaction Sunday to Tarpischev's comments as she spoke to reporters on the eve of the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore. Tarpischev, who has been banned by the WTA for a year and fined $25,000, has also made a public apology, but that has clearly not satisfied 18-time grand slam champion Williams. ""I think the WTA did a great job of taking initiative and taking immediate action to his comments. I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time,"" she said. Williams, who won the U.S. Open title last month, added: ""I thought they were in a way bullying. ""But the WTA and the USTA (U.S. Tennis Association) did a wonderful job of making sure that -- in this day of age, 2014 for someone with his power, it's really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks."" Tarpischev's apology, in which he suggested his remarks were a ""small joke,"" has also cut little ice with world number two Maria Sharapova. She has played in Russian FedCup teams captained by Tarpischev, but had little sympathy for her compatriot when asked for her reaction to the comments. ""I think they were very disrespectful and uncalled for, and I'm glad that many people have stood up, including the WTA,"" she said. ""It was very inappropriate, especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in sport, but being part of the Olympic committee. It was just really irresponsible on his side."" The controversy has been an unwelcome distraction ahead of the prestigious end of season finals, where Williams is bidding for a third straight title. She opens against former world number one Ana Ivanovic Monday, hoping to shrug off injury and illness scares from her two previous tournaments in China. ""I wasn't sure if I would be able to make it to this tournament,"" she admitted. ""But I'm here, and I'm really -- I feel better than I did obviously in China. I am just getting better every day hopefully."" On the men's ATP Tour, the race to secure a place in its eight-man Tour Finals in London next month is hotting up. Britain's Andy Murray improved his chances of claiming one of the three remaining spots available by beating Spain's David Ferrer 5-7 6-2 7-5 to win the Austrian Open in Vienna. It's the 30th career title for Murray, who has gone above Ferrer in the standings. Both will now play in Valencia next week. Top seed Tomas Berdych also did his cause no harm by beating defending champion Grigor Dimitrov 5-7 6-4 6-4 to claim the Stockholm Open title Sunday. The Czech is now seventh, just ahead of Murray in the qualifying battle, while defeat damages the hopes of Bulgaria's Dimitrov, who was seeking his fourth title of the year. U.S. Open Marin Cilic, who has already booked his place at London, won the Kremlin Cup tournament, beating Spaniard Roberto Bautista-Agut in straight sets. Tarpischev is chairman of the annual event in the Russian capital Moscow, and after his remarks about the Williams sisters, the WTA is demanding he stands down from that position.","Serena Williams criticizes Shamil Tarpischev for ""sexist"" remarks .

"(CNN) -- One of the stars of this summer's Hollywood hit, ""Inception"", Ken Watanabe has fought his way to the top of his profession. He started out as a theatrical actor in Japan in the 1980s, later finding fame in his homeland through TV and film roles often playing noble warriors in historical dramas or enigmatic tough guys. His biggest challenge came away from the lights and cameras when he was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 29. Fortunately he was able to continue acting while visiting hospital for treatment. However a return of the cancer five years later had an even more profound affect on him. ""When I got relapse, I thought my life would be meaningless if I did not make a comeback as an actor. It was a kind of sense of duty. That's how I faced [it],"" he told CNN. ""One good thing was that it gave me a time to reflect on my way of life, to think how I had connected myself to society. I had very vague image about the work of acting until then... We could connect to society because there are audiences who watch our performance."" Making a connection to a worldwide audience came with his role alongside Tom Cruise in 2003 film ""The Last Samurai"". It also helped Watanabe expand his own horizons. ""It was good that after growing in my career and seeing kind of a limit in myself, in a way Hollywood told me that it was not a limit at all... It opened me up to go as far as I can,"" he said. Now 50, Watanabe has continued to make movies in Japan after his Oscar nominated performance in ""The Last Samurai"" but has maintained his Hollywood credentials with roles in Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""Batman Begins"". His global profile is also growing, but he has the new battle of avoiding being typecast.

"(CNN) -- Ray Harryhausen, the stop-motion animation and special-effects master whose work influenced such directors as Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and George Lucas, has died, according to the Facebook page of the Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation. Harryhausen was 92. The page did not offer a cause of death. Harryhausen's pioneering work on such movies as ""Mighty Joe Young,"" ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" ""One Million Years B.C."" and ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981) was widely praised for its ability to blend stop-motion effects -- models filmed one frame at a time -- and live action. In ""Jason,"" for example, the hero has a battle with a group of skeletons that emerge from the ground and take on the Greek warriors. Harryhausen called his format ""dynamation,"" and though it looks somewhat crude by today's computer-generated standards, it still packs a punch -- and other filmmakers remain agog by Harryhausen's abilities. Several filmmakers paid tribute to him on his 90th birthday, including Jackson, ""Wallace & Gromit's"" Nick Park and Monty Python's Terry Gilliam. Pixar worked in a reference to Harryhausen in ""Monsters, Inc."" Raymond Frederick Harryhausen was born in Los Angeles in 1920. From his childhood he was intrigued by movies and animation, inspired by films such as ""The Lost World"" (1925) and especially ""King Kong"" (1933). As a teenager he built dioramas featuring prehistoric creatures and filmed them with a 16-millimeter camera, gently hitting the ""run"" button to move the film one frame at a time, according to his biography on rayharryhausen.com. By the time he was in his early 20s he was friends with Forrest Ackerman and Ray Bradbury, two men who shared Harryhausen's fondness for storytelling and animation. Ackerman became a writer, editor and famed memorabilia collector; Bradbury, of course, became one of the most celebrated science-fiction writers. Other influential colleagues included Willis O'Brien, the ""King Kong"" animator, who encouraged Harryhausen's pursuits, and George Pal, who produced 1953's ""The War of the Worlds"" and directed 1960's ""The Time Machine."" The science-fiction and fantasy films of Harryhausen's career weren't the star-filled, big-budget productions of today. Indeed, Harryhausen's creations were often the main attraction for films that lacked the polish of major studio releases. But the dedicated Harryhausen had a well-earned following, and was quick with praise for his successors. He also never lost his fondness for storytelling, and even in today's computer-dominated marketplace, maintained high hopes that the art of combining stop-motion with live action would continue. ""Stop-motion is a medium that welcomes fantasy, hence the number of recent productions,"" Harryhausen told CNN in 2012. ""As yet, though, there seem to be no productions that are utilizing model stop-motion and live actors. But that will, I think, re-emerge. It is only a matter of time.""

"(CNN) -- ""If power plants, waste handling, chemical plants and transport systems were located in wealthy areas as quickly and easily as in poor areas, we would have had a clean, green economy decades ago."" -- Majora Carter, Powershift 2007 . It was while walking her dog that Carter stumbled upon the disused stretch of waterfront that inspired her to act . Majora Carter grew up in the South Bronx at a time when America's cities were emptying into the suburbs. Many of the buildings in her neighborhood were abandoned by the time she was ten years old. Landlords were burning their buildings to collect the insurance; light manufacturing industries were moving out of the Bronx; and waste facilities were moving in to take their place. As pollution rose, asthma rates, poor health and unemployment soared. To outsiders, those who were left were branded with the stamp of the ghetto: as Carter says, ""If you lived here you were no doubt a pimp, a pusher, or a prostitute."" As a child, Carter spent much of her time planning her escape. ""Education was my way out,"" she reveals. She studied cinema studies and film production at Wesley University then signed up for graduate school at New York University. To save money, she moved home to her parents. Of that time, she says, ""It felt like a defeat but it was also the best thing in the world to happen to me because I got reacquainted with my community."" Carter saw that her neighborhood -- under-served, ignored and literally dumped on -- needed to fight a positive campaign to assert itself as a vibrant community. ""People wanted things like clean air, they wanted safe places for their kids to play where they wouldn't get hit by a truck,"" she tells CNN. ""They wanted living wage jobs that didn't degrade the environment or kill them."" She fought a vociferous campaign against a planned waste facility that would have seen 40 percent of New York's municipal waste coming to the South Bronx. ""We were already handling 40 percent of the city's commercial waste here,"" she says. In 2001, after the defeat of the scheme, Carter founded the non-profit environmental justice solutions corporation, Sustainable South Bronx. Its central tenet is that people shouldn't have to move out of their neighborhoods to live in a better one. While walking her dog one day, Carter stumbled upon a disused stretch of waterfront. That inspired her to write a tenacious $1.25 million Federal Transportation planning grant for the South Bronx Greenway. The 11-mile-long stretch is the first new South Bronx waterfront park in over 60 years and provides alternative transport, recreational space, jobs and environmental enhancements to the local community. In 2003, Sustainable South Bronx started an urban green-collar training scheme. Many of the course's graduates were formerly incarcerated; all were receiving some form of public handout. The scheme now boasts an 85 percent employment rate, in areas like urban forestry, brown-field clean-up, green roof installation and maintenance. Ultimately, Carter would like to see her organization ""worked out of a job."" She believes that, with the right partnerships, the South Bronx could be transformed into the thriving neighborhood her parents once knew. Carter has now handed the day-to-day management of Sustainable South Bronx to her colleagues, allowing her to spread her messages of environmental justice and regeneration through green industry to others. ""We've got to decide that we want to live in a world that is sane and happy and healthy, and that everyone deserves that,"" she says.","Carter, who grew up in the Bronx, set up Sustainable South Bronx in 2001 .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- It has been 10 years since federal agents raided the Gonzalez family home in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, seizing 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. Today, the house is a museum where visitors can see a virtual shrine to the boy -- now a 16-year-old military student in Cuba -- and his brief time in the United States. His school uniform still hangs in the closet, along with dozens of outfits that he never got a chance to wear. His toys are on display inside the house, as well as a giant image of the infamous Associated Press photo showing a federal agent pointing a weapon toward Elian and Donato Dalrymple, who had been hiding the boy in a bedroom closet. ""The story is still very vivid in this area,"" says Ruby Feria, a local radio reporter who covered the story. ""People think that it was just yesterday that they took Elian."" The custody dispute that led to Elian's seizure made national headlines, partly because of the possible impact on already tense U.S.-Cuban relations and also on the 2000 presidential election. Elian was found off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in November 1999, the only survivor of a group of 13 Cuban migrants trying to make it to the United States. His mother was among the dead. His father, in Cuba, demanded his return, but relatives in Miami refused to release him, touching off a seven-month international custody battle. Eventually, Attorney General Janet Reno decided to send Elian back to Cuba, but she failed to persuade his relatives in Miami to relinquish custody of Elian to his father. So, during the predawn hours of April 22, 2000, armed federal agents raided Delfin Gonzalez's home and seized the boy, reuniting him with his father. Vice President Al Gore, who was running for president at the time, broke ranks with the Clinton administration, calling for the matter to be settled in Florida's family court system. Gore was accused of pandering to Florida's Cuban-American voters, because the state was a battleground state in the presidential vote. Today, largely sheltered from prying eyes, 16-year-old Elian attends a Cuban military academy in the Cuban city of Matanzas. State media recently published photos of the trim-haired teen in his olive green and red uniform participating in the annual congress of the Union of Communist Youth. CNN's Shasta Darlington spoke to Elian's grandmother in his hometown of Cardenas. She said he comes home every weekend to visit his family there. ""Now he's a man, a little man,"" said Maria Quintana, standing on the porch of the modest house where Elian used to live with his father. ""He has a normal life, the way he wants it."" A plaque denouncing what many in Cuba call the ""Miami mafia"" hangs on the front of the house. She said Elian gets top grades, but still has time for ""a lot of girlfriends, just like any normal boy."" Elian's immediate family has moved to another part of town to avoid outside intrusions on their life. When Elian returned to Cuba in June 2000, he and his father found themselves with front-row seats to Cuban President Fidel Castro's rallies. Castro himself had led the battle to bring Elian back. On more than one occasion, Elian himself took the stage. ""It's been five years since I returned with my dad,"" he said at one event. ""And it was possible because of my family, the Cuban people and Commander Fidel."" Castro and Elian also had a personal relationship. The aging president attended his birthday celebrations.

"(CNN) -- Librarians, information specialists, knowledge managers or whatever title a librarian might have -- their skills are in high demand. And, though you might not know it, they are everywhere. And so in their honor during National Library Week, we enjoy the following tidbits of information. Famous people who were librarians . FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Casanova, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, former first lady Laura Bush and China's Mao Zedong. At one point in their lives, each of them either worked as librarian or in a library. Librarians are techno-savvy . Librarians don't just use books anymore. Searching through tweets, blogs, podcasts, websites and more to find accurate and authoritative information has become more the rule than the exception. At a time where anyone can Google just about anything, librarians don't just find information, they find the correct information -- and fast. The American Library Association reports reference librarians in the nation's public and academic libraries answered nearly 5.7 million questions each week in 2010. Filmmaker's library . Even ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas has his own research library on his Skywalker Ranch. Lucas started the library in 1978, and the collection is housed under a large stained-glass dome. Librarians influence our culture and society . While clearing out old archives at the Palmer Theological Seminary in 2005, librarian Heather Carbo found a working manuscript of one of Beethoven's final compositions. Librarians track spy info and classified intelligence . When the CIA needs to provide information to the U.S. president, they turn to their librarians. To become one of the U.S. intelligence's community research experts, a librarian must pass medical and psychological exams, polygraph interviews and clear extensive background investigations. Librarians are heroic . Alia Muhammad Baker, the chief librarian of Basra, Iraq, removed 30,000 books from the city's main library before it was destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Their numbers are many . In 2009, there were 206,000 librarians, 50,000 library technicians and 96,000 other education, training and library workers . Librarians are behind the scenes in current events . -- Federal government shutdown. Lawmakers go to the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress, for information. -- The royal wedding at Westminster Abbey. The Abbey's Library and Muniment Room has a historic collection of books, manuscripts and archival material. -- NATO no-fly zone over Libya. NATO's Brussels Headquarters houses a multimedia library with a collection focusing on international relations, security and defense, military questions and world affairs. Warning to readers about librarians . A character in ""The Callahan Touch"", one of science fiction writer Spider Robinson's books, said, ""Librarians are the secret masters of the universe. They control information. Never piss one off."" Good advice.

"(CNN) -- Seconds after a gunman shot Allie Young in the neck in a crowded Colorado theater, a friend, Stephanie Davies, pulled her into an aisle, put pressure on her wound and dialed 911.

"London (CNN) -- A ""once-in-a-lifetime"" exhibition of paintings and drawings by Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci opened in London Wednesday. The show, ""Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan,"" at London's National Gallery includes nine of da Vinci's 15 surviving paintings -- the first time so many of the artist's paintings have been exhibited together. The estimated insurance value of the works on show is $2 billion. ""I think this is maybe a once-in-a-lifetime experience,"" said Luke Syson, curator of Italian painting before 1500 for The National Gallery. ""(The exhibition) sort of tops everything, it's a moment in history really."" Highlights include the recently rediscovered ""Salvator Mundi"" and the first version of ""The Virgin of the Rocks,"" which has never before left the Louvre Museum, Paris. It is being exhibited opposite the National Gallery's recently restored version of ""The Virgin of the Rocks."" The show focuses on the period of da Vinci's life when he was living and working at the Sforza Court in Milan as a painter and engineer for the Duke. It was during this time that he produced paintings such as ""La Belle Ferronniere,"" ""The Lady with an Ermine,"" his first version of ""The Virgin of the Rocks,"" ""Madonna Litta,"" and fresco ""The Last Supper."" All of these works, barring ""The Last Supper"" (which is painted onto the wall of a church in Milan) are on view at the National Gallery. A copy of ""The Last Supper,"" painted by da Vinci's contemporary Giampietrino, is on display. It was an important period for da Vinci, says Syson, and the exhibition charts his evolution as a painter and thinker. He developed his concept of painting as a science, where he equated seeing with perceiving -- a radical idea in the 15th century. ""(Da Vinci) thought that the eye and what you could see was the most important way of experiencing the world and that painting could encapsulate all that was visible and invisible in it. ""(He's) getting closer to the belief that a painter in some ways imitates the mind of God himself, (his) own creativity is akin to god's creation and it's a huge leap,"" he said. It was also during this period that da Vinci became interested in the sciences and especially anatomy, and the many drawings on display show a furious mind, constantly thinking, sketching and pushing at its intellectual limits. Also on public view for the very first time as a Leonardo da Vinci painting is the ""Salvator Mundi,"" displayed alongside preparatory drawings. According to art historian Richard Stemp, ""To suddenly have a new painting by Leonardo when he painted so few in the first place is enormously exciting."" He added that, despite the painting's rigorous authentication process, there are still going to be art historians who ""will want to go along and see that it's not by Leonardo."" To put his work into context, paintings by da Vinci's associates and pupils, including Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio (originally thought to have been the painter of ""Salvator Mundi"") and Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis are also included in the show. One of the key themes in the exhibition is beauty. Da Vinci used geometry to refine proportions and adhered to prevalent ideals of beauty in his work, said Syson. The aim was to achieve perfection. ""Leonardo realized that paintings could make you fall in love, and in order to do that you needed to be amazed by a kind of absolutely essential beauty,"" he said. ""What he's showing is a painter that can (not only) record beauty but create beauty above all,"" he continued. Many of the drawings featured in the ""Leonardo -- The Lost Painting"" are held in the Royal Collection: royalcollection.org.uk .","Landmark exhibition in London brings nine Leonardo da Vinci paintings together .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey officially said Monday that it has ""profound regret"" for practicing slavery, and became the first state north of the Mason-Dixon line to pass such apologetic legislation. The legislation does not need the signature of New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine to become official. A committee of the New Jersey Assembly last Thursday approved the resolution, just one of several steps lawmakers had to take by Monday, the last day of the current legislative session. The Assembly and the Senate voted overwhelmingly -- 29-2 -- to approve the resolution. The resolution states that ""the fundamental values of Africans were shattered; they were brutalized, humiliated and dehumanized."" New Jersey, it reads, had 12,000 slaves, one of the largest populations in the northern colonies. The state was also the last to emancipate slaves, in 1846, it says. If the resolution had not passed, the process would have had to begin again. The resolution did not need Gov. Jon Corzine's signature and will become official when filed with the secretary of state. The symbolic atonement follows apologies for slavery made in 2007 by legislators in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia.

"New York (CNN) -- A city official married the first couple in New York City to wed under the state's new law allowing same-sex marriage Sunday. Phyllis Siegal, 76, and Connie Kopelov, 84, were married in a chapel at the city clerk's office as a crowd of onlookers cheered. The two, of New York, have been together for 23 years. Kopelov left the clerk's office in a wheelchair, but used a walker to approach reporters. ""Your cheers are wonderful,"" Siegal told well-wishers outside the office. She told reporters the experience was ""just so amazing. It's the only way I can describe it."" Hundreds of same-sex couples heard the news Friday that they made the cut in the marriage lottery that New York state instituted for Sunday, the day that the state's Marriage Equality Act took effect. ""These are two independent people who are joining together because they can see and they can feel how much better their lives will be,"" city clerk Michael McSweeney said as he married Siegal and Kopelov. ""We are grateful that they are allowing us to share this truly momentous ceremony with them."" The New York City clerk's office has been flooded with more than 2,600 requests for marriage licenses since the wording on the online application was changed from ""Groom and Bride"" to ""Spouse A and Spouse B."" The office could handle less than a third of those requests -- gay or straight -- on Sunday, according to a press statement the city released earlier in the week. The lottery was set up to allocate 764 slots for couples who want to obtain marriage licenses and/or be married at city clerk's offices on Sunday. Buffalo residents Kitty Lambert and Cheryle Rudd claim to be the first couple married in the state. The two exchanged vows at 12:01 a.m. Sunday in Niagara Falls, according to CNN affiliate WGRZ. Couples began lining up outside the clerk's office in New York City before the ceremonies began Sunday. Some women wore wedding gowns, while some men wore suits or tuxedos. If all 764 weddings actually take place on Sunday, it will set a one-day record for the city. ""Marriage equality is alive and well in every borough of New York City right now,"" said Christine Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council, who is also gay. She said watching the weddings ""sent a chill up my spine."" Marcos Chaljub and Freddy Zambrano were married after Siegal and Kopelov. The two tearfully said their vows as friends hovered and snapped pictures. ""You're married!"" one declared as celebratory hugs were exchanged afterward. Chaljub and Zambrano conducted last-minute preparations Saturday for their wedding, picking up bouquets of wildflowers for their bridesmaids and champagne for a family brunch afterward. The couple has been together for five years. ""I have certain people in my life, they're not totally OK with it, but they accept it, and just the fact they respect us because of that, it's really the most that I can ask for,"" Chaljub told CNN's Susan Candiotti. The two have been wearing rings for five years, and said they don't plan to exchange new ones. ""We're just going to polish them up and exchange them again,"" Chaljub said. As with many weddings, there were some comical moments. Chaljub momentarily forgot which finger to put Zambrano's ring on. ""Is it this one?"" he asked. Asked whether he took Michael Elasser, 56, as his spouse, 60-year-old Douglas Robinson responded, ""You bet your life I do!"" The couple's two adopted sons, ages 25 and 22, attended the ceremony. ""This is one of the great things about America, this diversity,"" Robinson said. ""I'm so proud to be an American today, but I'm particularly proud to be a New Yorker."" New York Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of Beit Simchat Torah congregation, who has lobbied for legalizing same-sex marriage, set up a station for couples desiring a religious ceremony after the civil one. New York legalized same-sex marriage in June. The Marriage Equality Act was a priority for Gov. Andrew Cuomo after winning election in November. The law was passed under a Republican-led Senate after days of delays and negotiations between the two parties. Quinn announced that a drawing will take place Monday to award a honeymoon package to one newly-married couple in each borough. The package will include two nights in a Manhattan hotel; dinners; tickets to a museum, the Empire State Buidling, a Broadway show and Cirque du Soleil; and Macy's gift certificates. However, opponents of the new law were planning to gather Sunday afternoon at rallies organized by the National Organization for Marriage in New York, Albany, Rochester and Buffalo. A handful of protesters were outside the city clerk's office in Manhattan Sunday morning. Quinn told CNN that New York is the place where the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) movement was born, and a place the world looks to. ""All eyes are upon it, and I believe it is going to help propel this movement forward faster than any of the other states have,"" Quinn said. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire also allow same-sex marriage, as does the District of Columbia.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has had the weight of the free world on his shoulders for 2½ years, and he might be starting to look like it. At 50, which he turns Thursday, his hair is a little grayer, and his face and neck are a little more creased, than on the day he took office in January 2009. You'd expect some of that -- he is older. But Obama, like his predecessors, has had plenty to do. He's waged battles over economic stimulus, health care and the debt ceiling. He's juggled wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; he committed to a campaign over Libya's skies; he chased Osama bin Laden; and he dealt with a massive oil disaster off the Gulf Coast. Obama's 50th birthday bash . It's tempting to think the office makes presidents look older than they are. The George W. Bush who left office in 2009 was not the youthful Bush before 9/11. Bill Clinton's hair was significantly whiter and his eyes baggier after eight years. Dr. Michael Roizen holds on to what he's said for a while: That presidents effectively age twice as fast while in office. Roizen, a chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic and co-founder of RealAge.com, said he based his opinion on his research of medical records of previous presidents, back to Theodore Roosevelt. Examining factors such as lifestyle habits, diet, blood pressure and physical activity, he said a person who has been president eight years has the risk of disability or dying of someone who is 16 years older. Gotta Watch: Happy Birthday, Mr. President . ""The main cause is what we call unrequited stress -- they don't have enough friends to mitigate the stress,"" Roizen, who also co-authored ""You: The Owner's Manual"" with Dr. Mehmet Oz, said Wednesday. ""The major way most of us handle stress is through a number of techniques, but the most prominent way is to discuss it with friends."" Roizen added, ""The problem with presidents is, some of them lose friends, and the closest friend they have is usually the spouse. Look at what (Obama) has been under with the debt ceiling. Even his friends spoke ill of him."" Read more on what Roizen says about presidential aging . Roizen, who also wrote ""RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?"" said he hasn't calculated Obama's ""real age,"" because of a lack of medial records. But records released in 2009 and 2010 show he effectively aged two years in one, in part because of his cholesterol values, he said. Not everyone who studies aging believes the office accelerates age appearance or risk of death. Eileen Crimmins, who holds the AARP chair at the University of Southern California's Davis School of Gerontology, said research shows leaders in control of circumstances are less negatively affected by stress than people with less control over their environment -- such as poorer people and those with low-status jobs. Crimmins said presidents certainly face tons of stress, but they're also likely to be people who thrive on it, and who have subordinates to help them manage stress. She also said presidents are high-status people who've lived generally healthy lives before they became president. ""Obama is a smoker ... and it's going to cost him. But aside from that, he's a skinny man who went to Columbia and Occidental,"" she said, arguing he benefits healthwise from his upbringing and status. And she said presidents generally exceed the life expectancy of their cohorts. Ronald Reagan made it to 93 (although with Alzheimer's). Jimmy Carter is 86. George H.W. Bush is 87. ""They're the cream of the socioeconomic crop. Generally they've had pretty good lives and already made it to a fairly old age, so they're going to live relatively long almost by definition,"" Crimmins said. Not so fast, said Dr. Michael Irwin, director of the Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. Irwin, whose center studies how the mind and body influence each other, said it's ""unequivocal that significant life stress perceived by a person does accelerate aging."" Both aging and stress produce similar stages in inflammation, the biological pathway that contributes to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers, he said. ""A person under significant stress is essentially accelerating the aging process at a biological level, and also at a genetic level,"" Irwin said. ""It's activating the genes that drive inflammation."" Research by molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn also has shown that as people age, telomeres -- areas at the end of chromosomes -- shorten, and that this shortening along with inflammation is ""highly predictive of death,"" Irwin said. ""Stress also produces accelerated shortening of telomeres,"" Irwin said. ""If we look at a middle-aged person who is not under stress, compared to a (similar) person who has been under five years of stress, we'd find an increase in inflammation and a shortening of these telomeres in the second person. Both changes are indicative of increased risk of death,"" Irwin said. And stress can induce changes in appearance such as creased faces, Irwin and Roizen said. Irwin said presidents do have advantages -- generally they're brought up in a good environment and healthy way. Presidents and everyone else can dampen the effects of stress with good lifestyle practices, strong social circles and proper sleep patterns, Irwin said. And some effects of accelerated aging -- beyond those that have changed certain physical appearances and caused permanent structural damage -- are reversible, Roizen said. ""The good news for presidents is, like everyone else, it's reversible if you change your habits,"" Roizen said. And, presumably, lessen that stress.

"(CNN) -- We've all heard that Paul Ryan is Gov. Mitt Romney's running mate. But many still don't know the details of his proposals for health care reform. They offer a stark contrast to what the Obama administration would like to do. Medicare . Medicare is a defined benefit program. That means the federal government decides each year what Medicare will cover. No matter what that costs, the government pays for most of it; individuals are responsible for the rest. Ryan's original plan, passed by the House of Representatives (but not the Senate) last year, would have changed Medicare to a defined contribution program, where the government would instead decide every year what it will pay. Under his plan, the government would give seniors that amount of money, in one form or another, to buy insurance on their own. Seniors would have had to pay for the difference between the cost of the insurance and the amount the government was willing to pay. The problem was that his original plan saved money by limiting how quickly the voucher seniors would get to buy health care would grow. This meant that by 2030, seniors would have been responsible for 68% of the cost of their insurance, likely too much for most to afford. At the end of 2011, though, Ryan made significant alterations to his proposal. With Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, he produced a plan that more closely resembles Romney's (although he changed things again in his 2013 budget, which Wyden does not support). Instead of tying the amount of the voucher to an arbitrary increase in the future, it would be tied, in his 2011 proposal, to how much insurance costs. Each year, companies will submit bids for how much it will cost to provide insurance for a senior that year. The voucher would then be set at the price of the second-lowest bid. In other words, seniors could get the second-cheapest plan for very little. If they chose the cheapest plan, they would actually get a rebate. If they want anything more expensive, they would have to pay for the difference. Moreover, traditional Medicare will be one of the choices. If it is the second cheapest, not much will change. If, however, it is more expensive, then seniors would have to pay for the difference, but in this way they will have the option to keep their Medicare. There are potential concerns, however. The first is that the proposal requires that the plans be ""actuarially equivalent,"" but not that they provide the same coverage benefits. This means that plans can tweak benefits they offer to try to preferentially attract healthy customers. The second issue is that this plan won't save near the money that Ryan's first attempt did. If this plan had been implemented in 2009, it would have saved the federal government 9% that year. But that would have been a one-time savings, and it wouldn't bend the cost curve much at all. Moreover, seniors would have had to pay about $64 a month for their traditional Medicare, which is a significant amount for many of them. A third concern, voiced by many who oppose the Ryan plan, is that the details are insufficient to assume that traditional Medicare will be preserved. There may be a good reason for this: If the Affordable Care Act is too radical for many wishing to pass this proposal into law, it's hard to imagine they'll be in a position to defend something far more specific and comprehensive. Most significantly, though, this whole plan rests on the same rationale as Medicare Advantage did (it lets Medicare beneficiaries get their coverage through private insurance companies) when President George W. Bush first proposed it. That didn't clearly work. Many private plans were unable to come in under traditional Medicare, and only in certain markets in the country. Medicaid . With respect to Medicaid, Ryan (and Romney) would like to get the federal government far less involved. They want to convert the current program, where benefits are set at the federal level, and costs are shared between the federal and state governments, to one in which states are given far more flexibility to set benefits, and a block grant payment with which to pay for them. Some states like this plan, because it will allow them to alter benefits and coverage locally so they will be on the hook for less money in the future. Even though the federal government covers somewhere between 50% and 75% of Medicaid costs right now, the remaining spending is still a significant drain on state budgets. Unfortunately, savings to the federal government would come from drastically cutting the amount of money they will give states in the future. The only way states would be able to provide insurance to Medicaid recipients on way less money would be if they reduced the benefits or the number of beneficiaries. If benefits aren't cut, and already low provider reimbursements aren't further reduced, then by 2021 about 19 million people, or one-third of all people on Medicaid, will need to be dropped from coverage. Many of those covered by Medicaid are very poor elderly people, or those who are blind or disabled. If states acted to preferentially protect those groups from cuts, then 27 million other people, many of them children and pregnant women, would be dropped from Medicaid. Although it will likely get far less media attention, the changes to Medicaid may be far more radical. Medicaid is already one of the cheapest forms of insurance around. There isn't that much fat to be trimmed, regardless of how much states might ""innovate."" Although the focus of much of the election will be on Medicare, these proposed changes to Medicaid are far more severe, and will have far more immediate repercussions. The choice . The Obama administration would like to reduce future health care spending by a number of means, including Accountable Care Organizations, the Independent Advisory Board and other programs that focus on providers and hospitals to save money (discussed on CNN.com here). They believe, in general, that relying on experts and leaning on providers can bend the cost curve. The problem is that some see this as rationing. Ryan and Romney, on the other hand, believe that individuals should be the lever by which spending is reduced. They propose to decrease the amount the federal government pays for care by increasing the amount individuals pay and giving them more choices. They further believe that this will drive individuals to demand lower prices. With respect to Medicare, the problem is that the amount seniors will be required to pay may be too much for many. Moreover, there is little evidence that prices will drop (they didn't for Medicare Advantage), and this could result in some seniors forgoing necessary care, which will have negative health consequences. Ironically, for all the talk about the concerns over the deficit, their plan also may not reduce Medicare spending as much as the Affordable Care Act does in the next decade. In a rational world, we'd try all these things. A bipartisan plan could come from Republicans accepting the Affordable Care Act as it stands for all those younger than 65, without further talk of repeal, in exchange for implementing the Ryan-Wyden plan for those 65 and older. After all, that proposal isn't really much different than the way the exchanges will work in the Affordable Care Act, with the exception that there is a public option (which should be opened to everyone under 65 as well). Everyone gets something they want, with all the tools available being brought to bear on containing future costs. This would require compromise, though, something that is in short supply in election years. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- A former University of Virginia lacrosse player convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend was sentenced to 23 years in prison on Thursday, according to the Commonwealth Attorney's office in Charlottesville, Virginia. In February, a Charlottesville jury found George Huguely, 24, guilty of second-degree murder and grand larceny in the May 2010 death of Yeardley Love. Circuit Court Judge Edward Hogshire sentenced Huguely to 23 years for murder and to one year, concurrent with that sentence, for the larceny charge. He also sentenced Huguely to three years of supervised release. The judge's decision was slightly less than the recommendation of the jury, which had suggested the defendant be sentenced to 26 years in prison. Virginia does not have parole. Huguely may earn time for good behavior during his incarceration, but the maximum credit he can receive is 15%. In other words, he must serve at least 85% of his sentence, or roughly 19Â½ years. ""We love George and will always support him,"" Huguely's family said in a statement soon after sentencing. ""We hope and pray that the passage of time will bring some semblance of peace and healing to each and everyone who has been affected by this tragedy, most especially the Love family."" The case captured national attention and highlighted the volatile relationship of star athletes Huguely and Love, 22. Both played lacrosse for the university's nationally ranked teams. The jury did not agree with the prosecution that Huguely was guilty of first-degree murder, and it acquitted him on several other charges, including robbery, and breaking and entering to commit larceny. Huguely has never denied he was in Love's apartment nor that they had a fight. At the center of the case were dueling portraits of Huguely, who prosecutors contend killed Love in a jealous rage. The defense argued the death was accidental. Prosecutors claimed Huguely followed through with a threat to kill Love after accusing her of having a liaison with a lacrosse player from a competing university. ""I should have killed you,"" he wrote in an e-mail to Love, which was read during the trial. The defense argued that Huguely contributed to her death but had no intention of killing her. During the trial, Huguely attorney Francis Lawrence described his client as ""stupid, drunk -- but not calculating."" Police were initially called to Love's Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported a possible alcohol overdose, authorities said at the time. A medical examiner found Love died of blunt force trauma to the head. The prosecution told jurors that Love's death was slow and painful, claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. Inside an emotionally charged courtroom, Huguely hung his head and appeared to cry during the sentencing phase that followed the jury's verdict. ""George's decision and judgment were clouded by drinking, immaturity,"" attorney Rhonda Quagliana told the jurors. ""It's not an excuse. It's not a justification. It's just a fact ... (at the time) George is a 22-year-old immersed in sex and alcohol."" In Session's Jessica Thill, Michael Christian, Jean Casarez and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","A judge also sentences George Huguely to three years' probation .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Michael Jackson tribute belt blocked from sale three years ago by the singer's estate is now cleared for sale after an out-of-court settlement. The belt dispute was one of several between Michael Jackson's estate and members of his family that erupted in the year after the pop icon's death. The agreement suggests that nearly four years after his death there is a calmer relationship between them. Trial begins in wrongful death lawsuit . The trustees of Jackson's estate issued a cease and desist letter when the crystal-encrusted belts initially went on sale in May 2010, saying they had not approved a contract between Katherine Jackson and the marketers. Michael Jackson's mother is no longer involved as a partner with B.B. Simon, the California company that makes the belts, under the deal reached with the estate clearing way for the sales, according to the company. The spokesman for the estate declined to comment on the belt agreement. Conrad Murray gives jailhouse interviews . Jackson's mother and her grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are the chief beneficiaries of the Michael Jackson estate. Charities yet to be chosen will also get 20% of the estate's profits, according to the will signed by Jackson. A limited run of 7,000 leather belts, designed by Simon Tavassoli, are handmade at his Newport Beach, California, studio. They went on sale again this week through the designer's website for $1,600.

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal civil rights lawyers filed suit Wednesday against Meridian, Mississippi, and other defendants for operating what the government calls a school-to-prison pipeline in which students are denied basic constitutional rights, sent to court and incarcerated for minor school infractions. The lawsuit says children who talk back to teachers, violate dress codes and commit other minor infractions are handcuffed and sent to a youth court where they are denied their rights. It's the first time a jurisdiction has been charged under a law designed to protect the due process rights of juveniles in such circumstances. 2010: Feds accuse Miss. county of rights violations . Also among the defendants were Lauderdale County, judges of the county's Youth Court and the State of Mississippi Division of Youth Services. About 6,000 mostly African-American students attend grades kindergarten through 12 in a dozen schools in the Lauderdale County School District. About 86% of the district's students are African-American, but all of those referred to the court for violations were minorities, the government suit said. The federal action came more than two months after the Justice Department warned local and state officials that they had 60 days to cooperate or face a federal lawsuit. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roy Austin said Wednesday that Mississippi officials had failed to cooperate with the eight-month investigation. ""We had no choice but to file suit,"" Austin said, giving examples of what he alleged are unconstitutional actions taken by the school district and court: . • Children are handcuffed and arrested in school and incarcerated for days at a time without a probable cause hearing. • Children detained wait more than 48 hours for a hearing, in violation of constitution requirements. • Children make admissions to formal charges without being advised of their Miranda rights. • Children are not routinely granted legal representation during the juvenile justice process. Austin said Wednesday that Meridian is not the only location in the country with such a system. However, he said, it is the only one to date where local authorities have not been fully cooperative with federal investigators. He pointed to Shelby County, Tennessee, as a school system where complaints had been received but where local officials had been fully cooperative with the Justice Department. Mississippi officials did not have an immediate response to the lawsuit.","Federal civil rights lawyers sue Meridian, Lauderdale County, agencies .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The wife of kidnapped security expert Felix Batista broke her month-long silence on Wednesday and pleaded with his Mexican abductors to ""please have mercy."" Lourdes Batista, wife of abducted security expert Felix Batista, talks to reporters in Miami, Florida. ""Please let him go. Let him return to his family,"" wife Lourdes Batista said at a news conference in Miami, Florida. ""He has never done anyone any harm,"" she pleaded. ""On the contrary, he has always extended a hand to those in need. I beg you with all the strength in my heart."" Batista, 55, disappeared December 10 from a restaurant in Mexico, a case that made international headlines because of its irony. The anti-kidnapping expert had been kidnapped, authorities said. The Batistas have been married 31 years, his family said. They have five children. Two of them attended the news conference but did not speak.  Watch Lourdes Batista plead for the release of her husband » . Batista's family has not heard from him or his kidnappers. There have been no demands for ransom, no contact at all. ""Words do not describe the pain that we are going through by not knowing where he is or what has happened to him,"" said his sister, Jackie Batista. He descibed the family's distress as a ""pain you do not bestow upon anyone not even our worst enemies."" ""I ask that you at least let us know what has happened to our beloved Felix,"" she implored.  Watch more from the news conference » . An internationally known American security consultant, Batista has negotiated the release of kidnapping victims throughout Latin America. ""He's always been a professional at what he does,"" his sister said. He arrived December 6 in Saltillo, Mexico, about 250 miles south of the U.S. border, to take part in a security seminar about kidnappings. The FBI has been working with Mexican law enforcement to determine what happened and to bring Batista home safely. The U.S. embassy in Mexico has not returned CNN's calls, nor has Mexico's Ministry of the Interior. The Batista family, however, is talking. ""We just want to get some news and would like to make a public plea, and in return, we hope to get some answers,"" Jackie Batista told CNN on Tuesday. Felix Batista was in a restaurant with several other people when he received a phone call, according to a written statement released by the state attorney general's office in Saltillo. After speaking on the telephone, he told his colleagues that several people in a white pickup were going to give him a message, said the statement. He got into a vehicle which did not match the description he had given his colleagues. Since then, no one has had any communication with him. The statement said there was no sign of violence at the scene. ""I don't understand how a man who has always loved Mexico and its people so much, so dearly, can be made to suffer is this manner,"" Batista's wife said at the news conference. ""My heart is broken. My children need their father. Please, I implore those of you that have feelings please let him go."" ""The fact that he was purposely picked up and they haven't reached out to family is certainly worrisome,"" said Gary Noesner, former chief of the FBI crisis negotiation unit, who now works as a security and kidnapping consultant. ""Typically, you would get contact sooner, but sometimes kidnappers wait a period of time. They use that as a pressure tactic,"" Noesner added. ""I would have thought they would have had contact by now."" He added, ""The family wants to be contacted. There is a bit of a good news story if they are contacted, because that opens up a dialogue, and that is a recipe for a resolution."" Mexico has seen an alarming rise in kidnappings and violence. Organized crime and drug related killings more than doubled from 2007 to 2008. President Felipe Calderon met over the summer with the country's 32 governors to unveil a plan to combat the increase in kidnappings. The plan includes building special prisons for kidnappers, and a constitutional amendment to reinstate the death penalty for kidnappers who kill their captives has been sent to Mexico's legislature. Experts believe that people in Mexico who have relatives in the United States are specifically being targeted because it's assumed they have money. ""What kidnappers basically do is look at who has money that we can get,"" Noesner said. ""They will go after anyone who they perceive will provide a payoff."" Batista worked as a retained consultant for ASI Global LLC, a global kidnap and ransom response company, for 18 months. ""He is an extremely gifted and talented consultant and has worked in the region for many, many years,"" company President Charlie LeBlanc said. Since Batista's kidnapping, the company has had representatives with the Batista family to help them through the crisis, he said. ""The fact that we have not had contact is not necessarily a bad sign. We've had cases in the past that have gone much longer without contact,"" he said. But almost a month has passed since Batista's disappearance,  and that is not a good sign, the experts cautioned. ""It becomes more problematic when there's not contact from the bad guys. You're very limited as to what you can do,""  Noesner said. ""Its far too early to say, 'This is typical,' but I'd be concerned,"" he added. Perhaps the Batista family can find some solace in the words of Felix Batista himself. In an interview with TV Azteca, a CNN affiliate based in Mexico City, he offered some advice to the families and loved ones of a kidnapping victims. ""Stay calm and ask [the kidnappers] for time. Time to do two things: to look for the missing person if possible and confirm that it is in fact a kidnapping.""","Felix Batista last seen in Saltillo, Mexico, on December 10 .

"(CNN) -- The plot may have been years in the making, but the killer gave just minutes' notice before he rained terror across a Southern California community. Now, shattered glass and flowers mark the path of horror created by a young man bent on getting his revenge for perceived slights and chronic problems with women. Six victims and the assailant are dead, and 13 people were wounded, authorities said. Three of the wounded are still being treated at at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, spokeswoman Maria Zate told CNN on Monday. Two are in good condition and one is in fair condition. In the three days since the rampage, a slew of new information has emerged about the victims, the suspect and what led up to the stabbings and shootings. Here's what we know: . The rampage started with his roommates . Authorities now know Elliot Rodger's killing spree across Isla Vista began before he even left home. The 22-year-old former Santa Barbara City College student fatally stabbed three young men in his own apartment -- George Chen, 19, Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, and Weihan Wang, 20. Chen and Hong were the attacker's roommates. A friend of Rodger's family said Rodger recently had a feud with his roommates, complaining to his landlord that his roommates were too noisy and played lots of video games. The assailant himself outlined his plan to kill two roommates in a 137-page manifesto he left behind. ""I'd even enjoy stabbing them both to death while they slept,"" Rodger wrote. Inside the gunman's head: Rejection, jealousy and a vow to kill 'beautiful girls' The assailant had been seeing therapists . Rodger's history of mental health issues was no secret to his family, and the young man was seeing at least two therapists prior to his death. He had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, family friend Simon Astaire said. When he went to high school in Van Nuys, California, he met with a therapist ""pretty much every day,"" Astaire said. Rodger's family contacted police after discovering social media posts about suicide and killing people, family spokesman and attorney Alan Shifman told reporters Saturday. Six policemen showed up at Rodger's home in Isla Vista on April 30, but they found nothing alarming. So they told Rodger to call his mother and they reassured her that he was OK, according to Astaire. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters Saturday that at the time, deputies ""determined he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold."" Brown said Rodger told deputies it was a misunderstanding and that he was not going to hurt anyone or himself. Rodger said he was having troubles with his social life. But long before that, Rodger was plotting his deadly ""Day of Retribution."" ""I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,"" Rodger wrote about the police visit, toward the end of his manifesto. ""If that was the case, the police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. ""I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that."" Five revelations from the 'twisted world' of a 'kissless virgin' He sent his manifesto to two dozen people . Perhaps some of the most obvious clues as to why the rampage took place come from Rodger's manifesto, which chronicles his life from birth all the way to his planned ""Day of Retribution."" In ""My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger,"" the writer said he bought his first handgun in 2012 in preparation for a possible ""Day of Retribution."" On Friday, minutes before he shot three young women in front of a sorority house and killed a young man at a nearby deli, Rodger e-mailed his writings to two dozen people, including his parents and at least one of his therapists. ""My orchestration of the Day of Retribution is my attempt to do everything, in my power, to destroy everything I cannot have,"" Rodger wrote. ""All of those beautiful girls I've desired so much in my life, but can never have because they despise and loathe me, I will destroy. All of those popular people who live hedonistic lives of pleasure, I will destroy, because they never accepted me as one of them. I will kill them all and make them suffer, just as they have made me suffer. It is only fair."" One of the people he mentioned by name in the manifesto is Lucky Radley, a childhood friend, who he said became ""an object of my extreme jealousy and hatred."" ""When I saw that, I was shocked,"" Radley told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""I literally didn't believe that was coming from him."" Radley said Rodger was an abnormally quiet boy who barely spoke, even when Radley went to Rodger's house a couple of times to play. He hadn't seen Rodger since high school. Seeing Rodger's video now, Radley told CNN, ""That's the first time me hearing him say more than a one-word answer."" Rodger's mother, Lichin, saw the e-mailed manifesto at 9:17 p.m. Friday. She went to Rodger's YouTube page and saw a disturbing video in which her son talked about ""slaughtering"" women at a sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Astaire said. His mother called 911 and Rodger's father, and the parents left Los Angeles, headed for Santa Barbara, the family friend said. En route, they heard there was a shooting. Later that night, they found out their son was the gunman. Killer's parents frantically searched for son . All the deceased victims were UCSB students . Chen, Hong and Wang, the three men fatally stabbed in Rodger's apartment, were students at the University of California, Santa Barbara -- as were the three other victims who didn't survive. UCSB canceled classes until Wednesday and declared Tuesday to be a day of mourning, with a memorial service set for Tuesday afternoon. Counselors are available on campus for anyone needing support, the university said. The two young women fatally shot outside the Alpha Phi sorority house -- Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19 -- were members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority at UCSB. ""Katie will be remembered for her generous spirit and warm heart. Veronika will be remembered for her vibrant personality and enthusiasm for life,"" Delta Delta Delta President Phyllis Durbin Grissom wrote. The sixth victim killed was Christopher Martinez, who was getting a sandwich at a deli when he was shot. The 20-year-old UCSB student was known for his selflessness. ""Chris was just an amazing guy,"" Jeff Dolphin, Martinez's freshman-year roommate, told the Los Angeles Times. ""If I was going through something, he was always there for me. If I needed something, he was there. If I needed a textbook, if I was locked out of the room because I forgot my key, he would stop playing basketball or doing what he was doing to unlock the door so I didn't have to get charged. He was just a great guy."" Martinez's father, Richard Martinez, lambasted politicians and the National Rifle Association after his son's death. He told CNN's Kyung Lah that nothing has changed since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012, when 20 children and six adults were killed. ""Have we learned nothing? These will continue until somebody does something. Where the hell is the leadership?"" Richard Martinez asked. ""He's our only child. And he died on Friday. I'm 61 years old now. I'll never have another child. He's gone."" Father of shooting victim chastises politicians, demands new gun laws . The community is trying to move forward . While some try to understand why the tragedy happened, others say it's a lost cause. ""I don't need an explanation. It's, unfortunately, a very sad situation that no explanation can ever justify,"" said Ryan Booth, manager of the I.V. Deli Mart, where Martinez died. He said he refuses to read the killer's manifesto or watch his YouTube video, ""Retribution."" ""As a community we have to be strong and stand up and try and move on."" Who's the man behind the rampage . CNN's Todd Leopold, Chelsea J. Carter, Ashley Fantz, Joe Sutton and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","NEW: Three of the injured are still at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital .

"(CNN) -- While many changes to Americans' health care outlined in the the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act don't take effect until 2014, a Supreme Court ruling expected this month could stop those changes from coming at all. The act, often referred to as ""Obamacare,"" is a step toward guaranteeing insurance coverage for all Americans and received enough support to pass in Congress in 2010. However, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments on several of its core issues in March. The court may rule on the issues by the end of this month. Basics: Health care reform issues . No matter the ruling, most Americans will be affected. Here are some of the issues being discussed right now: . Business owners . One hundred and sixty million Americans receive health care from their employers, many of whom set their own rates for their employees. If the court rules against the act, employees might face higher premiums, fewer network providers, higher-deductible plans and more stringent regulations on adding adult dependents. What is Corporate America's Plan B to safeguard employees and industry if the act is struck down? Here are some insights: . Employers' 'plan B' if health reform is axed . Employers bear brunt of health insurance hikes . Small business owners . If you run your own company, the act has a lot of good in store for you -- that is, if you know how to access it. Many small business owners across the country who do offer health coverage haven't taken advantage of, or didn't even know about, a tax credit that helps offset giving employees insurance. Why wouldn't small business owners take advantage of this? CNNMoney answers that question and talks about what might happen if only parts of the act are kept: . The health care tax credit few are taking . What's at stake for small businesses . National spending . Being insured helps safeguard against pricey medical bills. However, a report released Tuesday from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services suggests that the act won't limit national health spending. In fact, it predicts that spending will skyrocket after a brief recession-induced dip. Growth in health spending doesn't necessarily correlate with growth in health care costs, but what does it mean? Here's a projection: . Health spending growth to stay low, then jump . America's youth . For today's young adults, health care comes last. If you can't afford to feed and clothe yourself, why budget for something that hasn't happened yet? However, youth get sick too, and their future bank accounts might take a toll if the act is repealed -- or if they don't insure themselves, period. Additionally, the ones who do insure themselves tend to forgo expenditures elsewhere (like graduate school) to make ends meet. Young adults skip health care as medical debts rise . For 20-somethings, health care hangs in the balance . Senior citizens . Health reform has been the belle of the senior citizen community, saving Medicare beneficiaries a collective $3.7 billion dollars on their medication costs since its inception in 2010. One of the reform's aims is to close the ""donut hole,"" or portion of senior citizens that can't pay for medication out of pocket, by 2020. Read how Medicare has been affected by health care reform: . Medicare: Seniors saved $3.7 billion on medicine . Doctors at risk . Increases in insurance coverage and changes in Medicare help patients avoid footing hefty medical bills, but sometimes their doctors pay the price. Read why some doctors, especially those in private practice, are running out of money: . Doctors going broke . Doctors: We could go out of business . Silver linings . Just because a negative ruling would give health insurers and states the ability to opt out of reform-era options doesn't mean they're going to. UnitedHealthcare, the nation's largest health insurer, said that while it will take cues from competitors, it will maintain some of the act's key mandates regardless of the court's decision. Moreover, there is strong bipartisan support for state-created health care exchange programs, many of which have been set into motion, where those seeking insurance can look for subsidized coverage. UnitedHealthcare to keep some health care mandates . Exchanges could survive even if health reform law dies . The fine print .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Ryo Desmidt is in his first year at a kindergarten in Hong Kong and seems like an especially gifted child. That's because his parents say he can communicate in three languages. He is three years old. Since he was ten months old, his mother, Momoe, has been taking him to a language center five times a week where he is taught to listen, speak and interact in English, Mandarin and Japanese. He attends a language school in the city that offers courses for children as young as a few months old. Some parents will even pay a tutor to speak in a particular language for an hour in the belief their baby will absorb this. This is just one of the many examples of how parents in Hong Kong are trying to get ahead of the game by giving their children a competitive edge in the race for limited school places. With a large expatriate community and an increase in mainland Chinese parents wishing to send their kids across the border to school, Hong Kong's world class educational system is under siege with applications. And this pressure is being felt by parents, many of whom are starting early and going to extraordinary lengths to outshine thousands of other applicants for limited pre-school opportunities, believing it will give them an advantage when it comes to securing a primary school place. Queuing for places . At this time of the year, parents go into a frenzy queuing for application forms at schools across Hong Kong. In the city's northern district, which borders China, Hong Kong and mainland parents have even camped out overnight to get their hands on the right admission forms. According to Fung Kai Kindergarten in the city's Sheung Shui district, around 2,000 people queued up to apply for only 240 available spaces on October 7 -- police were even called in to deal with complaints about people cutting the queue. There has also been growing animosity towards mainland parents, with local people arguing children living in Hong Kong should be given priority over places. Cross-border students, or children living in China who have gained the right of abode and free education in Hong Kong by birth, often travel up to five hours to go to school. Currently, the Education Bureau (EDB) in Hong Kong estimates the number of cross-border students to be 17,000, with around half that number enrolled in kindergarten or day care centers. Early planning . In Hong Kong, where formal pre-school education begins at the age of three, many prospective parents begin mapping out education plans before their children are born. Desmidt, an expat mother living in Hong Kong, revealed she started looking for potential kindergartens and playgroups during her pregnancy. ""In Hong Kong, if you don't get into a good pre-nursery or kindergarten, it's really difficult to get into a good primary school, that's why you already have to have a plan when you are pregnant."" After attending numerous information sessions and preschool open days, she applied to a playgroup when she was eight months pregnant because the waiting list was already around a year. Another mother, who preferred not to be named, said parents scour online education forums to identify the top popular school choices. ""It's the only topic that comes up when you go out for lunch, which school your kid got into, which school are you applying for and how are you preparing your child for it?"" she said. ""My friends have sent me spreadsheets with a detailed timetable of when schools are available for applications and how to apply."" Pressure to perform . The stress doesn't end there for parents. Some have even signed up their children for mock interview training so they would be able to perform well during kindergarten interviews. ""Some playgroup teachers who are familiar with the interview process in certain famous kindergartens, will help train the child to overcome shyness and get used to answering questions from strangers,"" explained the unnamed mother. She recalled one of the interviews she took her son to, when he was only 18 months old. ""They (the children) were in a room with six to seven other kids with the parents sitting behind them. The teacher would ask them to point to an object in the picture or ask what color it is. Some kids didn't respond, or started crying and they would just have to move on to the next kid,"" she said. ""The whole thing lasted for seven minutes. I don't know what criteria they base their admissions on, but it's hard to figure out a kid at one and a half years old."" This comes as no surprise to Nicola Weir, Principal of the Early Childhood Education Section at Yew Chung International School. ""We've received CVs of little babies and portfolios listing their many talents,"" she said. ""Parents are proud of their children, and they want the best for them."" While parents see interviews as a make or break moment for their children, Weir says there is no need for parents to panic. ""Many of the schools are competitive, but it's not about how perfect their child is, all children are special,"" she said. ""We also look at families to see if they're congruent with our philosophy. It's not how well they can perform, but the relationship between home and school is really important too,"" she added. Finding the best fit . Even after parents manage to successfully enroll their child in a kindergarten, the unnamed mother adds that they are constantly on the lookout for better schools. ""Parents in Hong Kong have the dilemma in choosing between local and international schools. I have friends who send their kids to a local kindergarten in the morning, and then an international kindergarten in the afternoon. So they'll nap or eat lunch in the car. They think both systems are flawed, but they want to get the best of both worlds."" Meanwhile, Desmidt's son, Ryo, takes a nap after attending school in the morning and the Le Beaumont Language Center afterwards. ""I'm half Japanese and half Chinese, and my husband is half British and half French. We wanted him to speak all the languages and it's convenient because it's all in one center,"" she said. ""We've stayed in the language center for more than two years, and for him it's for fun. I asked him this week if he wanted to go to Disneyland or the language center and he said 'I want to go see this teacher and that teacher.' He really enjoys it,"" she added.","Parents compete for limited spots in kindergartens in Hong Kong .
In October, some 2,000 parents queued to apply for 240 spaces in a one kindergarten .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Question: Why use chemical weapons? Answer: Because you want to get the job done fast. Nerve agents and other battlefield chemicals are an area weapon. Be it town or trench where your enemy is hiding, your deadly gas will find them. From the waterlogged northern European plains of World War I to the arid mountains and marshes of the Iran-Iraq conflict, chemical weapons have been used when armies get bogged down and commanders get frustrated. When the urge to win outweighs warfare's cold calculus of routine slaughter and indignity, the danger is a slide into the depravity of craven criminality. Adolf Hitler used them in his extermination camps, diabolical in his annihilation of his enemies. So when I heard from two separate sources close to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's thinking that he planned to retake the country's largest city Aleppo in a ""swift battle of high causalities"" so he could go to peace talks in Geneva with ""facts on the ground"" in his favor, the use of chemicals in Damascus' suburbs against resurgent rebels made sense. As told to me, the Syrian army hoped by mid-August to have control of Homs, and by early-September to be wrapping up victory in war-ravaged Aleppo. In late-July, following June's strategic victory in Qusayr of cutting rebel supply lines, Assad's ambitions to get the country back in his control were on the rise. But two things happened, rebels attacked Alawite stronghold Latakia on the coast, temporarily distracting regime forces. The Latakia thrust was soon repulsed but not without shaking Assad's new found confidence. Second and more worryingly for him, rebels in the capital, loosely termed the ""Damascus Brigade"" by one regional source involved in supplying them with weapons and honing their fighting skills, were becoming a serious irritant. For over a year loose-knit bands of rebel fighters have nipped at the regime's Achilles heel, Damascus, with little strategic effect. Always a pressure point on the regime's military resources, the capital has the potential to distract the leadership. By mid-August, better-trained and better-equipped rebels were threatening to throw the regime off its agenda and stall strikes on Aleppo. A quandary for Assad, what should he do? The heat was no doubt turned up on his Damascus commanders: get results to free assets for the north. Into that walked the U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. The rest seems to be history.","Sources close to Assad say he planned to take Aleppo in ""swift battle of high causalities""

"London (CNN) -- In a crime that will shock the green-fingered, a thief has made off with the tiny water lily Nymphaea thermarum -- one of the rarest plants in the world -- from a botanical gardens in London. The plant, of which only a handful of specimens still exist in the wild, was stolen from a lily pond at the famed Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, police said. The thief is thought to have dug or pulled it from the damp, temperature-controlled mud it needs to survive. Kew Gardens is one of only two places in the world to cultivate this plant, and there were only 30 plants on display, London's Metropolitan Police said. They cite its value as ""priceless"" because of its rarity. The stolen plant may have been easier to sneak out of the botanic garden, which has its own security, because of its small size. The plant's bright green lily pads can measure as little as 1 centimeter (less than half an inch) across, and its white flower with yellow stamen is barely bigger than a fingernail. Fragile habitat . The Nymphaea thermarum was discovered in 1987 by German botanist Eberhard Fischer at a thermal freshwater spring in Mashyuza, Rwanda -- the only known location in the wild. However, over-exploitation of this hot spring meant the fragile habitat dried up, and the water lily died out there in about 2008. It was brought back from the brink of extinction only by the efforts of experts at Bonn Botanic Garden in Germany, where a number of living examples had been taken, and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, which succeeded in propagating the delicate plant in 2009. After a number of failed attempts, horticulturist Carlos Magdalena at Kew cracked the technique needed to persuade the water lily to grow from the remaining precious seeds. He realized that unlike all other water lilies, the Nymphaea thermarum grows in warm mud rather than water, and so found a way to replicate its native habitat using pots of damp loam surrounded by water kept at precisely 25 degrees Celsius (77 F) -- just as had occurred by the thermal spring. Only then did the seedlings flourish and develop into adult plants, according to Kew. For a couple of years, the only living examples of the water lily were found in Bonn and London. Now, a few plants are again found in the wild in Rwanda, according to Kew Gardens, but the Nymphaea thermarum remains critically endangered. Theft taken 'very seriously' Richard Barley, director of horticulture at Kew Gardens, said the police had been called in after the theft was discovered Thursday. The staff is ""dedicated to the conservation of plants, and when incidents of this nature occur it is a blow to morale,"" he said. ""We take theft of our invaluable scientific collection of plants very seriously."" According to the Kew Gardens' website, the plant has no common name because of its scarcity but has become known unofficially by its staff as the ""pygmy Rwandan water lily."" It ""has always been so rare that no uses have ever been known,"" it adds. Other instances of theft have occurred, but they are isolated and infrequent, Kew Gardens said.

"Seoul (CNN) -- What could bring together the biggest names in the Korean pop industry? A visit by the Pope will do it. As Pope Francis tours South Korea through August 18, some 20 Korean household names got together to record a video for a song titled ""Koinonia,"" which means camaraderie and communion in Greek. It was composed by K-pop veteran Noh Young-shim to celebrate the first papal visit to Korea in 25 years. Some 5.4 million Koreans are Catholics -- roughly 10% of the population -- and amongst them are pop stars and actors. Figure skating star Kim Yuna is also a follower of the faith and one of the celebs expected to appear at official functions during the Pope's visit. During a recent TV appearance, she had appealed to the Pope to bless Korea and ""provide messages of hope."" Unfortunately for fans, she does not appear in the new music video. Video worship . Despite involving some serious pop star power, the video for ""Koinonia"" is devoid of the typical trappings of a K-pop music video. There's no tightly choreographed dancing or thematic costumes. Instead, director Cha Eun-taek has the famous faces hidden behind sheet music, huddled together like a devout church choir. It's a far cry from Cha's previous work, such as the ""Hangover"" video starring Psy and Snoop Dogg. ""When I called everyone they were extremely happy to be part of the music video, and those who could not make it were extremely regretful,"" said veteran actor Ahn Sung-ki, who helped organize the project. Ahn has been at the forefront of several cultural projects that support religious causes, such as narrating a biopic about the life of Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou-hwan, the country's first Catholic cardinal and a much respected figure amongst religious and secular groups. Devoted diva . The number of Catholics in Korea continues to grow, with roughly 100,000 baptisms per year. The baptism du jour is that of pop star Rain (aka. Jung Ji-hoon) in July. Local media widely reported that his actress girlfriend Kim Tae-hee inspired the conversion, and the celebrity rumor mill spelled an impending marriage. Rain's agency Cube Entertainment has rejected the claim: ""Rain has indeed been baptized, but this is something he has been meaning to do for some time now. It would be rash to make assumptions about engagement plans."" Rain's girlfriend Kim, who rose to international stardom through TV soaps such as Iris, is outspoken on religious beliefs. She had espoused premarital chastity through press interviews early on in her career and continues to make statements on religion through the media. Korean celebrities are far from shy when it comes to expressing their faith, and actors and singers frequently pay religious tributes while making award acceptance speeches onstage. Pop singers including Lee Chang-min of 2AM, Taemin of SHINee and YeSung of Super Junior have been open about being Catholic, as have popular actors Jung Il-woo, Lee Joon-gi and Kim Rae-won. ""Korean celebrities convey their religiosity much more openly than their political views. They have been more outspoken and proactive since the 1980s as religion became increasingly secularized here,"" said culture critic Kim Bongseok. Strong resonation . Protestant Christian celebrities have often been more vocal than their Catholic counterparts, and many are part of well-known church gatherings. HaMiMo is a church group of young screen actresses including Han Hye-jin and Eom Ji-won, while Moonmien includes members of K-pop group such as Girls' Generation, Super Junior and 2NE1 as well as actor Kim Soo-hyun. ""These groups are not only for Bible studies and prayer, but also for carrying out volunteer work and networking. It's difficult for celebrities to socialize even if they are in show business together, and mutual religious views often become a strong basis for building friendship or even romance,"" said an industry insider who asked to remain anonymous. Sooyoung of Girls' Generation has been reported to have met her actor boyfriend Jung Kyung-ho through Moonmien. Meanwhile, celebrities are posting welcome messages for Pope Francis on social media networks. ""I hear this is the Pope's first visit to Korea in 25 years, and I wish he could instill hope in youths across Korea and beyond,"" tweeted RyeoWook of Super Junior. His fellow band member, KangIn, also tweeted: ""I would like to welcome Pope Francis' arrival on Aug. 14. I pray you can safely wrap up the four-night, five-day trip and that you can inspire youths across the world with visionary messages."" ""Pope Francis is particularly respected for making socially meaningful statements, which are resonating strongly among even non-Catholic Koreans. This is largely due to the prevailing sense of anxiousness and mistrust here following recent traumatic events,"" culture critic Kim said, referring to a ferry sinking earlier this year that left hundreds dead.","About 10% of the South Korean population is Catholic, including some of the country's most famous pop stars .

"(CNN) -- Before releasing an album most bands would talk about record sales or concert dates. But for Egyptian band Cairokee the bigger talking point is whether they will get arrested. ""Only Amir because he writes the lyrics,"" the band's bassist Adam El-Alfy jokes, tapping the shoulder of his friend, the band's lead singer Amir Eid. In a country currently polarized by politics the band are concerned some of the songs featured on ""El Sekka Shemal"" (""Wrong Turn"") could make them targets for the authorities. In another of the group's songs entitled ""Nefsy Afagar"" (""I Want To Explode"") Eid sings: ""A new order, just like the old one. And everything works with lying. I want to blow up the streets and roads."" According to the band the song reflects the daily frustration faced by Egyptians, such as stifling traffic, drug use and sexual harassment. ""We have many fans that will get very angry if we didn't release these songs,"" says Eid, who claims the band speaks the mind of many Egyptians. In doing so they realize they could face censorship and defamation campaigns, similar to those faced by television satirist Bassem Youssef who had his show cancelled last September after mocking supporters of Egypt's military. He is now on air again with a different network. Cairokee performed three songs on the first of his new shows. Sitting at the makeshift studio within Eid's family apartment in which the band recorded most of their songs for the past 10 years, they insist they are not political. ""We talk about freedom, social rights, what we think will make a better place for all of us,"" says guitarist Sherif El-Hawary. ""A lot of people kind of mix that, that we have a political agenda. We don't really."" After years of little success or recognition they rose to prominence through their participation in ""Sout El-Horreya"" (""The Sound of Freedom""), a song recorded during the Tahrir Square sit-in in 2011. For the three years that followed they released other songs that also became anthems to Egypt's revolution, urging Egyptians to ""hold their ground"" in ""Ethbat Makanak"" and in another yearning for ""The Square."" Their concerts included free performances at political sit-ins. ""The revolution is not politics. Dignity is not politics. This is what we sing about. We didn't sing about politics, but we sing about basic human rights,"" says Eid. They have a committed and growing fan-base and when they released on YouTube ""Nas Betroos We Nas Betmoot"" (""People Die While Others Dance"") it gained 1 million views in two months. For the band the song symbolizes a clash of generations, which they think is the source of most of Egypt's problems: an older generation holding on to an idea of stability and a younger one trying to shape the future it will live in. Eid's raspy vocals give the band's music a unique sound, while they cultivate an unconventional image, riding high-powered ""muscle"" motorbikes in defiance of the terrible Cairo traffic as an ""escape from reality."" The band is honest about the potential violent consequence of taking a stand against deep-seated views, but they choose to remain optimistic. ""This voice is like a turtle. (We) work very slowly, but we never go back... Look at the past three years, regimes changed and we continued the revolution,"" says Eid.

"(CNN) -- I was in Cairo three years ago when the revolution began. I had not thought the January 25th protests would lead to very much. But they did. Three years later, Egypt greets the dawn of the anniversary with bombs, police violence, and nihilism. The revolution has become a struggle in a way no one dreamed at the time. It seems to be almost a revolutionary act to simply reject despair. In this despondent phase of the Egyptian tale, there are very few good guys, far too many bad guys, and a plethora of ugly guys. On the 25th of January three years ago, the divisions in the population were more or less clear. The 'bad guy' was the regime of Hosni Mubarak, with all that implied. The corruption, police brutality, and overall degradation of human dignity in Egyptian society were clearly associated with his office. Certainly, there were sections of the population that supported him -- in the aftermath of the uprising, 79% of Egyptians said they supported the protests that led to Mubarak's departure. That left a sizeable minority which was uncertain of or opposed the protests. At the outset of the uprising, most Egyptians were unwilling to throw their weight behind the protests -- but they did not support Mubarak. They just did not see much of an alternative. Today, the divisions are far more complicated. That 79% has become fragmented in ways that few predicted. Those that backed the Islamist forces of the Muslim Brotherhood would feel great pride as confidence in its political party went from 15% in the aftermath of the uprising, to a high of 67% a year later. But they would also feel great disappointment: just prior to the June 30th ouster of Mohamed Morsy, Gallup polls and others showed the political force of the Muslim Brotherhood had lost most of its post-uprising popular support over its year in power. They are now designated as a terrorist organisation by the military backed interim government, albeit without conclusive public proof linking the group to terrorist attacks (a separate terrorist movement, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, has claimed responsibility). The Brotherhood's political strategy has gone from trying to enforce authority over the state from within, to engaging in continuous protests against it from without. Since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, the military establishment has been the single most popular institution in the country. Popular conscription means that members of most Egyptian families have served in it; the educational system glorifies it, and most media in the country over the past three years has been at best lukewarm in its criticism of it. At its height over the past three years before Morsy's ouster, public confidence in the military was anything from 80% to 95%. Until Morsy's departure, the Muslim Brotherhood repressed disparagement of the army, and joined in its lionisation, identifying the army as supportive of Morsy's rule. After it, one imagines the popularity of the military dropped with the departure of Brotherhood support for it. Given the loss of popular support for the Brotherhood, and the overwhelming negative public media narrative about the same, it seems likely the military can still count on a majority of the population to back it. Other political forces have, generally speaking, decided there is a binary choice to be made: back the Muslim Brotherhood, or back the military. There was never much lost love between most other political forces and the Brotherhood. The latter already had enemies prior to coming to power, and alienated many potential (and existing) allies during the post-uprising period through its toleration of sectarian rhetoric, permissive attitude to vigilante violence, opposition to consensus building, and failure to enact reforms. It is difficult to describe most of these anti-Brotherhood forces as ""liberal,"" let alone ""revolutionary,"" however. The past six months have seen the largest number of civilian causalities at the hands of state forces in modern Egyptian history, as well as various other violations of civil rights. Most of these forces have either been silent or actively supportive of such efforts in Egypt's own ""War on Terror,"" although they objected greatly to other abuses during Morsy's tenure. On the third anniversary of the revolutionary uprising, that leaves one group left to account for -- the group that sparked it in the first place, and continued to fight for it without regard for partisan political interest. Those original ""Jan25 revolutionaries,"" made up of rights campaigners, civil society activists and others, had no plan during that 18 day uprising -- except to persist and persevere. They were joined by many others -- and no-one can now claim the uprising was theirs alone. The crowds that swept into the different squares of Egypt over those days were representative of Egyptian society in general -- not simply one sector of it. But that portion of society that sparked the protests, those who continued to agitate for fundamental change, and to criticise, irrespective of who sat in the presidential palace -- they've already realised that just as they were on the margins on January 25 2011, they're still on them in 2014. Three years later, many of them have been arrested for dissent against the current government. Many had gone into political parties, but they never reached critical mass. What they did have -- what they do have -- is this strange perseverance to continue speaking truth to power. On January 25 2014, some may go out to remember the uprising where so many Egyptians decided to join them. Mostly, however, they'll probably take a deep breath as they see most Egyptians fall prey to an ultra-nationalism on the one hand, and a sectarian partisanship on the other. Back to the margins they may have gone -- but into oblivion, they refuse to go. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.A. Hellyer.","Egypt's revolution has shown clear fault lines in society, says H.A. Hellyer .

"(CNN) -- Travel can be a nightmare. Christmas can be a nightmare. Logic dictates that putting these two negatives together should make a positive. And so it proves. Plan wisely, packing your bags while everyone else is stuffing their stockings, and you can steer clear of the orgy of soulless materialism that some say Christmas has become. Just don't expect to get any presents. Or be surprised when your traveling companion introduces himself as ""Mr. Scrooge."" 1. Go to New Zealand . These days, one of the best ways to take a few hours out from modern life is to fly. With in-flight cellphone reception and free Wi-Fi still relatively rare on commercial flights, it's a rare chance to escape daily stresses. International aviation schedules keep going even over Christmas, so if you really want to spend December 25 out of the festive loop, there are few better ways than ascending to 30,000 feet. Because the pre-Christmas panic is over, tickets often become considerably cheaper -- and the cheaper the fare, the longer the travel time. Admittedly, you'll be dependent on your fellow passengers not trying to celebrate at altitude, but airline food will sap the festive spirit from even the most hardened traveler. New Zealand, thanks to its remote (for most of us) Southern Hemisphere location, makes an ideal destination as it's so far from everywhere else it'll probably take you 24 hours to get there. Unless you live in New Zealand. In which case head to Spain. More: 7 tips for successful solo travel . 2. Go to a non-Christian country . Since Christmas is Christianity's biggest annual shindig -- albeit one hijacked by commercialism in many countries -- another option is to head where both Christians and the pervasive forces of global commerce are confined to the sidelines. Morocco is a perennial favorite for Christmas avoiders, particularly as it also offers a warm escape from the plunging temperatures that merely serve to compound the misery of those who hate the holidays. Daytime temperatures can reach a pleasant 24C/75F. You could head to the ancient imperial city of Marrakech, with its lively Djemaa el Fna square filled with musicians, dancers, apothecaries and snake charmers. After checking into a luxury riad townhouse hotel (Riad Farnatchi, Rue Souk el Fassisi; +212 5 24 38 49 10), you can shop in the souk and sample street food such as chicken tagine with caramelized pumpkin. The evening calls to prayer should drown out the sound of sleigh bells. 3. Go to a communist country . Same deal as before, although by communist country we essentially mean Laos. You could try Cuba, but since Fidel Castro relented on a Christmas ban in 1998, Havana is no longer a safe haven. France's colonial past has left its festive footprint on Vietnam, and North Korea isn't anyone's idea of a fun getaway. You aren't entirely safe even in China, where two decades of economic reform have inspired giddy enthusiasm for Christmas's till-ringing commercialism. More: Giant blowup Santa poses as Marilyn Monroe in China . Expect trees, Santas and lights in big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, and ersatz Christmas dinners in rural tourist spots such as Yangshuo. However, on the Venn diagram where absence of Christianity and communism form two overlapping circles, Laos lies dead center. Here, centuries of Buddhist traditions largely kept French influence at bay and have both survived civil war and the onset of Marxist socialism. Unlike everywhere else at Christmas, it's relatively cheap. You can enjoy a Noel-free night before Christmas in Luang Prabang, where nothing stirs, except maybe the gently flowing Mekong River. The Mekong Riverview hotel (+856 71 25 49 00) makes the most of its location. 4. Retreat . If you're avoiding Christmas to spare your soul rather than your wallet from bankruptcy, perhaps the place for you is a retreat. By immersing yourself in the spiritually enriching possibilities of an intensive yoga course (Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram, Kerala, India; +91 471 227 3093) you'll not only skip the bingeing season, you'll get a head start on the January detox. Or you could try a monastery for silent meditation (such as the Wat Suan Mokkh, in Chaiya, Thailand; no telephone for obvious reasons). Absence of carol singers guaranteed. 5. Go to a party town . This might seem counter-intuitive, but a good way to avoid the season of excess is to head somewhere it happens on a daily basis. Although December 25 is certainly celebrated in world-class party towns like New Orleans, if anything it's slightly more low key than the rest of the year. New Orleans' boozy scene takes it considerably easier over Christmas, making it one of the best times to visit. In the Icelandic capital, Rejkjavik, where Nordic appetites for nightlife can leave visitors whimpering for mercy, very little happens over the Christmas holidays, making it a magically peaceful time to contemplate marvels such as the Northern Lights. More: Best places to see the Northern Lights . In New Orleans, one place to seek sanctuary is Loft 523 (523 Gravier Street; +1 504 200 6523). Near Reykjavik, the upscale Ion Hotel has its own Northern Lights Bar (Nesjavollum vid Thingvallavatn, 801 Selfoss; +354 482 34 15). More: World's 7 most dangerous and remote islands . 6. Work . More soul-cleansing, this time via the creditable route of voluntary work -- which, in a way, combines the giving spirit of Christmas with the best of Christmas avoidance. Not only will you be donating your time and labor, you'll be too busy building schools, teaching kids or saving rainforests to think about anything else. Organizations such as Elevate Destinations or Global Vision International are good places to start. 7. Get lost . If you find a remote spot where no one, not even Santa, can track you down, then giving Christmas the slip should be as easy as mince pie. Lundy, a windswept but beautiful island in the waters of Britain's Bristol Channel, isn't too far from civilization, but there are no televisions or Internet connections, you're unlikely to get a mobile phone signal and the only way on or off is by helicopter. You might have to avoid the island's solitary pub, the Marisco Tavern, on Christmas Day, but the prospect of sitting in front of a blazing fire in the splendid isolation of your very own lighthouse (Old Light Tower, Lundy Island; +44 1628 825 925), will be worth it. It's the perfect place to start plotting next year's Christmas escape.","Not everyone is a Noel fan .

"Hailey, Idaho (CNN) -- In the days after Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was released from nearly five years in captivity, yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street, red-bricked storefronts of his hometown. A sense of relief and excitement filled the air: Bergdahl would soon be home. But more than four months after Bergdahl returned to the United States, the ribbons and banners are gone. This town's relationship with the saga of their homegrown prisoner of war is complicated. ""We're done. We're over it,"" Hailey Mayor Fritz Haemmerle said as he denied CNN's request for an on-camera interview. ""We stood by the Bergdahl family to get Bowe home but we need to move on."" Inside a secure locker of the Hailey Police Department, there are boxes filled with thousands of letters for Bergdahl. The letters were sent to the White House as part of a ""Bring Bowe Home"" campaign started through social media last November, just months before Bergdahl would be released. Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, spearheaded the letter campaign. In three months, O'Neill said, several hundred thousand letters poured into the White House. A few of those boxes were eventually shipped to Idaho. O'Neill can't bring herself to throw the letters away. ""It means that people all over the world cared about Bowe,"" O'Neill said. ""We would hope that he would like to read through them one day to see just how much he meant to so many people."" The boxes are a symbol of how the story of Bergdahl's rescue didn't come with a triumphant homecoming. Bergdahl's release on May 30 was instantly doused in controversy. Many of the soldiers who served with him accused the 28-year-old soldier of deserting his unit by walking off the Afghanistan base before he was captured. There was also intense criticism of the Obama administration for trading Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl now sits in a sort of limbo. He has completed the Army's formal reintegration program and continues psychological treatment. He is still assigned to a unit with U.S. Army North in San Antonio, performing ""administrative duties."" But Bergdahl is also waiting to hear if he'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system. In August, he was questioned by Gen. Kenneth Dahl for two days. The Army announced on Friday that Dahl completed the initial report on his findings in the Bergdahl case. The report will now be reviewed by the director of the Army staff and senior Army leaders. ""This will be a lengthy process,"" an Army spokesman wrote. ""It would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential results or the amount of time the review process will take to complete."" When news of Bergdahl's release broke, his family and friends had hoped for a quick reunion. For nearly five years, the lives of Bergdahl's parents had been consumed by the plight of their son. His father, Bob Bergdahl, has said he kept his clocks set to the time in Afghanistan. He grew a beard, to the dismay of many critics, to show solidarity with his son. Bob Bergdahl also taught himself Pashto, the language of his son's captors, to communicate directly with the Taliban. In the days after his son's release, critics used those details to accuse Bob Bergdahl of sympathizing with the Taliban. Bergdahl's parents have declined all requests for interviews. Family friends say Bob Bergdahl has shaved his beard. But the expected family reunion never materialized and the Bergdahl family soon stopped answering questions about why Bowe Bergdahl was refusing to see his parents. Sources tell CNN that Bergdahl is now ""communicating"" with his parents, but a face-to-face reunion still has not occurred. The sources would not elaborate on how Bergdahl is communicating with his family. Military officials have said Bergdahl has been given every opportunity to reunite with his family. Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell, declined to talk about Bergdahl's communication with his family. Bergdahl grew up among a tight-knit community of families in Hailey that home-schooled their children. Tim Kemery's son was one of Bowe's best friends. Kemery said Bowe Bergdahl was raised in an intensely religious atmosphere with a strict code of conduct. Around age 16, Kemery said, Bergdahl left home and embarked on a series of adventures. ""No doubt it was some kind of rebellion,"" Kemery said. But Kemery couldn't say if that childhood rebellion was still a source of tension between Bergdahl and his family. He said he also wonders why the soldier hasn't reunited with his parents. ""There may have been something there that was a bone of contention,"" said Kemery. ""Maybe it's the debriefing (reintegration process) or because he feels like he has let them down or for some other unknown reason he just doesn't want to have that emotional recognition again of his parents."" Kemery said that as a child Bergdahl struggled to control his frustration and would often disappear for days at a time, building forts and hiking for miles into the Idaho wilderness. Kemery said he sees a parallel between the young Bowe he knew and the soldier accused by fellow soldiers of walking off his military base in Afghanistan in 2009. ""Bowe did have a tendency to get really frustrated and just to walk off and throw up his hands,"" said Kemery. Around Hailey, one often hears people asking the same question, will Bowe Bergdahl ever come back home? Bergdahl must wait to hear what military commanders will determine about his fate. Will he be charged with a crime? Will he be discharged? Bergdahl's lawyer has said the soldier would like to continue his education. Tim Kemery hopes he makes time to visit Idaho. ""We have a hunting trip waiting for him. We are going to talk about things around the fire,"" said Kemery. CNN's Jason Morris contributed to this report.","Bergdahl, held captive in Afghanistan, has been free since May .
People in his Idaho hometown worked to publicize him while he was hostage .
But his freedom came with questions and town mayor says it's time to move on ."
"(CNN) -- These are tough times for idealistic revolutionaries. Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong know that taking on the Chinese government has never been an easy task. Their chance of success gets worse by the day. There are signs that this could end badly. China's Communist Party is sending clear messages that it has no intention of yielding to the protesters' demands, warning of ""unimaginable consequences"" if the protests don't end soon. The worst case scenario is that these peaceful and highly disciplined protesters could end up crushed by the Chinese regime just as their predecessors were in 1989 at Tiananmen. Yes, the arc of history tends to bend toward justice, but the conditions and timing have to be right. Based on official statements, China is in no mood to be pressured to change. The international community is too worried about the instability in the Middle East and too busy to meddle with China's political problems. Hong Kong's activists, who were prepared well for this moment and are committed to avoiding violence, have the moral support of people beyond China's borders, but not much more. And China believes it has little to fear from international reaction. When the United States issued mild statements in support of an ""open system"" and the ""highest possible degree of autonomy"" for Hong Kong, Beijing promptly shot back that this is China's internal domestic affair and others should stay out. Sure, if China brings about a bloodbath in Hong Kong, investors may take their chips and go to Singapore or other competing regional hubs. It is not completely risk-free for Beijing to go on the offensive against peaceful protesters. But China is controlling the message at home, trying to inoculate the country from a pro-democracy contagion. It would rather avoid a nasty confrontation, but it may decide at some point that a prolonged standoff is riskier than a swift violent crackdown. China's highly self-assured president, Xi Jinping, has three possible courses of action, and all the evidence is that he has ruled out the one leading to compromise. Instead, he has issued his response in language that signals complete inflexibility. The Communist Party newspaper presented Xi's position almost as a doctrine, practically written for long-term use. They called it ""The Three Unwaverings,"" a determination to continue on the current course of implementing the existing policies of ""one country, two systems,"" in ""advancing democratic development according to the law,"" and in ""safeguarding long-term prosperity and stability."" When China speaks of safeguarding stability, it means change will come -- if at all -- very slowly and under the complete control of the central government. The Hong Kong students, in contrast to the Tiananmen Square protesters, are not demanding that China become a democratic country. Their demands are much more modest. All they want is Beijing to keep its word. When Hong Kong stopped being a British colony to join China in 1997, Beijing agreed voters there would choose their own leaders through universal suffrage by 2017. Now China has said all voters in Hong Kong can participate in those elections, but they will have to choose between candidates approved by a committee loyal to Beijing's leaders. That's not true democracy, the protesters say, quite correctly. The man who helped negotiate the 1997 handover, the last British governor of Hong Kong, agrees that Beijing is in brazen violation of the agreement. But President Xi, who has been adding to his authority and may have already become the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, is not going to let the masses of democracy-loving people in Hong Kong tell him what to do. More importantly, he will not allow them to give the rest of China any crazy ideas about choosing their own leaders or about pressuring the authorities to make concessions by holding protests. China's Communist Party worries about three things over all others: social stability, economic growth and its hold on power. They view anything that threatens one of those goals as a challenge to be quashed. A mass protest demanding democracy in the most prosperous city in the country -- Hong Kong's umbrella revolution -- threatens all three, even if the protesters are not trying to overthrow the Communist Party's rule. Xi has already been trying to maneuver through an economic slowdown. Periods of economic uncertainty are the most dangerous times for a political system. Activists in the mainland say he has already tightened repression and surveillance against dissidents. And that was even before the umbrellas came out in Hong Kong and volleys of tear gas persuaded tens of thousands of people to come out in support of the young protesters. For now, Beijing is allowing the local government in Hong Kong to deal with the crisis. But its patience is wearing thin. The students are digging in, persuaded of the rightness of their cause. If Beijing does send out the troops -- the People's Liberation Army forces already garrisoned close to where the ""umbrella revolution"" demonstrators are holding their protests -- international reaction will prove even less determined and more ineffective than it did in Beijing after that tragic night in Tiananmen Square 25 years ago . Beijing knows that if it crushes the protests, there will be little appetite in other countries for major economic sanctions against China. Both rich and poor economies have become reliant on Chinese markets. If it's any consolation, this moment is not lost. The times are tough for democratic revolution, but history really is on the side of protesters. As Hegel said, history steadily brings the awareness of one's freedom, followed by its realization. Hong Kong is gaining that awareness. But achieving true democracy will take longer.","Frida Ghitis: These are tough times for idealistic pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong .

"Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of Congo (CNN) -- ""The poachers are usually hiding firearms in the fishing camps,"" Mathieu Eckel briefs us as his anti-poaching unit's shaky metal boats speed down one of the rivers that snakes it way through the Odzala-Kokoua National Park. The river's dark waters are stunningly framed by shades of green and cascading vines in this remote corner of the Republic of Congo. As Eckel's eco-guard unit turns a corner, he gives the order to cut the engines. We're approaching the first suspected site. The boats coast silently against the hum of the forest. The team quietly assaults, but the camp is deserted. A member of the team checks the ashes. ""It's still warm, they must have left early morning, we missed them by a couple hours,"" he says. For the next grueling, hot eight hours, the same scenario repeats itself. Then, suddenly around a bend, the unit spots rising smoke. They rush ashore, fan out and within seconds the first gunshot rings out. The men sprint through the dense and disorienting terrain, forcing their way though the undergrowth and knee-deep water as even more bursts of gunfire echo through the forest. Pumped on adrenaline, eco-guard Brice Moupele animatedly re-enacts what happened when he saw the poachers. ""I yelled 'Stop, stop!' and shot in the air,"" he says. ""The man tried to shoot at me. I tackled him and grabbed his gun, but he was able to escape."" Moupele happily displays the captured weapon. The team finds the poachers' canoe, weighed down with fresh elephant meat. An eco-guard lifts up a portion of the elephant's trunk, still dripping blood. He lifts up heavy chunks of elephant flesh, searching for weapons and tusk on the bottom of the wooden canoe. ""This is what they use to cut off the tusks"" Eckel says, holding up a bloodied ax. It's a sickening reminder of a trade that has decimated the park's elephant population. The non-profit group African Parks -- which runs Odzala -- estimates that Central Africa has lost 62% of its forest elephant population in the last decade. In the week we spent at the park, we only saw one alive. Opinion: How to end the elephant slaughter . ""The ivory we get, it's less than 1%"" Eckel estimates. ""In this area, it makes a lot of money. It's very difficult to say, maybe one or more elephant is killed a day."" Eckel describes the fight to protect what's left as guerrilla warfare carried out by just 76 eco-guards patrolling an area that is 13,500 km2 (8,390 square miles) -- about the size of Connecticut. Hardly enough, but around 40% of the team members are former poachers themselves. ""They are really motivated to stop the poaching and they know how the poachers work, so it's easy for them to think like them,"" Eckel explains. It's part of a program developed by Eckel in the past year in which poachers are given amnesty if they hand over their weapons and confess. But it's still a tough sell in an area where villages live off poaching and there are no other alternatives. The unit's successes haven't made them any friends. Members often find themselves pursuing neighbors, friends and even family members. They have all been threatened. Frank Bolangonga tells us three men assaulted his wife down a dark side street in his village. ""She went to buy petrol at the market,"" he says. ""When she was on her way back home they attacked her, tried to rape her, but she was strong. She pulled back and her dress ripped and she ran away."" The threats intensify after arrests and raids, and did so even more after the team brought in Ghislain Ngondjo, better known as ""Pepito."" Vianney Evoura, who used to poach for Pepito back in 2004, testified against him in court. They live in the same village and Pepito's relatives have vowed revenge. ""His mother promised to poison me,"" Evoura says. ""I don't go out after dark unless I am with five or six other people, I don't eat out. I am always on alert."" African Parks headquarters is just a 10-minute drive from Pepito's village, which has forced Eckel to send his own family away. ""There was threats of attack on the camp where we live, my family was with me at this time. I don't want to take the risk for them because of my job,"" he tells us. But the toughest challenge for Eckel and his team is government corruption. He doesn't trust for a second that the government will follow any leads after the bust on the poachers' camp. The team finds four guns, one of which Eckel says is military issue. Of all of the weapons the unit has in its stockpile -- a combination of those handed over in the amnesty program and those seized in raids -- the majority come from military stock. ""The military sells firearms to the poachers,"" Eckel claims. ""Sometime we catch military with their firearms inside the park."" In an area where the lines between poachers and protectors tend to blur because of village and family ties, at times the team can't even trust itself. ""To find this in the Congo you must have contact with a ranger,"" Eckel says, showing a compass found at the poachers' camp. ""It's a silver one and it's not an old one."" Also found during the raid was a cellphone. Dogs help to sniff out poaching . The team torches the camp to send a message and sets off down the river with the poachers' canoe in tow as bright orange flames engulf the ramshackle huts. But it's far from over. The next morning, Eckel is busy drawing a map in the sand, strategizing the best way to get into position. One of the numbers on the phone they found is that of a notorious bushmeat trader. ""We had an initial phone contact and we organized a meeting,"" Eckel explains. ""We play like we are the poacher and he thinks we are the poacher."" It's an ambush. Barreling down the road, the team spots the bushmeat trader on his motorcycle. Shouting with guns pointed, they force him to pull over. ""How do you justify that this phone we called you from was found with a poacher?"" Eckel asks the trader. ""You were saying that you wanted to collect material, ivory."" ""I don't know who called me,"" the trader claims. ""Everyone in the village has my number."" The cell phone rings, answered by an eco-guard pretending to be the suspected poacher. The person on the other end of the line issues a breathless warning. ""Remove all the weapons from the camp by the river, we've spotted the eco-guards at the small port."" Meanwhile, the trader breaks, giving up the name and location of the cell phone's owner. ""They are just there, they live there. He's a young guy."" The team detains not one, but two brothers and take them back to one of the unit's checkpoints. One confesses to owning one of the rifles found at the camp, but both deny they shot at the eco-guards and refuse to give up the names of the other members of the gang. Poachers poison 87 elephants for ivory . They are handcuffed and driven off to jail. When we return to Brazzaville, we interview Henri Djombo, minister of Forest Economy and Sustainable Development, and ask about the rampant corruption claims. He denied direct military complicity, but conceded the government needs to clean up its ranks. ""Yes, it is true that there are accomplices to this illegal trading of wildlife, that is not easy,"" he told us. He insists that the government is committed to fighting corruption and ending the culture of poaching with impunity. A few days after the two brothers were detained, their families gave up the names of the rest of the gang members, in hopes of getting the brothers out of jail. Based on that intel, the unit carried out another raid. One of the eco-guards was severely wounded, run over by a motorcycle as they attempted to detain the suspected poacher. As the team was transporting the wounded guard to hospital, gang members torched the eco-guard camp at the checkpoint. Out here, the war on ivory trading is violent and personal.

"(CNN) -- What role did Pakistan play in the operation against Osama bin Laden? I would be surprised if Pakistan played a significant role in the operation to apprehend and kill Osama bin Laden, based on the fact that the drone strikes that the U.S. conduct in the tribal areas are done covertly, the authorities in Pakistan are not informed until the very last minute, because of the fear of information leaks. An operation of this scale in the central urban heartland of Pakistan would mean that information would be kept on a need-to-know basis. Only a few people within the CIA would have known about this operation, it would definitely not have gone out to another country's intelligence agency, especially when there's so little trust with the ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistani intelligence service]. There has been a deterioration in relations at a strategic level -- the ISI leaked out the name of the CIA station chief in Islamabad, and a person working out of the U.S. embassy was detained by the Pakistani authorities, allegedly working for the CIA. The fact that the U.S. has been conducting drone strikes is an illustration of the fact that there has been little cooperation -- if not none -- with the Pakistani authorities. We've seen the evolution of relations between Pakistan and America go from 'frenemies' to outright enemies. Historically, have the U.S. and Pakistan had good ties? The relationship has always been problematic, flawed, lacking trust. It goes back to during the time of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan: The U.S. and the West turned to Pakistan to provide and assist the Mujahideen in removing the Soviets from Afghanistan. There was a strategic relationship, but following the Soviets leaving Afghanistan, that relationship went into suspension. It was only restarted following 9/11: The Bush Administration turned to General Pervez Musharraf, the military ruler of Pakistan, who at that time had become a social pariah. He was asked to round up the leadership of al Qaeda, of the Taliban, to prevent them from creating an infrastructure inside Pakistan. In return Pakistan would be rewarded with generous aid from the United States and other countries. Musharraf was very skilled at saying all the right things, but doing virtually nothing, and that scenario continued, from 9/11, right up to the end of Musharraf's tenure as ruler of Pakistan in 2007. It took a long time but the U.S. finally began to realise that the promises the Pakistanis were making were empty promises: Nothing of real tangible significance was achieved. Information that was being shared ended up being passed on to al Qaeda, and counterterrorism operations were therefore flawed. The Obama Administration disagreed with the Bush Administration on issues like Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, but the one issue they absolutely built upon was on the drone strikes policy, because if they couldn't deal with al Qaeda on the ground, they would try to tackle them from the skies. Drone strikes were increased substantially under the Obama Administration, because there was this lack of trust. The perception was that the U.S. would support Pakistan publicly while pressurising them privately. Over time we've seen the public support wane. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Pakistan last year, made it clear that she could not believe that the authorities in Pakistan did not know where bin Laden was. What has the reaction been in the region to news of bin Laden's death? Keep in mind the fact that there are protests when drone strikes take place in the tribal areas. This operation to take out Osama bin Laden was near the urban heartland of Punjab. This is the core of where the military establishment is from, so there is going to be a falling out. Publicly, the Pakistanis will try to make out that they were aware of the operation, and that they played a role in it. Privately, they will be seething that this was done on their territory. And there will be protests. The radicals and the extremists inside Pakistan --whose infrastructure has not been dismantled, as Musharraf had promised -- they will organize mass protests. There will be propaganda by the radicals and the extremists to try and exploit the situation. U.S. interests, U.S. personnel, U.S. embassies and consulates will have to take extra precautions. If bin Laden's death is of symbolic seismic significance, then the fallout in Pakistan will be equally matched. There is always a reaction. But keep in mind that the reaction may not come from al Qaeda -- it may come from an affiliate, from the groups that have emerged or are emerging from al Qaeda's shadows: Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Pakistani Taliban, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. These groups have the infrastructure, the resources, the personnel and the desire to plot and plan mass casualty attacks, and they may be in a better position than bin Laden's al Qaeda to carry out a reprisal attack. Will Osama bin Laden's death have a wider impact? Al Qaeda central is not the group it once was: the drone strikes have been confining their operational space, one by one the leadership has been picked off, they don't have the ability to train people from the West as they once could. Their resources are depleted, they are not able to replenish their ranks, so Al Qaeda central may not be able to cause a significant reaction, but other groups are potentially in a better position to do it. There will be problems that will emerge from this -- the worry is that we don't know potentially what they could be, or when. The silence is going to be the greatest fear, because it's not necessarily that these groups would want to carry out attacks regionally or globally imminently. They may wait, they may bide their time. We're talking about weeks, months. Al Qaeda's affiliates have always had very long term thinking -- it's not about today or tomorrow, it's about next year. They won't necessarily want to carry out something that will fail and humiliate the group further. We also have to bear in mind that bin Laden has been killed, but his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri is still at large. He has very much taken on the mantle of issuing al Qaeda's messages: Audio, video, through the internet; and his protégé, Abu Yahya al-Libi is also out there. They will certainly be issuing a message at some point, trying to create a rallying call for vengeance, to inspire their adherents and followers to take up arms. Bin Laden may be dead, but his ideology still lives, and the message will continue to indoctrinate young, impressionable minds across the world.","Gohel: Pakistani authorities will have been kept in the dark because of a lack of trust .

"(CNN) -- Four people were killed Thursday afternoon and two others were injured in a gun and knife attack at a Native American tribal office in Alturas, California, police chief Ken Barnes said. Sherrie Rhoades, 44, was attending a tribal eviction meeting at the Cedarville Rancheria tribal office Thursday around 3:30 p.m. when she opened fire, Barnes said. When Rhoades ran out of ammunition she grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen and attacked another person, stabbing them, Barnes said. A person at the meeting ran out of the building covered in blood and went to the Alturas police station to alert officers, Barnes said. Police said they found Rhoades outside the building, running with a knife in her hands. She was taken into custody. The deceased victims were identified as a 19-year-old woman, a 45-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man and a 50-year-old man. Rhoades, a former tribal leader, was at the hearing because she was facing eviction, police said. The shooting happened in Modoc County, which is in Northern California on the Oregon border. Autopsies on those killed are scheduled for Friday. The two who were injured by gunshots were transported to out-of-area hospitals and are in critical condition, Barnes told reporters. ""At this time, there doesn't appear to be any threat to the community,"" he said. CNN first learned of the shooting on Twitter.","Two people are injured, in critical condition, the police chief says .

"(CNN) -- He might be fighting it out with Lionel Messi for the title of the world's top soccer player, but Cristiano Ronaldo is in a league of his very own when it comes to social media followers. Tuesday saw the Portuguese superstar top 100 million ""fans"" on Facebook -- way ahead of the nearest sporting opposition. He is adding fans at the rate of nearly one every second, 54 per minute on average. The next best tally is not an individual but a club, FC Barcelona, which has over 76 million 'likes' -- just edging ahead of Ronaldo's own team, European champion Real Madrid. The 29-year-old Ronaldo is also on top of the sporting world on Twitter with over 30 million followers. That is 10 million more than second placed Kaka, a star Brazilian footballer and former Real teammate of Ronaldo. NBA standout LeBron James has the third most popular sports profile on Twitter at 15.3 million followers and also trails on the Facebook front with his account 'liked' by a shade under 22 million people. When Ronaldo tweeted he had won FIFA's Ballon D'Or for the second time on January 13, it received over 118,000 retweets and according to sports market researchers Repucom its total reach in teams of retweets, mentions and replies topped 1.04 million. This compares to James' most popular day on Twitter -- the announcement of his move to Clevelland Cavaliers, where the total figure was 672,000. Both sets of figures are undoubtedly impressive and James is thought to have a huge following in China, where Facebook and Twitter are banned. ""He's a good looking guy and very savvy in terms of partnerships and the brands he endorses,"" Repucom's head of digital Max Barnett told CNN, explaining why Ronaldo was way out in front. ""He's going down the David Beckham route and is extremely well managed."" Ronaldo's physical appearance is clearly a factor in his widespread following outside of avid sports fans, but Barnett said his most popular tweets were all football related. ""The social media traffic around the Ballon D'Or announcement but also Real Madrid winning the Champions League for a record 10th time (La Decima) was vast,"" he said. Repucom's founder and CEO Paul Smith told CNN that companies backing Ronaldo were on to a winner on and off the field. ""For example, in two days, Tag Heuer's #DontCrackUnderPressure campaign which was endorsed through six posts by Ronaldo led to an estimated 34.92 million Facebook views and 2.4 million ""likes"" for these Tag Heuer related posts,"" he said. ""All of which generated an estimated value of $380,000 to the Tag Heuer brand."" Repucom takes into account a range of factors, from the simple number of people who have seen a social media posting through to the quality and duration of the brand exposure to reach its conclusions. ""When Ronaldo won his first Champions League title with Manchester United in 2008, the English powerhouses did not have have an official Twitter account,"" said Barnett. United's official Twitter feed now has over 3.55 million followers. Its former star player shows no sign of resting on his social media laurels, launching his own official community digital platform, Viva Ronaldo, with a downloadable app and other special features. Fans are promised prizes, autographed memorabilia and even the chance to meet him. Any sports star hoping to mount a challenge to Ronaldo's Facebook and Twitter supremacy clearly faces as tough a test as the hapless defenders trying to keep the prolific striker off the score sheet. Ronaldo is averaging well over a goal per game already this season for Real. But as Barnett points out, even more modest outfits such as unheralded English Premier League side Hull City can benefit from social media's exponential growth. ""Hull grew its Facebook 'fan' base by over 800% last year, with much of the increase coming from Egypt (Hull's owner Assem Allam is Egyptian),"" he said. For Ronaldo, his attraction is not limited to a single country or region, with research suggesting he's known by over 84% of the world's population -- giving plenty of scope still for him to increase his Facebook and Twitter fan base yet more.","Cristiano Ronaldo passes 100 million Facebook fans .

"San Cristobal, Venezuela (CNN) -- The wives of two jailed Venezuelan opposition politicians have won landslide election victories while their husbands remain behind bars. The votes Sunday in the cities of San Cristobal and San Diego were symbolic triumphs for the South American country's opposition, which has argued that the cities' former mayors were politically persecuted when authorities arrested them in March. Daniel Ceballos was accused of civil rebellion and conspiracy after the government said he failed to stop violent protests in San Cristobal. He was given a 12-month sentence. San Cristobal is in the southwestern part of the country, near the border with Colombia. Enzo Scarano was jailed for 10 months after the government accused him of ignoring an order given by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice to stop protests in San Diego, a city near the coast and west of the capital of Caracas. After winning more than 73% of votes in the mayoral election Sunday, Patricia Gutierrez de Ceballos said that each ballot cast in her favor represented a sentence of justice and freedom and a blow against what she called the country's dictatorship. ""They have converted me into mayor and ratified Daniel Ceballos as mayor. And today, San Cristobal has the privilege of having two mayors governing its city,"" the 30-year-old engineer said. When protests erupted against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government earlier this year, San Cristobal, capital of the border state of Tachira, quickly became a flashpoint, and Daniel Ceballos was an outspoken critic of Maduro. Clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces have left more than 40 people dead and around 800 injured across the country since February, according to officials. Maduro has said protesters are ""fascists and extreme-right thugs"" who are trying to destabilize the government to promote a coup. Protesters call Maduro a dictator who has ruined the Venezuelan economy with failed socialist policies. Rosa Brandonisio de Scarano, formerly a City Council member in San Diego, won nearly 88% of votes in the mayoral election there Sunday, officials said. After casting her ballot, she said her vote was a protest against the government's sentence of her husband. ""The people will remain peacefully in the streets, making people listen, so that it echoes throughout the world that Venezuela right now is going through a very difficult time, economically, socially, morally and politically,"" she told reporters. One official from the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela praised the San Diego election results. Carabobo state Gov. Francisco Ameliach said the results signal that the government's election authority is impartial, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Earlier this month, a State Department official pointed to the arrests of Ceballos and Scarano as signs that Maduro's government ""continues to persecute political opponents."" ""While dismantling the independent media and jailing local officials who dare to dissent, the Maduro government is simultaneously empowering armed civilian thugs, or 'colectivos' to intimidate and kill those Venezuelans who continue to march,"" Tom Malinowski, assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, said in a statement prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. CNN team denied permission to cover Venezuelan local elections . Opinion: The Venezuelan nightmare . Journalist Osmary Hernandez reported from San Cristobal, Venezuela.

"(CNN) -- As many as 175 enemy troops killed, 18 wounds from enemy fire, 38 hours of battle, 48 hours evading the North Vietnamese troops in the bush -- and one tiger. Those are the numbers behind Sgt. Maj. Bennie Adkins' Medal of Honor, an award he received from President Barack Obama in a White House ceremony Monday. Adkins of Opelika, Alabama, was honored for his actions in Vietnam's A Shau Valley more than 48 years ago. Then a 32-year-old sergeant first class, Adkins was among a handful of Americans working with troops of the South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Group at Camp A Shau when the camp was attacked by a large North Vietnamese and Viet Cong force on March 9, 1966, according to an Army report. ""Adkins rushed through intense enemy fire and manned a mortar position defending the camp,"" the Army report says. ""He continued to mount a defense even while incurring wounds from several direct hits from enemy mortars. Upon learning that several soldiers were wounded near the center of camp, he temporarily turned the mortar over to another soldier, ran through exploding mortar rounds and dragged several comrades to safety. As the hostile fire subsided, Adkins exposed himself to sporadic sniper fire and carried his wounded comrades to a more secure position."" Later, under enemy fire, some of it coming from South Vietnamese allies who had defected to the North during the battle, Adkins took wounded troops to an airstrip outside the camp for evacuation and drew enemy fire away from the evacuation aircraft. He went outside the camp again to retrieve supplies from an airdrop that fell into a minefield. And that was just day one. ""The bottom line is that it was just not my day to go,"" Adkins said in an Army interview at Fort Benning, Georgia, last week. The fighting, and Adkins' heroism, continued in the early morning of March 10 when the North Vietnamese hit the camp with their main attack, according to the Army report. ""Within two hours, Sergeant First Class Adkins was the only defender firing a mortar weapon. When all mortar rounds were expended, Adkins began placing effective rifle fire upon enemy as they infiltrated the camp perimeter and assaulted his position. Despite receiving additional wounds from enemy rounds exploding on his position, Adkins fought off relentless waves of attacking North Vietnamese soldiers,"" the Army report says. After falling back to a smaller bunker in Camp A Shau, Adkins killed more enemy troops with small arms fire, destroyed equipment and classified documents to prevent them from getting into North Vietnamese hands, and led a group of soldiers in digging their way out of the rear of the bunker and escaping the besieged camp. But Adkins' ordeal was not over. Because he was carrying a wounded comrade, he and his small group couldn't get to the evacuation helicopters sent to pick up the battle's survivors. The band faded into the jungle, avoiding their North Vietnamese pursuers for 48 hours. And that's where the tiger comes in. ""The North Vietnamese soldiers had us surrounded on a little hilltop and everything started getting kind of quiet,"" Adkins is quoted as saying in an Army report. ""We could look around and all at once, all we could see were eyes going around us. It was a tiger that stalked us that night. We were all bloody and in this jungle, the tiger stalked us and the North Vietnamese soldiers were more afraid of the tiger than they were of us. So, they backed off some and we were (able to escape)."" Helicopters rescued Adkins and the rest of his group on March 12. The Army says Adkins killed 135 to 175 enemy soldiers during the Camp A Shau battle. He suffered 18 wounds during the 86-hour ordeal. Forty-eight years later, Adkins doesn't cite those numbers but two others. ""I'm just a keeper of the medal for those other 16 (U.S. troops) who were in the battle, especially the five who didn't make it,"" he told Army News Service. ""I can tell you every man who was there and the five who lost their lives. I can tell you how that happened. It diminishes, but it does not go away,"" Adkins said. And he remembers the South Vietnamese who stuck by his side. ""There were about 410 indigenous Civilian Irregular Defense Group soldiers there with us, and of those, only about 122 survived, and most of those were wounded. It was a horrible, horrible battle. There was valor on all sides, not only from the Americans, but from the CIDG soldiers also,"" he's quoted as saying in an Army report. Others to receive honor . Honored with Adkins at the White House ceremony was one other soldier, posthumously. Spc. Donald P. Sloat was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in using his body to shield comrades from a grenade blast near Danang, Vietnam, in January 1970. Additionally, the White House has announced one more Medal of Honor recipient: From the Civil War, 1st Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing, who held out against Confederate troops during Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863, part of the Battle of Gettysburg. Cushing manned the last serviceable Union artillery battery during the Confederate assault, which came within 100 yards of his position. He was killed by Confederate gunfire. ""His actions made it possible for the Union Army to successfully repulse the Confederate assault,"" a White House statement said. A ceremony for the presentation of Cushing's honor has yet to be announced, the White House said.","Sgt. Maj. Bennie Adkins honored for his actions in Vietnam in 1966 .

"(CNN) -- A growing scandal over the manipulation of health care appointments resulted in an employee at a Wyoming clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs being placed on administrative leave, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said Friday. An e-mail allegedly written by an employee in Cheyenne, obtained by CNN, says: ""Yes, it is gaming the system a bit. But you have to know the rules of the game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset, which doesn't help us. Let me know if this doesn't make sense."" The Navy Chief Hospital Corpsman who says she supplied the e-mail to investigators told CNN in an exclusive interview that employees were told to ""game the system because it made Cheyenne look good."" CNN confirmed with investigators that she was the source of the e-mail. The e-mail outlined ways employees could manipulate the system to hide the fact that veterans had to wait months for appointments, said Lisa Lee, a scheduler at the VA clinic in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is managed by the Wyoming clinic. ""We were sat down by our supervisor ... and he showed us exactly how to schedule so it looked like it was within that 14-day period,"" Lee told CNN. ""They would keep track of schedulers who were complying and getting 100 percent of that 14 day(s) and those of us who were not."" The VA's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor, dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested/preferred date. Any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented. But many veterans end up waiting longer, and the delays are never reported, veterans and their advocates say. Shinseki released a statement saying he has ordered an investigation by the inspector general, and that the employee be removed immediately from patient care responsibilities and placed on leave. ""VA takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously,"" Shinseki said. ""If true, the behavior outlined in the email is unacceptable."" Rep. Jeff Miller, chairman of House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which subpoenaed Shinseki to testify next week, said in a statement that ""the VA's reaction to the latest development in its delays in care scandal is faux outrage at its finest."" ""Since last year, VA officials have known about intentional efforts to falsify patient wait time data at the Fort Collins, Colo., Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, which is part of the Cheyenne VA Medical Center,"" Miller said in the statement. ""In fact, according to a Dec. 2013 VA Office of Medical Inspector report, clerks at the Fort Collins clinic were actually taught how to cook the books. Yet until today, department officials had not taken any steps whatsoever to discipline any employees or request an independent investigation -- nor did they plan to do so."" Miller said Shinseki's actions Friday appear ""to be more of a knee-jerk reaction to tough media questions than anything else. If this is what it takes for VA leaders to do the right thing, you can't help but question how they operate when they think no one is paying attention."" The latest allegation comes as the federal department defends itself against claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities throughout the nation, including claims of a secret wait list in Phoenix, which was first reported by CNN. An new interim director, Steve Young, will take over the Phoenix VA Health Care system on Monday, the department announced Friday. He takes over an embattled system responsible for 85,000 veterans and an operating budget of about $500 million. On Thursday, Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman, Associate Director Lance Robinson and a third employee, who was not identified, were placed on leave amid allegations of a secret waiting list and claims that more than 40 veterans died waiting for care. The American Legion, the nation's largest veterans organization, and another group, Concerned Veterans for America, have called for Shinseki's resignation. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN on Friday that if the mounting accusations are true, ""people should go to jail."" He spoke before news broke of the Wyoming clinic e-mail. McCain's comments came the same day that he appeared at a Phoenix town hall meeting in which a procession of veterans and their families criticized what they described as widespread delays and mismanagement within the national health care system designed for America's veterans. ""If it is what it appears to be, this isn't just resignations, this is violations of the law,"" McCain told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""People should go to jail."" The former POW said, ""Not surprisingly ... this is spreading .... and we need to hold people accountable."" McCain told the town hall meeting that Shinseki called him to say he had ordered a ""face-to-face audit"" at all VA clinics but wanted to wait for an VA inspector general's report before revealing his findings. ""My friends, an inspector general's report can take months. I told him we cannot wait a day, much less months, before there is a report,"" McCain said amid applause. Shinseki ordered the audit Thursday. The same day, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee subpoenaed him. The subpoena will cover e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list, first reported by CNN, of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital. Attention on the secretary follows months of CNN exclusive reporting about U.S. veterans who have died while they waited for treatment at VA hospitals. CNN has submitted numerous requests for an interview with Shinseki; the secretary has refused them all. On Thursday, a VA scheduler in San Antonio, said clerks scheduling medical appointments for veterans were ""cooking the books"" at their bosses' behest to hide the fact some had to wait weeks, if not months, for appointments. The Office of Inspector General confirmed to CNN that it has staff investigators on the ground in San Antonio looking into the allegations.","NEW: Whistleblower tells CNN the e-mail outlined ways to manipulate the system .

"Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) -- A United Arab Emirates court convicted dozens Tuesday in a high-profile case against 94 people charged with plotting to overthrow the government. More than two dozen of those who stood trial were acquitted, according to state media. It was a trial that drew criticism from international rights groups, who accused UAE authorities of ""serious pretrial violations of fair trial rights."" The Supreme Federal Court in Abu Dhabi sentenced eight people in absentia to 15 years in prison, while 56 of the suspects were handed 10-year prison sentences, five were sentenced to seven years in prison, and 25, including all 12 women in the, case were acquitted. Financial assets belonging to some of those convicted have also been confiscated, according to the state news agency, WAM. The court also ordered the shutdown of a number of organizations and websites that seem to be associated with the accused. According to the country's Ministry of Justice, the sentences in the state security trial that lasted four months cannot be appealed. The 94, all UAE nationals, were facing various charges including establishment of a clandestine organization aiming to overthrow the government. The charges, according to judicial authorities, stem from Article 180 of the country's penal code, which bans ""establishing, instituting, founding, organizing, administering or joining an association, corporation, organization or any branch thereof, with the aim of overthrowing the regime of the State"" The group is also accused of having links to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, an organization prohibited in the UAE. ""They launched, established and ran an organization seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power,"" Attorney General Salem Saeed Kubaish said in a January statement published by state media. Recent statements by Human Rights Watch said many of the 94 are members of a local ""non-violent group that has been engaged in peaceful political debate in the UAE for many years and advocates greater adherence to Islamic precepts."" Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other watchdog groups have described the mass trial as unfair. The groups have also accused authorities of abusing the detainees. According to Human Rights Watch, the defendants included two prominent human rights lawyers, as well as judges, teachers and student leaders. Rights groups have accused the country's judicial authorities of carrying out a trial shrouded in secrecy by not allowing international journalists and observers to cover the hearings. Local media and observers have had access to trial sessions. Authorities have maintained that the trial has been a fair and transparent one. ""As per the UAE constitution and law, the Ministry of Justice stated that the court's transparency, fairness and independence were upheld, with more than 500 observers in attendance at each court hearing, including family members of the defendants, representatives of the national media"" in addition to a local rights group, the Ministry of Justice said in a statement reported by WAM. It also said those attending were ""given all judicial and administrative guarantees to carry out their activities without restrictions within the provisions of law."" Before handing down the verdicts, the judge read a statement defending the fairness of the proceedings. In the statement, also carried by the state news agency, the judge said that throughout the proceedings, the defendants were allowed to defend themselves and counter any of the evidence presented against them transparently, and the trial adjourned for the verdict only after both sides presented their cases. Many believe UAE authorities are clamping down on the freedom of expression in reaction to the Arab Spring that swept across the Middle East starting in early 2011. Unelected ruling families in oil-rich Gulf countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have sought to prevent popular uprisings. But countries such as Bahrain have also received criticism for their heavy-handed use of force. While there has been little protest in the majority Sunni and hugely wealthy UAE, some believe authorities were taking no chances.","Sixty-nine people are sentenced to prison, eight of them in absentia .

"(CNN) -- Santiago Vergini's 12th minute volley flashed past the goalkeeper to open the scoring in the English Premier League match at St Mary's between Southampton and Sunderland. The only problem for Sunderland's Argentine defender was that his perfectly struck effort found his own net. It was to get worse for the Black Cats and manager Gus Poyet and by the end of the afternoon keeper Vito Mannone had been beaten eight times with no reply from the visitors. The 8-0 reverse was one short of the record defeat in the EPL, Manchester United's 9-0 rout of Ipswich in 1995 and left Poyet perplexed. ""I've never felt as bad on a football pitch, as a player or as a coach, as I do today. Even as a fan I've never felt this way, it's embarrassing and unacceptable, I'm really hurt.,"" the Uruguayan told Sunderland's official website. Ironically, Sunderland had started brightly until Vergini's attempted clearance whistled past Mannone, Poyet left baffled by the freak nature of the own goal. ""We started off well, we were aggressive -- we passed the ball well and then we conceded one of the most difficult goals to try and explain,"" he added. Vergini was also at fault as he allowed Steven Davis to break clear and cross for Graziano Pelle to tap in from close range for the second. It was the start of a capitulation and by end of the match new Italian international Pelle had scored twice, there was another own goal from Liam Bridcutt and Saints summer signing Dusan Tadic had set up four more and also got on the score sheet himself. The victory leaves Ronald Koeman's team in third with seven wins in eight in all competitions. Dutchman Koeman was named EPL manager of the month ahead of the match but Sunderland has just a single win and hover above the drop zone. Chelsea stays top . Chelsea remains top after a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace with Oscar and Cesc Fabregas scoring early in each half before Fraizer Campbell pulled one back in added time at the end of the match. Both teams ended with 10 men after having men sent off late in the first half, Cesar Azpilicueta for Chelsea and Damien Delaney for the home side. Champion Manchester City is five points adrift in second spot after a 4-1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur in another extraordinary encounter. Sergio Aguero scored all four goals for City but also missed one of the four penalties awarded by referee Jonathan Moss. City were leading 2-1 when Roberto Soldado saw his effort from the spot for the visitors saved by Joe Hart and it proved a turning point. Aguero was pulled back by Federico Fazio, making his debut for Spurs, with the Argentine shown red. Aguero duly scored from the penalty and then rounded off the afternoon by beating Hugo Lloris for his fourth. Bayern hits six . The goals also flowed in the Bundesliga with reigning champion Bayern Munich leading the way in a 6-0 rout of bottom side Werder Bremen. Defender Philipp Lahm started the scoring and later hit a second, his first double for the Bavarian giants in 321 top-flight games. A packed Allianz Arena also saw Xabi Alonso net his first for his new club, with Mario Gotze (2) and Thomas Muller also on target. It left Bayern on 20 points from eight games, four clear of Borussia Moenchengladbach, who won 3-0 at Hanover. But Bayern's traditional rival Borussia Dortmund went down 2-1 defeat at Cologne and trail the leaders by 13 points. Ronaldo double . European champion Real Madrid also recorded a one-sided victory over Levante, Cristiano Ronaldo scoring twice in a 5-0 romp. The first from the penalty spot set Real on its way in the Bernabeu before Javier Hernandez headed home to double the lead before half-time. Ronaldo notched his 15th La Liga goal in just seven appearances this season to make it 3-0 before summer signing James Rodriguez and Isco completed a seventh straight win for Real. It leaves them four points adrift of Barcelona, who beat minnows Eibar in a later kickoff Saturday. It took an hour for Barca to break through in the Nou Camp with Xavi on target after being set up by Lionel Messi. Neymar scored the second with Messi completing the scoring with his 250th goal in La Liga. He is now just one shy of the all-time record by former Athletic Bilbao forward Telmo Zarra.","Southampton thrashes Sunderland 8-0 in the English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Israel's military said Tuesday it shot down a Syrian warplane over the Golan Heights amid what it described as growing tensions in the border area. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the plane ""was identified while attempting to infiltrate Israeli airspace in the Golan Heights."" Israel used a Patriot anti-aircraft missile to bring it down, the IDF said. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the aircraft shot down was a Russian-made Sukhoi-24 and that both the pilot and co-pilot ejected into Syria. The plane penetrated roughly a kilometer (more than half a mile) into Israeli airspace, he said. Syrian state TV also reported that Israeli forces had shot down a Syrian warplane. Defense Minister: We will act strongly . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, said the Syrian fighter jet was targeting the countryside around the Syrian town of Quneitra, where the only border crossing between Israel and Syria is located. Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area, the group said. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the Syrian fighter jet ""came close to Israeli territory on the Golan Heights in a threatening manner, and even crossed the border line."" He said Israel would use whatever means were necessary to protect its citizens. ""We have made it clear, and we are making it clear now as well: We will not allow any factor be it a country or a terror organization, to threaten our security and violate our sovereignty. We will act strongly against all attempts even if it is a mistake or intentional."" Border area called 'Highly unstable' An IDF statement posted online said the Israel-Syria border had been ""highly unstable"" in recent months. ""As the civil war rages in Syria, IDF forces have experienced combat in the region, both from targeted strikes and errant fire,"" it said. The incident came as the United States and a number of Arab allies began bombing ISIS targets in the Syrian town of Raqqa, far to the northeast. U.N. forces withdrew last week from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, a little more than two weeks after Islamic militant fighters took some peacekeepers hostage and besieged others. Al-Nusra Front freed 45 U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji in good condition earlier this month, while forces from the Philippines escaped after exchanging fire with militant fighters, according to media reports. The incidents occurred after Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing in Quneitra in late August. Golan Heights: Making wine in the shadow of war .

"New York (CNN)  -- Leslie Buck, designer of New York City's iconic blue-and-white coffee cup, died Monday at home in Glen Cove, New York. He was 87 years old. Before there was a Starbucks on every corner, New Yorkers would stop into one of the city's many Greek-owned diners for their morning caffeine. They would most likely exit clutching Buck's famous ""Anthora Cup"" filled with steaming coffee. The cup has made appearances in New York City TV shows and movies, from ""Law and Order"", to Al Pacino's 1989 film ""Sea of Love."" One of Buck's daughters, Beverly Eisenoff, remembers sitting in the movie theater when she saw the cup stretched across the screen, ""That's my dad's cup!"" she yelled. Angie Gorman, Director of Communications at Solo Cup Co., told CNN that Solo now owns Sherri Cup Co., where Buck first designed the cup in the early 1960s. The cup can still be custom ordered, but demand for the cup tapered off in the new century and Solo decided to officially discontinue the product from its catalog in 2006. Born Laszlo Büch in present-day Ukraine in 1922, Buck arrived in America a refugee of Nazi Germany after World War II. He lost his parents to the Nazis, but he survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald. His daughter describes him as a self-made man, ""He came here with nothing, no parents, no job, no savings. He had nothing."" But that didn't stop him. ""Because of what he suffered in the concentration camps he was somebody who really believed in respecting humanity, really was about loving your neighbor and respecting your neighbor,"" his daughter said. It was this respect that led him to spend hours in the library, researching Greek history and design. He wanted to honor the heritage of the Greek diner owners who bought his products and gave him his livelihood. His design features three steaming golden cups of coffee, and the essential phrase 'We are happy to serve you"" bordered by two Greek Amphora vases. Buck's children say his Eastern European accent transformed ""Amphora"" to ""Anthora,"" and that's how it's known today. When Buck retired in 1992, the company printed 10,000 cups for him and his family with a slight change. The cups said, ""It was our pleasure to serve you,"" as a farewell to the man who left his mark on the city that never sleeps. When talking with CNN about the outpouring of attention and affection for her father following his death, Eisenoff described her father as incredibly humble, and impossible to buy presents for. ""New York became his home when he left his home,"" she says. ""This is the best present to give my father. What he did his whole life matters to the city that became his home."" Leslie Buck is survived by his wife, Ella, Eisenoff and another daughter, Linda Rush, his son Robert, his brother Eugene and four grandchildren.","Leslie Buck, designer of New York's iconic blue- and-white coffee cup, has died .

"Alpharetta, Georgia (CNN) -- A disease that Mackenzie Bearup compares to a bomb going off in her knee prompted the 16-year-old to seek escape in the comfort of reading. Now she's helping thousands of troubled children soothe their own pain -- within the pages of donated books. ""When I read, it's a real escape,"" Bearup says. ""I try to take myself into the book instead of in the real world where I'm in so much pain."" Her personal discovery that books could be used to ease discomfort was an idea that Bearup ultimately chose to share with homeless and abused children throughout the country. Bearup's journey began six years ago when she was jumping on a bed and dancing to TV's ""American Idol."" Suddenly her knee started ""hurting unexplainably, extremely bad,"" she recalls. The next day, the fifth grader's knee swelled to the size of a grapefruit. After a week on crutches, it was even worse. Her knee collapsed when she tried to walk. After a series of misdiagnoses, doctors later diagnosed Bearup with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, also called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. The disease causes the nerves and blood vessels in the affected area to tell the brain ""that the injury is still there,"" says Dr. James Yost, Bearup's pain-management physician. There is no cure, Yost said. From 200,000 to 1.2 million people have RSD, ranging from mild to severe, according to the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association Web site. ""The kind of pain I feel is very hard to describe,"" Bearup says. ""It will explode at random times [and] when something touches it, it's like I'm getting stabbed multiple times."" Medications and treatments failed to alleviate the constant pain in Bearup's knee. At some points, the extreme discomfort forced her to remain in bed for months, unable to walk. The only thing that took her mind off the pain, she says, was reading. So when her pediatrician told her about kids living in nearby Murphy-Harpst Children's Center in Cedartown -- a residential treatment center for Georgia's most severely abused children -- Bearup had an idea. ""I think any child being in horrible, intense pain like this, they need something. And something that I knew that helped me was books."" She learned that the center had just built a library, but had no books to fill it with. ""I asked everyone I knew to donate books, and then I asked them to tell their friends,"" said Bearup, who spread the word further by stuffing flyers inside mailboxes, placing ads in newspapers, and launching a Web site. Bearup's goal was to donate 300 books, but she soon had 3,000. Once the library at Murphy-Harpst reached capacity, Bearup turned her attention to other places -- providing reading material to youngsters in homeless and domestic violence shelters, children's homes and treatment centers.    How to nominate a CNN Hero . ""Reading isn't just an escape, you can learn a lot, too, and that's very important for homeless and abused children,"" said Bearup. ""Staying in high school is one of the things that will help you most in life, to be able to get a job and be able to support yourself."" Since 2007, Bearup has collected and donated more than 38,000 books for homeless and abused children in six states. With her mother's help, the teenager launched her official nonprofit -- Sheltering Books -- in 2009. Although donations are readily accepted, Bearup and her mom scour garage sales in the suburban Atlanta area to collect books. With the help of her brothers -- Alex, 14, and Benjamin, 11 -- Bearup sorts the books into categories, such as age, gender and interest, and delivers them to shelters. She's so far donated books for libraries and reading rooms in 27 different shelters. ""Sometimes a child will tell me how much they liked a book from a library I've helped to create and it really makes me happy,"" says Bearup. ""I try to suggest books that kids will like. And sometimes, when I meet a 10-year-old girl, I'll suggest she check out the books I liked when I was her age."" To help further encourage reading, Bearup developed a pamphlet that suggests reading programs for groups, such as crafts based on books and family bonding through reading. While Bearup still lives with constant pain, she says she feels better helping others. ""If one homeless or abused child finds a love of reading through books that I've given them, then that will help them in school and just turn their life around entirely,"" she said. ""I really think that reading can do that for someone.""  Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Cycling can be the cruelest of sports and just when New Zealand's Jack Bauer was ready to celebrate a Tour de France stage win it was snatched away from him in an instant. Out in front of the peloton for over 200km, Bauer was desperately holding on to his lead as he approached the finishing line in Nimes only for Alexander Kristoff of Norway to lead a surging group of sprinters past him. Kristoff took the victory, Bauer could only finish 10th and with tears in his eyes. The Garmin-Sharp rider had been in the breakaway with Swiss champion Martin Elmiger and on the run from Tallard built a lead of over eight minutes. But slowly it was whittled away and with a kilometer to go was down to just over 10 seconds. Bauer was the stronger of the duo and made his run for the finish to be denied by Katusha fast man Kristoff, who was claiming his second stage win of the 2014 Tour. Race leader Vincenzo Nibali retained his four minutes 37 second advantage over Alejandro Valverde after an uneventful stage for the yellow jersey contenders following two days in the Alps. It left the way clear for the sprinters but Bauer looked set to spoil their day with his gallant but in the end fruitless effort. ""It's just bitter, bitter disappointment,"" he told the official Tour de France website. ""It's a childhood dream to win a stage of the Tour and for a domestique, like myself, I'm normally working for others. ""This was my first chance to be up the road and with the chance in the wind and the weather, me and Martin realized we had a chance for the win. ""I faked to be tired but felt I had more punch left. I left it until 400. I thought I had it but then I realized in the last 50m that I had nothing. German Heinrich Haussler finished second behind Kristoff, with green jersey holder Peter Sagan in third. Monday is a rest day as the contenders take stock ahead of the challenge of the Pyrenees and the only time trial of the race which may well decide the podium positions.","Alexander Kristoff wins 15th stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- If the 21st century belongs to China, as some have argued, then it is worth asking what the defining Chinese idea will be. It is unsurprising that this very issue has ginned up ferocious debate within China, as the country's might grows but its voice remains meek on the global stage. Economic success alone has yet to evince a self-assured China that it can offer a set of compelling values and ideas to the world. As a country that prides itself on the continuity of its great civilization and cultural force, China seems to grow increasingly dissatisfied with punching below its weight in the world of ideas. Indeed, much of the 20th century was defined by the rise of the United States and the dominance of the American idea: It was essentially an articulation of what modernity means. To be modern meant widespread economic prosperity, a healthy middle class, and technological superiority, combined with values that emphasized individual rights and freedoms to pursue whatever lives, liberties, and happiness that one sought. It was a manifestation of the ideals that were enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, a document that, at the young nation's inception, defined what kind of country the United States ought to strive for. In many ways, the country was born out of a few central ideas because its existence could not be predicated on strong ethnic kinships, bloodlines, or the old monarchical order. It was not the ""Old World"" but a new nation that was moving toward collective ideals. The belief in the very idea of America was the strongest glue that could bind together a diverse, continental nation. That cohesive idea has anchored the ""American Dream"" and provided ballast for themes that are readily found in Hollywood and other popular culture products that pervade the global market. Whether by design or accidental, the genius of the American idea is that it is simply an open source template, or a ""default setting,"" that can be easily replicated and customized in different cultural and institutional environments. Its power and universalizing appeal is apparent. Little wonder that the American idea gained immense market share and is still widely equated with the general aspiration of obtaining a high living standard and human dignity. China, in contrast, is both of the old world and a young republic -- or as scholar Lucian Pye once rendered it, ""a civilization pretending to be a nation-state."" And its transition into a modern state has been anything but smooth. The modern Chinese state was forged from a nasty civil war, and its recent history since 1949 has been plagued by a series of highly disruptive discontinuities. It has had no continuous narrative from which to draw inspiration and to define the soul of a nation. In fact, the People's Republic under Mao Zedong primarily defined itself as what it is not -- that is, it wasn't feudal or traditional. For the next six decades, the country lurched from devastating revolution to hyper materialism, breaking with whatever ideological milieu that had existed at the time. When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, the only ""ism"" that mattered was pragmatism, as the country went to work on nation building and zeroed in on material prosperity. Thirty-five years and several trillions worth of GDP later, an entire generation of Chinese is waking up to the fact that it still has little idea of what kind of nation to strive for. All this relentless work has built a dynamic middle-income economy, yet cumulative wealth is no substitute for the richness of a nation, especially for a China that believes it has much to offer the world. After all, this is a country that once brought the world paper, gunpowder, and the compass. Virtually every Chinese school child knows that. But few Chinese know or agree on what China should stand for in the 21st century. It is clearly a global economic power, but unlike the United States, China seems to have little desire to stake out social and political values that others might adopt. The Chinese government, which tightly controls historical narratives, simply cannot look into its recent past to seek out those values because even communism is derived from a Western political philosophy appropriated for Chinese conditions. And politically, it could be potentially disastrous if the government owned up to all the dark chapters in its recent past. It seems that China has little choice but to look to its distant past in search of a continuous narrative and an indigenous idea that can carry the nation forward in the 21st Century. The new leadership of the Communist Party, particularly President Xi Jinping, has prioritized this effort because it understands that a major source of its political power is derived from ideological legitimacy. To keep a continental nation together, China, too, needs a ruling party to govern around a set of ideas so that its people can imagine what the country can and should become. And so the ""great rejuvenation"" of the Chinese nation has become the new ideological offering -- an explicit effort to connect today's China to the glories of a former empire that sat at the center of the world. It revives the traditional ideas of wealth and power that have defined the country through much of its history. The Chinese leadership is leaving little doubt that China will once again be a global force that garners respect. Yet it is far from clear what a rejuvenated China means or how that force might be employed. Reestablishing ""national greatness"" may win over some of the Chinese public, but it hardly serves as an idea or value proposition that can extend beyond Chinese borders. Each nation is entitled to deem itself unique, exceptional, and ""great"" -- the United States certainly does. But some nations also use their wealth and power to articulate a vision of how to shape the world and aspire to address common challenges. The tagline for a U.S. Navy advertisement, for example, is ""a global force for good."" China, at least so far, has exhibited little interest in becoming a charge d'affaires with world-shaping responsibilities, even as outside pressures mount for it to assume them. Indeed, it may simply be comfortable with being just China -- an idea that the rest of the world may have to get used to. Read more: Xi Jinping's 2014 challenge: Resolving an identity crisis?

"(CNN) -- What do you get when you combine gorillas, Leonard DiCaprio and Netflix? A hit, the media company hopes. Netflix announced Friday that it will team up with DiCaprio -- who it described as a ""an actor, producer and philanthropist"" -- to distribute a documentary film entitled ""VIRUNGA,"" about the quest to save endangered mountain gorillas in the eastern Congo park by that name. ""With VIRUNGA, we'll work with Leo to introduce viewers around the world to an incredible, gripping story that will have audiences guessing right up until the final act,"" said Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer. The fact Netflix is getting behind a high-profile production is nothing new. After all, it has produced the critically acclaimed series ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black,"" not to mention the reboot of ""Arrested Development."" But what makes this unique is that it's a film, not a series, and it will come out in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on November 7. That's the same day ""VIRUNGA,"" which is directed by Orlando von Einsiedel, will roll out on Netflix as well. According to its website, the film chronicles how a ""a small and embattled team of park rangers -- including an ex-child soldier turned ranger, a carer of orphan gorillas and a Belgian conservationist -- protect (Virunga National Park) from armed militia, poachers and the dark forces struggling to control Congo's rich natural resources."" ""VIRUNGA"" hasn't been distributed widely, but it has racked up a number of awards from the likes of the Tribeca Film Festival, DOXA and American Film Institute. DiCaprio, its executive producer, called the partnership with Netflix ""an exciting opportunity to inform and inspire individuals to engage on this topic."" ""Films like VIRUNGA are powerful stories that are a window into the incredible cultural and natural diversity of our world, the forces that are threatening to destroy it, and the people who are fighting to protect it,"" the actor added. Mountain gorillas are a subspecies of the eastern gorilla discovered in 1902 and imperiled in recent days by war, hunting, disease and other threats. There are a little less than 800 of them in the wild now, according to the World Wildlife Fund, about half of those in the Virunga Mountains bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. A child actor who broke through on the sitcom ""Growing Pains"" and became an international sensation after the film ""Titanic,"" DiCaprio is one of Hollywood's most respected and bankable actors. From the 1990s through today, he has starred in such films as ""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Catch Me If You Can"" and more recently ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" He has also developed a reputation, and tried to break ground, outside the cinematic world.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Talking about how much you earn is kind of like talking about how much you weigh. Both are uncomfortable subjects, so you might not always be 100 percent honest about either. (Who hasn't shaved 10 pounds off their physique or upped their salary by a few thousand dollars when hanging with their rich and skinny friends?) Most of the time, these little white lies are no big deal -- it's not as if your friends are going to ask you get on a scale to verify your weight. However, while telling an occasional fib in daily conversation may be a minor offense, lying about your salary history on a job application can be a serious transgression. ""Unlike many soft skills, salaries are finite, concrete numbers that can be verified through things like a W2, 1099 [or] tax return,"" says Paul Peterson, national talent resource manager for Grant Thornton, a management consulting firm. That means that if you lie about your salary history on your résumé, there's a good chance that your potential employer will find out. Careerbuilder.com: 7 questions not to ask . ""If someone goes to extremes to embellish a salary prior to getting the job, one has to ask, 'What will they embellish when they are actually performing the job?'"" Peterson says. Though it's true that not all employers conduct background checks or delve as deep as checking a candidate's W2 forms, salary information can easily be verified through your references -- which most employers do check. ""Salary is one of the very few things that former employers are often willing to reveal in a reference check,"" says Barry Maher, author of ""Filling the Glass: The Skeptic's Guide to Positive Thinking in Business."" ""Even if they won't give the exact amount, a question like, 'If I placed his salary range with you in the area of $100,000 would I be in the ballpark?' usually yields the information."" Bottom line? ""Lying about anything as part of a job search strategy is not a good idea,"" says Elaine Varelas, managing partner at Keystone Partners, a recruitment firm. ""Starting a relationship with a company based on false pretenses may not hurt you in the short term, but chances are you will be exposed."" Careerbuilder.com: 5 ways to rehab your resume . Yet what about job seekers who think they were underpaid at their last job? Should they continue to settle for less money than they think they're worth, just to avoid embellishing their salary history? Not necessarily, say our experts. There are plenty of ways to get the salary you deserve without lying on a job application. Here, they offer three ways to broach the subject of salary increase with a potential employer: . 1. ""If you're looking to make a significant jump in salary, my advice to people is to convince the potential employer why you are worth what you are seeking and, where possible, quantify that number,"" Peterson says. 2. ""It's perfectly acceptable to say something like 'I'm making $80,000 now. And though my present employer would certainly agree that I'm worth more, the simple fact is ...' then give the reason, [whether it be] a salary freeze, budget constraints, tough times in that industry, whatever. [Then continue with] 'Since the industry standard for someone with my skills and experience is $120,000, that's one of the reasons I'm looking to move on,'"" Maher says. Careerbuilder.com: Great employee? Or you just think you are? 3. ""When you are asked about compensation, you can say: 'I was making in the mid-$70s, which included a 20 percent performance bonus, which I always got, and a very comprehensive benefits package.' Then ask, 'What is the compensation range for this position?' Using this technique allows you flexibility and gets the employer to share compensation data. Be prepared to negotiate only after an offer has been made,"" Varelas advises. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- The ""Fab Five"" got off to a strong start Tuesday, and it led to a golden finish. The U.S. women's gymnastics team won its second gold medal ever, living up to its pre-tournament billing, which included a Sports Illustrated cover for the Olympic darlings. Gabby Douglas led the U.S. to a 183.596 score, while Russia finished second with 178.503. Jordyn Wieber was a key part of the victory also, placing third in the vault and fourth on the floor. ""I'm so proud of these girls. We did awesome,"" said Douglas, who competed on all four apparatus. ""A lot of hard work and sacrifice in the gym, and it all pays off."" Wieber, who didn't qualify for the individual all-around competition because Olympic rules limit the entrants to two per team, said it was a team win. ""This couldn't be possible without everyone stepping up today,"" she said."" Everyone did their job and was completely amazing. I am so excited."" The U.S. had the highest score in three of the four events, including the vault, which it did first. McKayla Maroney scored a meet-high 16.233 to lead the Americans. Team USA had a two-point lead going into the final event -- the floor exercise -- over the Russians, but both Anastasia Grishina and Kseniia Afanaseva botched their routines, . Afterward, there were tears for both teams. ""Well, I think the first tears were of disappointment, but the second were tears of joy,"" Afanaseva said. Wieber, the world champion in the individual all around, said: ""It was just tears of happiness. I really did just go out there and made the most of my Olympics and I'm happy I ended on this note."" Members of the Chinese team were crying, too, after a fourth-place finish. Except one member. When asked why she wasn't weeping, Lu Sui responded, """"Because the rest of the team is crying, and besides, if I cry, I will mess up my make-up."" Members of the U.S. team said they were unaware of the purported curse that goes with being on the cover of Sports Illustrated. ""I was never aware of it. Kyla was told about it in an interview. I don't believe in that,"" said Aly Raisman. ""We worked really hard to get here."" At the pool, Americans were also collecting gold medals, including one that made Olympics history. Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian ever, setting a record with his 19th medal after anchoring the U.S. men's 4x200-meter freestyle team to gold. The crowd at London's Aquatic Centre rose to its feet as Phelps churned home, well ahead of France's Yannick Agnel. ""I've been in a huddle with them (his teammates in the relay) because they made it possible,"" Phelps said. ""If I didn't get a big enough lead then who knows what would have happened."" With the gold, Phelps broke a brief tie with Larisa Latynina, a Soviet gymnast who won18 total medals from 1956 to 1964. Phelps now has 15 gold, two silver and two bronze medals spanning four Olympics. An hour earlier, Phelps was a dejected silver medalist. SI analysis: Three thoughts from the swimming finals . Phelps led his signature race, the 200-meter butterfly. from the start until the last few meters, appearing to be ready to become the first man to win an individual event in three consecutive Olympics. But just as Phelps glided into the finish, South African Chad le Clos, a 20-year-old whose idol was swimming in the lane right next to him, cranked one last big stroke to edge his hero Phelps at the wall. It reminded swimming commentators of Phelps' 100-meter butterfly win at the Beijing Games when he took a quick final stroke as Serbian Milorad Cavic stretched for the wall. This time it was Phelps who was caught reaching. After the race, the shocked Phelps put his face in his hands. It was only later, on the medal stand when he broke into a big smile. ""It was my last one and I would have liked to have won,"" he said. American Allison Schmitt won the women's 200-meter freestyle in Olympic record time. Michael Phelps: ""I consider myself normal"" Chinese swimmer Shiwen Ye won her second gold medal, taking the women's 200 individual medley in Olympic record time. The performances of the 16-year-old have resulted in some wondering out loud about possible doping. ""I just train well and perform well and keep on going,"" she said. ""I think that was a little bit unfair for me, but it didn't affect me. Other swimmers have won multiple golds, how come they criticize me?"" History had already been made once at the Olympics on Tuesday when Queen Elizabeth's equestrian granddaughter Zara Phillips put her name in the record books earlier in the day by becoming the first member of the British royal family to win an Olympic medal. She claimed a silver as part of the British eventing team. Her mother, Princess Anne, a 1976 Olympic equestrian, draped the medal around her neck. Another British Olympian, Tom Daley, was in the news for a less happy reason as police arrested a 17-year-old accused of abusing the teen diver in comments on Twitter. After his day on the tennis court, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France needed some sleep. He beat Milos Raonic in three sets, but the score of the final stanza was 25-23. ""For me it's good because this is the only way, you know, to write my name in history for the moment,"" he said. ""With Rafa (Nadal), Roger (Federer) and Novak (Djokovic), even Andy (Roddick), you know, it's tough to go through big tournaments. So ... I'm really happy.

"(CNN) -- AS Roma became the first Italian soccer club to be owned by foreign investors on Saturday when an American group completed its takeover of the Serie A side. The consortium is headed by Thomas DiBenedetto, a partner of the New England Sports Ventures group which owns English club Liverpool and U.S. baseball team the Boston Red Sox. He and his cohorts will have a 60% stake, with the remainder held by Italy-based European banking organization UniCredit -- which bought the club when president Rosella Sensi last year decided she wanted to sell up. ""The business aspect has been very important but I love Rome and I want to do something big for this city,"" Thomas DiBenedetto told reporters in quotes carried by the UK Press Association. ""I am proud of my Italian origins and for this reason I will do big things. I didn't expect so much attention. ""I knew of the great passion from the Romans and this has been one of the reasons for doing this. ""I share this passion. I never played but my father played in the American Soccer League."" Founded in 1927, the club -- nicknamed ""Giallorossi"" (The Yellow-Reds) after the team colors -- has been listed on the stock exchange since 2000. Its website lists its share capital as almost €20 million ($28.9 million). The Sensi family had been owners for 18 years, and in 2009 announced plans to move away from the Stadio Olimpico and build a new 55,000-capacity ground in the western suburbs of Rome which have yet to come to fruition. Buoyed by the news, Roma went in Saturday's home match against Palermo in sixth place in the table, 12 points behind leaders AC Milan with six rounds to play. But it ended in a defeat that dented the team's European hopes for next season despite the Wolves taking a 19th-minute lead through the club's veteran top scorer Francesco Totti, with the captain netting from the penalty spot. However, Maurizio Pinilla leveled just before halftime also from a penalty after he was fouled, and 20-year-old Uruguayan striker Abel Hernandez scored twice in the last seven minutes before Mirko Vucinic's late consolation for Roma. AC Milan moved six points clear at the top with a 3-0 victory at home to 17th-placed Sampdoria later in the evening. Veteran Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf opened the scoring in the 20th minute with a freekick driven across the goal into the bottom corner, striker Antonio Cassano netted a penalty nine minutes after halftime and Brazil forward Robinho sealed it on 61. Sampdoria will drop into the bottom three if Cesena beat bottom club Bari on Sunday, or Brescia win at Genoa. Napoli can reduce the deficit to three again by winning at home to fifth-placed Udinese on Sunday, after which there will be five rounds to play. Third-placed defending champions Inter Milan dropped eight points behind their arch-rivals after a 2-0 loss at lowly Parma, who moved four points clear of the relegation zone. Sebastian Giovinco put Parma ahead in the 36th minute and Amauri -- another striker on loan from Juventus -- made it safe with four minutes to play. It capped a miserable week for Inter, whose European Champions League title defense ended with a 7-3 aggregate quarterfinal defeat against Schalke.","U.S. group becomes first foreign owner of an Italian football club, buying out Roma .

"(CNN) -- About nine years ago I flew Ryanair from London to a town called Maastricht in the southernmost, dangly, uvula-looking part of The Netherlands. I don't remember how much my flight actually cost, but I promise you I've spent more this week alone in the candy machine at work. Truth be told, I've completely lost all self-control. They keep stocking it with Swedish Fish, and now HR has had to warn me three times about borking in the break room. ""Bork! Bork! Bork!"" ""Red light, Jarrett."" Anyway, my flight on Ryanair is relevant only in that I have firsthand experience flying with the famous low-cost European carrier whose CEO, Michael O'Leary, started trending on the Web this week after he proclaimed that seat belts on planes ""don't matter."" O'Leary told the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper that ""If there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seat belt won't save you."" And he's probably right. When a giant metal tube going 500 mph slams into the side of a mountain, several inches of fabric and a spring-loaded metal clamp aren't going to let you simply walk away feeling like it was all just a minor inconvenience. ""Excuse me, captain. THIS isn't Denver."" But as everyone knows, saving you from a mountain crash isn't really the point of seat belts. They're primarily for turbulence, so that when you hit a patch of rough air halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh, you don't end up face deep in row 32 with a Biscoff cookie firmly lodged in your skull. O'Leary's argument against the importance of seat belts stems from his ultimate goal to create ""standing room only"" cabins for ultra-budget travelers who, we can only presume, would have to uncomfortably mingle in the back with the chickens and other livestock. In 2003, when I flew Ryanair from London, I was definitely that ultra-budget (i.e. cheap) traveler. At the time I was doing the whole European backpacker thing. I'd like to say I was out there trying to find myself, sucking the marrow out of life, but, really, I was too busy hitting ineffectively on Australian girls and looking at cathedrals ... and cathedrals .... and cathedrals. Of course, money was tight, so Ryanair was a welcome resource when trying to fly over to mainland Europe from the UK. Basically, I was then exactly who O'Leary wants to target with these seats now. To make this dream a reality, he even suggests that his airline, perhaps, remove the back 10 rows to accommodate people willing to stand for a couple hours for as little as Â£1. O'Leary told the Telegraph, ""If you say to passengers it's Â£25 for the seat and Â£1 for the standing cabin, I guarantee we will sell the standing cabin first."" In a lot of ways, it's like paying for the worst section in the bleachers at an undersold baseball game here in the United States. Many people don't actually care where they sit. They just want to be inside the park to drink beer, soak in the sun, and maybe heckle the opposing center fielder. ""Hey, Granderson! You wear rubber pants!"" ""Dude, what does that even mean?"" ""I have no idea."" But, really, the argument over his plan's merit is a completely pointless conversation since it's probably never going to happen. European safety laws require that passengers wear a seat belt for takeoff and landing. O'Leary responded to these pesky regulations by calling the authorities a bunch of ""plonkers."" So, for comedy alone, you gotta love this O'Leary guy! And at least he's being creative -- if not possibly reckless -- about the future of his industry. His safety argument is that standing passengers could treat the experience just like riding public transportation on terra firma, grabbing onto hanging straps when things get bumpy. He notes that, for 50 years flying has been ""populated by people who think it's this wondrous sexual experience; that it's like James Bond and wonderful and we'll all be flying first class when really it's just a bloody bus with wings."" He's right. It is. Though, personally, I hate everything about flying in the first place, and I've never actually thought of it as a wondrous sexual experience, save for the beginning of every flight, during that singular breathtaking moment in the Delta safety video when their sultry flight attendant softly wags her finger and playfully reminds me that I'm not allowed to smoke. Oh, you know what I'm talking about. Bork! Bork! Bork!","CEO of Ryanair suggests adding a cheap ""standing room"" section on planes .

"(CNN) -- If you're the kind of gal whose ""me time"" includes a glass or two of wine after work, you might want to consider how those drinks could affect your looks. That's part of the message of the Scottish government's Drop a Glass Size Campaign, which specifically ""encourages women to think about the health effects of regularly drinking above the recommended alcohol guidelines."" Now there's a mobile app that aims to drive that point home on a more personal level. This week, the campaign rolled out its ""Drinking Mirror"" app, which lets users upload photos of themselves to show how their faces could age if they keep imbibing at their current rate. The app is available only for Android-powered devices, although government spokeswoman said an iPhone version will be out shortly. A Web version is also available. The campaign's Drink Smarter website shows a picture of a woman to demonstrate how the drinking mirror works, along with a warning that ""deeper wrinkles, red cheeks and weight gain"" are just some of the visible effects of regular heavy drinking. Overall, the campaign aims to make people aware of the fine line between social drinking and drinking too much, especially when people drink in the home. Men are not excluded from the conversation. A page devoted to ""drinking like a man"" warns that men who have more than five drinks a day are twice as likely to die of a stroke, and that having a beer belly can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea and cancer. Men and women can use the app by uploading or taking photos of themselves and entering data about their drinking habits. Then, to show the potential long-term physical toll of drinking, the app shows them a photo of how they might look in 10 years at their current rate of alcohol consumption. Even though the campaign states that ""men drink more on average than women"" and ""suffer more ill effects as a result,"" it's targeted to women in an effort to play on their vanity, said a Scottish government spokeswoman who asked not to be named. ""In Scotland, we have a troubled relationship with alcohol,"" she said. ""We're focusing on women to try a different approach."" Past government campaigns in Scotland have targeted both genders, but research shows that women in particular ""are often unaware or slightly confused about what sensible drinking guidelines are,"" she said. The number of alcohol-related deaths among women aged 30 to 44 has doubled in the last 20 years, although numbers remain relatively small (70 deaths in 2010), according to statistics from the General Register Office for Scotland. ""With any public health campaign, it's crucial to target it to specific demographic. It can be an age group, a gender or people with specific risk factors,"" said health writer and body image expert Leslie Goldman, who has a master's in public health from the University of Illinois-Chicago. ""If Scotland is having issues with more and more women engaging in unhealthy drinking then I think it's a smart idea to target that population."" She pointed out that men and women can use the app and that the Drink Smarter website offers information and resources for both genders. So how much booze is too much? On a daily basis, it's more than two to three drinks (about a 175 ml glass of 13% wine) for women and three to four drinks (equivalent to a pint and a half of 4% beer) for men. About 38% of Scottish women and 49% of men exceed the daily recommended limit each week, according to government statistics. ""Women don't really accept that the amount of alcohol they're drinking is excessive,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Women are very receptive when you talk about calories in a glass of wine, and people don't always make the association between alcohol and calories.""

"(CNN) -- Should a convicted rapist, who has served their time in prison, be allowed to resume their old job? What if that job was as a high-profile football player? In the early hours of Friday, Ched Evans was released from a British prison -- a Category C facility for sex offenders -- after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room. A blacked-out silver Mercedes 4x4 apparently whisked him out of sight of the waiting photographers before dawn had even broken. In another life, photographers had trained their lenses on the 25-year-old Evans for very different reasons -- he was the prized player of third-flight English league club Sheffield United, signed for Â£3 million ($4.8 million) in 2009. Three years later, that privileged existence came to an abrupt end after the Wales international striker was found guilty of rape -- a conviction he denies. He might have ""done the time,"" but not everyone believes Evans should be allowed to tie up his bootlaces and start scoring goals again, with almost 150,000 people signing a petition against his return to the League One team. ""A lot of the backlash has been over the fact that he's not accepted his guilt, despite having served his sentence,"" lawyer and Football Association agent, Shehneela Ahmed, told CNN. ""But where does it say that a convicted criminal, who has served their time, cannot go out to work?"" Role model? As an elite football player earning the sort of money most people can only dream of, Evans does not have your average job. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, who is also an MP in Sheffield, said Evans' position as a role model for young boys needed to be taken into consideration by his future employers. ""He has done his time, but I just don't believe that the owners of a football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened,"" Clegg told LBC Radio. ""You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime."" Club statement . With the media furore increasing, Sheffield United took the unusual step Saturday of denying a report in an English newspaper that Evans has been offered a contract by them to play again. ""An article in The Sun today, that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the club,"" read a statement on its official website. ""We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans."" Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Women's Aid, asked what message would be sent out if Evans played for United again. ""The club has a responsibility to look at who it is hiring in high-profile positions, and consider whether a convicted rapist, who continues to protest that he's done nothing wrong and whose case has attracted widespread victim-blaming language, is someone that they want to be representing their brand,"" she told CNN. ""It's important that high profile institutions take a stand about the seriousness of rape as a crime, and do not in any way condone the blaming of victims of rape, or participate in a culture which trivializes violence against women."" Playing fair? Ahmed argued that much of the fury over Evans' possible return to football was related to footballers' relatively high earnings. ""I think people are angry because normally a lot of the criminals who are sent to prison, once they've served their sentence in relation to a heinous crime, have to start from scratch trying to get employment,"" she explained. ""But this is a young lad who has committed a crime, never admitted his guilt, and despite that, he comes out of prison and walks into a job which is so well paid."" Evans was never sacked by the Sheffield club, which instead allowed his contract to expire while he was in prison. So far, Evans has not revealed if he intends to return to football at all. Though all eyes will be watching his next move closely. Media scrutiny . They will have to wait until next week, when Evans has promised to ""make a very personal and profound statement by video,"" on his website. ""Natasha [Evans' girlfriend] and the family never asked for this media intrusion but it was thrust upon them following events of that night in Rhyl [where the incident took place], coupled with an insatiable and hungry media society,"" said Evans, referring to the northern Welsh town. ""All they have ever asked for is for the media to report fairly, help raise the concerns that there are from the vast section of society about Ched's conviction, and have a sensible debate."" He wasn't the only one apparently tormented by the media, with Neate saying the victim's life was made hell after being identified by Evans' supporters. ""Not only was the original trial covered extensively in the media, but the victim was harassed and unlawfully identified by Ched Evans' supporters, and her life has been very badly affected,"" she said. ""He has shown no remorse, and his former employer -- Sheffield United -- has not said anything to condemn the crime he committed."" What next? Sheffield United boss, Nigel Clough, has said only that he has had talks with club officials about the possibility of Evans returning, according to the BBC. But as Ahmed argues: ""If Sheffield United don't take him, what's there to say another club won't sign him? Whether it's in the UK or abroad? ""What impact could his return have on their brand? That's something Sheffield United is going to have to look into."" Ultimately Evans may have left jail, but his conviction remains, and his future remains uncertain.","Footballer Ched Evans released after serving sentence for rape .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has asked the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) to investigate alleged comments from the front runner to become its next president that referred to African players as ""banana eaters."" Reports in Italy claim Carlo Tavecchio, who is currently the organization's vice-president, made the remarks at a conference of Italy's amateur leagues at the weekend. He touched on the debate that has followed Italy's group stage exit at the recent World Cup in Brazil, with some suggesting there are too many foreign players operating in the country's top league -- Serie A. Tavecchio made reference to the system in England, which has strict rules on players from outside the European Union. ""In England, they identify the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play,"" the 71-year-old was reported to have said by Reuters. ""Here instead we get 'Opti Poba' (a fictional player) who previously ate bananas and then suddenly becomes a first team player with Lazio. ""That's how it is here. In England, you need to demonstrate what you have on your CV and your pedigree."" Tavecchio's remarks prompted one of Italy's leading clubs Fiorentina to say his bid to be FIGC president was no longer ""sustainable"" while an online campaign set up by an Italian politician asked people to protest at his candidacy. World soccer's governing body said on Tuesday it wanted the FIGC to investigate and stressed that tackling racism was one of its top priorities. Piara Powar, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE), said it was little wonder some of Italy's top clubs, and the country's prime minister Matteo Renzi, have come out against Tavecchio's presidency bid. ""It's quite clear there is a strong public opinion focus on this guy and this idea he should not become president at any cost,"" he told CNN. ""Unfortunately, the people that will vote him in later in August don't necessarily share that view. ""To have someone who has said the sort of things that he's said, said them in the way he's said them, to become a president of one of the top five footballing countries in Europe really is going to be quite a big shock."" Tavecchio has been president of the Italian amateur football federation for more than a decade and has apologized twice since he made the remarks. But he retains support from big clubs like AC Milan and is thought to be winning the battle with his rival for the presidency, former Italy midfielder Demetrio Albertini. Although his comments are not enough for FIFA or its European counterpart UEFA to block his bid, Powar thinks they may act if he is elected. ""I imagine if he gets elected in two weeks' time that FIFA and UEFA will start to lobby against him,"" Powar added. ""Because how can he look people from African nations in eye, for example, within FIFA who he has already insulted through these words? ""How can he possibly manage the national team when it has two or three black players but younger, emerging black players. ""The former FIGC president Giancarlo Abete had done a great deal to tackle racism, he was very strong and put in place some very innovative measures. ""I think the question is, where does this leave this very strong struggle, this real big problem that Italian football has had historically?"" The FIGC said they would not be commenting when contacted by CNN but FIFA made its position clear with a statement on Tuesday morning. It read: ""Media reports concerning alleged racist comments by one of the presidential candidates for the Italian FA have alerted FIFA's Task Force against racism and discrimination and its chairman Jeffrey Webb. ""As such, FIFA has written a letter to the Italian FA asking it to take the appropriate steps to investigate and decide on this matter and report to FIFA. ""In the letter, FIFA reminded the Italian FA that the fight against racism is a top priority for FIFA. ""In 2013, the FIFA Congress unanimously passed a strong resolution on the fight against racism and discrimination, which, among other measures, reminded the member associations about their obligation to put every effort into eliminating racism and discrimination in football. ""In its correspondence, FIFA also stressed that officials of the football community are expected to act as role models in the fight against racism.""","FIFA asks Italian soccer federation to investigate alleged racist remarks .

"(CNN) -- Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson said Monday that he is ""not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser."" Peterson, one of the NFL's marquee players, will practice this week and can play in Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints, despite facing a child abuse charge, team officials said. Peterson, who was kept out of Sunday's game against the New England Patriots, turned himself in to East Texas authorities Saturday, two days after an indictment alleged the 29-year-old father did ""recklessly or by criminal negligence cause bodily injury"" to his son, a felony. Peterson quickly posted $15,000 in bail and was released, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. In his first comments on the case, the reinstated NFL star told fans in a written statement posted on his Twitter feed, ""I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son."" Despite being advised by his attorney not to discuss details of the case, Peterson wrote, ""I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child."" He said that he voluntarily appeared before a grand jury and told its members the same thing, which also matches what he said he told two different police agencies about the incident. ""I will say the same thing once I have my day in court,"" he wrote. In disciplining his son in the same manner as Peterson himself was disciplined as a child, he wrote, he unintentionally caused the boy injury. He understands that there are people who disagree with this form of discipline, he said, and he has met with a psychologist who informed him of more ""appropriate"" ways to discipline children. ""But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives,"" he wrote. ""I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make."" He closed his statement by saying that while he isn't the perfect parent, he is not a child abuser. ""My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that's what I tried to do that day,"" he wrote. ""I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person."" Team stands behind its star player . General manager Rick Spielman said more information about the incident was available to the Vikings then the team had on Friday when it placed Peterson, a six-time Pro Bowler in his first seven seasons, on the inactive list. ""This is a difficult path to navigate regarding the judgment of how a parent disciplines his child,"" Spielman told reporters. ""Based on the extensive information that we have right now, and what we know about Adrian not only as a person but what he has also done for this community, we believe he deserves to play while this legal process plays out."" The developments came as CNN affilaite KHOU reported that Peterson allegedly abused another one of his children -- a 4-year-old son. Sources told KHOU that the mother of the child filed a complaint with Child Protective Services in Texas because she alleged that Peterson beat the child, while visiting his father at his Houston-area home. According to the report, text messages between Peterson and the boy's mother show that Peterson admitted disciplining the child, but he claims the child hit his head on the car seat in the process. No charges were ever filed, according to KHOU. CNN reached out CPS, but has not received a response. Through his attorney Rusty Hardin, Peterson vehemently denied the report. ""The allegation of another investigation into Adrian Peterson is simply not true. This is not a new allegation. It's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it,"" Hardin said. ""An adult witness adamantly insists Adrian did nothing inappropriate with his son."" One of the team's sponsors, the Radisson hotel chain, announced Monday night that it was suspending its ""limited sponsorship of the Minnesota Vikings while we evaluate the facts and circumstances."" Report: Photos show alleged injuries . Peterson's attorney has said his client used ""a switch to spank his son"" and was simply doling out discipline much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas."" Peterson ""will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing,"" Hardin said Friday. Photos obtained by TMZ allegedly show Peterson's son's leg covered in marks that could have come from a switch, or thin tree branch. Some of the marks in the photo appeared to have broken the skin. ""The photos are disturbing, I understand that. But to be clear, you know any matter that's involving the child is very important for this organization. But we also think that it is right for him to go through the process legally,"" Spielman said. SportsRadio 610 in Houston reported this past weekend that Peterson allegedly sent text messages to the boy's mother in Minnesota after the lashing. Peterson wrote he ""felt bad after the fact when I notice the switch was wrapping around hitting I (sic) thigh."" Another text was more graphic. ""Got him in the nuts once I noticed,"" it read, according to the CBS radio affiliate in Houston. ""But I felt so bad, n i'm all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!"" The station said a later message from Peterson was: ""Never do I go overboard! But all my kids will know, hey daddy has the biggie heart but don't play no games when it comes to acting right."" Due in court on October 8 . Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Phil Grant, whose office made the case against Peterson to a grand jury over a period of weeks, said prosecutors ""will take this charge extremely seriously and we look forward to presenting this case to a jury."" The next step is a preliminary court hearing that is scheduled for October 8. Grant said he expected Peterson to be there, although the decision is up to a judge. According to Texas law, people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury ""intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence"" or cause such harm by omission. The crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $1,000 fine. In Texas, someone can defend himself against a charge of injury to a child if he can prove it happened while he was administering ""reasonable discipline,"" Grant said. ""Obviously, parents are entitled to discipline their children as they see fit, except for when that discipline exceeds what the community would say is reasonable,"" he said. ""And so, a grand jury, having indicted this case, looked at the injuries that were inflicted upon this child and determined that that discipline was not reasonable."" As the NFL reviews the running back's actions under its personal conduct policy, the Vikings owners said they will ""monitor the situation closely."" Referring to the decision to keep Peterson out of Sunday's game, the Vikings owners, who are brothers, said, ""On Friday, we felt it was in the best interests of the organization to step back, evaluate the situation, and not rush to judgment given the seriousness of this matter. At that time, we made the decision that we felt was best for the Vikings and all parties involved."" Peterson is considered one of the best running backs in the NFL -- if not the best. His absence was probably felt during the Vikings' 30-7 loss to the Patriots on Sunday. In 2011, he agreed to a lucrative contract, which NFL.com reported would be worth $100 million over a 7-year period. Opinion: Spanking isn't parenting, it's child abuse . To spank or not to spank?

"(CNN) -- Arizona Cardinals backup running back Jonathan Dwyer was arrested in connection with domestic abuse allegations, Phoenix police said Wednesday night. The Cardinals deactivated Dwyer after news of the arrest, according to a news release from the team. CNN's calls to the office of Dwyer's agent, Adisa Bakari, weren't immediately returned. The announcement from the Phoenix Police Department said two incidents allegedly occurred on consecutive days in late July. They were reported last week. Detectives interviewed Dwyer and he ""admitted to the incidents, however, denied any physical assaults,"" the police statement said. Police said he was booked on one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage, one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault. The two victims were a 27-year-old woman and an 18-month-old child, police said. Dwyer is being held at the Maricopa County Jail. The Cardinals said they became aware of the allegations when contacted by police. Dwyer, 25, is the fourth NFL player to be in the headlines this week. Two other players, Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings and Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers, took paid leave from their teams to focus on their legal cases. Peterson has been charged in Texas with child abuse. Hardy has been convicted of misdemeanor assault charges in North Carolina and has been granted the opportunity to have a new trial, this time in front of a jury. And running back Ray Rice has an appeal with the NFL in connection with his indefinite suspension after a domestic violence incident. Dwyer is listed as the No. 2 running back for the Cardinals behind Andre Ellington. He is in his fifth NFL season and first with the Cardinals. Dwyer has 51 yards on 16 carries in two games this year.

"(CNN) -- Muhammad Ali fought here. Neil Armstrong celebrated his moonwalk here. Elvis Presley sang here. And Billie Jean King faced off against Bobby Riggs here. In its heyday, the world's first indoor stadium knew how to throw a party. And it paved the way for multi-use, publicly subsidized sports facilities getting built across the United States. Now the Houston Astrodome has hit the big time, as far as historic buildings go. The dome has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a designation announced by the National Park Service last week. The listing makes it eligible for tax breaks should the building be rehabilitated but is otherwise mostly honorary. Can a 20th-century sports stadium be a ""historic place?"" The Astrodome ""was bold and modern, and it marked the enormous ambition Houston had in the 1960's and 70's, when, thanks to air conditioning becoming cheap and plentiful, [Houston] believed there were no obstacles to its becoming one of the major cities of the world,"" wrote architecture critic Paul Goldberger, contributor to Vanity Fair, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his architecture criticism at The New York Times and author of ""Why Architecture Matters,"" via email. ""I'm all for saving sports facilities that have genuine historic and architectural value, which the Astrodome does,"" wrote Goldberger. ""Things this big aren't easy to re-use, of course, and there is no doubt that figuring out a viable future for the Astrodome is a huge challenge. But it definitely meets the standard of being a landmark."" 6 imperiled and extinct sports sites . That's why the National Trust for Historic Preservation included the stadium on its 2013 list of ""most endangered"" places, along with a military club for African-American officers, America's first permanent English settlement and an unused airline terminal. ""Many people perceive places built during living memory, or just before, differently than they do older places, and too often value them less,"" said Stephanie K. Meeks, the National Trust's president, via e-mail. ""We see more and more midcentury icons slowly fading away until demolition seems inevitable,"" said Meeks. ""We must preserve these Modernist buildings not only because they represent America's ingenuity and space-age determination, but because they challenge -- and expand -- our sense of what is worth saving in this country."" Opened in 1965 as home to the Houston Astros and the then-Houston Oilers, the Astrodome hasn't had a sports team to call its own since 1999. Used as a refuge for people fleeing Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the stadium had a sale in November to sell off Astroturf (first installed at the Astrodome and named in its honor), stadium seating and other parts. The storied stadium was the site of tennis great Billie Jean King's 1973 ""Battle of the Sexes"" with Bobby Riggs, a historic and much-hyped victory of woman over man in sports. Elvis Presley played the Astrodome in 1970, Neil Armstrong celebrated his moon mission there in 1969 and Muhammad Ali successfully defended his world heavyweight champion title against Cleveland Williams at the stadium in 1966. Preservationists are scrambling to save the stadium, which is structurally sound and significant in the world of sports -- but also a bit of a local eyesore. Local voters rejected a $217 million November bond initiative to save the county-owned stadium and turn it into a convention center. What do you think of efforts to preserve and reuse the Houston Astrodome? Should it be saved or torn down?

"(CNN) -- In 2001, the nation watched as Andrea Yates, by all accounts a loving mother, was arrested in the killings of her five children after drowning them in a bathtub. In the trial that followed, we learned she had a history of mental illness, which intensified in her postpartum periods and required four psychiatric hospitalizations. She would ultimately be found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a Texas psychiatric hospital. Her case riveted a bewildered nation for much the same reasons as the story this past weekend of Megan Huntsman, a woman in Utah who authorities say admitted to strangling or suffocating at least six of her babies, likely over a 10-year period beginning in 1996, and putting their bodies in boxes in her garage. As with Yates, intense national publicity has focused on the shock or horror of filicide -- the act of a parent killing a child. We wonder: What would cause a mother or father to do such a seemingly unnatural thing? Indeed, it's rare enough to stop us in our tracks. But the practice has existed since ancient times, and the reasons may include displeasure over the child's gender, or a disability or questionable paternity as a lack of parental resources to care for the child. Filicide has been documented in literature from all eras. Perhaps the most famous tale comes from Greek mythology --- the story of Medea, a woman who kills her sons to punish her husband for his affair. Today, roughly two-thirds of all children murdered in the United States under the age of 5 between 1980 and 2008 were killed by a parent, more specifically 33% were killed by their fathers and 30% by their mothers. We cannot know what was behind the deaths of Huntsman's infants, but research may offer at least broad motivations. Forensic psychiatrist Phillip J. Resnick, a pioneer in the field of filicide research, published a seminal article in 1969 identifying five major reasons for filicide based on the motive of the perpetrator: . 1. Altruism: The parent kills the child because he or she may perceive it to be in the child's best interest. It may be reality-based (e.g., the child suffers from a terminal illness) or precede the suicide of the parent, as the parent feels it would be unfair to leave the child behind to face the cruel world. 2. Acute psychosis: The parent kills the child based on ideas that are inconsistent with reality; for example, the parent believes the child has been possessed by the devil. 3. Unwanted child: The parent kills the child that he or she regards as a hindrance. 4. Accidental: The child's death is an unintentional outcome of parental physical abuse. 5. Spousal revenge: The parent kills the child in an effort to exact revenge on the other parent. Filicide is the broad term used to refer to a parent (or a person acting in a parental role, such as a stepparent or guardian) who kills his or her child under the age of 18; infanticide is the term used to define the murder of a child in the first year of life, and -- more specifically -- neonaticide refers to a parent who kills a child within the first 24 hours of life. Neonaticides, as described by Resnick, are most often perpetrated by young, unmarried women who do not suffer from a major mental illness and do not want their children. In 1997, for example, New Jersey teen Melissa Drexler made national news when it was discovered she gave birth in a bathroom stall at her prom and disposed of the newborn in a trash can. It is also worth noting there are differences between fathers and mothers who commit filicide. Fathers are more likely to kill more than one victim, including other children and spouses. They are also more likely to kill themselves following the filicide. And fathers are often more harshly punished than women who commit similar crimes. England, for example, passed the Infanticide Acts of 1922 and 1938, which banned the use of the death penalty for mothers who killed their children in the first 12 months of life. These were efforts to recognize the effect that the birth and care of an infant may have on the mother. Several other Western countries have followed suit (with the exception of the United States). No such laws exist to protect men charged with infanticide. Is it possible to prevent the killing of children by their parents? This is trickier. Efforts to head off deaths have included the passage of safe haven laws, which allow parents to surrender infants anonymously to state custody without fear of legal repercussions. But parents who kill their children are a varied population, and this, unfortunately, leaves few means to identify those at risk in the first place. The friends and family of parents or parents-to-be suffering from stress or mental illness would best serve their loved ones by helping them get the attention of mental health providers. These treatment providers should in turn make every extra effort to learn specifically about the parents' feelings toward -- or plans for -- their children. Then, perhaps, we can have some hope of preventing these senseless tragedies.","Sara West: Case of Utah mom accused of killing her babies recalls 2001 Andrea Yates case .

"(CNN) -- Who needs Fourth of July fireworks when you have Joan Rivers around? The comedian known for her lack of self-censoring recently officiated a same-sex wedding and was asked by a photographer if she believed the United States would ever see the first gay or female president. Her response was typical Rivers. ""We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down,"" she said. ""You know Michelle (Obama) is a trans."" When asked to further explain Rivers said, ""A transgender. We all know it."" A representative for Rivers released the following statement to CNN from the comic about her remarks to the photographer: . ""I think it's a compliment.

"(CNN) -- Every other year in July, the small town of Farnborough in South East England hosts the biggest names in the aviation world. Exhibitors and visitors mingle with the latest technology to hit the skies. Below, UK Editor-in-Chief of Royal Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine, Tim Robinson highlights the themes and big players to watch out for at this year's Farnborough International Airshow. Touch and go as F-35 aims for international début . Costly white elephant, or next-generation, sensor-fused superfighter? Whatever your view of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Farnborough could be the first opportunity for the general public to see the West's latest stealth fighter outside of the U.S. That's, of course, only if the aircraft overcomes a last minute fleet grounding following an engine glitch to fly across the Atlantic. The UK, as a key industrial and strategic partner for the F-35, is set to acquire the fifth generation fighter, in its 'B' vertical-lift version for the UK's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. This UK visit, then, could see an order being placed for the first 14 F-35Bs. While the fighter will wow the crowds with its vertical hovering in the air display, for the military top brass the most exciting features -- including its advanced sensors, helmet display and stealth -- are under the skin. Should the F-35 miss the showcase of Farnborough, this will provide extra ammunition for its detractors -- and its absence would be a big talking point. One positive point however, for the aircraft's recent engine fire, is it happened on the ground where engineers can study and solve the problem. New contenders . While the home team will be riding high -- thanks to the UK government's support for its R&D and space sector -- Farnborough is truly a global airshow and showcase for the aerospace industry around the world --with over two-thirds of 1,500 exhibitors coming from outside the UK. New countries represented this year include Malaysia, Tunisia and Thailand. While Airbus and Boeing continue to dominate the commercial aircraft industry, new entrants will be using Farnborough to show off their progress. Expect updates from Brazil's Embraer -- which will have a mockup cabin for its re-engined E2 airliner, Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft, whose Mitsubishi Regional Jet is now in final assembly, and Russia's Irkut -- developing the MC-21 -- a rival to the A320 and 737. However, one airliner in development that will be notable by its absence at the show is Canada's Bombardier CSeries. This suffered a serious engine failure on the ground at the end of May, and although ground-testing has resumed, the aircraft now will miss the show. Finally, the airshow will also see a new military type from the U.S. making its international debut - the Textron Airland Scorpion. The two-seat, jet 'fighter' is a low-cost attack and reconnaissance platform -- aimed at bridging the gap between supersonic expensive fast jets and slower, cheaper turboprops. Will it find a niche? Read this: A century of commercial aviation . Rise of the drones . From book delivery by Amazon drone, to Google and Facebook's acquisition of 'high-altitude, long endurance' (HALE) makers, commercial UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) are now going mainstream -- and this year's Farnborough will reflect this with a focus on autonomous 'intelligent systems' and indoor and outdoor UAV flying areas. Civil UAVs are now possibly one of the fastest growing sectors in aerospace, with one estimate that in five years, commercial UAVs just in the U.S. could be a $13bn industry. However, despite the enthusiasm, challenges remain; in certification, in sharing airspace with manned aircraft and in the business models and structure of this emerging sector. So far the majority of activity has been in small UAVs like quad- and multi-copters -- but the bigger, established global aerospace players are now looking hungrily in the direction of the commercial UAV market. Can they break into this? Or will, in this fast-growing sector, the big primes be outmaneuvered by these tiny start-ups?

"Nairobi (CNN) -- Kenya Airways will suspend flight operations to Liberia and Sierra Leone, the latest airline to curb flights because of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The suspension is temporary, and the airline will continue operating flights to Nigeria and Ghana, Kenya Airways said. The Kenyan government announced other restrictions, saying it is temporarily suspending entry into Kenya of passengers who have passed through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Health professionals and Kenyan citizens returning home from those countries will be the exceptions, but will have to undergo extensive screening and close monitoring, said James Macharia, Cabinet secretary of the Kenya Ministry of Health. The measures come as the World Health Organization warned this week that the magnitude of the Ebola crisis in West Africa is ""vastly"" underestimated. Ebola has infected at least 2,127 people in Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began this year. Of the victims, 1,145 have died as of Wednesday, according to the WHO. ""The outbreak is expected to continue for some time,"" the WHO said in a statement this week. ""Staff at the outbreak sites see evidence that the numbers of reported cases and deaths vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak."" Though the United Nations agency did not provide an estimate of unreported cases, it said it's teaming up with the affected countries to gather more intelligence from the ground. It's also working with other agencies, including the World Food Program, to feed about 1 million people quarantined in villages in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. As experts scramble to contain the outbreak, health officials are considering the use of experimental treatments and vaccines, since no there is no proven cure for the deadly virus. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. It causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes internal and external bleeding.

"(CNN) -- In another time, Tropical Storm Katia, which was barreling across the Atlantic early Wednesday, would have been called Katrina. That's because the National Hurricane Center uses a roster of names it repeats every six years. However, once a large storm ravages a coast and causes too much death and destruction, its name is retired out of sensitivity to the victims and for historical purposes. This year's list has a few changes because the 2005 hurricane season was particularly severe. Among the names retired in the 2005 Atlantic season is Katrina, which was replaced with Katia. Here is an explainer on how storm names are chosen: . . How did the idea of names come about? The United States started off by naming storms using a latitude/longitude designation of their origin. The names were hard to remember and convey to the public, so meteorologists started naming storms after their wives and girlfriends during World War II. The naming method -- which started in the Pacific -- was so easy to remember, meteorologists adopted it for the Atlantic storms. When did this change? In 1950, meteorologists began the use of phonetic alphabets such as Able, Baker and Charlie for the North Atlantic storms, according to the National Weather Service. How did storms end up with female names ? In 1953, the National Weather Service changed its naming convention again. It kept the alphabetical order but used female names. In 1979, forecasters began throwing in male names into the mix. They now alternate male and female names in alphabetical order. . Are the names random? No. At the beginning of each Atlantic storm season, the hurricane center publishes 21 storm names, which are recycled every six years. The names are in alphabetical order. For example, the predecessor to Katia was Jose. Before Jose, there was Irene. What happens if there are more than 21 storms? If the Atlantic sees more than 21 named storms in a season, it resorts to using the Greek alphabet: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and so on. Does the rest of the world have the same naming convention? Since 1978, the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization has a predetermined list for each basin of the world. Not all basins follow the same rules. For example, the Northwest Pacific basin mostly uses names of flowers, animals and trees. . What makes a good storm name? Short, distinctive names work best, according to the National Weather Service. . Why do some of the names sound unfamiliar? . Not all names are derived from English. French and Spanish names are used as well, since those are the other major languages for countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean. . What other storm names have been retired? The 2005 hurricane season was especially busy, and ravaged the Caribbean, and the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Five storm names were retired a year later, including Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Stan.","The names of large storms that cause widespread death and destruction are retired .

"(CNN) -- It's a good thing I didn't know exactly how dangerous a trip I was embarking on, because when I left home in October 2013 to fly to Sudan, I was scared enough. What I had committed to was, quite frankly, the most ""impossible"" thing I'd ever tried to accomplish. Three months earlier, over dinner, I'd learned about a doctor in Sudan's Nuba mountains, Dr. Tom Catena, who was treating thousands of people -- many of them children -- who'd had limbs blown off in the Sudanese government's bombing raids. By coincidence, we'd just posted an article to our website about Richard Van As, an amazing inventor who created a low-cost, 3-D printed prosthetic hand. So, over a second beer, I raised the possibility -- wouldn't it be cool if we brought printers over to Sudan and made arms for these kids? The story might have ended there -- one of those plans you cook up over dinner and forget by breakfast. Really, what can one person do in the face of such widespread sorrow thousands of miles away? But when I got home and looked up Dr. Catena, I read about one of the patients he'd treated: Daniel -- a 12-year-old boy who, in attempting to protect himself from an aerial attack, wrapped his arms around a tree. The tree protected his body, but both his arms were blown off by the bomb that exploded those few meters away. The amputation and hospital treatment had saved his life, but when Daniel woke and realized what had happened he said he wished he would have died. It was one of the most heart-wrenching stories I'd ever read. It was 11pm. I looked down the hallway to where my three boys were sleeping and thought, ""What if it were my kid?"" What if this happened to them and somebody out there could help them -- and didn't? In that moment, I realized I couldn't just close the computer, get a glass of water and go to bed. I had to do something. Going to Sudan try to help thousands of people was way too daunting. There was no way I could get my head around that. I couldn't help the many. But I could help one. I could help Daniel. Crash course in 3-D printing . Mind you, at the time I knew very little about 3-D printing, and even less about prosthetic arms. So I did what I always do: surround myself with smart people, shut up, and absorb their brilliance. I brought together all the experts -- including the great Van As himself -- to give me a crash course in 3-D printing and prosthetic arms. Step 1: 3-D print the files. Step 2: Soften orthoplastic in hot water, then wrap it around the patient's limb to mold the custom-fitted, medical-grade, breathable plastic that will anchor the printed components. Step 3: Attach the hand and the gauntlet, and thread the cabling through each digit, running it back to an attachment point behind the patient's wrist or elbow. The motion of the wrist (up and down) or elbow (side to side) then pulls on the cabling and draws the fingers to a close. In short, the cables tense and release around a pivot point. The crash course done, and just three short months after that initial dinner, I found myself in Yida -- a desolate, dusty refugee camp in South Sudan -- a home to 70,000 hungry and desperate people, driven from their homes by bombing campaigns and unimaginable horrors. I set up shop in an old toolshed and got ready to make a working mechanical arm. Despite the heat (which kept melting the printing filament) and the bugs (which kept jamming up the 3-D printer motors), I managed to get the 3-D printers working and set about making an arm ... for a real boy, now sitting five feet away from me. That boy I'd read about that night in my kitchen back in July. Daniel. Meeting Daniel . Daniel was non-communicative when we first met. He stared, sullen and resigned, off into the middle distance. I gave him my tablet to play with while I worked, and he did what any other teenager would do: found a video game and started playing. Only he used his stumps instead of his fingers. Little by little, he began to trust me and started to show some interest in what I was doing. Every time I got frustrated, or something wasn't working right, I just had to look over at Daniel and nothing else mattered. I had to make it work. After a few days, and a few failures, we managed to fit an arm on Daniel. He wasn't yet strong enough to make the motion that would make the hand clench -- that would come later -- but he could manipulate the hand to his mouth. I fitted it with a tin spoon and took him to the mess tent. We sat him in front of a bowl of goat and pumpkin stew. It was here, for the first time in two years, that Daniel fed himself. He looked over at me and, slowly, a little smirk curled his lips. He turned back, looked at the small crowd that had gathered around him, broke into the biggest grin you'd ever seen, then went back in for more. I knew then, that I had stumbled upon something way bigger than myself, bigger than Daniel, and bigger than that one meal. It was the idea that by helping one, you have the potential to help many -- and that might just be the secret to it all. The reality, I believe, is that all change starts small. The big picture is just too unwieldy, too incomprehensible and seemingly immovable. But give us something individual, quantifiable and personalize-able and, suddenly, our perspective shifts to the one. Just one step. Just one mile. Just one dollar. Just one kiss. Just one person. When we look at life through the lens of ""one,"" everything becomes that much more attainable. By the end of the week, I was in Sudan's Nuba Mountains where Dr. Catena's hospital continues his work. With a steady stream of solar power, I gathered a roomful of locals -- some invited, some not -- and taught them how to 3-D print. Most of them had never seen a computer before, and none of them had ever seen a 3-D printer. Yet, there we were, getting ready to start a hand-making factory, excited about the possibility of making arms for other amputees. As I was packing up to leave, we all talked about what we wanted to accomplish. We talked about how many limbs we wanted to make, how many people we wanted to help, how many arms we wanted to have done by the time I return. And I stopped myself. ""It doesn't matter how many we make,"" I told them. ""We'll get there, eventually. ""For now, just make one."" Interactive: How 3-D printing will reshape the world .

"(CNN) -- The 21st century is a terrible time to be a control freak. When I speak with leaders around the world and ask them what one thing has most changed for them over the last 15 years, they almost always cite the perceived loss of control. The thing they cite as the major reason? ""Connection technologies"" -- technologies like the internet and mobile phone networks that connect people to information and each other. Media and information environments, political agendas, social movements, governmental decision-making processes and control over corporate brands have all been disrupted by citizens using what are now billions of devices and billions of internet connections. Information no longer flows exclusively from mainstream media and government out to society. It flows in a vast network of citizens and consumers interacting with once-dominant information sources. This network of people is constantly reading, writing, and evaluating everything, shaping the ideas that guide society and politics. In a ground-breaking speech on internet freedom given by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in January 2010, she described this by saying that the ""spread of information networks is forming a new nervous system for our planet."" A little bit of hindsight shows that this disruption has come to the foreign policy domain. Should we fear mind-reading future tech? We can draw at least three early conclusions about the impact of these connection technologies on the development of political movements: . Conclusion #1: These technologies accelerate the growth of social and political movements. Distance and time no longer limit access to real-time information. Movements that would have once taken years to develop and relied on strong ties between people well-known to each other now can be built in days or weeks, leveraging the relatively open platforms that social media provide. This phenomenon is plain to see in world events as diverse as the Arab Spring, political protests in Russia, disaster response in Japan, and the populist online movements supporting open internet policies in Europe and the United States. Conclusion #2: Connection technologies have enriched the information environment, changing our ability to share and receive information. Many people know the story of Mohamed Bouazizi, a fruit vendor from the small town of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia whose self-immolation on December 17, 2010, catalyzed what became the Arab Spring. On December 18, his mother and other family members began a protest that spread to the rest of Tunisia. What most people don't know, though, is that just two years earlier there were protests in Tunisia that started off far larger but failed to spread beyond the confines of the Gafsa mining basin where they began. What changed in those two years? During the initial protests in Sidi Bouzid, acts of protest were documented on video-enabled mobile phones and posted to social media sites. Activists in the Tunisian Diaspora curated and distributed this content, leading to its pick-up by pan-Arab satellite television networks including Al-Jazeera. This allowed students with a few dozen friends and followers on social media to become eyewitness sources for satellite TV networks that broadcast their stories to hundreds of millions of viewers. The Tunisian government of president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was unable to contain this flow of media and information. This combination of new and traditional media can amplify the voices of citizen-centred movements into potent political forces and demonstrate how governments lose control over their information environments. Opinion: Humans, lose your cyberphobia . Conclusion #3: New information networks have disrupted leadership structures. Internet-enabled movements tend to lack the traditional single charismatic leader, inspiring and organizing the masses from on high. Rather, movements that rely heavily on the internet tend to have leadership structures that look like the internet itself -- a distributed web of nodes and connections, rather than a pyramidal, top-down structure. This enables a decentralized form of organization bringing together unlikely combinations of people into rapidly formed movements. While this has the virtue of making movements more citizen-centered and less bound to the cults of personality one often finds in and around protest movements, it also makes these movements more ephemeral and less sustainable. A lack of real structure and widely-accepted leaders has limited the sustainability of many movements, both political and issue-oriented. More than anything else, we can draw the early conclusion that connection technologies redistribute power from hierarchies to citizens and networks of citizens. These technologies are changing the entire political ecosystem. They are changing the nature of who is participating, who has power and how that power is exercised. Most of the time, this is a good thing. It allows for more open, transparent and participatory government. It allows citizens to make their voices heard and participate in the political process. A look back at all the action LeWeb'12 London: Day one . However, the same power given to people seeking to connect the governing to the governed also gives the world's criminals and terrorists powerful tools to build sophisticated networks through which to perpetuate fraud, graft, and violence. In this respect, Secretary Clinton has likened our information networks to nuclear power, which can either fuel a city or destroy it, and to steel, which can be used to build a hospital or a machine gun. It is difficult to imagine how connection technologies will shape political movements and systems over the next decade, but we can anticipate more empowerment of the citizen and more disruption, for both good and ill. How political leaders respond to this connectivity and its power will be a test of values, open versus closed. Closure strictly constrains the benefits technology can bring and separates the aspirations of the governed from the governing. Openness brings transparency, democratizes information, and empowers people to achieve things together that none could attain by themselves.

"(CNN) -- North Korean orphans who make it to South Korea could be considered relatively lucky. They are provided an education, a path to South Korean citizenship and even a chance at adoption. But many North Korean children do not have similar opportunities. Some are in orphanages in their homeland; others make it out of North Korea, only to find themselves stateless and in hiding in China or other countries. In January, President Obama signed into law a measure designed to help these children. The North Korean Child Welfare Act of 2012 calls for the U.S. State Department to advocate for the ""best interests"" of North Korean children. This includes helping reunite family members who've escaped North Korea, as well as facilitating adoption for North Korean children living outside their homeland without parental care. But it could be years before Americans are able to adopt any of these children. The act does not lay out a roadmap for making adoptions or family reunions possible. Rather, it tasks the State Department with making regular reports to Congress on challenges facing North Korean children and developing a strategy to address them. ""Hundreds of thousands of North Korean children suffer from malnutrition in North Korea,"" the act reads, and many of them ""may face statelessness in neighboring countries."" Orphaned and homeless: Surviving the streets of North Korea . Most North Korean defectors escape to neighboring China, which has a policy of sending those who are caught back to their home country. The consequences of repatriation can include imprisonment in North Korea and, in some cases, the death penalty, according to human rights activists. Some North Korean children escape to China after losing their parents, while others become orphans after crossing the border if their parents die or are sent back to North Korea. The orphans often live in hiding because of fears that they'll be repatriated. ""The last estimate we heard was 20,000,"" said Arthur Han of Han-Schneider International Children's Foundation, an organization for disadvantaged children based in Montebello, California. ""That number is not accurate because these orphans are in hiding and there's no way to get an accurate number."" Han's father, Sam Han, grew up as an orphan in South Korea and lobbied to get the law passed beginning in 2010. The elder Han had been concerned about the welfare of such children after visiting orphanages in North Korea, his son said. His father died in 2012 from cancer. The North Korean Child Welfare Act tasks the State Department and the House Foreign Affairs Committee with devising strategies to ""safely bring these kids out of hiding in these neighboring countries, into the U.S. or into international homes,"" Han said. ""This bill initiates a process, sets a committee, so a plan can be implemented."" Several prospective parents have already asked Han whether they could adopt a North Korean child. ""I have to tell them it's a few years out before we have a chance to adopt a North Korean child,"" Han said. ""From what we've heard, we're looking at minimum one to three years before a plan is strategized and implemented."" Meanwhile, the law has garnered criticism, especially from Christine Hong, an assistant professor at the University of California Santa Cruz, who said the wording of the measure is troubling. ""I don't think this is going to have an effect of an open season of baby scooping,"" she said. ""One of the dangers is it states that the State Department has to elaborate protocol and it makes it possible for U.S. citizens to be able to adopt stateless children, not just from North Korea or China, but from around the world. It's one of the dangerous precedents -- it's a very loose and fast language."" Last fall, Hong penned a critique of the bill on the website 38North. In addition to North Korean orphans, the law also refers to children with one North Korean parent -- many of whom are born in China from a Chinese-North Korean relationship. Because of the illegal status of North Koreans in China, such children may not be recognized by China or North Korea, rendering them stateless. Also, they may not have proper registration in China, which is crucial for social services and education, according to human rights organizations. But Hong said the law is based on outdated premises, and that the discrimination and barriers to services for children born of North Korean-Chinese relationships have greatly improved. The new law also calls for the State Department to work with the South Korean government to establish pilot programs to assist in the family reunification of North Korean children. The South Korean government's Ministry of Unification wrote in an e-mail to CNN: ""If the U.S. government makes a detailed proposal regarding this pilot project in the future, we can decide on whether we will go on with the project after examining various factors.""
