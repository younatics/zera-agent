Broadie indicated after winning her first-round match on Monday that she wouldn’t begin video analysis of the Dane until today. She might want to start cramming – or avoid the videos altogether. Wozniacki needed to return to the All England Club on Tuesday to resume her first-round tie with Shahar Peer, which was interrupted by rain on Monday with the former world No 1 leading 6-3, 2-0. What followed might prove intimidating for Broadie. They resumed at 30-30 in the third game of the second set Wozniacki promptly broke serve to lead 3-0. The next three games were rattled off in roughly 10 minutes, Wozniacki crushing the Israeli with her groundstrokes. The Dane, whose relationship with golfer Rory McIlroy ended recently, has slipped down the rankings. She is currently seeded 16th after a significant loss in form and has not gone past the second round here since 2011. Next up: Wozniacki takes on British star Naomi Broady in the second round .","Former world No 1 Caroline Wozniacki beat Shahar Peer 6-3, 6-0 .

"By . Joe Bernstein . What did World Cup legends Paolo Rossi, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo have in common? They were all 25-years-old when they played in the tournaments that made them all-time greats. Going by recent history, 25 is the perfect age to enter a World Cup if you want to become a superstar. Perfect age: Diego Maradona was a 25-year-old when he took the world by storm with Argentina . Talismen: Zinedine Zidane led France to victory in 1998 before Ronaldo did with Brazil in the 2002 tournament . Champion: A 25-year-old Paolo Rossi led Italy to World Cup victory in 1982 after returning from a two-year ban . Diego Maradona, ARG, 1986 World Cup . Born: October 1960 .

Paolo Rossi, ITA, 1982 World Cup . Born: September 1956 . Italy apps/goals: 48/20 . And Mesut Ozil, Diego Costa and Alexis Sanchez are among the high-profile players who hope the tradition continues in Brazil 2014. At 25, you’re still at the peak of your physical powers but have experience and know-how too. Even more importantly, you should be able to handle pressure and bounce back from adversity. Rossi won the 1982 World Cup for Italy having returned from a two-year ban for his part in a match-fixing scandal. He didn’t score in his opening four games in the tournament, then bagged six in three game in including a famous hat-trick against Brazil. Maradona couldn’t handle the expectation as a 21-year-old in 1982. Four years later, he was Argentina’s captain and main man in lifting the trophy, scoring or creating 10 goals in seven matches. Zidane celebrated his 26th birthday right in the middle of the 1998 World Cup when he inspired France to win the trophy on home soil and cement his place in history. Four years later, Brazil’s Ronaldo – who suffered a near-nervous breakdown before the 1998 World Cup final -  came back stronger and wiser at 25 to win the Golden Boot with eight goals as Brazil became world champions for a record fifth time. Now, in 2014, a new generation of 25-year-olds are ready to take the world by storm. Who's next? Maradona led Argentina to World Cup glory and gave himself legendary status in 1986 . Born: October 1988 . Apps/goals: 55/17 . MESUT OZIL, GERMANY . Mesmeric playmaker who sprinted away from Gareth Barry to destroy England’s World Cup hopes four years ago. Had a difficult debut season in the Premier League with Arsenal, missing a crucial penalty against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but loves the No10 role given to him by Germany coach Joachim Low. ‘We are travelling to Brazil to win the World Cup and show our thanks to the many fans in Germany and all over the world,’ says Ozil. ‘The most important thing for me is that I have been given the freedom to move either left or right, or even deep to pick up the ball. That suits me very well.’ The right age: Mesut Ozil destroyed England's hopes four years ago and is now 25 for the tournament in Brazil . Born: December 1988 . Apps/goals: 66/23 . ALEXIS SANCHEZ, CHILE . Hugely-talented Barcelona forward who began his World Cup with a goal and assist in Chile’s 3-1 win against Australia on Friday. Having scored 19 La Liga goals last season, £25million Sanchez is entering the peak of his career and  Manchester United, Juventus and Liverpool are among the clubs monitoring his situation at the Nou Camp in case new manager Luis Enrique wants to make changes. ‘If I did not believe that Chile could be world champions, I would have stayed at home, watching the games on the TV,’ says the confident winger. Talent: Alexis Sanchez began his World Cup with a goal and an assist in Chile's 3-1 win over Australia . Born: October 1988 . Apps/goals: 3/0 . DIEGO COSTA, SPAIN . Controversially chose to play for his adopted Spain instead of Brazil and is key to their hopes of retaining the World Cup despite being substituted in a disastrous 5-1 defeat by Holland in their opening game on Friday. Jose Mourinho is close to signing the £32million centre-forward from Atletico Madrid as a proper replacement for Didier Drogba and though Costa has been troubled by hamstring problems in the build-up to the World Cup, his physical presence gives Spain a different option. May not have hit the ground running at Brazil 2014 but Rossi and others have shown in the past it’s how you finish rather than how you start that counts. Target: £32million-rated striker Diego Costa opted for Spain over Brazil and could be key to their World Cup hopes . Born: October 1988 . Apps/goals: 7/2 . WILLIAN, BRAZIL . One of four Chelsea players named by Felipe Scolari in Brazil’s squad and though he didn’t feature in the opening-night victory against Croatia, his athleticism and power will be needed as the tournament progresses. Scolari is a huge Willian fan and he named is as one of the eight certainties in the Brazil squad back in April – two months before he had to finalise his squad. Chelsea: Brazil's Willian can have an impact in Felipe Scolari's side on their home soil in the 2014 World Cup . Born: July 1988 . Apps/goals: 27/5 . PAULINHO, BRAZIL . There wasn’t a single Spurs player in the England World Cup squad – but Paulinho not only made the 23-man party for hosts Brazil, he started the win against Croatia as a midfield enforcer to help protect the home defence. Paulinho scored nine goals for Tottenham in his debut season in England and his all-round play in the Brazilian engine room makes him an important component in the team. Alone: Paulinho (right) was a midfield enforcer against Croatia for Brazil's World Cup opener on Thursday . Born: May 1989 . Apps/goals: 77/14 . GIOVANI DOS SANTOS, MEXICO . Too lightweight to make it in the Premier League with Spurs but his dazzling skills are made for a World Cup.

Chase: Giovani dos Santos (right) can put his skills that weren't used in the Premier League to use in Brazil . Born: January 1989 . Apps/goals: 48/5 . AXEL WITSEL, BELGIUM . While Premier League fans know all about Eden Hazard and Vincent Kompany, Belgian supporters regard Witsel of Russian club Zenit St Petersburg as the most important individual in their team. Witsel is the heartbeat of the Belgian side, their Roy Keane who protects the back four and drives everyone else on. Belgian are World Cup dark horses, and Witsel may be a dark horse for player of the tournament. He’s certainly the right age!

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Free: More than 750 foreign criminals - including killers, rapists and paedophiles - are walking the streets after jumping bail, it has been revealed . More than 750 foreign criminals – including killers, rapists and paedophiles – are walking the streets after jumping bail. They should have been deported after completing their sentences, but instead have been released from detention under human rights laws and then gone on the run. Among those at large are serious violent criminals, including 11 rapists, at least two killers and several child abusers and arsonists. The previously unseen figures show the total also includes six burglars, 26 robbers, dozens of violent thugs and 76 drug dealers. The Home Office is refusing to identify the criminals by name because to do so would breach their ‘right’ to privacy. The figures were released to the Daily Mail after a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The Home Office revealed that 752 foreign offenders who have committed crimes in Britain have absconded after they were released on bail from prison or immigration detention and have never been found. Of those, 16 have been on the run for more than ten years, and 158 for between five and ten years. Another 310 have been on the run for between two and five years, while 191 have been at large for between one and two years, and 77 for less than a year. Human rights rulings mean foreign criminals who the Home Office is struggling to remove from Britain cannot be kept behind bars indefinitely. Concern: Tory MP Nick de Bois (left) said it is 'deeply worrying' that so many violent foreign criminals are on the run. The scandal is a serious blow to David Cameron (right) who has pledged to deport more foreign offenders . They can only remain in custody as . long as there is a reasonable prospect of officials being able to remove . them in the near future. But . in many cases, human rights laws block their return. Other barriers can . include difficulties in obtaining a passport for offenders who . destroyed their travel documents on their arrival. Violent thug Kawa Ali Azad should have been deported five years ago. Instead, the Iraqi failed asylum seeker is in Britain after twice going on the run while on bail granted by immigration judges. He has six convictions for violence including an attack on the mother of his young son. Azad, pictured, battered his terrified ex-partner Tania Doherty unconscious – before trying to snatch the boy. In 2009, he was flown all the way to Baghdad, but the Iraqi authorities refused to take him and sent him back. Miss Doherty says she and their son live in ‘constant fear’ that he will return. They had to be moved and she was given a new identity in case Azad attacked them again. She carries a phone with a direct link to police. As a result, even the most dangerous offenders can be let out on bail by a judge. Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘It is deeply worrying that so many dangerous foreign criminals are walking the streets and urgent action must be taken to find them. ‘The British public are losing patience with so-called human rights claims putting them at risk. These criminals should by rights have been thrown out of this country and put back in jail in their country of origin.’ The new scandal is the latest blow to the reputation of the beleaguered immigration service, and is a serious blow to David Cameron, who has made personal pledges to deport more foreign offenders. The freedom of information request was made in March last year, but despite a legal requirement to release the information after 21 days, no response was received until last month. The Home Office refused to say which countries the offenders are from. It claimed releasing that information could undermine its ability to negotiate deportation agreements with foreign governments. Officials also refused to say exactly how many criminals had committed particular offences – if the total was fewer than five – in case it could aid public identification. But they said there were fewer than five criminals guilty of manslaughter, and at least one guilty of conspiracy to murder. They admitted they did not classify the criminals according to how much of a risk they pose to the public. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We believe foreign nationals who break our rules should be removed from the UK at the earliest opportunity. ‘Last year we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders. Where individuals abscond from our controls, we work closely with the police and probation services and employ specialist trace teams to return these individuals to prison. ‘Absconders are circulated on the Police National Computer and are added to our watch lists in case those who have left the country seek to re-enter.’","More than 750 foreign criminals are walking the streets after jumping bail .

"By . Mark Prigg . It could mean the end of out of focus holiday snaps and bring a whole new dimension to selfies. The Illum camera allows the user to change the focus of their picture after taking a snap. It can even be used to create interactive images online where users can choose their own focus. Scroll down to try an interactive picture . The $1599 Illum camera allows users to change the focus after the picture has been taken using a radical new technology to capture images. The camera uses a technique known as Light Field Photography. This captures the color, intensity and direction of every light ray flowing into the camera. Rays of light entering the camera refract through a series of curved lenses and are captured on the light-field sensor. The micro-lens array in front of the sensor surface preserves each ray's direction. The camera offers a 40-megaray light field sensor, 8x optical zoom range, constant f/2.0 aperture and a high-speed shutter capable of freezing motion under a wide variety of conditions. After the picture is taken, photographers can adjust aspects of images that were previously fixed, such as focus, tilt, perspective shift and depth of field. The camera uses a technique known as Light Field Photography. This captures the color, intensity and direction of every light ray flowing into the camera. 'Built to harness the full power of the light field, the professional-grade LYTRO ILLUM will give photographers a new medium capable of capturing visual experiences in their purest form — not as a static cross-section of reality but an authentic, interactive window into their world,' the firm behind the camera said. 'With Lytro Illum, creative pioneers — ranging from artistic amateurs to experienced professionals — will tap into a new wave of graphical storytelling. Now artist and audience alike can share an equally intimate connection with the imagery, and, in a sense, jointly participate in the magic of its creation,' said Lytro CEO Jason Rosenthal. 'By combining a novel hardware array with tremendous computational horsepower, this camera opens up unprecedented possibilities to push the boundaries of creativity beyond the limits inherent in digital or film photography.'

The camera has a traditional shutter, but can capture a huge amount of information allowing the focus to be changed at any time. The firm has been testing the camera with professional photographers. 'My photography style pushes me to look for ways to tell a more compelling story with every image. Lytro Illum gave me that ability by incorporating an interactive element that captures different visual touch points at every depth,' said Kyle Thompson, a Chicago-based photographer known for his surreal conceptual style and .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it was ‘simply foolish’ to believe that the risk of a terrorist attack on the UK was a thing of the past . The British public has become ‘disturbingly’ complacent about the terror threat, the spy watchdog has warned. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it was ‘simply foolish’ to believe that the risk of a terrorist attack on the UK was a thing of the past. On the eve of the anniversary of the July 7 bombings in London in 2005, Sir Malcolm warned jihadi extremists were deploying 'devilish technical skill' to create ever more sophisticated devices. Passengers arriving at airports in Britain, the Middle East and Africa face extra security checks to fly into the US after warnings an attack was being planned. It follows claims Islamic extremists are making explosives which are undetectable to airport scanners, by using smartphones or tablet computers. Sir Malcolm, who disclosed that he had been briefed in advance about the measures, said that he had been left in no doubt that they were necessary. But he warned some people have become too complacent about the threat, because there had not been a successful bomb attack since 2005 when 52 people were killed by four bombers on tube trains and a London bus. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Malcolm rejected claims that a new round of stringent security checks were not needed. ‘Long queues work their way through security, our clothes are removed, our luggage inspected and our own bodies often examined. As of this week it has got worse, especially for flights to the United States,’ he wrote. ‘Is it really necessary? We have seen no planes hijacked for many years. None have exploded in the air, like the PanAm flight over Lockerbie in 1988. ‘Apart from the terrible murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, the last successful Islamic jihadi terrorist outrage in Britain was the London bombings back in 2005. ‘This has resulted in complacency amongst some of the public which is seriously disturbing. It is simply foolish to believe that the threat is either minimal or now behind us.’ Sir Malcolm said it was 'foolish' to think that because there has not been a successful bomb attack in Britain since July 7. 2005 that the threat had receded . The latest security measures imposed last week followed intelligence warnings that al Qaeda's chief bomb maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, who is thought to be based in Yemen, had linked up with jihadists in Syria to pass on his skills. Meanwhile Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State - formerly Isis - appeared in public before his followers to lead prayers at the Great Mosque in Mosul in northern Iraq where the extremist group has made sweeping gains. brahim Al-Asiri, 32, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners. The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights from the UK. The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from 10 to 21 on Friday. Queues at Manchester Airport on Friday morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so-called 'stealth bombs' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners . Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport, with many complaining of delays . Sir Malcolm, who disclosed that he had been briefed in advance about the measures, said that he had been left in no doubt that they were necessary. 'I have received fuller information than it has been possible to publish in the newspapers. I have no doubt, from what I have learnt, that these new steps are not bureaucratic nor an overreaction . Sadly, they are unavoidable,' he wrote. Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, has insisted that the each year the security services have intercepted serious plots which ‘would have led to the deaths and mutilation of many British citizens’, Sir Malcolm added.. 'The police and the security services have been very successful but we must not underestimate the devilish technical skill of those terrorists who design ever more sophisticated means of concealing explosives in mobile devices, in clothing and in otherwise innocent objects. They have been hard at work over the last year.'","Sir Malcolm Rifkind warns against 'disturbing' levels of complacency .

"By . John Stevens . and James Tozer . A married Tory activist who was brought to court as one of Nigel Evans’s alleged victims last night spoke of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a ‘bit of a laugh’. Prosecutors claimed the former Deputy Speaker had tried to put his hand down the trousers of the party worker at a Conservative Party conference more than ten years ago. But last night the 35-year-old dismissed the alleged incident involving him as just a ‘bit of drunken misbehaviour’ that was ‘not in any shape or form a crime’. Scroll down for video . A married Tory activist, brought to court as one of Nigel Evans' alleged victims, has told of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a 'bit of a laugh' The man – in his 20s when it was claimed the event took place in a bar in Blackpool in October 2003 – said the CPS and police had been ‘over-zealous’ in their decision to take Mr Evans, 56, to court for the alleged indecent assault. ‘I would definitely have not called myself a victim,’ he said. ‘It was nothing more than some banter among friends. ‘It genuinely astonishes me that I was in court having to give evidence on something that was nothing more than a bit of a laugh and a joke. It is very, very surreal.’ After Mr Evans was arrested for rape in May last year, the man said he did not contact police because  he did not believe he was a victim of a criminal offence. But a Tory councillor who was also in the bar reported it to police. In his statement to police, the man wrote: ‘I would like to categorically state I have no ill-feeling or malice to Mr Evans. I do not wish Mr Evans to be charged as a result of what happened to me. ‘I am making this statement after a witness reported the incident.’ Mr Evans was re-arrested and charged with indecent assault. Of the seven alleged victims, three did not consider an offence had been committed against them. The man last night said he was ‘relieved’ that Mr Evans had been cleared. The former Deputy Speaker of the Commons was cleared after a jury at Preston Crown Court took less than six hours to acquit him of nine sex charges against seven men . He said: ‘Do I think that he should spend even an hour of time in jail for what happened to me? No. It never even occurred to me that it would be a police matter and would end up in court. ‘I made it clear to the police all along that I did not think he should be charged. ‘It does not surprised me in the slightest that he has been found not guilty. I think that is entirely right in the count involving me’ He believes that Mr Evans’s reputation has been wrongly tarnished by the CPS bringing the case. He said: ‘I feel sorry for Nigel. I think that unfortunately everyone is innocent until proven guilty unless you are a politician. ‘MPs have got a fairly thick skin, but to have your sex life dragged up in public and be the subject of gossip is horrific. ‘Unfortunately he had a job he loved and job he was good at as deputy speaker and it will be very hard for him to recover again.’ He added: ‘Nigel is someone who is genuinely well liked across the political divide. ‘He is seen as friendly, humorous and someone who is very good at his job. ‘Maybe Nigel had a bit of a problem with drink, but he is not predatory or a bad person by any stretch of the imagination.’ The man said he had seen Mr Evans since 2003, but they had never talked about the alleged incident. He said: ‘We never talked about what happened because it was something in the past. On the few occasions I have spoken to him I’ve got on perfectly well with him and we’ve had a good gossip about party policy and things like that. I feel absolutely no animosity towards Nigel whatsoever. ‘I hope that he rebuilds his life as best as he can now he has been cleared on all counts. I wish him all the best. I am sure the CPS will be reviewing the case.’ 'I would like to categorically state I . have no ill-feeling or malice to Mr Evans. I do not wish Mr Evans to be . charged as a result of what happened to me' - Alleged victim in his police statement . The court heard that the man had complained to MP Conor Burns after he claimed a ‘plastered’ Mr Evans had twice tried to put his hands down his trousers while drinking late at night. Last night, the man said that he had only reported the event because he did not want Mr Evans, who was at the time shadow spokesman for Wales, to be embarrassed in front of journalists who were also drinking in the bar and had wanted someone to send him to bed.

"By . Associated Press . Several bodies had been stored for up to a decade or more at a Rhode Island funeral home whose owner killed himself last week, police said Thursday. The bodies of five elderly adults — three men and two women — and one fetus were found along with the cremated remains of two other people last week at the Pennine Funeral home in Providence, according to the state health department. Providence police Major David Lapatin said indicators at the scene lead him to believe some of the bodies date back to the early 2000s. He declined to elaborate. Unclaimed bodies: Several bodies had been stored for up to a decade or more at this Rhode Island funeral home whose owner Alfred Pennine killed himself last week, police said Thursday . Detectives are waiting for the state medical examiner to finish identifying the bodies so they can contact any relatives, Lapatin said. Lapatin said the investigation is not currently considered criminal. A spokesman for the state Health Department said four of the six bodies have been tentatively identified. The funeral home's director, Alfred Pennine, committed suicide July 21 in New Hampshire, according to authorities. Another funeral director found the remains after returning from New Hampshire with Pennine's body. Michael Berarducci, a Providence funeral director and friend of Pennine's, told the Providence Journal that Pennine's mother asked him to bring her son's body back from New Hampshire. Pennine, 55, had gone to a popular campground along the Kancamagus Highway where a campground worker found him hanging from a tree on July 21. He'd been reported missing a week earlier. Makeshift morgue: Several years ago, the Pennines converted this garage into a morgue where Alfred Pennine embalmed bodies . Berarducci said another friend told him that Pennine may have been storing a recent body for the state medical examiner's office at his funeral home. Berarducci went to investigate and was shocked to find five of the bodies, some in caskets and others in a cardboard 'shipping containers.' He said that some of the bodies appeared to be identified with hospital tags. They were in a garage that had been converted into an unrefrigerated morgue, the paper reported. One casket contained the body of a woman who appeared to have died on 'a couple weeks,' Berarducci told the Providence Journal. According to the Health Department, Pennine was put on probation for two years in 2006 for not performing a timely cremation and for not submitting a required report. His license was suspended in 2007 for two years for unprofessional conduct and reinstated in 2009 after Pennine agreed to two more years of probation.","The bodies of five adults and one fetus, as well as the cremated remains of two people, were found in a Providence funeral home .

"By . Associated Press . His paintings made news worldwide, but it turns out that former President George W. Bush has been working on another, highly personal project since leaving the White House: He has quietly completed a biography of his father, former President George H.W. Bush. Crown Publishers told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the book, currently untitled, will be released Nov. 11. In 2010, Crown published the younger Bush's million-selling memoir, Decision Points. 'George H.W. Bush is a great servant, statesman, and father,' George W. Bush said in a statement issued by Crown. 'I loved writing the story of his life, and I hope others enjoy reading it.' According to Crown, the book will cover the elder Bush's whole life and his influence on his son, from George W.'s 'childhood in West Texas to his early campaign trips with his father, and from his decision to go into politics to his own two-term Presidency.' In this April 25, 2013 photo, former U.S. Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush attend the George W. Bush Presidential Center dedication ceremony in Dallas, Texas. The younger Bush has written a 'personal biography' of his presidential father, publishers said Wednesday . George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, pictured here in 2009 at a Houston Texans NFL game, are also cooperating with a historian for a joint biography about the former presidents called Presidents Bush: A Portrait of a Father and Son by Mark K. Updegrove. The book is scheduled for Spring 2016 . The book will be 'heartfelt, intimate, and illuminating,' Crown publisher Maya Mavjee said in a statement. 'As the only father and son to each have served as President of the United States since John and John Quincy Adams, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush occupy a unique position in history,' Mavjee said. 'George W. Bush brings to vivid life his unique perspective of the personal qualities and principles that have animated George H. W. Bush's extraordinary life of service to country and family.' Financial terms were not disclosed. George W. Bush was represented by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, who also handled negotiations for Decision Points. The relationship between the two presidents has long fascinated scholars, political insiders and the general public. Many have speculated that the younger Bush felt competitive with his father, driven to surpass him and to gain his approval. George W. Bush first thought of the book around 2010 and began writing it two years later, consulting widely with friends and family members, including his father. Although Bush had assistance with research, he wrote the book himself. The book is expected to be around 300 pages and Crown is planning a first printing of 1 million copies. George H.W. Bush, who turned 90 in June, was defeated for re-election in 1992 by Bill Clinton, but his stature has steadily grown. In 2012, he was the subject of an admiring HBO documentary, 41, referring to his being the 41st president. Jon Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, is working on a book about Bush. George H. W. Bush: Character at the Core by former Bush speechwriter Curt Smith, is scheduled to come out this fall. The elder Bush is one of the few presidents in modern times not to have written a memoir. His books include All the Best: My Life in Letters and Other Writings and A World Transformed, a collaboration with former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.","The currently untitled book will be released on November 11 .

Chelsea's pre-season preparations may be well underway, with the squad currently being whipped into shape by Jose Mourinho at their training camp in Austria, but Willian is still on holiday following the World Cup.

"By . Associated Press . Repair crews on Thursday were shoring up a giant hole in the middle of Sunset Boulevard caused by a ruptured pipe, as officials at the water-logged University of California, Los Angeles, continued to assess damage from the 20 million gallons that inundated the campus. Workers were reinforcing the excavated 56-by-41-foot crater and making the site safe for crews, said Mike Miller, district superintendent for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Meanwhile, workers off-site were fashioning new valves and a Y-joint connector to replace the burst section of the century-old steel line. The Department of Water and Power said repairs along the famed boulevard, a heavily traveled east-west thoroughfare, likely won't be completed until the weekend. 'There's still just a lot of work to do out here,' Miller said.

Damage costs have yet to be pegged from the rupture of the pipeline that spewed more than 20 million gallons of water in the midst of California's worst drought in decades. The break in the 93-year-old pipe left a swath of the UCLA campus including its basketball arena swamped with water. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) UCLA officials said six facilities were damaged in Tuesday's flooding and about 960 vehicles remained trapped in garages, with many below water left behind by the roiling flood. Rich Mylin, associate director of events and facilities, led a tour Wednesday of affected areas for Department of Water and Power workers in hard hats, and they snapped photos and took notes. The flooding sent water cascading into the Pauley Pavilion, less than two years after a $136 million renovation. UCLA Vice Chancellor Kelly Schmader said 8 to 10 inches of water covered the basketball court, and it showed signs of buckling. The floor will be repaired or replaced as necessary and will be ready by the start of the basketball season this fall, Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said.

On Wednesday evening, six men helping to pump water from the pavilion were treated for exposure to carbon monoxide from a generator's exhaust, city fire spokeswoman Katherine Main said. Two were taken to a hospital in fair condition, and four were treated at the scene. Department of Water and Power spokesman Joe Ramallo said people who suffered damage from the flooding can file claims with the agency, which will work with UCLA on settling losses. The 30-inch steel main was gushing 1,000 gallons a minute Wednesday before it was shut off completely in the evening. At its peak, water was streaming out of the break at a rate of 75,000 gallons a minute. The amount of water spilled could serve more than 100,000 Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers for a day. The rupture occurred amid a drought as tough new state fines took effect for Californians who waste water by hosing down driveways or using a hose without a nozzle to wash their car. Despite the break, no utility customers were without water. No injuries were reported.

"By . Chris Pleasance . More than 1,500 new cases of female genital mutilation have been revealed by a single London maternity unit and staff admit that other cases could have 'slipped through the net.' St George's hospital in Tooting has treated nearly  200 women a year since it started keeping records on the violent practice. While most of the 1,546 victims treated in the hospital's specialist unit were born in Somalia, disturbing statistics show that at least 11 were born in the UK, where genital mutilation has been a crime since 1985. Rudimentary tools are often used to perform the operations, like these . found in Kenya (pictured left). The procedure is often performed on . young girls like nine-year-old Fay Mohammed (pictured right). Others were from Nigeria or Eritrea where the practice is common among some Muslim communities. Campaigners described the statistics as 'horrifying' while staff at the hospital said it shows the tribal practice remains relatively common. Karen Lewis, a midwife at St George's, warned that some staff  were fearful of getting involved because they saw the backstreet operations as a cultural issue, rather than abuse. She said: 'The women we see have often faced years of pain and suffer flashbacks and other psychological problems. Some of them are also terrified of childbirth because of what's happened to them in the past.' 'Some of them also don't realise that FGM is wrong and are quite horrified when we tell them. 'So we need to do much more to raise awareness and have a big educational campaign to stop it happening to more girls in the future.' One nurse at St George's hospital said that some staff view FGM as a cultural issue rather than abuse . Battersea MP Jane Ellison, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on female genital mutilation, said: 'Many of these women are suffering the chronic health problems associated with FGM. 'Yet again we are shown that there is a big problem to which our health and other public services must respond.' Despite the high number of cases - 80 so far this year - nobody has yet been prosecuted for the practice. The Crown Prosecution Service says it is studying five case files passed on by the Metropolitan Police. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has said it is only a matter of time before somebody is prosecuted but efforts are being hampered by victim's unwillingness to come forward. Female genital mutilation, or FGM, is a common practice among some Muslim communities across the middle of Africa, including Somalia, Eritrea, North Sudan and central Mali. It is also present in Muslim communities in Indonesia, Oman, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, among others. The operation involves cutting or removing female sexual tissue. It can also involve stitching using silk thread or catgut. The process is supposed to cleanse the woman of sexual impurity and victims can spend up to 40 days bound from the waist down while healing. The operation is usually performed on children or young girls before entering adolescence, though ages vary from community to community. Given that most surgeries are performed by untrained women, commonly Aunts of the girls or village matrons, risks include infection, pain, sterility, and death due to blood loss. Due to the nature of the wounds, problems can occur later during childbirth. While the practice has been illegal in the UK since 1985, there have so . far been no prosecutions due in part to victim's reluctance to come . forward, and also because some women do not recognise it as a crime. The practice is also specifically outlawed in Belgium, Sweden and some US states. In Africa several nations, including Somalia, have made declarations . against the practice though across the continent legislation is patchy and difficult to . enforce.","The barbaric practice is most common in Muslim areas of Africa .

"Photographs taken on the streets of Australian cities have been layered with images captured 100 years ago and the results are nothing short of profound.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . It was more than the cheering of the crowd and the hand-banging on the hoardings that powered Alex Dowsett to the time-trial gold medal on Thursday. The 25-year-old Englishman carried with him the extra incentive of banishing the heartache of the past few months - and the worrying of a lifetime - in coming from six seconds down to Australia’s Rohan Dennis at the start of the final section to win by nearly 10 seconds. Minutes after being given his gold medal, he was holding it in his hands, contemplating his biggest achievement more in relief than joy. Champion: England's Alex Dowsett clinched gold in the Commonwealth Games cycling time trial . Rapid: Dowsett completed the Glasgow course in 47 minutes, 41.78 seconds . Prize: Dowsett poses with his gold medal after his brilliant victory in the time trial . The most recent impetus to his winning here in Glasgow was provided by his exclusion through illness from the Movistar team for this year’s Tour de France, which took in his home county of Essex on its way from Yorkshire to the Channel. It was agony for him. A son of racing driver Phil Dowsett, he took himself off to the British Grand Prix at Silverstone to escape his pain. He does not blame Movistar’s management for leaving him out, for he was coughing up ‘rainbow-coloured’ phlegm. But he added: ‘I was angry for pretty much the whole month. I was an a*** to live with. I took it out on everyone, especially my family - they bore the brunt of it.’ But the Tour de France setback was hardly the start of the Dowsetts’ suffering since he took up cycling because, as he is a haemophiliac, it was marginally safer for him than contact sports. ‘There have been a lot of disappointments over the years,’ said Dowsett, a three-time British champion. ‘For example, I broke my elbow and got close to MRSA in the operation to fix it . . . before the World Championships at the end of last year I was going really well, when I picked up a little bug. Podium: Dowsett (centre) with silver medallist Rohan Dennis (left) and bronze medallist Geraint Thomas (right) One better: Dowsett improved on his silver medal from four years ago at the Delhi 2010 Games . ‘I was down by about 30 per cent power, and Tony Martin (the world champion) beat me by six minutes, which wasn’t easy. I got in the bus after that and burst into tears. It’s nice that things have gone right for this one.’ Dowsett will take part in the road race on Sunday, but the medal that was his No 1 priority is already his. Dennis was second, Geraint Thomas of Wales third. The defending champion David Millar, of Scotland, was eighth. ‘I am the sort of person who questions everything,’ Dowsett added. ‘If my numbers are not right in a session, I get worried. I worry all the time. I can hopefully worry a bit less from now on.’ Sights: Dowsett passes by The Tolbooth on his way to Commonwealth glory . In the women’s race Emma Pooley took her leave of professional time-trialling with a silver medal. Even some old boys from the hard pubs on the city’s Saltmarket came out with their morning pints to watch the spectacle. Pooley was the penultimate rider, setting the fastest time by more than 48 seconds, but was denied victory by Linda Villumsen of New Zealand, the partner of Laura Trott’s elder sister Emma. Pooley, 31, will retire after Sunday’s road race, in which she is expected to support Lizzie Armitstead. She has already turned to the more lucrative pursuit of marathons and triathlons with some success and that is where her future lies. Looking back on a career that included an Olympic silver medal in 2008 and the world title in 2010, Pooley said: ‘I’m absolutely delighted to have had a surprising opportunity. I never expected to be a professional cyclist. You start off with friends who give you lifts to races and who help you sort out your bike. ‘Then you move on to a team where everybody is a volunteer. So many people have helped me. I’m immensely grateful to all of them. I have made some great friends along the way. It has been a huge privilege.’ She had problems with her bike before the race that meant she would have had the use of just one gear but for the team’s mechanics working hard on the repairs.

"By . Taylor Lorenz . Instagram has launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt. The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video.

The app, which functions similar to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favorites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favorites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. ‘We're going to other regions soon, but are starting with handful of countries to make sure we can scale the experience,’ an Instagram spokesman told The Verge. ‘Instagram has 65 percent of its users overseas, so an international launch, while different, is actually not all that out of order with what we do.’ The Instagram representative elaborated that the three countries were selected not only because of their geographical diversity, but also for their tight-knit communities. The app’s launch follows Facebook’s recent foray into ephemeral messaging with Slingshot. Slingshot performs many of the same functions as Bolt (and even includes an identical text editor), however it encourages the user to share photos and videos with many people, not just a single contact. Slingshot also forces you to send a photo before you can before you can view the one you’ve just received. Instagram’s current private sharing mechanism, Instagram Direct, allows for the permanent exchange of photos with up to 15 people at a time. Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The features is regularly used by around 45 million users, however it has failed to catch on the way more standalone messaging apps have. Some experts say that Bolt is actually an attempt to mirror Taptalk, yet another ephemeral messaging service. The Berlin-based company provides a Snapchat-like interface but without the signature countdown clock, user profiles or navigation buttons. In May, Snapchat unveiled its own in-app instant messaging and video chat service. In February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumors that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client. Facebook announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a direct messaging service last December. In May, Snapchat released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger. Both Apple and Facebook have released similar ephemeral messaging services in attempt to capitalize on Snapchat's runaway success. Apple also added the ability to send self-destructing audio and video messages via iMessage. Some say Bolt’s functionality is also similar to Mirage, a one tap messaging app by the makers of Yo. Facebook and Instagram both hope that Bolt will become more successful than Facebook’s previous ill-fated Snapchat clone, Poke. Instagram plans to promote Bolt at the top of every user's Instagram feed. Instagram is already facing problems with its Bolt app with some users accusing the firm of stealing the logo from a San Francisco-based charity called Causes. The app is already facing some problems, however. Andrew Benton, CEO of a free calling app named Bolt has already written a blog post asking Instagram to please consider another name for its app. ‘There is already confusion in the market… Our users have reached out to us, wondering whether we've been acquired or are possibly providing the underlying technology behind your Bolt app. People are searching for Bolt in the Play Store and downloading our app thinking it’s yours,’ he wrote. Facebook and Instagram have also been accused of ripping off the logo for Causes, a charity organization. Regardless, users in the US are already clamoring to get their hands on the service. ‘ugh i want to try bolt but it’s not available in the US,’ Twitter user @samsheffer posted, ‘now i know how it feels’.","The app is only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa .

"By . Associated Press . Whether Pope Francis will visit Philadelphia during a major gathering of the world's Roman Catholics remained a matter of speculation Friday after the archdiocese said a report he would attend should not be considered confirmation. The Catholic News Service had published comments that Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput made Thursday in North Dakota, reporting that he announced at a Mass that 'Pope Francis has told me that he is coming' to the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. The archdiocese, however, cautioned in a statement that Chaput's comments weren't 'official confirmation' and that church officials would expect that to come about six months prior to the event scheduled for September 2015. No confirmation: Pope Francis pictured here in Italy has not yet confirmed whether he will be attending a Roman Catholic's gathering in Philadelphia . 'Archbishop Chaput has frequently shared his confidence in Pope Francis' attendance at the World Meeting and his personal conversations with the Holy Father are the foundation for that confidence,' the statement said. A Vatican spokesman added that although Francis has said 'he is willing' to attend, there is 'no operating plan or preparations underway' for a visit. The popular Francis has yet to visit the U.S. as pope, and the question of whether he will attend the Philadelphia gathering has drawn intense speculation. Popes have attended five of the past seven such conferences around the globe, and Pope Benedict had announced his intention to come when the city was announced as the venue for the gathering. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, noted that Pope Francis has received other invitations to visit North America, including from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who met this week with the Vatican's No. 2 official in Rome, as well as one from Mexico. Benedict made the last papal visit to the U.S. in 2008, a six-day pilgrimage during which he went to Washington and New York. The most recent visit to Philadelphia by a pontiff was in 1979, when Pope John Paul II drew gigantic crowds as part of his first papal tour of the country. The Catholic News Service said it stood by its account of the archbishop's remarks. Uncertainty: Pope Francis has not yet made a visit to the United States and the Roman Catholic community is hoping his will attend a gathering in Philadelphia in September of 2015 .","A Vatican spokesman said that Pope Francis has said 'he is willing' to attend but that there is 'no operating plan .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Arguments stem from the fact that both sides believe they are in the right. But while most people would claim the best way to win one is to try and convince the other party to agree with their views, a new study suggests otherwise. Researchers in Israel discovered that by agreeing with the other person, through extreme examples of their views, can make them reconsider how they feel. To test their theory, the researchers, including graduate students of Professor Eran Halperin, from the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, asked 150 Israeli participants to watch videos. Half were shown clips relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict (Gaza pictured) while the other half were shown neutral adverts . To test their theory, the researchers, including graduate students of Professor Eran Halperin, a psychologist at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, asked 150 Israeli participants to watch videos. To test their theory, the researchers, including graduate students of Professor Eran Halperin, a psychologist at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, asked 150 Israeli participants to watch videos. Half were shown clips relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict, while the other half were shown neutral TV commercials as a control. The clips demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants' beliefs, but these views were portrayed at the very extreme . ‘For example, the fact that they are the most moral society in the world is one of the most basic beliefs of Israeli society,’ Professor Halperin said. But the video clips claimed Israel should continue to take part in the conflict so that its citizens could continue to feel moral. When questioned about their views on the conflict, following months of similar tests, the researchers reported a 30 per cent increase in their willingness to re-evaluate their position compared to the control group. Half were shown clips relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict, while the other half were shown neutral TV commercials as a control. Instead of highlighting how the clips were at odds with Israeli values, the videos instead demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants' beliefs. However, these views were portrayed at the very extreme . ‘For example, the fact that they [believe they are one of] the most moral societies in the world is one of the most basic beliefs of Israeli society,’ Professor Halperin said. But the video clips claimed Israel should continue to take part in the conflict so that its citizens could continue to feel moral. This caused anger among the group. When questioned about their views on the conflict, following months of similar tests, the researchers reported a 30 per cent increase in their willingness to re-evaluate their position compared to the control group. They also took a more neutral stance on common political ideals, and this shift continued even a year after the study had ended. The clips demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants' beliefs, but these views were portrayed at the very extreme. When questioned about their views on the conflict (pro-Palestine march pictured), following months of similar tests, the researchers reported a 30% increase in the willingness of subjects to re-evaluate their views . Arguing with a partner isn't just upsetting - it's also bad for your heart. People who think their partner is unsupportive are more likely to develop heart disease, a study has found. Scientists at the University of Utah found people who claim their spouse is sometimes supportive, but also sometimes upsetting have higher levels of artery calcification. This suggests their arteries are diseased and they are at greater risk of premature death. The scientists attribute this to the fact that the new information caused people to see their views as irrational, according to the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ‘We truly believe that in most intractable conflicts, the real problems are not the real issues,’ said Professor Halperin. In reality, he continued, both sides know what needs to be done but there are many ‘psychological barriers that prevent societies from identifying opportunities for peace.’ ‘You take people's most basic beliefs and turn them into something that is absurd,’ Professor Halperin said. ‘For an outsider, it can sound like a joke, but for them, you are playing with their most fundamental belief.’ The scientists said the method needs to be tested further. They also questioned how to get people to watch videos they find uncomfortable outside of the experiment setting. Students Boaz Hameiri and Roni Porat, who helped run the study, additionally expressed concern at the possibility the videos may assimilate the extreme views into the participant’s beliefs.","Researchers tested their theory using the Israel and Palestine conflict .

"By . Associated Press . The wife and lawyer of Alan Gross, a U.S. government subcontractor serving a 15-year prison sentence in Cuba, said Wednesday they fear for his life even more after his mother's death from cancer last week. In Havana to visit her husband, Judy Gross again urged Washington to do whatever is necessary to secure his release after more than four years behind bars. 'I am extremely worried that Alan is going to do something drastic now that his mother is gone,"" she said in a statement. My husband and I need President Obama to do everything in his power to end this nightmare and bring Alan home from Cuba now.' Incarcerated: American Alan Gross is serving a prison sentence in Havana, Cuba. His mother died last week from lung cancer. Gross was arrested in Cuba in 2009. The Maryland man had been working covertly in Cuba as a subcontractor for the U.S. government's U.S. Agency for International Development. Fearing for his life: Judy Gross, wife of imprisoned U.S. government subcontractor Alan Gross, leaves in a taxi after an interview in Old Havana, Cuba. Gross is in Havana to visit her jailed husband . Gross began a hunger strike in April to protest his confinement and pressure Washington and Havana resolve his case. He ended it after nine days at the request of his mother, Evelyn Gross, who died June 18 in Texas. He has lost more than 100 pounds, is losing vision in his right eye and 'both of his hips are failing,' the statement read. 'I am extremely worried that Alan is becoming more despondent every day,' said Scott Gilbert, the Grosses' U.S. lawyer. ""Both governments need to know that Alan plans to end his life in an effort to end this agony.' U.S. and Cuban officials did not have immediate comment.

Alan Gross launched a hunger strike in April to urge Washington and Havana to strike a deal for his release. He is serving a 15-year sentence . Gross was arrested in 2009 while working to set up unauthorized Internet networks for the island's Jewish community on a contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development, a government entity. He says his activities were no threat to Cuba. But Havana considers such programs an affront to its sovereignty, and Gross was convicted under a statute governing crimes against the state. Cuba has made clear it wants to work out a solution involving three intelligence agents serving long prison terms in the United States on spy-related charges. Washington says the cases are not comparable. Judy Gross suggested that a swap should be on the table, noting the recent exchange of five detainees at Guantanamo for a U.S. soldier held captive in Afghanistan. 'If we can trade five members of the Taliban to bring home one American soldier,' she said, 'surely we can figure out a path forward to bring home one American citizen from a Cuban prison.'","Alan Gross' wife, Judy, visits husband in Cuba a week after his mother's death .

"A New Jersey couple was identified as the victims of a tornado that hit the Cherrystone Family Camping & RV Resort in Northampton. Lord Balatbat and Lolabeth Ortega, both 38, were killed, state police said. Their 13-year-old son has life-threatening injuries. The tornado touched down at the campground on the Chesapeake Bay on Thursday morning killing at least two people and injuring 31. The National Weather Service believes the tornado was an EF1 based on the preliminary investigation, which means winds were between 86 and 110 miles per hour. The Cherrystone Family Camping & RV Resort in rural Northampton County has been evacuated as crews clean up from the massive damage, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. Scroll down for video . Victims: Lord Balatbat, right, and Lolabeth Ortega, left, both 38, were killed in the tornado, state police said .

Peter Glagola described the patient as 'very critical.' Riverside Regional also treated 26 others. Another patient was taken to Sentara Virginia Beach General, and two others were taken to Sentara Norfolk General, according to WAVY. Officials have not released any details about the identities of the victims at this point. Police said 1,328 campers and 40 staff members were at the campground when the tornado hit. State Police say trees crashed onto several campers, causing some to overturn. Troopers also found numerous downed trees and power lines across roads. Around 150 to 175 people lost their shelter and are being bussed to a nearby school for shelter, while authorities search the site for any additional injured persons.

"By . Associated Press . A former Utah airline pilot was sentenced Wednesday to more than two years in prison for groping a 14-year-old girl in the seat next to him during an off-duty flight. Michael James Pascal, 46, of Park City, appeared in federal court Wednesday in Salt Lake City. He wore a navy blue suit and had close-cropped hair. 'Whatever the sentence is, I will accept it,' he told the judge, saying he hoped to be a good father during his time in prison. Former Utah airline pilot Michael Pascal was sentenced Wednesday to more than two years in prison for groping a 14-year-old girl in the seat next to him during an off-duty flight . On the October 2013 Delta Airlines flight, the teenager awoke from a nap and felt Pascal's hand under her, gripping her buttocks, she said, according to court documents. She elbowed him and yelled, 'What the hell are you doing?' the records show. Earlier, she said, she had pushed down the armrest between them but when she woke up, someone had pushed it upright, she said. Pascal pulled his hand out from under her, she recounted, saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was asleep, I have to use the bathroom.' Pascal told investigators he fell asleep with his hands in his lap and couldn't recall where his hand was when he awoke. He said he had lifted the armrest between him and the girl because the man on his other side was taking up a lot of room. His attorney Rhome Zabriskie maintained that any contact was inadvertent and that Pascal was asleep. 'When he woke up, he realized he had kind of flopped over on the passenger next to him,' he said when Pascal was charged in 2013. The girl, who was flying alone on the Detroit to Salt Lake City flight, told attendants and changed seats. On the October 2013 Delta Airlines flight, the teenager awoke from a nap and felt Pascal's hand under her, gripping her buttocks, she said, according to court documents . She said Pascal earlier in the flight helped her retrieve a blanket from the flight crew after he saw she was on crutches. After she moved, she said, she saw Pascal looking at her in an 'annoyed' manner, court documents show. Pascal lost his job with a regional airline carrier, a Delta Airlines contractor, when he was charged in 2013. In March, a jury convicted him on two counts of abusive sexual contact related to the incident. 'He has suffered an awful lot and it will continue,' Zabriskie said Wednesday. Pascal has an 18-year-old daughter of his own and maintained that he was asleep. A Delta spokesman previously told The Associated Press that the airline cooperated with investigators but declined further comment. Judge U.S. Magistrate Dale Kimball ordered Pascal to turn himself into to authorities on Sept. 30. He is set to serve his sentence in Colorado, where he has family, and to serve 60 months of probation afterward.","Michael James Pascal, 46, has maintained any contact with the girl was accidental .

Cameron needs the support of British citizens and returning this money would send a good message.’ Mr Cameron has faced growing criticism after it emerged that Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Russian deputy finance minister, won a bid for the ‘ultimate tennis match’ at a Conservative fundraising event. Tory officials insist the money will not be handed back and say she is now a British citizen. They also insist her husband Vladimir fell out with Putin after being dismissed from his job in charge of a state-run bank. Yesterday, however, party sources were quoted as saying the tennis match is ‘stuck in the locker room’ and may never take place. There has been a new scrutiny over donations from those linked to Russian president Mr Putin after the EU threatened new sanctions in reaction to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Labour leader Ed Miliband said yesterday the Tories have ‘questions to answer’ over the money they were accepting in donations from wealthy Russians. Eight years ago: Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) died in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium by two ex-KGB colleagues . Figures from the Electoral Commission suggest that Conservatives have taken more than £161,000 from people with links to the Kremlin, and Labour has calculated they have received almost £1million from Russians in general. ‘David Cameron does have questions to answer on the money that he’s taking from Russian oligarchs, on the bidding for a tennis match, all of that stuff,’ Mr Miliband told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. 'If David Cameron doesn’t want to appear like he is being bought, I think he should return this money' Marina Litvinenko . ‘Frankly, he can’t stand up one minute and say that “this is the biggest issue and we’re going to take the right action”. He’s got to really look very, very carefully at who he is getting money from.’ Mrs Litvinenko, speaking about broader donations from wealthy oligarchs, said: ‘You never know who is behind these Russian businessmen. You need to be very careful whose money it is. You must be absolutely sure because many Russians are not free from the Russian government.’ A Tory spokesman said there had been no change on plans for the tennis match, adding: ‘All donations are transparent, permissible and done under the rules set out by the Electoral Commission.’ Conservatives: Mrs Litvinenko criticised the Tories for taking the money in return for Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Mayor of London Boris Johnson (right) playing a tennis match . Mr Cameron does not believe Russia should . be humiliated by being stripped of the right to host the 2018 World Cup . – but warned he is ‘not surprised’ critics are beginning to raise the . issue. Downing Street said the Prime Minister was not supporting an ‘immediate’ boycott after Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said it was ‘unthinkable’ for the tournament to be played there if Mr Putin continues with his ‘belligerent behaviour’. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, also stopped short of calling for the World Cup to be moved, but urged governing body FIFA to draw up contingency plans for it to be held elsewhere. FIFA, however, has ruled out a boycott, insisting the tournament is a ‘force for good’ and should not be influenced by global politics. But in the wake of the downing of flight MH17, Mr Clegg said stripping Russia of major sporting events would be a ‘very potent political and symbolic sanction’. ‘Vladimir Putin himself has to understand that he can’t have his cake and eat it,’ Mr Clegg told the Sunday Times. ‘He can’t constantly push the patience of the international community beyond breaking point, destabilise a neighbouring country, protect these armed separatists in the east of Ukraine and still have the privilege and honour of receiving  all the accolades in 2018 for being the host nation of the World Cup.’","Marina Litvinenko calls on Conservatives to return a £160,000 donation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Colorado woman walked down the aisle on Saturday in a wedding that almost didn't happen after the bride and her maid of honor were forced to jump from the third floor of their apartment after the building caught fire just five days before she was scheduled to tie the knot. Lenise Brown and best friend Marilyn Kruc survived the massive blaze at their Copper Terrace Apartment complex in Centennial - just south of Denver - but Kruc broke her back while jumping from the apartment, and neither woman knew whether she'd be able to stand by her friend's side as she said her vows until the morning of the wedding. Wearing a back brace, Kruc was by her best friend's side during Saturday's ceremony. Lucky: Bride Lenise Brown is walked down the aisle by her father, Greg Ruff, just days after she survived a fire by jumping from her third floor apartment . Destroyed: The massive blaze completely destroyed several units in the apartment building where Brown lived with her best friend Marilyn Kruc . 'I would consider her my sister.  I just have brothers so she’s the . closest thing I have to a sister and I’m just so proud of her for her . courage and her strength,' Brown tells 7News Denver. 'For her [to make] that trip, I know it was . hard, it means a lot to us.' Luckily, Brown only suffered burns to her hands and face, but nothing serious enough to keep her from marrying her now-husband, Sam Brown. 'It’s been the craziest montage of everything, it’s been really hard and . it’s been stressful but we’re here and Marilyn made it and we’re . married,' Sam Brown said. The fire broke out in the apartment building about 1 a.m. on June 23. Within minutes, firefighters were on the scene battling the enormous flames and trying to rescue people trying to get out of the building. Lucky: Brown only suffered minor burns to her face and arms during her escape from the massive blaze . Maid of honor: Kruc attended the wedding and walked down the aisle with the help of a walker and back brace . By the time the fire was under control, eight people had been injured by either the flames or from jumping from the building. The roof and several apartments were completely gutted by the inferno, which authorities are now investigating as possible arson. Eight of the apartment in the 24-unit building were completely destroyed, while ten others suffered smoke and water damage, Becky O'Guin, a spokeswoman with South Metro Fire Rescue Authority, told the Denver Post. Of the injuries, Kruc's was the most serious - she suffered two broken vertebrae in her lower back and underwent surgery hours after the fire. Both women were terrified. Happily married: Both Brown and her husband, Sam Brown, were honored that Kruc made it to the wedding after breaking her back just days earlier . Arson: Detectives are investigating the fire - that injured 8 and destroyed much of the building - as possible arson . 'I just am glad I was with her in this moment because if we were to die, . I was with my best friend,' Lenise Brown told 7NEWS shortly after the blaze. The father of the bride, Greg Ruff, was happy to give his daughter away following the near-tragic incident. 'The toasts are a little higher.  I never had doubt the wedding wouldn't happen,' Ruff said.","Lenise Brown and best friend - and maid of honor - Marilyn Kruc survived the blaze, but Kruc broke her back jumping from their burning, Colorado apartment .

"By . Charles Martland . The Anfield redevelopment project reached another milestone on Thursday after the demolition of the final two houses on one side of the ground. The buildings in Lothair Road, situated behind the main stand of Liverpool's 46,000 capacity ground, were brought down by bulldozers to mark the completion of another phase of the project. Milestone: The last remained terraced house on Lothair Road awaits demolition on Wednesday . Old for new: The buildings in Lothair Road are situated behind the main stand of the 46,000 capacity ground . Liverpool City Council, in conjunction with the football club, aim to redevelop and regenerate the community around Anfield by mid-2016. The £260 million project aims to create refurbished or new housing, a multi-use park space and greater numbers of commercial and retail premises. Crucial to the project is the expansion of the stadium, which will see Liverpool play in front of almost 60,000 fans from the start of the 2016-17 season. The development remains controversial, even if it has received the endorsement of the vast majority of residents and officials. Some residents remain uncertain as to what benefit they will get from the project and are disappointed by the lack of communication they have received from the council throughout the demolition process. The future: Liverpool's plans for Anfield will see the capacity grow to almost 60,000 . Expansion: The main stand will house an extra 8,500 seats and the Anfield Road stand will take another 4,800 . Margaret Sheilds, speaking to the Liverpool Echo earlier this year, claimed she has been 'left in limbo' by the council. She feels that 'everything is to suit the Anfield stadium and Liverpool FC,' as opposed to the future of the surrounding community and its residents. Indeed in May Liverpool City Council had to consider seeking compulsory purchase powers in order to acquire the final few properties owned by those less keen to sell up. On the other hand many see this latest demolition phase as another step forward in an exciting project, with one property owner in the area told the Echo 'people are happy again,' since the commencement of the redevelopment work. Moving on up: Liverpool finished second in the Premier League and will hope to continue that success . The football club will benefit from a greatly increased capacity. Brendan Rodgers led the Reds to Champions League football last season, with the team narrowly missing out on winning a first league title since 1990. The Reds boss will be relishing the possibility of European nights in front of an additional 15,000 supporters after the completion of the project. The fact that the club are remaining at Anfield, rather than finding somewhere to build a new stadium is also seen as a significant benefit of the upheaval in the area. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes the club’s rich history will be consolidated within an improved Anfield. He said in 2012: 'A lot of history and important things have happened at Anfield and I think it is fantastic Liverpool are staying there.'","Buildings in Lothair Road demolished as redevelopment gathers pace .

"Barcelona's new head coach Luis Enrique has paid tribute to the influence of his old boss Sir Bobby Robson, on the fifth anniversary of the former England manager's death. The Football Association have marked the anniversary with the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day and a grassroots event next to Ipswich's Portman Road. Enrique, meanwhile, who has brought his Barcelona team to train at St George's Park near Burton, has spoken out about Robson. Respect: Luis Enrigue has paid tribute to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson . He told www.thefa.com: 'As a manager, he had very clear ideas, with an attacking concept of play and an easy and clear philosophy. His natural way of doing things, being very spontaneous, being capable of managing a group, being able to adapt himself to the high expectations of a big team with different circumstances. 'I remember that at half-time he used to grab some plastic glasses to show us the tactics and movements he wanted to see. He was a very talented and easy going person.' It was Enrique's first season as a player at the club too and for that he reason he has special memories of Robson. Memories: Enrique played for Barcelona under Robson in the 1990s . 'It was a year where we won three trophies, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Kings Cup, one Spanish Super Cup,' he added. 'It was a difficult season because it was the year after [Johan] Cruyff had left, and Barcelona decided to sign the services of Robson and his great experience. I think he reached the full expectations. 'I used to appreciate his words of praise, because it was my first year at Barcelona, a very important year for me, and I have to say, I always had a good relationship with him and he always had good things to say about me and that's always nice.' FA general secretary Alex Horne said Sir Bobby epitomised the values of the FA. Man in charge: Robson was manager of Barca in the 90s and worked with Jose Mourinho . He said: 'Sir Bobby Robson encapsulated so much in his career that resonates with the FA. 'He always made player and coach development a priority right through his career and that epitomises what the FA are there for, nurturing footballers and coaches from the bottom of the pyramid right through to the top.' The FA presented a £25,000 cheque to his widow Lady Elsie Robson, for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation which has so far raised more than £7million to fund developments to fight cancer. She said: 'We've achieved far more than we ever expected. He would be astonished to know what we've achieved and what we've done with the money. It unites people who are interested in football and affected by cancer. It unites them somehow across our region and beyond.'","Sir Bobby Robson died in 2009 .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . If the adornments to Moeen Ali’s left wrist have been causing flutters at the ICC, it was the stuff propelled by his right one that briefly did for the Indians in Southampton on Tuesday. While the world of cricket was having its say on the rights and wrongs of the ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands worn by Moeen on Monday, the man himself was busy profiting from the tourists’ apparent urge to self-destruct on the third afternoon of this south coast slow-burner. Moeen is very much England’s fifth bowler, an off-spinner so tantalisingly poised between frontline and part-time that Alastair Cook doesn’t seem sure how to handle him. To judge by events either side of tea, the confusion had spread to India’s middle order. Hands free! Moeen Ali got over his wrist bands controversy to chip in with two wickets at the Ageas Bowl . Slap on the wrist! The ICC has banned Moeen Ali from wearing pro-Palestine wristbands while playing for England . In the penultimate over before the break, the supremely gifted Rohit Sharma took leave of his senses — as he has been known to in the past — and drove Moeen straight to Stuart Broad at mid-off. Then, in the third over after tea, Ajinkya Rahane spoiled the effect of a gutsy half-century by top- edging an inviting long hop straight to midwicket. From 210 for four, India — a nation that traditionally produces some of the world’s best players of spin — were 217 for six, still 359 behind. Moeen’s brief England career has already raised the possibility of an identity crisis. Is he the master of self-denial who almost saved a Test by himself against Sri Lanka, or the flighty No 6 with an issue against the short ball? And are his  off-breaks designed to hold up an end — or take wickets? Some of the names among his 12 Test victims so far suggest the part-time tag is too hastily applied. He has removed Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara twice, plus five of India’s top eight on show in this Test. As for chips to mid-off and miscued half-trackers, didn’t Shane Warne take the occasional wicket with a bad ball? ‘He picked up a couple of freakish wickets,’ said Stuart Broad. ‘But that was off the pressure he developed. And he was unlucky not to have Ajinkya Rahane caught down the leg side. Hopefully the wicket will deteriorate in the second innings, and Moeen could be a bit of a handful. Self destruct mode: Rohit Sharma shows his frustration after losing a 'freak wicket' against Moeen Ali . High five: Moeen Ali celebrates after India batsman Rohit Sharma is caught out by Stuart Broad . ‘We’ve been so fortunate having Graeme Swann play over 60 Tests for us. When you’re playing with him, perhaps you don’t realise what role he played. But Moeen’s developing every game as a spin bowler.’ England will miss Swann for a while yet, and Moeen’s misfortune has been to invite unfair comparisons with his country’s greatest modern off-spinner. But Swann would have settled for Moeen’s spell either side of tea of  12-0-33-2. The jury may be out on Moeen’s batting, if only because he keeps getting in a tangle against the bouncer. But his off-breaks are getting into a groove. And if that means the odd lucky break, Swann would definitely approve. Practice makes perfect: Moeen Ali is developing as a spin bowler in every games, says Stuart Broad .","England restricted India to 328-8 on day three of the Third Test .

Booth's view of day three of the third Test between England and India at . the Ageas Bowl, which saw James Anderson and Stuart Broad step up to the plate. KUMAR'S CAUGHT OUT EARLY . England were celebrating a rare moment when they nipped an innings from No 9 Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the bud. Caught via his pad by a lunging Gary . Ballance for 19, Kumar had been dismissed for fewer than 50 for only the . second time in five innings this series. Thumbs up: Ian Bell leaves the field  after injuring his thumb attempting a catch during day three . ... BUT IT'S THUMBS UP FOR BELL . Ian Bell, back in form since Monday’s elegant 167, caused a scare when he went for an X-ray after being hit on the left thumb while fielding in the slips in the morning. But there was no break and with England insisting his injury was limited to ‘acute bruising’, Bell remained off the field for treatment. PUJARA AND KOHLI DON'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS . The two Indian batsmen England feared most before the series started were Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli. But their respective contributions yesterday of 24 and 39 meant the pair have managed just one half-century between them in this series from 10 innings. Don't believe the hype! Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli have not lived up to their reputations . STOKES PUTS TOGETHER A ROYAL INNINGS . Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes was dropped for this Test because his batting had disintegrated, so the selectors will have noted with relief the 56-ball 50 he made against Kent in the 50-over Royal London Cup. That’s an improvement on the 18 runs he had managed in his previous 10 innings for England in all formats, including six ducks. COOK AND ANDERSON EQUAL RECORD DOUBLE ACT . When Jimmy Anderson had Kohli caught in the slips not long after lunch, it was the 22nd time Alastair Cook had clung on from his bowling. That equalled the England record for a bowler/non-wicketkeeper combination, now shared with Sir Ian Botham and Bob Willis. Double act: James Anderson (L) and Alistair Cook have equalled England's record for bowler/non-wicketkeeper combination . 500 PARTNERSHIP FOR ANDERSON AND BROAD . Another partnership milestone was brought up by Anderson’s removal of Ravindra Jadeja — the 500th Test wicket claimed by him and Stuart Broad in Tests they have played together. Only two pairings stand in front of them: West India’s Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose took 762 between them and Pakistan’s Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis 559.","Kumar was dimissed for less than 50 for only second time in his career .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Sentences totalling 134 years have been handed down to an eight-strong gang who killed a mother and her three children when their home was mistakenly set alight in a botched revenge attack. Tristan Richards, 22, was told he would serve a minimum of 35 years for his part in the murders of Shehnila Taufiq, 47, daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamal, 15. His accomplice Kemo Porter, 19, was given a 25 year minimum term. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Guilty: (Left to right top row) Tristan Richards, Kemo Porter, Shaun Carter, Nathaniel Mullings, (bottom row left to right) Aaron Webb, Jackson Powell, Akeem Jeffers and Cairo Parker, who received sentences totalling 134 years today at Nottingham Crown Court for killing a mother and her three children in a botched revenge attack . They were convicted at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday after a two-month trial during which the jury heard that the family died when their home in Wood Hill, Leicester, was mistakenly set alight in what police called a 'misguided and impulsive' attack last September. The killers had intended to target a different house in Wood Hill, Leicester, as they sought to avenge the fatal stabbing of a friend hours earlier. There were sobs from the public gallery as Mr Justice John Griffith Williams read out the sentences. Jamal Tauriq, left and his brother Bilal both died in the blaze, along with their mother Shehnila and sister Zainab . Mrs Taufiq's husband, consultant neurosurgeon Dr Muhammed Taufiq Sattar, survived because he was working in Dublin at the time of the tragedy . Distraught: Dr Taufiq Al Sattar (centre) praying over the coffins of his family . Mourning: The coffins of Dr Sattar's family, who died in an arson attack in September last year . The judge said it was a 'premeditated and planned attack'. 'The defendants were out for really significant revenge', he said. He said Richards had gone to the scene with the petrol and Porter with the lighter. 'The horror of what then happened is all too apparent,' the judge said. 'The quantity of petrol and the pouring of petrol through the letterbox provide the evidence the plan was that the house was to be consumed by fire, which took hold instantly and spread upstairs. 'There was, and could not have been, any escape from that ferocious fire,' he added. Tragic: The scene of the fatal house fire in Wood Hill, Leicester . Six other men who were cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter over the deaths were also each handed jail terms at the court today. They are Shaun Carter, 24, of Franche Road, Leicester; Nathaniel Mullings, 19, of Farringdon Street, Northfield, Leicester; Jackson Powell, 20, of Burnside Road, Leicester; Aaron Webb, 20, of Saltersford Road, Leicester; Akeem Jeffers, 21, of Carr Mills, Buslingthorpe, Leeds and 17-year-old Cairo Parker, from Leicester. Carter was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Mullings was handed 15 years detention in a young offender institution. Webb, Powell and Jeffers were each sentenced to 12 years behind bars. Parker, on account of his age, was given eight years detention. There were tears from the public gallery as the remaining sentences were read out. During the trial, the court heard that football coach Antoin Akpom, 20, had been stabbed in the back in a 'confrontation'’ involving two 19-year-olds at around 5.30pm on September 12, less than a mile away in Kent Street. He was pronounced dead in hospital at 7pm. Hussain Hussain, 19, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years for Mr Akpom’s murder following a trial at Stafford Crown Court earlier this year with the tariff since upgraded to 22 years. The trial against the eight defendants at Nottingham Crown Court heard they had intended to target the house of another man who they believed had been involved in the confrontation. But they got the wrong house and around 12.30am on September 13, petrol was poured through the letterbox of the Taufiq family home and ignited. Mrs Taufiq’s husband, a neurosurgeon, was working in Ireland at the time of the fatal blaze. The jury heard Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar, who had sat in court throughout the trial, had spoken to his family just an hour before the fire broke out. The judge today praised Dr Taufiq saying his dignified presence throughout the trial had been 'remarkable'. 'He told in the most moving of terms his loss, its effect upon him and his dedication to complete, in their memory, the family goal of setting up a community centre in Dublin,' the judge said. 'He too is a victim of what he described as a ‘heartless, malicious act’,' he added. Speaking outside court, Dr Taufiq said: 'I’m satisfied at the sentence and I accept everything. 'My family is with me 24/7 spiritually and these are the main motives for me. My own belief, religion, my God and my family are with me and these are the main motives for me to continue which I have been doing for the last nine months and will continue until my last breath. 'I’m going back to Dublin tonight where I will continue working at the hospital as well as helping at the community centre.' He said that he had decided to sell the house in Leicester, which had been uninsured at the time of the blaze.","Gang of eight mistakenly set alight a home in Wood Hill, Leicester .

The poster girl of Glasgow 2014 was beaten to the title by Kaliese Spencer, the favourite, coming home in 55.02 seconds, with the Jamaican taking a dominant win in 54.10secs. The 27-year-old, whose pictures are plastered on billboards across the city, was greeted by deafening cheers from a packed crowd amid a sea of Saltires inside the national stadium. Joy: Scotland's Eilidh Child wins 400m hurdles silver on home soil at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow .

Streaming clear: Child was comfortably ahead of the bronze medal position in the final of the 400m hurdles . Hurdling: Child looks focused as she makes her way around the track during the 400m hurdles final . She and Spencer both went off hard, but it was the latter who had established a clear lead coming into the home straight and Child could not close the gap. Running from lane six, with Spencer three inside her, Child knew she had to go out hard. The tension was increased when, with the athletes in their blocks, a sudden noise inside the stadium prompted laughter and the athletes had to stand up. Child still held her nerve and her form, but it was not enough to upstage the classy Spencer, the world number one this year. Jessica Ennis-Hill, who experienced the pressure of being the 'face' of a Games at London 2012, was quick to congratulate Child, saying on Twitter: 'Congratulation!! Brilliant run! Lots of pressure and pulled it out the bag :) Enjoy celebrating!' Despite winning Commonwealth silver in Delhi four years ago, the Hearts fan has spent her career largely in the shadow of Perri Shakes-Drayton. The Londoner beat her to the British title in for three years running from 2011 before Child finally upgraded to gold this year, in the absence of her injured rival. Child reached the semi-finals at London 2012 before coming home fifth at last year's World Championships in Moscow, but even that achievement was overshadowed by the serious knee injury suffered by Shakes-Drayton in the same race. Hugs: Child looks on in disbelief having claimed a Commonwealth silver medal in the 400m hurdles final . Patriotic: Child walks around the Hampden Park track holding a Scottish Saltire in her hand after the final . But Child demonstrated her credentials with an impressive win in the Diamond League meeting on this very track earlier this month and the Edinburgh University graduate was able to add another medal to her collection. The gods appeared to be smiling on Child when the heavens opened to deliver some typical Scottish weather, but it had eased by the time she took to the track and Spencer was not affected. Child said: 'I will cherish this silver medal because I'm happy with the way I performed. 'It wasn't the fastest race I've run but there was a lot of expectation and I've coped with that. 'I always said I can't control what other people can do - that's the reality in sport. I tried to shut out the crowd a bit beforehand and concentrate on what I had to do. 'Afterwards it was amazing and the lap of honour was something very special.'

"By . Mike Dawes . England's Scott Fitzgerald made an early impression in the welterweight division at the Commonwealth Games after wobbling St Lucia's Ron Bastien inside the first five seconds of the opening round. The Preston man rammed home a left hook which sent his opponent reeling backwards into the ropes, and fired the same shot early in the third to score a conclusive stoppage win. Fitzgerald said: 'It is great to get in there and when I knocked him down early it gave me confidence. I looked for it a bit too much to begin with but in the end I got him.' But there was disappointment for the first home nation boxer Lewis Benson, who dropped a split decision to Bowyn Morgan of New Zealand. Benson was wobbled by a left hook midway through round two and despite a gutsy display he could not do enough to haul back the points deficit.

"By . Mike Dawes . Athletics Australia's British head coach Eric Hollingsworth has been sent home from the Commonwealth Games after his outspoken attack on Olympic sprint hurdles champion Sally Pearson. Hollingsworth labelled Pearson, who is the defending champion in Glasgow, a 'bad example', highlighting his anger that she did not attend the team's pre-Games training camp. Australian Commonwealth Games Association chef de mission Steve Moneghetti announced at a press conference on Thursday morning that Hollingsworth had been stripped of his accreditation and would travel back to Australia at the earliest opportunity. Heading home: Australia head coach Eric Hollingsworth has been forced to leave the Commonwealth Games . Moneghetti said: 'There was a breach in our team agreement with one of our members of the team, specifically the head coach of the athletics section. 'We invited that person in to explain that breach in the contract and we decided that there was reason enough to impost some sanctions on the actions taken by Eric Hollingsworth and we then spoke to the section manager from athletics to decide on an appropriate sanction. 'As a result of that Athletics Australia withdrew Eric's nomination as head coach of the athletics section of the Australia's Commonwealth Games team and this led to us revoking his accreditation. We've made arrangements for Eric to travel back to Australia at an appropriate time. 'He is going home today, if we can get some flights arranged.

"England goalkeeper Ben Foster has signed a new four-year deal with West Brom, the Barclays Premier League club have announced. The 31-year-old, who joined the Baggies permanently in 2012, also has an option for a further 12 months and is now effectively tied to the Hawthorns outfit until 2019. Foster has just returned from the World Cup where he won his eighth cap in the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica. Happy: West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster has extended his contract with the club until 2019 . 'This is fantastic news for everyone connected with the club as Ben’s an extremely important player for us - both on and off the pitch,' said head coach Alan Irvine. 'He’s a great personality, a great character and leads by example. 'This is a magnificent signing for the club. 'Ben is one of the best keepers in the country, which he showed when he played really well for England against Costa Rica at the World Cup. 'Ben is extremely professional, which is infectious in training, as he demands high standards of himself and others.' Big stage: Foster was part of England's 2014 World Cup squad and played against Costa Rica . Foster initially signed for Albion on a season-long loan from midlands rivals Birmingham in 2011, keeping 10 clean sheets in 37 appearances and earning himself a full-time move. And the former Manchester United stopper is now hoping he can end his career at the Hawthorns. 'When I signed here permanently, I said this is the sort of club I could see myself finishing my career at,' he said. 'And that’s exactly how I felt when the club said they wanted to negotiate a new contract. 'It was something I wanted to get sorted as soon as possible. I’m very happy here. 'It was a very obvious and easy decision for me and my family.' Settled: Foster has talked about finishing his career at West Brom . Foster began his professional career at Stoke but never made an appearance for the Potters, instead going out on a series of loan moves before a 2005 transfer to United. Two seasons on loan at Watford followed and while Foster was touted by many to be Edwin van der Sar’s replacement at Old Trafford, he could never displace the Dutchman and moved to Birmingham in 2010. Relegation followed in 2011, prompting a move back to the top flight and the Hawthorns.

"By . Mike Collett, Reuters . HNK Rijeka have issued a strongly-worded statement denying any racism during Tuesday's abandoned friendly match against Manchester City's Under 21s. Rijeka youth coach Ranko Buteka also denied any of his players racially insulted any City player during the game, saying City coach Patrick Vieira may have led his team off at half-time because Rijeka were too strong for them. The game was stopped after an alleged incident of racist abuse against City's 19-year-old French midfielder Seko Fofana just before the break. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Seko Fofana score a 30 yard screamer for Manchester City U21s . Alleged abuse: Seko Fofana in action during an Under 21 match against Chelsea last season at the Etihad . Making his point: Patrick Vieira insisted City's players left the field after the alleged incident . Fofana had been shown a red card for an off-the-ball incident just before the match was abandoned. Vieira, City's elite development coach, then led his players off after Fofana was allegedly abused by one of the Rijeka team. Rijeka were leading the match, played in Novigrad, western Croatia, 1-0, when the incident happened. 'After our first goal, we expected more pressure from City but we remained the dominant team in all departments and had several opportunities to score again,' Buketa told Croatia's national news agency Hina. Stopped: The match is abandoned as Vieira leads his team off the pitch in Croatia . Taking a stand: Patrick Vieira (third left) walked on to the pitch after hearing what may have happened . 'They responded with more aggression, which resulted in a red card for them. While the first tougher tackle on Dangubic could be classified as reckless, the really violent tackle on Marko Marcius only a minute later was unjustifiable, so the Manchester midfielder was rightly sent off. 'What ensued was something rarely seen, even in friendly games. 'The Manchester coach, Patrick Vieira, entered the pitch, discussed something with the referee and then, to the utter surprise of the packed stadium, withdrew his team from the pitch. The reasons are known only to him. 'Perhaps he had expected an easier rival, against whom they could easily dominate and easily score, but this wasn't the case against us.' In a statement carried by Hina, the club rejected any racist allegations. 'We strongly reject unfounded racism allegations mentioned in the statement Manchester City has posted on its website and want to stress that Rijeka itself had six players from Nigeria on the team. 'We also want to point out that HNK Rijeka, in cooperation with FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe), has been supporting the campaign against racism for years and we strongly condemn every such incident. Seeing red: Fofana was sent off for kicking out at his opponent as the players come together . Flashpoint: Fofana (No 8) kicked out at a NHK Rijeka player after being allegedly racially abused . 'We are very unpleasantly surprised by the serious and unfounded allegations, which we entirely reject.' In an updated statement on their website, City said the match was abandoned for an 'alleged incident of racial abuse.' 'Details remain sketchy at this stage, but club representatives in Croatia and Manchester are liaising with officials, match organisers and the Croatian FA to pursue this matter fully.' UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has fined the Croatian FA for racism in the past, most notably at Euro 2012 when the country's fans racially abused Italian Mario Balotelli. Croatian fans were also cited for displaying far-right flags and symbols at the World Cup in Brazil but were not fined by FIFA, world soccer's governing body.","Croatian side say alleged incident of racist abuse at 19-year-old Fofana is 'unfounded'

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Max Whitlock produced an immaculate performance to win Commonwealth gold and then declared he was in hot pursuit of the man considered by many to be the greatest gymnast of all time. The high bar creaked as Whitlock flew round it like a rotator blade, before sticking his landing without so much as a stray toenail. It was the final faultless act in an almost perfect round of competition which saw him run away with the all-around title, beating his British team-mates Daniel Keatings and Nile Wilson into silver and bronze medal positions, respectively. Whitlock, who won the team title on Tuesday, could conceivably take seven medals home from Glasgow, with five individual finals to come over the next two days, and he is a genuine gold-medal prospect in three of them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Commonwealth Games: Day 7 review . Commonwealth champion: Max Whitlock holds up his gold medal at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow . Still friends: Scotland's Dan Keatings, left, congratulates Whitlock after his superb performance . The 21-year-old, one of the seven athletes whom Sportsmail and the National Lottery are following on the road to Rio, registered a total score of 90.631 in a performance which a deeply impressed Beth Tweddle lauded as ‘absolutely world class’. But Whitlock will not rest on his laurels and said he had set his sights on challenging Japan’s reigning Olympic and six-time world champion, Kohei Uchimura. ‘I have been trying to push towards him,’ said Whitlock. ‘It’s an honour to be in the same sentence as that guy. He’s been my absolute idol my whole gymnastics career.’ For many years, gymnastics has been transmitted to the wider British public by Tweddle and Louis Smith, both of whom were at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro Arena to cheer on Whitlock. But Tweddle claimed Whitlock has replaced the pair as the new face of gymnastics in Britain. ‘I think he already has (taken over the mantle),’ she said. ‘After London 2012 he was a double bronze medallist and I don’t think he truly realised what he had achieved. Since then he has been building on that success and he is definitely a star. ‘He was totally world class today,’ added Tweddle. ‘He had all the pressure on him leading into these championships. It was his to lose, there is no doubt about that. It was always going to be who would come second and third, as long as Max had a nice day in the gym.’ Hoop dreams: Whitlock strains his muscles to make the leap between hoops during his gold-winning display . Steady: The English gymnast scored an impressive 90.631 across the six apparatus to win gold . Unlikely hero: Azman paid the price for a tricky routine in the men's 1m springboard diving . With a drawstring plastic bag containing his chalk slung over his shoulder, Whitlock walked between apparatus with all the nonchalance of a schoolchild heading to PE class. On the vault, where he was trying out a more testing routine, he took a half stumble on landing, a minor blemish on an otherwise sublime day. But the gold medal was effectively sealed with Whitlock two points clear before he had even moved on to the high bar, the final test of power, poise and nerve. By the time his Games finishes on Friday, Whitlock will have endured five straight days of intense competition. ‘I’m really tired,’ he admitted. ‘It’s really hard actually but you know, you need to make sure you get the right food, the right rest and keep that adrenaline going. And wait until the end to celebrate.’ They call it the Friendly Games and the camaraderie between the home nation gymnasts was clear. Whitlock was embraced by a beaming Keatings when his winning score flashed on to the big screen. His England team-mate Nile Wilson, 18, who took bronze with a score of 87.965, was also on hand to offer his congratulations. Wilson, in his first senior competition, nailed the parallel bars and looks likely to follow Whitlock as a star of the all-around in the future. ‘He is unbelievable,’ said Tweddle. ‘In May he picked up five gold medals in the junior ranks and it is a big step to go to seniors but he has taken it in his stride. To have three from the home nations on the podium truly puts British gymnastics on the world stage.’ VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 7 review .

'There were moments when I thought my body was not going to make it, even though you want to, and bits are falling off. 'They changed the rules recently, and that affected my judo, which put doubts in my head, but as I started getting fitter again, I made the decision I was going to compete, and if I was going to compete, then I was going to be as fit as possible, today (Friday) I could not have felt better.' Yeats-Brown, who trains at British Judo's Walsall Centre of Excellence was also a late call-up to England's squad because of injury to Caroline Kinnane. She said: 'I was meant to be doing Laser Quest today - I'd choose a Commonwealth medal over Laser Quest. 'I got the call on Tuesday morning at seven.

In the women's one-length butterfly contest, Scotland's Corrie Scott continued her nation's fine start to the swimming action as she claimed bronze. Twelfth four years ago in Dehli, the 20-year-old from Bellshill claimed a podium place with a time of 30.75 secs as Australia's Leiston Pickett beat Alia Atkinson of Jamaica to the gold. The delighted Scott said: 'If someone had told me this time last year that I would get a bronze medal, I would have laughed in their face and said no way. 'I can't believe it. I need to watch it back. My swimming is my good bit, my dive and my finish are not so good bits, there is always stuff to work on.'

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Blood smeared across his face from his nose to his left ear, it was a fitting image to mark Nemanja Vidic’s last game for Manchester United. This is one warrior who was always likely to go out on his shield. The flailing arm from Southampton’s Rickie Lambert was far from the first time Vidic has taken one for the team, nor will it be the last as he changes colours and heads for Inter Milan after more than eight years at Old Trafford. In a country known for tough defenders, Italy is about to inherit one of the toughest. Brave: Vidic fittingly bowed out with a bloodied nose after United's draw at Southampton . United have had their fair share of them down the years: think Gordon McQueen, Kevin Moran, Steve Bruce and Jaap Stam. The Serbian has raised the bar even higher. ‘He puts his head where people are scared to put their feet,’ said teammate Robin van Persie after Vidic played his last game at Old Trafford. ‘That’s Nemanja. He wants to die for the cause, in a good way. He is very brave, a great player and he’s won everything at Manchester United.’ From the moment Vidic arrived for £7million in the 2006 January transfer window, the first signing of the Glazer era, it was clear that United had found themselves a true leader – someone who had captained Red Star Belgrade to the Serbian title at a young age before enhancing his fearsome reputation at Spartak Moscow. Flying high: Vidic chipped in with more than his fair share of goals for United over the years . There were childhood tales of growing up in Uzice, a town one hundred miles from Belgrade that was targeted for American and NATO bombing raids. United fans embraced the legend, even though heir tribute song to Vidic might not be the most politically correct in English football. Back then: Vidic joined United in January 2006, signed by Sir Alex Ferguson . It was sung in full cry last Tuesday when Vidic made his farewell appearance at Old Trafford against Hull City before taking the microphone to say his goodbyes on the pitch afterwards and thank them ‘from the bottom of my heart’. In the match programme that night, he tried to play down the importance of him leaving United. ‘It shouldn’t be so dramatic,’ said Vidic. ‘A lot of players leave the club and a lot come here. United will always be the same and will always attract good, big-name players. I don’t think it will be any different when the transfer market starts. ‘Last year Paul Scholes retired. Before that, it was Gary Neville. That’s life and yet you still see these players around the club and supporting the club. I will be no different.’ History will show his contribution to be rather more significant, however. It is hard to think of a better central defensive partnership in the Premier League era than that forged by Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. It saw the Serbian win the title in five of the eight full seasons that he played at Old Trafford, not to mention a Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup and three League Cups. Vidic was the proverbial rock at the heart of defence, while Ferdinand was the ball player. It felt like the perfect combination. Very few players got the better of Vidic, even though United fans were right to get nervous every time he came up against Liverpool, and Fernando Torres and then Luis Suarez in particular. Double act: Vidic joined alongside Patrice Evra - both have enjoyed good careers at the club . He was a gladiator, fearsome and fearless in equal measure. Images of Vidic holding his head after another juddering collision while a physio sponged the blood of his face or asked him to count the fingers in front of his eyes like a punch-drunk boxer will live on. Some believe that he was never quite the same after badly damaging the ligaments in his right knee during a Champions League game against Basle in December 2011, but Vidic soldiered on. Saturday’s final appearance at St Mary’s was his 300th for United. Only 10 of those have come off the bench. His leaving present was an elbow to the nose from Lambert. Vidic wouldn’t have it any other way.

"Glen Turner was shot and killed on a property near Moree in northern NSW over an environmental dispute . A 79-year-old Moree man has been charged with murdering a state government worker who was trying to issue him a notice for illegally chopping down trees. Ian Robert Turnbull was refused bail on Wednesday and appeared at Moree Local court later in the day. Glen Turner, 51, was working for the NSW Department of Environment and Heritage. He is survived by his wife Alison and their two children, aged nine and 10. In a family statement released on Wednesday, Mr Turner's family said they were devastated by his early passing, according to The Daily Telegraph. 'His passing comes at a time when his dreams of the farm and family, which he had planned and lovingly built together with Alison, were coming to fruition,' it read. Mr Turnbull, a wheat farmer, had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area. Investigators said that police and paramedics were called to a property about 55 kilometres north of Moree on the Newell Highway, where they found the body of the victim late on Tuesday afternoon. A post-mortem will be held to determine exactly how the 51-year-old died. He was informing Mr Turnbull that there would be a formal inspection of his property in relation to the suspected illegally clearing of vegetation before the incident occurred. Scroll down for video . The state government worker was shot as he served a notice to an elderly man accused of illegally chopping down trees in the Croppa Creek area . Another worker was with the victim when he was shot, a department source who did not wish to be named said. The other worker is understood to be in shock but is otherwise uninjured. Friends of the alleged shooter have described Mr Turnbull as even-tempered but admitted the whole town knew that he had cleared too many trees. The wheat farmer owned five properties in the area and the shooting took place about a kilometre from one of those. Moree Plains Shire mayor Katrina Humphries said the shooting highlighted the volatile issue of land clearing in northern NSW. Environmental issues including land clearing and coal seam gas exploration have been a source of frustration in the rural community, she said. 'This is why I say, and I am not saying it flippantly and I mean it, I am not surprised this has happened,' she said. 'Because I know people have been pushed and pushed and pushed. This is their life and this is their livelihood,' Ms Humphries said. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce agreed with these comments, and said this was a tragedy but not an isolated incident, just the worst one. Northern NSW ecologist Phil Spark said the farmer had cleared about 100 hectares of land. 'And a lot of that is koala habitat so that has been a real conflict between conservation and this farmer having the right to clear his land,' he told ABC Radio. The NSW Public Service Association says the tragedy highlights the need for better risk assessment. 'The protection of the environment is an issue that generates great passion with strong feelings on both sides of the argument,' acting general secretary Steve Turner said in a statement. NSW Environment Minister Rob Stokes said he was deeply saddened by the death.

After . Spurs striker Steve Archibald scored four minutes into the match, Spurs . supporters could be seen climbing over a fence, assisted by police . officers who also opened two gates.

Up to . 250 Spurs fans were eventually moved to another part of Hillsborough. The inquest heard that 38 received injuries, including two victims with . broken arms and one with a broken leg. Christina Lambert QC, counsel for . the inquest in Warrington, Cheshire, said  huge crowds had built up . outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles shortly before the match kicked . off, possibly because fans had been delayed by an accident on the . motorway.

Lambert told the jury they would later hear from police officers who . were on duty at both matches as well as fans, stewards and turnstile . operators from the 1981 semi-final.

Joke: A Paddy Power billboard aimed at Luis Suarez after his bite on Giorgio Chiellini . Greg Rusedski, crowned Sports Personality of the Year after finishing runner-up in the 1997 US Open, is under scrutiny in his role as coach at the Lawn Tennis Association. This follows the upset around Rusedski being assigned to look after Britain’s highest-ranked teenager Kyle Edmund last April — yet not being with him in the build-up to Wimbledon, where his charge exited in straight sets in the first round. Rusedski was playing an exhibition tournament in Liverpool in the four days leading up to 19-year-old Edmund’s big moment at the Championships. Keeping busy: Greg Rusedski playing an exhibition match in Liverpool in the lead up to Wimbledon . And there is now concern whether busy Rusedski, who has media commitments and is a regular on the seniors circuit, has sufficient time to coach Edmund. LTA chief executive Michael Downey said after Rusedski’s appointment: ‘It reflects very highly on Greg that he wanted to step up and take on this challenge.’ Yet neither Andy Murray nor Tim Henman were too impressed with the choice of Rusedski to guide Edmund, it is understood. Gone: Kyle Edmund suffered a straight sets first-round defeat by Austria's Andreas Haider-Maurer . An LTA spokeswoman said: ‘Greg agreed to take part in Liverpool well before he was appointed as Kyle’s coach. Our performance team are working to achieve a level of continuity for Kyle’s coaching situation.’ Meanwhile. Downey is believed to be paying Australian Bob Brett around £250,000 a year — not far short of the CEO’s own salary — to be director of player development when the LTA are involved in a nationwide cost-cutting process which has seen more than 30 jobs lost. However, Brett and Downey’s combined wages are still less then the obscene £640,000 a year the LTA were paying former CEO Roger Draper. .......................................................................... Chairman Greg Dyke works only part-time for the FA and was entitled to take up an invitation to Wimbledon’s Royal Box on Monday. But somehow it seemed wrong for Dyke to be enjoying lavish All England Club hospitality quite so soon after England’s footballers had let down the nation in Brazil, with the FA chief not prepared to discuss it. The LTA, who have a poor record with communications chief appointments, have once again, in their wisdom, given this crucial role to someone from outside tennis. There is a real need at the LTA for a top media operator to make the most of Andy Murray’s golden years. Yet Alex Mawer, recruited from tourism agency Visit England, is much more of a marketing specialist. LTA chief Michael Downey believes marketing is key to revitalising his organisation’s battered image. Philip Brook, all-powerful chairman of the All England Club, is the force behind the unnecessary policing to ensure all-white clothing regulations are enforced — even to the extent of 1987 singles champion Pat Cash not being allowed to wear his signature check headband in the seniors event. There is also disquiet at the way Brook has turned the Royal Box into such a celebrity fest, particularly on the first Saturday when random sporting guests receive invites despite doing nothing noteworthy of late.

England’s captain, whose job has been under huge pressure after a terrible run of results, saw his team destroy India to level the five-match series 1-1 — largely down to new hero Moeen Ali. Six wickets for Ali, who has been derided as a part-time off-spinner, helped England triumph by 266 runs in the third Investec Test, a victory to relieve the pressure on Cook. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alastair Cook and James Anderson happy with Test victory . Happy: Alastair Cook finally has reason to be cheerful again after victory over India . New hero: Moeen Ali starred with bat and ball during the third Test . The only blot on England’s landscape is the assault charge against Jimmy Anderson which will be heard today and could lead to him being banned for up to four Tests, meaning he is a doubt for next week’s match on his home ground at Old Trafford. Anderson, who was man of the match, is accused of ‘abusing and pushing’ Ravindra Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion during the first Test. But Cook called for Justice Gordon Lewis to clear Anderson today, saying: ‘I hope common sense prevails and we’ll see Jimmy in his home Test.’ Anderson, sitting alongside Cook, said: ‘I want to play at Old Trafford but we’ll have to wait and see.’ India officials have been privately insisting video evidence exists of Anderson’s contretemps with Jadeja. They say it will support captain MS Dhoni’s claim that Anderson overstepped the mark and got physical with India’s all-rounder. The ECB say they are unaware of the video but hope their supporting cast of witnesses — who include Ben Stokes and Matt Prior — can persuade Lewis to downgrade the charge from a Level 3 offence. India, hoping to overturn the fine levied on Jadeja for his part in the incident (50 per cent of his match fee, about £3,500) will be represented by Dhoni, coach Duncan Fletcher and physio Evan Speechly, among others. Anderson, the leading wicket-taker in this series with 16, said the hearing had been playing on his mind. Blot: But the outcome of Jimmy Anderson's (left) assault charges still hangs over the team . Relief: But for now Cook can relax ahead of the fourth Test . ‘It’s been there since Trent Bridge,’ he said. ‘This was somewhere near my best. We were relentless as a group of four seamers. Everyone bowled brilliantly. Our job is to maintain that throughout the series.’ At Old Trafford India will again be without injured seamer Ishant Sharma, who wreaked havoc at Lord’s. England named the same 13 for Manchester. ‘We never let India off the hook,’ said Cook, who added that his own form with the bat, scoring 95 and 70 not out in the Test, and the result had eased the pressure on his own position. ‘The weight is lifted,’ he said. ‘To score runs under that pressure in the first innings meant a lot.’ He praised Moeen, whose Test-best figures of six for 67 wrapped things up — three days after sparking controversy by going out to bat wearing ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands. ‘I don’t think he was affected,’ said Cook. ‘He took six and had the same smile.’","Alastair Cook has reason to smile against after third Test victory .

Heather Franks overcame her crippling anorexia after visiting Disneyland in Florida with her family. At her lightest the 17-year-old weighed six stone, left at her school prom. Today Heather is a healthy 10 stone, right . She said: 'When we got to Disney World I was sat in a restaurant where nobody knew me or my eating problems, and I just felt so different. 'My parents let me choose whatever I wanted to eat, and slowly but surely I started to feel more comfortable around food. 'The portions were bigger and there was so many different things to try. 'The first thing I ate out there was a cheese and tomato pizza, and I actually enjoyed it. 'It changed my outlook on food, and that continued when we got home. 'When my doctors told me that I should go to hospital rather than go on holiday I was devastated. 'But in the end, going to Disney World is the best thing I’ve ever done.' When she was 16, Heather first began suffering anorexia. Within a year, her condition became so severe that doctors advised she should be admitted to hospital. She said: 'When I was told I couldn’t go to Disney World that was really the breaking point for me. 'I spoke to my parents and they agreed that I could still go with them, but I knew that if I didn’t put on weight I would end up in hospital. 'At Disney World I was so weak that I had to go around the park in a wheelchair. As a child Heather was overweight, eating around 1,500 calories for breakfast alone . But by the age of 16, following a fall out with friends which led to depression, the teenager developed anorexia, leaving doctors so concerned they advised she should be hosptialised . 'Luckily, everything changed after a few days there. I put on weight and I continued to do so when we got home.' Heather, who as a child had been overweight, said she used to eat around 1,500 calories for breakfast alone. She said: 'Luckily I managed to lose it as I grew up. 'I was completely fine with my body and how I looked, but in 2011 I fell out with my friends and developed depression. 'I was seeing a counselor but in April 2013 she went away on holiday, and whilst she was gone I found it difficult to control my emotions and how I felt. 'Before we went away I was days away from going to hospital. But in Disney World my perspective on things changed... I realised I just wanted to get on with my life' - Heather Franks . 'The only thing I was actually able to control was the amount of food I was eating - that’s where it all began. 'My counselor came back and noticed the difference in me and began to weigh me every week. 'Before long I was diagnosed with anorexia. 'I would just eat as little as I could - nothing for breakfast or lunch, and then I’d pick at my dinner at the table with my family. 'At my lowest I living off less than 500 calories a day. It was really hard for my family and friends to see my like that. 'I look back at pictures of me at my high school prom - at my thinnest - and I can’t believe how ill I looked.' The turning point came while Heather was on holiday at Disney World. 'Before we went away I was days away from going to hospital,' she said. 'But in Disney World my perspective on things changed. 'I . was away from the counselors and dieticians - I was just with my . supportive family and around people who treated food normally. While on holiday at Disney World in Florida with her family, including sister Leah (pictured left with Heather), the 17-year-old started to eat, encouraged by larger portion sizes and eating in front of strangers . Heather said: 'Before we went away I was days away from going to hospital. But in Disney World my perspective on things changed. I was just with my supportive family and around people who treated food normally' Having overcome the illness, Heather now weighs 10 stone and is working to help raise awareness of eating disorders . 'I put on 2lbs - which is a lot when all you want to do is lose weight - and then when I got back I continued to gain. 'I realised that I just wanted to get on with my life.' Despite her life-changing visit, Heather said she is unlikely to return to the famous resort. 'Disney World has a lot of good memories for me but I’m not sure I’ll go back,' she said. 'I loved my holiday there, but it reminds me of how extremely ill I was. 'But it’s the place and time where I went through the biggest turning point in my life - I’ll always remember it.' Heather weighs almost 10 stone and has made it her aim to raise awareness of eating disorders. She said: 'I’m not ashamed at all of what I’ve been through. 'It’s thanks to my wonderful family and friends that I’m still here, ad I’m really happy now. 'I’m also fundraising with the eating disorder charity, BEAT, so they can help other young people like me. 'I’m just looking forward to the future.'

"It has been widely accepted Apple’s rumoured 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will not launch later this year - but the delay was previously blamed on manufacturing problems. The latest reports, however, are blaming this staggered release date on Apple’s marketing strategy, and suggest the tech giant is feeling vulnerable against rivals such as Samsung and HTC. Tech site Digitimes claims Apple will look to maximise sales of its next range of iPhones by releasing them in stages. Scroll down for video . It has been widely accepted Apple's rumoured 4.7-inch iPhone 6 (concept pictured left) will debut in September, with the 5.5-inch model launching in 2015. This was blamed on manufacturing problems. The latest reports, instead, are blaming this staggered release date on Apple's marketing strategy . The . iPhone maker reported sales of $37.4 billion (£21.9 billion) in its . third quarter ending June, falling short of expectations for about $38 . billion (£22.3 billion). Sales . of iPads hit 13.3 million, which is a little short of analysts' projections of more than 14 million. Gross . margin, however, was better than expected at 39.4 per cent, up from 36.9 . per cent a year ago. Despite . poor iPad sales, the iPhone continued to do well with 35.2 million . handsets sold in the past three months – an increase of 13 per cent . following strong performance in China. Mac . desktop computers were the most popular product by the group in terms . of growth, with 4.4 million sold, providing a year-on-year increased of . 18 per cent. Overall, the company’s quarterly profit rose 12 per cent to $7.75 billion (£4.55 billion). This is so the devices don’t go head-to-head in the same way the iPhone 5S and 5C did last year. Sources ‘familiar with the matter’ told Digitimes: ‘The different timetables have been set as Apple does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C simultaneously.’ But Apple expert Ben Lovejoy from 9to5Mac dubbed these reports as 'spurious': ‘Apple’s iPhone sales numbers in no way suggest it made a ‘mistake’ in launching the iPhone 5S and 5C simultaneously.’ He continued that although there is evidence that the balance of sales between the two devices differed, in favour of the iPhone 5S, this may be because people preferred to buy the more expensive model. His claims are also bolstered by the fact Apple sold 35.2 million iPhone handsets in the past three months – an increase of 13 per cent following strong performance in China. This was despite a nine per cent slump in iPad sales. The initial reports about the delay blamed it on issues with manufacturing the glass and case needed for the larger screens. Sources 'familiar with the matter' said: 'The different timetables have been set as Apple does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the iPhone 5S (pictured front) and iPhone 5C (pictured back) simultaneously' But Apple site 9to5Mac questioned the reports: 'Apple's iPhone sales numbers in no way suggest it made a 'mistake' in launching the iPhone 5S and 5C (pictured) simultaneously.' This is bolstered by Apple figures that show it sold 35.2 million iPhone handsets in the past three months - up 13% . Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display. Current models have a separate touchscreen layer. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass. Due to the complex nature of these . screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare . for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements . that need to be issued. Suppliers claim Apple has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured, upcoming 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s (leaked images pictured) by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets . This report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015. Meanwhile, a separate report claimed the tech giant is said to be so confident its upcoming iPhone 6 will be a success, it has ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year. If true, this would be the largest initial production run of iPhones – up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C last year. This suggests either Apple will release two handsets by the end of the year, or is expecting the 4.7-inch model to be a third more popular than its previous handsets combined. Suppliers claimed the Californian firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s by 30 December.","Reports last week suggest Apple will release its two models separately .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A kindhearted mother whose daughter died at just six months has set up a charity which provides parents with free photos of their premature babies in hospital. Capturing Hopes Photography founder Deneen Bryan and a team of volunteer professional snappers capture a preemie’s growth as a gift to families too distressed or unable to take photos. Bryan, a mother-of-six from North Carolina, said the work is emotionally difficult but rewarding. One baby she has photographed is tiny Walker Pruett who weighed just 1lb 3oz when he was born prematurely on April 25. Scroll down for video . Walker Pruett . Adorable: Walker Pruett was born severely premature on April 25,  weighing just one pound and three ounces . Pulling through: On day 5, Walker's parents were able to hold him for the first time. He couldn't breathe on his own . Fast forward: By day 27, Walker has grown a little and is looking healthier . Bryan's team created a time-lapse video charting Walker's progress for its new 'Project 100 Days'. The project aims to show a preemie's growth in the first 100 days of its life at the hospital. For Walker's parents, Erica and Jared Pruett, it was a dream come true. Bryan's beautiful photos show Walker from the moment he was born and put on a ventilator, to day 80 when he was healthy enough to be discharged from hospital. '(Walker) was just so, so tiny. You couldn’t touch him. You couldn’t rub him. You just had to pat his skin, because his skin was so fragile. ... It was five days before we could hold him,' Erica told Martinsville Bulletin.

"By . Helen Pow . The former girlfriend of a Cirque du Soleil dancer on trial for killing another performer has backed his claims that she was jilted and unstable with violent tendencies, describing a previous incident where the alleged victim 'pushed, slapped and spit on' him. Jason 'Blue' Griffith is accused of choking to death Debbie Flores Narvaez, dismembering her body and hiding it in concrete-filled plastic tubs in an abandoned home. But his attorneys in the explosive murder case say he acted in self-defense when he wrapped his forearms around her until she went limp in December 2010. On Monday, the eighth day of the Las Vegas trial, 'Zumanity' dancer Agnes Roux told jurors Flores Narvaez had harassed and stalked Griffith and had a history of acting irrationally. Ex-girlfriend: Cirque du Soleil performer Agnes Roux testifies during the Jason Omar Griffith's murder trial at the Regional Justice Center on Monday, May 19, 2014, in Las Vegas . Roux also told of how she called 911 on Griffith's behalf after an incident where Flores Narvaez was in her car chasing Griffith to his property. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the jury heard 14 911 calls Griffith made himself involving domestic incidents with Flores Narvaez during their volatile year-long relationship. However, Roux also talked of Griffith's cheating and told the court she refused to get back with him in December 2010 unless he ended his relationship with Flores Narvaez. 'It was quite obvious she couldn't be in the picture if I was back,' Roux said Monday, according to the Review-Journal. She said she had split with the performer months earlier after discovering the affair, and later learning he was sleeping with two other dancers who he performed with in the Cirque du Soleil show 'Love.' Roux believed the pair were monogamous until their break up she said, and that he had ended things with Flores Narvaez in May 2010, but testimony shows he continued having sex with the alleged victim for some time. On trial: Griffith, pictured Monday, is accused of killing Luxor 'Fantasy' dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez in December 2010 . Lies: Cirque du Soleil performer Agnes Roux, pictured left and right on Monday, supported Griffith's claims that the alleged victim was volatile but also learned her ex-boyfriend had lied about a death threat . Roux described an incident in October 2010 when Flores Narvaez allegedly attacked Griffiths in front of her, yelling at him to tell her the truth about their affair. She began to kick Griffith's car door angrily and when Griffith grabbed her by the shoulders she fell to the ground, Roux recalled. However, Griffith didn't push her down, Roux said. 'Her fall seemed disproportionate' to how he grabbed her, she told jurors. Griffith was later arrested and charged with coercion in the incident but the charges were dropped. But during cross-examination, Roux was asked about a note Griffiths told her was from Flores Narvaez, threatening to kill him if he was ever with another woman. Prosecutor Michelle Fleck asked whether Roux knew that Griffith had learned four years ago that the note was written by his roommate Louis Colombo. Roux said she didn't know that and looked squarely at Griffith, before telling the court 'I just believe he's a great actor,' with reference to his claims he was suicidal after she dumped him for cheating.Closing arguments in the case should begin Tuesday. Griffith also resumed the stand on . Monday and tried to fend off a prosecutor's suggestions that what he . really did was eliminate a pesky former girlfriend whose pregnancy claim . endangered his new romance. 'Debbie . was the obstacle,' prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo said as he questioned the dancer about his motivation in the asphyxiation death. Emotional: Griiffith demonstrates in court on Thursday how he and ex-girlfriend Deborah Flores Narvaez struggled on the night she was strangled . Griffith, . 35, previously told the jury that he fell back to the floor and held . Flores Narvaez tightly around the upper chest and neck until she stopped . breathing. He said he thought she was reaching for a gun in her . purse. No gun was ever found, and medical examiners found no evidence . during her autopsy that she was pregnant at the time. Griffith denied under questioning Monday that he was angry during the argument. 'You weren't enraged?' DiGiacomo asked. 'Was it an accident?' 'In . fear, sir,' Griffith replied. He said he and Flores Narvaez were close together . in his home music studio when she hit him in the face as she reached . past him toward her purse. 'She . attacked me, sir,' Griffith said. 'I attempted to restrain her so she . wouldn't hurt me or herself. The only thing I did was restrain her, . sir.' Griffith denied . that Flores Narvaez's claim of pregnancy led to the fight. He had accompanied the woman to an abortion clinic in May 2010, but he also maintained that he . was never sure she was really pregnant at that time. Afterward, the two . stopped seeing each other for several weeks. Jurors . have been told that after the couple got back together a few weeks . later, Flores Narvaez slashed three tires on Griffith's car in a fit of anger. But they remained intimate in the fall, while Griffith spent time with . the new girlfriend, Agnes Roux, and continued sleeping with several . other women. DiGiacomo . ended two days of cross-examination questioning Griffith about . inconsistencies on the whereabouts of Flores Narvaez's cellphone after her death. Horrific: The dismembered body of dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez was found encased in concrete in 2011 . Griffith . insisted that he didn't take her phone. GPS put the phone at or near . the New York-New York resort, DiGiacomo said, where Griffith, who danced . at the time with the Cirque du Soleil show, 'Love,' went to meet Roux, a . dancer in the Cirque show 'Zumanity.' Prosecutors . told jurors that after entombing Flores Narvaez's dismembered body in concrete . in his home, Griffith spent several nights with Roux at a boutique hotel . just off the Las Vegas Strip. Griffith . is standing trial on a murder charge that could get him life in prison. The dancer's disappearance drew intense media attention after she failed to . show up for work as a dancer in the racy 'Fantasy' revue at the Luxor . hotel-casino. Her remains were found weeks later in two tubs of concrete in a vacant home in downtown Las Vegas. Griffith . has testified that he and Flores Narvaez had a violent relationship and that . she stalked, threatened, harassed and assaulted him when he tried to . limit their time together. He . left the jury with the impression Friday that his roommate, Louis . Colombo, dismembered Flores Narvaez's body. Her remains were recovered January 8, . 2011, after Colombo received immunity from prosecution and led police to . them. Colombo testified last week that Griffith sawed off Flores Narvaez's legs, while Griffith testified that it was Colombo. Colombo was due to return to the witness stand before Griffith's defense attorneys rest their case, perhaps on Tuesday. Last week, Griffith cried on the stand as he showed the jury how Flores Narvaez had died in his arms while he was trying to talk to her. Self-defense: Griffith, pictured Thursday, has claimed he was trying to protect himself during an argument with Flores Narvaez . Describing her as violent and possessive, he claimed that the dancer had threatened him and assaulted him. Griffith told the court no one had taken . him seriously when he tried to report Flores Narvaez for stalking and . harassing him after they began a relationship earlier in the year. On the night that she died, Griffith claimed that he was trying to stop her reaching a purse, which he thought contained a gun. 'I . think she's reaching for the gun in her purse, but I have no way to . know. I was telling her to stop. I pull her back toward me,' he said. Griffith showed the jury how the alleged victim's head had become wedged in his . elbows as he fell backwards on the floor of his studio apartment. 'She . says, ""I'm going to [expletive] . kill you. I'm going to [expletive] kill you"",' Griffith said, adding . that she was kicking him with the high heels of her boots and threw her . head back against his nose as he held her. Accused: Griffith, pictured in court on Thursday, is facing charges over the murder of Deborah Flores Narvaez . Claiming . that he was pleading with her to stop, Griffith said: 'I thought she . was listening to me, because she wasn't moving anymore. She wasn't . scratching me, or gasping for air.' Moments later, he claimed, he realized she wasn't breathing at all. Their . fight had allegedly been because Flores Narvaez wanted him to stop seeing . another dancer. He said she had claimed to be pregnant, but a medical . examiner said there was no evidence to support this. The . 35-year-old has acknowledged lying to police, and said he hid details . of the killing from everyone, including his housemate Louis Colombo, who . testified that he helped dispose of the victim's body. Griffith has pleaded not guilty . to first-degree murder, and his defense, Jeff Banks, says the dancer was acting in self-defense. 'They will show you pictures, and they . will be gruesome and they will be shocking,' Banks said during the opening statements on May 8. 'But that does . not change the fact ... that he was scared and he was afraid that she . was violent, and Jason Griffith was defending himself on December 12, 2010.' The jury has already heard from Flores Narvaez's roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg, who testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith's house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer - and never returned. After finding her dismembered body in a vacant house, police finally cracked the disappearance-turned-homicide case when they gave Griffith's housemate, Colombo, immunity from prosecution. Colombo told police he left the house after seeing Griffith put his hands around Flores Narvaez's neck as they argued. When he returned, he could see she was dead. A friend, Kalae Casorso, told police that Griffith admitted to her that the woman was in the huge tub of cement he and Colombo tried to store at her house.","Jason 'Blue' Griffith is accused of choking to death Debbie Flores Narvaez, dismembering her body and hiding it in concrete-filled plastic tubs .

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . The CIA will no longer use fake vaccination programs as a cover for spying operations, like the one that helped target and ultimately kill Osama bin Laden in 2011. Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, pledged last week that the agency would no longer use such ruses for intelligence purposes after the practice came under fire from public health academics for endangering workers. In a letter to the deans of 13 prominent U.S. public health schools, Monaco also agreed to not use genetic materials obtained through such programs. Controversial spying: The CIA will no longer use fake vaccination programs as a cover for spying operations, like the one that helped target and ultimately kill Osama bin Laden, pictured, in 2011 . However, one such program was used to . successfully locate Osama bin Laden. A Pakistani doctor, Shakil Afridi, . offered a program of hepatitis vaccinations in the Pakistani city of . Abbottabad as cover for his CIA-backed effort to obtain DNA samples from . children at a compound where bin Laden was later killed during a 2011 . raid by U.S. Navy SEALs. Afridi was convicted and sentenced by a Pakistani court to 33 years in prison for treason. The sentence was later overturned and Afridi faces a retrial. The health school deans were among a group of medical authorities who publicly criticized the CIA's use of the vaccination program after it was disclosed by media accounts and Pakistan's arrest of Afridi as a CIA operative. In 2012, the United Nations suspended a polio vaccination effort in Pakistan after gunmen killed several health workers. Taliban militants accused health workers of acting as spies for the U.S. Jailed: Pakistani doctor, Shakil Afridi, pictured, offered a program of hepatitis vaccinations in Abbottabad as cover to obtain DNA samples from children at a compound where bin Laden was later killed. He was sentenced by a Pakistani court to 33 years in prison for treason but is awaiting retrial . In her May 16 letter to the health school deans, Monaco said the U.S. 'strongly supports the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and efforts to end the spread of the polio virus forever.' She added that CIA Director John Brennan committed in August 2013 that the agency would 'make no operational use of vaccination programs, which includes vaccination workers.' Also saying no DNA or genetic material would be used from such programs, Monaco said the CIA policy 'applied worldwide and to U.S. and non-U.S. persons alike.' CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said Brennan 'took seriously the concerns raised by the public health community, examined them closely and took decisive action.' Monaco's letter and the CIA statement did not acknowledge any error in the decision to use the Pakistan vaccine program as a spying cover. The letter was first disclosed in a report by Yahoo News. The White House statement came three days after Pakistan acted to quell a growing polio crisis within its borders. The public health deans had warned last year that the CIA's use of a vaccination program had played a role in the shootings of several health workers in Pakistan and could hamper anti-polio efforts. 'Public health programs should not be used as cover for covert operations,' they said. Last week, Pakistan's Health Ministry . announced that it would require that all travelers leaving the country . first get a polio vaccination. Mission: The vaccination program linked children living at this compound in Abbottabad to Osama bin Laden . That move followed the World Health Organization's declaration earlier this month that polio's spread was an international public health emergency. The WHO identified Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon as nations that had allowed polio to spread beyond their borders. Pakistan was the only country with reported endemic polio that saw a rise in new cases in 2012, the health organization reported. Pakistan accounted for more than a fifth of all polio cases identified across the world in 2013. The CIA's use of a vaccine program to spy on bin Laden's compound undercut Obama's own high-profile speech to the Muslim world in 2009, in which he touted U.S. efforts to slash the growth of polio in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. With Obama administration assurances, Muslim scholars in two international groups issued religious decrees urging parents to vaccinate their children.","The pledge came after the use of fake medical programs was criticized by public health academics who were concerned about the safety of workers .

Suspect Ardon Ortega Montano, 42, dashed into the petrol station in the city of Lora del Rio, in the south Spanish province of Seville, shortly after it opened in the morning and warned the customers to stay out of the way as he rushed over to the till. Although terrified the cashier can be seen pushing the silent alarm as the robber forces his way behind the counter and demands the till be opened, and then grabs the money. Threatening: Robbery suspect Ardon Ortega Montano, 42, dashed into a petrol station in Spain armed with a spike . Dangerous: The suspect threatens a customer, in an orange top, with the spike . Brave: A customer in a blue top approaches from the left, armed with a fire extinguisher . Decisive: The customer rams the extinguisher into the suspect's head . But as he attempts to leave, waving the spike at those in the shop, the shop's CCTV system shows a customer throwing a fire extinguisher full force at his head, allowing a second man to grab the hand with the spike. They quickly push him to the floor. Together the pair managed to hold onto the suspect, delaying him enough so that by the time he finally managed to flee, police who turned up a short while later were able to easily track him down and arrest him. Police spokesman Adiel Perea said: ‘He had not gone very far. After getting his image from the CCTV cameras he was quickly spotted nearby and arrested.’ He has been remanded in custody while the investigation continues.","Ardon Ortega Montano, 42, tried to rob a petrol station in Seville, Spain .

"By . Rebecca Camber . and Mario Ledwith . and Eleanor Harding . Victim: Breck Bednar, 14, who was allegedly stabbed to death by a man he met off the internet . The teenage son of a millionaire was stabbed to death by a ‘predator’ he met online who groomed him through video games, it was claimed yesterday. Breck Bednar, 14, said he was going to a sleepover at a friend’s house on Sunday night. But secretly the teenager – who was said to be addicted to online computer games – travelled by train to the flat of an 18-year-old stranger who it is believed he had played with over the internet. Hours later, the church-going youngster was found dead by police at a flat in Grays, Essex – 30 miles away from the family home in Caterham, Surrey – after being knifed in the neck. Paramedics tried to revive him but he died at the scene. Lewis Daynes, an 18-year-old computer engineer, appeared in court yesterday charged with murder, and was remanded in custody. Last night it emerged that Breck’s family had alerted police as early as December that their son was being targeted over the internet. The case has now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for investigation. His mother Lorin LaFave spoke of her fears that a ‘predator’ had preyed on her son via a secretive gaming forum. Miss LaFave, 47, a US-born teaching assistant and school governor said in an internet post: ‘Breck was a clever, good and helpful boy. ‘Like most teenagers, socialising, computers and games were what he enjoyed. ‘The problem was a predator who was trying to control his ideology about religion, government, family, education. Breck looked up to him because of his interesting manner and computer skills. ‘Breck couldn’t see the bad and when I pointed out his obvious lies, they were overlooked by Breck, his friends, and unfortunately the police. Breck may have been shy when we saw cousins over three years ago, however he is actually very calm, clever and confident young man. Unfortunately too confident and independent to believe my warnings.’ Yesterday Breck’s American father Barry paid tribute to his ‘happy, gentle and smart boy’. Victim: Breck Bednar, 14, who was found with stab wounds in Grays, Essex, after telling his parents he was going for a sleepover near his home in Caterham, Surrey. Right, his mother Lorin LaFave . Family home: The detached property in Caterham, Surrey, which Breck Bednar lived in with his parents . Scene: The 14-year-old boy was rushed to hospital after being stabbed in this block of flats in Grays, Essex. He was later pronounced dead . The 49-year-old, who works for . investment firm Tandem Partners, and who owns a £1million flat in Canary . Wharf as well as a £600,000 home in Surrey, said his son appeared . ‘excited’ after returning from a school trip to Spain. He . said: ‘I last saw him on Sunday. He was a happy, gentle and smart boy. He had been in Spain for ten days and he was excited to see us and be . home again.’ The schoolboy’s . cousin Tanner Barth said Breck was ‘addicted’ to video games and had . stopped going to church and turned against his parents after meeting a . man on the internet. In an internet post, he wrote that Breck was an ‘incredibly smart, funny, and cute 14-year-old boy’, before adding: ‘Despite this it was very difficult for him to make friends and he would often avoid social interaction. ‘So, like myself and many others he turned to his computer and the internet for entertainment. ‘He loved to play video games and may have even been a bit addicted to them. He ended up meeting someone who he thought wanted to be his friend. ‘Soon a man began telling him that his parents hated him, and that God isn’t real, and that he shouldn’t go to church. Friends of 14-year-old schoolboy Breck Bednar told yesterday how he would spend hours speaking to online ‘friends’ – often late at night – who he had never met in real life. As they played videogames on the internet, they would use a computer program called Teamspeak 3 to chat to each other. The software allows computer users to make free calls over the internet in a similar way to a conference call. Users often wear a headset with an integrated microphone so they can talk as they play online with several other gamers. Private chat channels can also be set up by groups which are accessed by invitation only. Teamspeak is free to use but there is a fee if someone wants to block other users from joining in. Breck is thought to have been a keen player of violent videogame Battlefield 4, which thousands of teenagers play online. Last night Hannah Broadbent, of online protection charity Childnet, said: ‘Young people should bear in mind that it’s not always easy to spot a groomer. 'Often they might be chatting about things you are interested in and you might not realise. You can never be completely sure that a person is who they say they are on the internet. ‘The most important thing is that young people can tell someone if someone makes them feel uncomfortable online. ‘And never meet up in person or share any personal information. If they are contacted by someone who makes them feel uncomfortable it’s important to report it. ‘It’s really important that we educate young people so they know how to navigate the risks.’ Probe: A forensics officer can be seen entering the flats in Grays, Essex, yesterday where the 14-year-old schoolboy was found seriously injured on Monday. He later died . Probe: A forensics officer is seen in Grays, Essex, today as police carry out a murder investigation . ‘Breck became distant, stopped going to church and quit his extracurricular [activities] altogether. ‘They tried talking to him and helping him to no avail. ‘Two nights ago, Breck told his father that he was going to his friend’s house for a sleepover a couple of blocks away. ‘He ended up taking a train down to Essex, about two hours away to meet a man he had been talking to over the internet. ‘Early the next morning, the police found his body.’ Breck’s aunt Lisa Barth described the boy as ‘absolutely wonderful’ and said his death was a ‘senseless, disgusting tragedy’. And Christopher Curtis, headmaster of St Bede’s School, a Christian comprehensive in Redhill, Surrey, where Breck went to school, said: ‘Breck was a bright and hard-working student who was a real pleasure to teach. ‘His tutor describes him as a model student. A conscientious young man with a great deal  of potential.’ 'Murder': Breck Bednar is thought to have travelled from his home in Caterham, Surrey, to Grays, Essex . It is understood the schoolboy was part of a gaming group run by Daynes called FEP squad, which had around eight members, all thought to be around age 14, and some of whom had never met  in person. Eventually almost all the members left and joined a different group, but Breck stayed. Yesterday neighbours described how an ashen-faced teenage boy was led away from the Essex flat where Breck was found after arriving on Sunday night in a taxi. They described Daynes as an ‘extremely quiet’ loner who moved into the property 18 months ago with the help of his grandparents, who paid for his rent and bills. A spokesman for Surrey Police said: ‘Surrey Police is working with Essex Police following the tragic death of a 14-year-old boy from Caterham in Grays, Essex on Monday, February 17. ‘Due to recent contact Surrey Police had with the victim’s family the case has been referred to  the Independent Police Complaints Commission.’ Probe: A police van is parked outside the block of flats in Grays, Essex, which Breck Bednar travelled to .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Google employee says his company hires the absolute smartest people in the world and that it's a pretty big problem. Avery Pennarun, an engineer for Google's broadband arm Fiber based in Canada, blew the whistle on what he calls the staff's overconfidence problem in a June 30 blog post he titled The Curse of Smart People. 'Smart people have a problem,' Pennarun writes, 'especially when you put them in large groups. That problem is an ability to convincingly rationalize nearly anything.' Stop me if you've heard this: Google employees are over-confident computer geeks with poor social skills, says Google employee Avery Pennarun (pictured) Pennarun reasons that Google snags its smart programmers straight out of college much of the time, giving the brilliant 'computer geek types' to see how the real world works. 'Working at a large, successful company lets you keep your isolation,' writes Pennarun. 'If you choose, you can just ignore all the inconvenient facts about the world.' Google's problem is the opposite of other less elite companies where lack of confidence plagues workers, says Pennarun. 'The curse is confidence. It's confidence that comes from a lifetime of success after real success,' he writes. Too confident? Pennarun says that Googlers could use a dose of self-doubt in order to foster the next great innovation . So what's the solution to confidence? A blow to the ego, of course. Pennarun believes the genius masses at Google need a dose of Impostor Syndrome AKA lack of confidence. 'The people with Impostor Syndrome are the people who *aren't* sure that a logical proof of their smartness is sufficient,' he says. In Pennarun's experience, hyper confidence leads to projects being created that look great on paper but which don't lead to happy customers or innovation. In the place of confidence, he says that Google, it's employees and its users would all benefit from some self doubt to help usher in that next great Google product. 'Impostor Syndrome is that voice inside you saying that not everything is as it seems, and it could all be lost in a momen,' writes Pennarun. 'The people with the problem are the people who can't hear that voice.'","Avery Pennarun is an engineer with Google's broadband service Fiber .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Police in Malaysia have denied that a British backpacker was involved in a fight shortly before he went missing in the jungle, it was reported. Gareth Huntley's body was found on Wednesday after he disappeared during a trek to a waterfall on Tioman Island, off the south-eastern coast of the country's mainland. It was discovered in a pond just yards from a kayak storage shed at the Juara Turtle Project where he had been volunteering, adjacent to a row of cabins used by rescue teams during the search. Malaysian police are investigating whether the death of Mr Huntley (left), was the result of foul play. His mother, Janet Southwell (right), gave her own DNA to help in the . identification process after his body was found and said no words can describe the void left by him .

Police in the country said yesterday . that they were investigating claims the 34-year-old was involved in a . fight before he went missing. It was reported that he may be have been murdered, and there were claims that his throat had been cut. But a senior police officer on the island has denied the suggestion, local newspaper the Malaysia Star said. Senior . Assistant Commissioner Datuk Mohd Zakaria Ahmad said: ‘I was in Pulau . Tioman on Saturday and I interviewed several witnesses myself. What they . told me contradicts what the foreign reporter wrote. That report is . inaccurate.’ He told the newspaper that police were not ruling out foul play, but said the investigation was in its early days. He said a post-mortem examination had revealed no external injuries. Earlier, . the owner of a bistro, Ab Razib Ali Awang, told the Telegraph that most . people in the local area think something sinister had happened to the . backpacker. He said: I’m not sure if the project [people] are making a false report or maybe not telling the police everything. 'There are rumours that there was a fight before with a foreigner.' He was found on Wednesday near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working, according to local reports . Mr . Huntley, of Hackney, east London, who is originally from the . Leeds-Bradford border, was on a sabbatical from his job in the City. His family mounted a high-profile campaign to intensify a search for him after he failed to return from his trek. They spoke of their devastation after it was confirmed that a body found on Wednesday was his. In . a statement they said: 'There are no words that can capture the . devastation we feel right now; no words that can capture the kindness, . warmth and spirit that Gareth exuded; no words can describe the void he . will leave in all of the lives he touched.' His . mother Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday and was pictured . on Friday outside the Forensic Unit at the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital . in Kuantan with Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga. Mrs Southwell travelled to Malaysia with Miss Natariga to press the authorities into finding him. She . broke down in tears and ran to her cabin a short distance away when . news of the body’s discovery was broken to her by Deputy Police . Superintendent Johari Yahaya. Gareth Huntley and his girlfriend Kit Natariga. She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions . Before . the positive identification, she had told of how she was staying . positive in the hope that she would be the ‘friendly face’ her son . needed when he came out of the jungle.

They unexpectedly saw the badly decomposed body floating face up in the Mentawak River. Dressed in a T-shirt, shorts and shoes, it was just behind a row of cabins being occupied by the rescue teams. With . his body being found within the confines of the conservation . headquarters, police are questioning whether he even managed to reach . the start of the jungle path before tragedy struck in some way. They are also looking at the possibility that Mr Huntley did reach the waterfall and plunged into the river on his return.

"By . Mario Ledwith . and Sophie Jane Evans . A dog believed to belong to British Special Forces has become an unlikely prisoner of the Taliban. Footage posted online shows bearded gunmen parading the unfortunate animal as a trophy after it was taken during a failed Nato raid in Afghanistan. The subdued dog, named Colonel, is seen wearing a specially adapted flak jacket as it is held on a chain by one of the fighters. Scroll down for video . Taliban fighters claim to have captured a British military dog which was armed with four guns and grenades . It is understood to be attached to an . elite unit, believed to be either the Special Air Service or its naval . counterpart, the Special Boat Service. Locals in Alingar Valley, in the Laghman province, say the dog is being held by a notoriously brutal Taliban commander known as Abu Zarqawi, according to The Telegraph. But despite their concern, the animal's captors claim it is healthy - and is being fed a diet of chicken and beef kebabs. Speaking from an undisclosed location, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the dog had become separated from its handlers during the fierce raid in December. The dog, which was wearing an equipment vest, appeared to be in good condition and did not seem distressed . Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the captured dog was with British forces . 'Right now we are keeping the dog and . trying to look after him,' he told the newspaper by telephone. 'We haven’t decided what to do with it yet. Maybe we will keep it and use it ourselves because it has been trained.' He added that the fighters had been preparing 'proper food' for the dog, including kebabs. In . the video posted by the Taliban's 'cultural arm', an insurgent can be seen holding up . a GPS tracking device that formed part of the animal's uniform. The . jacket also contained a torch and video camera, which are often fitted . in order to capture reconnaissance material as the animals move around . on a battlefield. A Taliban fighter brandishes a pair of grenades which they say were captured along with the dog . Fighters can also be seen brandishing weapons allegedly seized at the time, including two . assault rifles similar to those used by US special forces and a number . of hand grenades. Dogs have been deployed by the British Army since the First World War, when they were used to carry messages. Some . 11,000 canines work in the UK's Armed Forces, sniffing out drugs, . helping with search and rescue, and searching suspicious buildings . before soldiers enter. Dogs can be strapped to their handlers' chests and parachuted into combat zones. They . have reportedly been trained to attack people who are armed, but are . mainly used to sniff out explosives or explore territory, sending images . back from cameras attached to their heads. Armed: Insurgents claim the dog was carrying four guns including an assault rifle, left, and a sniper rifle, right . Their . sense of smell is 40 times better than a soldier's, meaning they scent . enemies up to two miles away. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence . said: 'We do not comment on the activity of Special Forces. We cannot . confirm the nationality of the animal.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force confirmed that an animal went missing during a raid in December. A Taliban spokesman added: 'This dog was very important to the Americans. Once we got this dog, the Americans tried their best to get it back but . they did not succeed.' The . Ministry of Defence said last year that four dogs have been killed in . service in Helmand province since March 2011 – two labradors, a German . shepherd and a springer spaniel cross. One of the four was apparently . shot by the Taliban on a mission. But while some may fear  for the Taliban's most recent detainee, an Australian dog captured in Afghanistan had a lucky escape. After being adopted by a  Taliban leader, black labrador Sabi was eventually rescued by an American soldier. Dogs have been used in war since military records began, and are particularly useful in special forces operations. In . 2005 in Iraq, one such animal was killed when he detected an ambush . that even a soldier using night-vision goggles could not see. The dog ran ahead to attack and was riddled with AK-47 fire, betraying the sniper's position in the process. Dogs also led the way when the US Navy SEALS raided Osama Bin Laden's Pakistani hideout in 2011. Animal rights campaigners have expressed their outrage at the use of dogs by British forces in Afghanistan. People . for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said: 'Dogs are not tools . or ""innovations"" and are not ours to use and toss away like empty . ammunition shells.'","Video posted on Taliban website shows a dog wearing equipment vest .

"By . Martha De Lacey . The Duchess of Cornwall has hinted at the similarities between herself and the sixth and final wife of Henry VIII, Katherine Parr, who had already been married twice by the time she married the Tudor king, . Camilla, who married Prince Charles following her divorce from Andrew Parker-Bowles, made the comments in a foreword to a new collection of prayers written by Parr -  who was married to the king from July 1543 until his death in 1547 - and now translated into modern English. In the book, The Spice of Wisdom, put together by Rev John Partington, the Duchess writes that Parr - England's most-married queen, with four husbands in total - had a 'passionate' and 'eventful life', and that her voice 'speaks to us still'. The Duchess of Cornwall, left, has praised Henry VIII's final wife Catherine Parr, right, in the foreword of a new book, a collection of prayers written by the 16th century Tudor queen . A drawing of Henry VIII and his sixth and final wife, Katherine Parr, to whom the Duchess of Cornwall has implied an affinity with in the foreword to a new book . As reported by Melanie Hall and Jasper Copping in the Telegraph, Camilla writes: 'Her commitment to what is right and good, . expressed with humility and openness to others, is as valuable now as it . was in the more turbulent times of the Tudors.' She goes on to say: 'Few women's writings have come down to us from so many . centuries ago. In the pages that follow are found not only some of the . carefully crafted prayers that Katherine intended for publication, but . also the more personal hopes and fears of a woman who was as passionate . in her faith as she was in other aspects of her eventful life.' Prince Charles and the former Camilla Parker-Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall, following their wedding at the Guildhall in Windsor on 9 April 2005 . When Catherine Parr married Henry VIII in 1543 - here captured in an 18th century drawing - she had already been married twice . Parr was married to Edward Burgh in 1529 and widowed in 1533. She then married John Neville in 1534, only to be widowed again in 1543. She married Henry VIII in the summer of that year. Camilla, meanwhile, was married to Andrew Parker-Bowles in 1973 until their divorce in 1995. She had had a relationship with Charles prior to her first marriage. Both women are known to be or have been close to their step-children. Katherine was step-mother to Henry's children Edward, Mary and Elizabeth, and when her only biological child, a daughter with fourth husband Thomas Seymour, was born in 1548 she named her Mary in honour of her step-daughter. Katherine has been credited with campaigning tirelessly for the restoration of the line of succession in the new Act of Succession of 1544 that allowed Mary, then Elizabeth, to take the throne after their brother Edward. Camilla is close to both her stepsons, Princes William and Harry, and William's wife Kate . Camilla is known to enjoy a close friendship with her stepsons Princes William and Harry, and to have mentored Kate when she joined the royal family upon her 2011 marriage to Charles and Diana's eldest son. The Duchess became involved with the book due to her close friendship with the owner of Sudeley Castle - Parr's former residence and the site of her burial - Lady Ashcombe. She was shown a copy of the prayer collection by Rev Partington, who then wrote to her and asked if she would contribute a foreword because he saw the similarities between the two of them.

"By . Michael Zennie . Residents of a Chicago suburb say their quiet city is being taken over by thousands of snakes that are finally emerging from hibernation after the long, bitter winter. Dozens of slithering serpents have been spotted in parks, on sidewalks and yards in Naperville, Illinois. One resident, Nancy Quigley, said she's found them on her door step and discovered six of them in her bushes in a matter of days. Scroll down for video . Skin-crawling: This northern water snake was spotted near a river walk path in Naperville, Illinois - part of an influx of serpents in the city . Experts say the snakes, a gartner snake in a bush seen here, are harmless - but that doesn't stop residents from being unnerved by them . 'They're twice as big as they were last year. They’re not afraid of me anymore,' she told WBBM-TV. Naperville Animal Control says the serpents are harmless garter and water snakes. There are four species of venomous snakes in Illinois, including two kind of a rattlesnake, but none of them have been found in the suburb west of Chicago. They manage to freak residents out nonetheless. Like Mrs Quigley's deliveryman. 'He'll walk up to the house and see one, drop it and run,' she told WBBM. 'My friends said they're going to stop coming over.' One resident created a meme for the problem - a play on the 2006 Samuel L. Jackson movie 'Snakes on a Plane' The issue has become bad enough that someone even created a meme for it - playing off the 2006 Samuel L. Jackson movie 'Snakes on a Plane.' David Drake, the snake expert at Aquarium Adventure in Chicago, told WBBM that the influx of snakes is simply a sign that they are finally emerging from their slumber and beginning their summer feeding frenzy. Recent heavy rains are making them more visible by flooding them out of their homes, he added. Mr Drake said the snakes are nearly all harmless, but cautioned against approaching them unless they can be identified first - in the unlikely event that one turns out to be a venomous species.","Snakes have begun showing up en masse on sidewalks, in parks and on doorsteps and bushes in sleepy Naperville, Illinois .

"By . Mario Ledwith . It was the grim setting for the murder mystery at the heart of ITV’s crime thriller Broadchurch. But in a macabre echo of the ITV series, a dead man has been found at the foot of the same cliffs that featured in the programme and police are now investigating. The award-winning programme’s plot centred on a police investigation after an 11-year-old’s body was found on a fictional beach in mysterious circumstances. But locals were left stunned when reality appeared to mirror fiction with the discovery of the middle-aged man’s body yesterday morning. A dead man has been found at the foot of a cliff at West Bay beach in Dorset . David Tennant and Olivia Colman, pictured on location in TV drama Broadchurch. A body has been found at the cliffs used in scenes in the hit show . West Bay beach in Dorset, where the programme was partly shot in 2012, was yesterday closed and a tent erected around the scene as dozens of police officers investigated the area. Police have yet not yet revealed whether the death is being treated as suspicious, with investigators examining whether the male died while climbing. A spokesman for Dorset Police said that the body had injuries consistent with a fall from a considerable height. ‘The discovery was made at about 7.45am and an investigation into what happened to the man is underway,’ said the spokesman. Detective Sergeant Steve Broadhurst said: ‘While we are keeping an open mind all the signs are that this is not suspicious.’ The spokesman said that details of the man’s identity were being withheld until all his relatives had been told of the tragedy. Broadchurch has won numerous awards and an American version is now being made . The beach, which is  featured in the opening episode of the drama when two police detectives, played by David Tennant and Olivia Coleman, arrive following the death of schoolboy Danny Latimer. The Mayor of Bridport, a nearby town where parts of the programme were also filmed, said: ’We now need to find out what exactly has happened here.’ ‘This is very sad news. I can only say what everyone else has been saying and that it is an awful thing to happen. I feel for the family and send them our condolences.","A middle-aged man was found at base of cliffs at West Bay beach .

"By . Christian Gysin . and Mario Ledwith . These are some of the young  party-goers at the illegal rave where 16-year-old Daniel Spargo-Mabbs took a fatal dose of ecstasy. Many of the teenagers are seen with the legal high ‘hippy crack’ and some appear to be casually passing substances to one another. Daniel, whose last words to his parents were ‘I promise I won’t die’, suffered a heart attack at the gathering on an industrial estate in Hayes, West London, on Friday. He died two days later in hospital. Brazen: Group of teenagers poses with 'hippy crack' in balloons at the party where Daniel Spargo-Mabbs became ill . Last night his father Tim, 50, who believes it was the first time his son had taken ecstasy, gave a stark warning to teenagers about the dangers of drugs. ‘We want to say to any child tempted to take any illegal drugs, talk to us first. We’ll tell you about the machines, the hospital, the ventilator, the whole shebang. ‘We don’t want this to happen to anybody else.’ More than 3,000 revellers were at the event, which was put on by a secretive group called ‘Vibes Family’. It uses a series of web-based email addresses and pay-as-you-go mobile phones with recorded messages to direct partygoers to its illegal raves by giving a postcode and address for the venue just hours beforehand. Party times: Pictures of the rave were posted online by the organisers . This cloak-and-dagger operation makes it harder for the police  and local councils to find the  rave locations. Despite Daniel’s death, the group – whose logo features a cartoon mushroom character – yesterday posted photographs of smiling and dancing revellers from the Hayes event on its Facebook page. In a series of pictures, youngsters can be seen smoking, drinking and inhaling ‘hippy crack’,  better known as nitrous oxide or laughing gas. The legal high is increasingly popular and a recent survey suggested that as many as 350,000  16 to 24-year-olds have tried it. Victim: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs took a fatal dose of ecstasy . Inhaled from balloons, the drug is said to make people feel ‘euphoric and relaxed’ – but drug experts warn it can cause death through suffocation. Prince Harry was spotted inhaling the drug at a party three years ago. Other photographs showed at least one young woman smoking what appeared to be a ‘spliff’, or cannabis cigarette. The image was later removed. In another photograph three young men appear to be pouring a substance from a plastic bag into a bottle of Coca-Cola. An ecstasy tablet is thought to have been responsible for Daniel’s death. A freelance first aider hired to attend the event, Richard Chaplain, said: ‘A partygoer came over and said a young man had collapsed. We went over immediately to see him and I knew straight away that he looked in serious trouble. I insisted we call an ambulance straight away.’ The 16-year-old from Croydon, South London, had told his parents he was going to a party in Clapham, South London, but instead made his way to the rave. After he failed to return home, his parents Fiona and Tim’s worst fears were realised when police called at their house at 5.30am on Saturday to inform them that Daniel had been rushed to hospital. His reaction to the drug had sent his temperature soaring to 42C – and then caused him to have a heart attack. The bright pupil, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England School in Croydon,  was predicted to gain excellent  A-level results. His long-term girlfriend Jenna Coombs, who attended the same school, was being comforted by friends yesterday.

"By . Michael Zennie . A married teacher at a Catholic high school in Michigan faces life in prison after she was charged with repeatedly having sex with a 15-year-old student in her classroom. Police say Kathryn Ronk, 29, engaged in a variety of sex acts with the student - including intercourse at Bishop Foley High School in Madison Heights, a Detroit suburb. The Spanish teacher allegedly hooked up with the student in her classroom - sometimes after school, sometimes in between classes when Ronk had a break in her schedule, the Detroit Free Press reports. Arrested: Kathryn Ronk, 29, faces life in prison after being charged with five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for her alleged affair with a 15-year-old student . Ronk is pictured in her classroom, where she allegedly had sex with a teenage student at least five times . The trysts happened from January through April of this year. 'According to our investigation, this was a combination of actual sexual intercourse and other sexual acts,' Madison Heights Deputy Chief Corey Haines told the Free Press. Authorities began investigating Ronk on May 16, when the student's parents and the principal of the school,  the Reverend Gerry LeBoeuf, filed a complaint with police. Ronk was promptly fired from her job, which she had started at the beginning of the school year last August. She was charged on Wednesday with five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. She faces life in prison if convicted. Ronk allegedly met her the teenager here for trysts in between classes and after school . Ronk goes by the title 'Señora Ronk' in her Spanish classes as Bishop Foley High School. She has been married since 2011, according to her Facebook profile . Ronk was fired in May after the student's parents filed a complaint with police . Ronk could face additional charges. Police are investigating whether sexual contact also took place outside of school grounds in Macomb County. Ronk's bail was set at $500,000. She was released Wednesday after posting $50,000 cash on the condition that she wear a GPS tether on her ankle. Ronk has been married since 2011, but has no children, according to her husband's Facebook profile. A Facebook page she set up for her Spanish class, Español con Señora Ronk, shows her celebrating Día de los Muertos (The Day of the Dead) in her classroom. The Archdioceses of Detroit, which runs Bishop Foley High School, sent a letter home to parents informing them of the allegations against the teacher, though the school did not name her. In a statement, the Archdioceses said: 'Whatever the details or outcome, such allegations are disconcerting and are treated with the utmost seriousness.'","Kathryn Ronk aka 'Señora Ronk' taught Spanish at Bishop Foley High School outside Detroit .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A family of three from Ohio died on Monday morning when their light aircraft crashed at a popular Colorado ski area. James and Amy Kerker had been flying with their six-year-old son Lucas to Moab in Utah for a vacation when the plane went down. Witnesses described how the plane burst into flames after crashing into ski lifts at the Loveland resort when it tried to cross the Continental Divide. Scroll down for video . Tragic: James Kerker and his son Lucas died in a crash on Monday afternoon . Loss: Amy Kerker, pictured with Lucas at a parade, was also killed in the crash at a Colorado ski area . The wreck at Loveland Ski Area can be seen from this aerial shot taken on Tuesday . A couple from Ohio and their six-year-old son were killed in the plane crash at Loveland Ski Area on Tuesday . The Kerker family, from Raymond, Ohio, reportedly left Rocky Mountain Airport in Broomfield at 8:10 a.m. They crashed a short time later at Loveland Ski Area's Loveland Valley beginner area . Mr Kerker, 43, is believed to have been flying the aircraft at the time. Early indications suggest that the plane didn't have enough power to clear the mountains, then crashed when he tried to turn back. Also on board were his 39-year-old wife Amy and the couple's son, who suffered from the rare and terminal disease ataxia telangiectasia. In a moving YouTube video the couple had made to explain their son's diagnosis in 2011, they had said they were dedicated to filling his life with new experiences. With only 500 children in the U.S. suffering from the disease, and most patients not living past their 20th birthday, the couple had said it was their 'mission in life to make every day count' for him. 'We can't imagine our lives without him,' his parents had stated on the video, as they explained how the disorder would rob their son of the ability to walk and talk properly and leave him susceptible to childhood cancers. Vacation: Amy Kerker and her husband were dedicated to giving their terminally ill son Lucas as many new experiences as possible . The family had been vacationing in Colorado, and had then planned a trip to Utah. Unwell: Lucas, pictured pretending to fly a plane, suffered from ataxia telangiectasia . In a final Facebook post on Saturday, Ms Kerker had said: 'Listening to Conway Twitty classics driving through the Rocky Mountains...could only be better if we had some John Denver.' The advanced pediatric surgery nurse was praised by colleagues at Nationwide Children's Hospital who were shocked and saddened to learn of her death. Deb Pratt, director for advance practice nursing, said: 'Amy was dedicated to our patients and families throughout her years of outstanding service. 'Amy was one of the initial nurse practitioners in Pediatric Surgery who helped build the excellent program we have today. 'She was known for her advocacy for her patients and families - she routinely went above and beyond to see that their needs and concerns were addressed.' Medical staff she had worked alongside, and parents of children she had helped to treat, left tributes for the nurse on social media sites. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating what caused the Piper aircraft to crash shortly after it left Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield. Adventure: Lucas and his parents had been flying to Utah over the Continental Divide when their plane crashed . Aviation . expert Greg Feith told 9 News that the mountain and surrounding ski area sometimes created tricky flying conditions that pilots from out of state struggled to navigate. He added that many pilots run into difficulty because they try to follow the highway and then realize their planes haven't got enough lift to clear the Eisenhower Tunnel. Hiker Rico Argentati watched as the plane tried to turn before crashing. ' I just stopped to take a break, and I heard this plane coming up the valley. I knew right away it was too low,' he said. 'It tried to turn around. It made a 180-degree turn to the left, and it dropped below the ridge ... I was hoping it would come over the ridge, and it didn't. It crashed just on the other said of the ridge, and I saw a huge plume of smoke coming up.'","Witnesses describe how plane burst into flames after crashing at resort .

"By . James Nye . In a move reminiscent of LeBron's The Decision, the New York teen offered places at all eight Ivy League schools held a press conference on Wednesday to announce Yale was his choice. Seventeen-year-old Kwasi Enin announced his eagerly awaited decision at William Floyd High School on Long Island and declared that Yale's music program is what swayed his decision. The senior hit international headlines last month when he revealed he had been accepted to every single Ivy League college backed by his parents who are both nurses and emigrated to the United States from Ghana in the 1980s. Scroll Down to Read his Application Essay . Success: Kwasi Enin, a high school senior, smiles after announcing he will attend Yale University during a press conference at William Floyd High School in Mastic Beach, New York on April 30, 2014 . Decision: The high school senior made his choice out of all eight U.S. Ivy League schools that he was accepted to beforehand . Enin scored 2,250 out of 2,400 on his SAT. He was also accepted at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania. His incredible feat beat the odds - Harvard only accepted 5.9 percent of applicants in during this round and Cornell, which accepts more than the other seven schools, still only takes 14 percent. Enin plans to study music and medicine and said of Yale, 'I met people who were just like me - diverse in both science and music - and they told me how manageable it is doing both.' The teen said he is looking forward to singing in one of Yale's capella groups and playing in one of its orchestras. Now that's high achievement: Kwasi Enin, 17 a senior at William Floyd High School in Shirley, New York, applied to all eight Ivy League Universities - and decided today to go to Yale . 'I'm very satisfied with my offer,' he said of Yale. 'They're very generous on their aid.' 'A wrong decision can be the beginning or end to a lifestyle. In the seventh grade, I nearly ended my music career by opting to select a simple course- Music in Our Lives- that met the state music requirement, But this decision would have left me empty. 'While onstage as Big Jule of Guys and Dolls during my favorite musical, I helped create a wonderful atmosphere in the school auditorium by singing and dancing. 'With improvement and balance comes success, and music taught me all of these virtues. 'Whenever I perform... I become immersed in the conversations between performers and the audience.' At the news conference in the school gym, Enin thanked his parents and educators who helped him along the way. 'Without their assistance, I would not be in this position,' he said to NBC New York. 'I would not have had the initial drive to strive for excellence.' His mother said her son is 'proving himself to be on the right path.' She and her husband have sought to instill ""strong moral qualities"" in Enin and his sister since they were young, she said. 'We are so proud and so excited about all that he has achieved,' she said. His father said he has always been strict about his children's academics. 'I told him, 'Look, your worst grade in school should be a 95,' he said. Earlier this month, the admissions essay penned by Enin was released. In the biographical statement he submitted for the Common Application, he wrote about how music is 'the spark of my intellectual curiosity' and helped him connect to his community through plays. 'While onstage as Big Jule of Guys and Dolls during my favorite musical, I helped create a wonderful atmosphere in the school auditorium by singing and dancing,' the essay reads. The Decision: LeBron James announced his move from the Cleveland Cavaliers to Miami Heat in a heavily hyped television show dubbed The Decision in 2010 . Kwasi Enin matriculated at William Floyd High School, a large school on Long Island, New York. His principal said that, from the start, it was clear he would succeed . He goes on to tout his involvement in the local men's Doo Wop group as well as the chamber ensemble. 'With improvement and balance comes success, and music taught me all of these virtues,' he wrote. 'My haven for solace in and away from home is in the world of composers, harmonies and possibilities.' 'The self-guided journey known as music in my life excites my mind every day. My heart sings every day because the journey is already wonderful. Although I hope that my future career is in medicine, I love that I still have much to learn about and from the world of music.' The 17-year-old from Long Island, who had already been accepted early into Princeton, got into Brown. Columbia, Cornell, Yale and Dartmouth on March 27. Yale bound: Enin scored 2,250 out of 2,400 on his SAT. He was also accepted at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania . By 5pm that day, he had six Ivy League colleges offering him a place at their institutions, and then the toughest of them all, Harvard, sent the William Floyd High School student an email. The university has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent - meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in - and they wanted Kwasi. 'I was like - this can't be happening!' Kwasi told Newsday. He told The New York Post that much of his success is a result of his hovering 'helicopter parents', who both work as nurses after moving to America from Ghana in 1980. 'He's an amazing kid. He's very humble,' his father Ebenezer Enin said. 'He's been trained to be a high achiever right from when he was a kid. 'We have been encouraging him to be an all-around student. So far, he has proved himself.'

"By . James Nye . and Lydia Warren . Never-before-seen photographs have revealed prescription pill bottles and apparent drug paraphernalia Kurt Cobain left behind when he moved out of his Los Angeles apartment two years before his death. The images, which were taken in July 1992 at the Riverdale home he shared with Courtney Love, show a metal spoon - perhaps used for heroin - among trash including cigarette packets, razors, acne cream, underwear and unopened mail addressed to the Nirvana frontman. The photos show he also left behind collection of music and video tapes, including one of the group's 1992 hit Come As You Are, which were dumped alongside a shriveled rose and Polaroids. One letter left behind appears to be from California Rep. Henry Waxman. The images were taken by a press photographer after Cobain left his home on Spaulding Avenue and have surfaced as the . 20th anniversary of the singer's death approaches. Trash: Images show the trash Kurt Cobain left behind when he moved out of his Los Angeles apartment in 1992 - including pill bottles, a spoon, a candle, matches, tampons, unopened mail and acne cream and a bra (top) Left behind: When he moved out of the home, he left behind a spoon, which could have been used for heroin, and various ties (bottom center) Discarded: Another image inside the Riverdale apartment shows a deconstructed soap dispenser and a candle - perhaps used for drug use . It comes after police released two other never-before-seen images taken at the . scene of his suicide in Seattle as they announced they were re-examining evidence in the case. One of these photographs, which comes from four rolls of undeveloped film stumbled upon last month, shows a small cigar box containing a spoon, possibly with heroin residue on it, needles and a lighter laying on the floor next to a cigarette butt and a pair of dark sunglasses. The second picture shows the box closed, next to cash, a woolly hat and an open wallet that appears to display Cobain's ID. Detective Renee Witt, a spokeswoman for the Seattle Police Department, revealed on Thursday that . detectives were taking a second look at the circumstances surrounding . the Nirvana star's suicide after the new evidence was uncovered. Forgotten: A bra and acne cream sit discarded among unopened mail, receipts, business cards and pill packets . History: He also left behind a video tape of Nirvana's single, Come As You Are (left), among other tapes at the home he shared with Courtney Love . Former address: The mail shows Cobain lived at the debris-filled apartment on Spaulding Avenue on letters addressed to the singer . The rolls of film were found in . sealed bags by an officer who was going through Cobain's case file ahead . of the approaching 20th anniversary of the singer's death. The . images are said to detail the scene in sharper detail than the Polaroid . pictures used in the original 1994 investigation causing police to . review all evidence. However, . authorities have stopped short of declaring a full re-opening of the . case and police are reluctant to suggest much will come from the new . photos. The Nevermind star was discovered . dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home near Lake . Washington by electrician Gary Smith, who raised the alarm. The . Seattle chief medical examiner ruled that Cobain, who was 27 at the . time, had ended his own life after leaving a rehab . facility for heroin addiction. Authorities . recovered a note, but speculation has been rife since that the Smells . Like Teen Spirit singer did not commit suicide. Indeed, . the 1998 documentary Kurt and Courtney by filmmaker Nick Broomfield . infamously made allusions to Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. No evidence has ever been found that the Hole singer was in any way responsible for the rock icon's death. Loss: Cobain was just 27-years-old when he was found dead in his Seattle home in 1994 from an apparently self-inflicted gun wound . Identification: On Thursday, Seattle police released two photos from the scene, including one showing an open wallet with Cobain's ID . Close up: They also released this image showing spoon in a box filled with syringes. The spoon appears to be holding white powder . Scene: A police officer stands guard on the back porch of Kurt Cobain's garage where Cobain's body was found early 8 April 1994 in Seattle . Authorities initially ruled Cobain's death a suicide and said he had taken a lethal dose of heroin prior to shooting himself. Since his band rocketed to fame in the early 1990s, Cobain had struggled to deal with the public perceptions of him and suffered depression and battled addiction. According to local Seattle station KIRO, authorities developed four rolls of 35mm film found last month by the King County Sheriff's Office photo lab under high security. Detective Renee Witt, a spokesperson for . the Seattle Police, told the Washington Post the pictures have a slight green tint because of deterioration but still reveal more than the original polaroids. KIRO reported that the image of Cobain's dead . body will never be released. As Nirvana fans across the globe went wild with speculation that police were to officially reopen the investigation into his death, Seattle police were quick to clarify the pictures and the status of the case. 'Despite an erroneous news report, we have not 'reopened' the investigation into the suicide of Kurt Cobain,' the Seattle Police Department tweeted from a verified account. The police went on to explain on Twitter . that the case was simply being reviewed in anticipation of the 20th . anniversary of Cobain's untimely death. Suicide note: Cobain did leave a suicide note, pictured, at the scene saying his daughter would be happier without him . 'Our detective reviewed the case file anticipating questions surrounding the closed Cobain case as the 20 yr anniversary approaches,' another tweet explained. Detective Witt later told NBC News: 'There was nothing . earth-shattering in any of these images.' Speaking to KIRO on April 8, 1994, electrician Smith said that as he walked into the Nirvana legend's home  'I noticed something on the floor and I thought it was a mannequin. 'So I looked a little closer and geez, that's a person. I looked a little closer and I could see blood and an ear and a weapon laying on his chest.' Stunned, he said that he could recall seeing the suspected suicide note on top of soil in the home's greenhouse. 'I only read the bottom lines,' he said 'the bottom two lines said, 'I love you, I love you' to someone.' Together: Kurt Cobain is pictured with his wife Courtney Love - whom fans have tried to implicate in his death - and their daughter Frances Bean Cobain . Legends: This 1991 file photo shows the band Nirvana, from left, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Kurt Cobain. Nirvana will be inducted into the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, at the Barclays Center in New York . Two weeks before his suicide, a police report detailed how officers had been called to his Seattle home after Cobain had locked himself in his bathroom and threatened to kill himself. The report said that at the time, police were told 'he had a gun in the room.' However, Cobain had told police he was not suicidal, but in the aftermath of his death they immediately ruled suicide. More than 7,000 mourners packed Seattle Center two days later for a public memorial, where a recording was played of Love reading Cobain's suicide note. Last year, a Seattle police department spokeswoman said the department gets at least one request per week to reopen the investigation, mostly through Twitter. Police have said no other Seattle police case has received similar attention over two decades, reports KIRO.

Almost . 20 years to the day speculation still rages amongst Nirvana fans as to . the circumstances surrounding Kurt Cobain's death. His death certificate stated . that he died as a result of a 'contact perforating shotgun wound to the . head', and concluded it a suicide. However here are the leading theories that have grown up around his death . Homicide: . Lack of blood at the scene: Seattle public access host Richard Lee obtained a video taped from outside Cobain's garage looking into his house. The scene around the body showed what Lee claimed was a distinct lack of blood for a point-blank shotgun blast to the head. Toxicology report: The . official pathology report determined that the level of heroin in . Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter - a potentially . lethal dose. However, . private investigator Tom Grant - who worked for Courtney Love - has . pointed out that meant Cobain could have been too high to even be able . to pull the trigger. Furthermore, . Grant argues that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain . before the shotgun was fired by the perpetrator of the homicide. Suicide note: . Grant claims that while he was working for Courtney Love he came across . the suicide note that Cobain wrote for Courtney Love. He . believes that the letter reads as a note announcing he is leaving his . wife and the music business - not as a farewell to life. He claims the final few lines at the bottom - which do imply suicide - were added afterwards by an unknown individual. The shotgun: The gun that the . singer used to kill himself, a Remington Model 11 20 gauge, was not . checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint . Analysis Report, four cards of latent prints were lifted but contained . no legible prints. Nick . Broomfield: The filmmaker's controversial film, Kurt and . Courtney made the claim that Courtney Love paid for a hit on her . husband's life. However, . in  a 1998 interview, Broomfield said, 'I think that . he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a smoking gun.' Suicide: . Many of Cobain's friends and family have noted the singer's private and public utterances of depression and instability. They noted his struggles with addiction and what they believe was an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. They . point to a previous suicide attempt in Rome in and bandmate's Krist . Novoselic and Dave Grohl all believe he sadly took his own life.","Photos have emerged showing the trash the Nirvana front man left behind when he moved out of his Los Angeles apartment in 1992 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Women under 50 are being diagnosed with breast cancer at the record rate of 27 a day, reaching 10,000 a year for the first time. Posed by model . Women under 50 are being diagnosed with breast cancer at the record rate of 27 a day, reaching 10,000 a year for the first time. One in five cases now involve women in this age bracket, while the rate is still climbing among older women. Experts fear modern lifestyles are to blame for the rise among younger women. Many are drinking excessively, overeating and failing to exercise – all habits which contribute to breast cancer. The growing trend for women to delay having children until their 30s and 40s, have smaller families and breastfeed for short periods of time, if at all, also pushes up the risk, claims Cancer Research UK. The charity suggested that increasing use of the contraceptive pill may also play a role in the rise. Breast cancer kills around 12,000 women annually, but more than ever before are surviving due to advances in treatment. In women under 50 the death rate has almost halved in the last 20 years. Chris Askew, chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘Although breast cancer is more common in older women, it’s worrying to see an increase in the number of younger women diagnosed with the disease. ‘More women than ever are surviving which is great news, however more women are getting breast cancer and we must invest in vital research for new treatments and disease prevention.’ Statistics released by Cancer Research UK show that around 7,700 women under 50 were diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995 in the UK, but the figure had risen to 10,068 in 2010. The increase in breast cancer in women of all  ages over the same period was 18 per cent. In younger women, a family history of the disease increases the risk. But experts are concerned about changing lifestyle patterns among younger women, with many choosing to have children later or remain childless, which boosts the risk. Pregnancy before the age of 30 and breastfeeding cuts a woman’s lifetime number of menstrual cycles, thereby reducing overall exposure to oestrogen, a hormone which drives most breast cancer tumours. Previous research suggests women who breastfeed for six months reduce their risk of dying of cancer by ten per cent, possibly by a direct effect on breast cells making them more resistant to cancer. Age remains the strongest factor for breast cancer, with a healthy lifestyle cutting risk at any age. Scientists estimate four out of every ten cases in the UK could be prevented through maintaining a healthy weight, drinking less alcohol and being more physically active. Experts fear modern lifestyles are to blame for the rise among younger women. Many are drinking excessively, overeating and failing to exercise – all habits which contribute to breast cancer. (Pic posed by model, left); right, breast cancer cells . Women who are overweight or obese run a higher risk of developing the disease, probably through changes in sex hormone levels triggered by weight gain. Studies show drinking just one large glass of wine a day increases the chances of developing breast cancer by a fifth. Cancer Research UK says the  contraceptive pill slightly increases the risk while women are taking it, and it has become more popular. Sara Hiom, the charity’s director of health information, said: ‘The number of cases in women under 50 diagnosed with breast cancer is increasing slowly, but thanks to research, awareness and improved care, more women than ever before are surviving the disease. ‘Women of all ages who notice anything different about their breasts, including changes in size, shape or feel, a lump or thickening, nipple discharge or rash, dimpling, puckering or redness of the skin, should see their GP straight away, even if they have attended screening. ‘It’s more likely not to be cancer but if it is, detecting it early gives the best chance of successful treatment.’ Mia Rosenblatt of the Breast Cancer Campaign said: ‘This increase in cases among younger women is a pattern evident across all ages. ‘It is vital that the particular concerns of younger women, such as fertility issues as a result of treatment, are addressed and that  specialist support is provided  by clinicians. ‘Apart from being a woman, age still remains the biggest risk factor for breast cancer, with 80 per cent of cases in women over the age of 50. However, no matter what  their age, all women need to be breast aware.’","Drinking to excess, overeating and no exercise are contributing factors .

'We were trying to get everything done. Once you get more resources, you're able to focus on one patient at a time. I tried to treat each patient as my family member.' Terry Ruparcic, who manages the EMS station said the accident was a '9 out of 10' on the scale of traumatic accidents he has seen. The paramedics were given the opportunity to talk to mental health counselors after the accident. Hinebaugh has been dating Lichty for about 18 months and is about eight months pregnant with his child, said a friend to WPXI. Devastating: This is the wreckage of the family car that led to the deaths of two of the four children in the backseat . Police say the male driver, a pregnant woman and the other two children were injured and taken to Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center. Witness Sandy Seth lives along the street from the accident and heard the crash happen in the middle of Monday afternoon. 'This was pure mother nature at its worst,' said Sandy to WTAJ. 'I saw a lady get out of the passenger seat screaming, 'My babies, my babies'. 'We . heard the thump, we didn't come out right away. We watched the . emergency services cut the doors off and cut the roof off and get the . driver out of the car. 'I am glad we didn't come out when we first heard the thump otherwise we wouldn't have been able to sleep for days.' Freak accident: The car can be seen in the distance and the tree in the fore front of the screen shot . Severe: The four surviving members of the family were taken to hospital after the accident . Erosion: This is the stump of the tree that authorities believe had rotted away before the accident on Monday . Chief Louis Barclay of the Conemaugh Township Police said he’s shocked at the freak nature of the accident. 'In my 23-years here I have never had anything like this,' said Chief Louis Barclay. 'To have two young children die in the same family it must be horrendous on the parents, I can't even imagine.' Authorities said the tree was rotten at the base but they don't know what caused the tree to fall.

"By . Fiona Macrae . A two-in-one treatment could revolutionise the care of men with advanced prostate cancer. Patients who undergo surgery as well as drug treatment are twice as likely to still be alive 14 years later as those given medication alone, a study found. If further research confirms the effect, the management of late-stage prostate cancer could be ‘revolutionised’, said the researchers. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, affecting 41,000 a year and claiming almost 11,000 lives. Dual action: Prostate cancer patients who undergo surgery as well as drug treatment are twice as likely to still be alive 14 years later as those given medication alone, a study found. Pictured, prostate cancer cells . Advanced cancer, which has spread to other parts of the body, is normally treated with drugs that mop up the male hormones it needs to grow. Men live for an average of five years after starting testosterone-blocking drugs. In the latest study, British and Swedish researchers looked at whether surgery combined with this hormonal therapy is better than the therapy alone. Half of the 1,400 men studied had their prostate removed before starting testosterone-blocking drugs. The other half simply had the drug treatment. Some 321 men given drugs alone died during the course of the study – twice as many as in the group given surgery and medicine. Although radical prostatectomy, or prostate removal, is used in earlier stages of the disease, it is not normally carried out once the cancer has spread throughout the body. This is because it is thought that the cancer has such a grip that there is little point in trying to contain it. There are also concerns about putting patients through surgery, plus prostate removal can cause distressing side effects such as  impotence and incontinence. However, the latest research, released at the European Association of Urology’s annual conference, suggests that the prostate is still fuelling the cancer, even after it has spread elsewhere. The conference heard that recent research has focused on developing new drugs. However, combining  surgery with the standard treatment seems more promising. Lead author Professor Peter  Wiklund, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, cautioned that further studies are needed but said the  combined treatment could ‘revolutionise the management of advanced prostate cancer’. Mikis Euripides, of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘While this is a valid line of inquiry, the evidence isn’t enough to conclude that men with advanced prostate cancer would be better off having a radical prostatectomy. ‘However, the findings do indicate that there may be value in conducting a larger clinical trial.’","Two-pronged treatment could 'revolutionise' prostate cancer treatment .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Mario Ledwith . Outspoken: John Major said he was appalled that . 'every single sphere of British influence' was dominated by people who . went to private school . Britain is run by privately-educated elite, former Prime Minister Sir John Major has warned in a dramatic warning about the difficulties for poor children to get on in life. The Conservative grandee said the dominance of the wealthy and well-educated  in the ‘upper echelons’ of public life was ‘truly shocking’. His remarks were seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of David Cameron's government, in contrast to Sir John's own upbringing in a rented flat in Brixton, South London. It is the second time in a month that Sir John has spoken out about the dangers of out-of-touch well-heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor. During a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association on Friday evening, Sir John said: ‘In every single sphere of . British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held . overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. ‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’ Downing Street rejected the criticism, insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said the PM regularly speaks to Si John. ‘At the heart of this is about the importance of building what the Prime Minister has decribed as an aspiration nation,' the spokesman said. ‘I actually think that what people around their breakfast table in the morning, getting their kids ready for school… what they want to know is the government has the policies to ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions. That’s what is the most important thing.’ Sir John blamed Labour for the ‘collapse in social mobility’ and the ‘truly shocking’ inequality in the UK. He criticised Ed Miliband's ‘absurd mantra to be the one-nation party’, suggesting that ‘they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration’. The 70-year-old grew up in a rented flat in Brixton and was educated in a comprehensive school where he attained three O-levels. Despite his direct criticism of Labour policies during the speech at South Norfolk Conservative Association’s annual dinner, his comments are also likely to prove embarrassing for David Cameron. The Prime Minister was educated at Eton and went on to study at Oxford University. Several senior members of the Cabinet, including Chancellor George Osborne and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, were privately educated, as was London Mayor Boris Johnson. Sir John suggested that British institutions should return to a system whereby ‘sheer hard graft’ can lead to success, rather than having to rely on privilege. He said: ‘I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost. 'Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born. ‘We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn’t going to happen magically.’ His concerns echo those expressed by Education Secretary Michael Gove – also educated at a State school – who suggested last year that ‘progressive’ education policies had damaged social mobility. Embarrassing: Both the current Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, left, and his Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, right, as well as senior members of the cabinet, were privately schooled . Suggesting that the Government needed to ‘pull together’ to win the next election, Sir John also criticised the Coalition’s push for same-sex marriage. Sir John, Prime Minister between 1990 and 1997, said: ‘Social mores have moved on from the way in which we were brought up, with the values that we had. They have moved and changed. ‘And that is why issues such as gay marriage have proved so toxic for the Conservative Party. ‘For people like that, who form the bulk of our party and a great deal of our country too, these are difficult issues, these bewildering social changes, and mostly it is my generation and older who are unsettled by these changes. ‘We may be unsettled by them, but David Cameron and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world. They cannot Canute-like order it to go away because it won’t.’ Sir John also said the Tory leadership should pull their punches on Ukip, saying ‘many of the Ukip  supporters are patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing’ and who will come back to the  Tory party. Warning: Sir John Major said successive governments had ignored the 'poor and near-poor' Last month Sir John warned wealthy politicians from privileged . backgrounds have a moral duty not to ‘kick the ladder’ away for those . struggling to improve their lives. In a passionate speech standing up for . the ‘silent have-nots’, Sir John pointedly drew on his own experience . growing up in poor parts of Brixton. Speaking to the parliamentary press gallery, Sir John said there were too many people ‘falling behind through no fault of their own’. He added: ‘They are white, black, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish – all of them. ‘They work hard, they obey the law, . they hope for a better future and they live in every single constituency . up and down the country. ‘And this trend of people falling behind in the modern world is one that we cannot accept.’ He warned it was ‘criminally easy’ to . overlook these ‘silent citizens’ because they do not ‘make a fuss, they . just get on with their lives’. Si John added: ‘They struggle to pay the bills often, they think carefully before having a family holiday. ‘If unemployed they seek work, if employed they work hard to hang on to their jobs. And how do I know about these people? ‘Because I grew up with them. They were my neighbours, the silent have-nots. ‘They are not high-fliers, not . financially secure. They’re the dignified poor or near-poor and to the . shame of decades of politicians – and I include myself in this – there . are still millions and millions of them.’","Sir John Major says Labour left 'Victorian divide' between rich and poor .

Additionally, half of those surveyed by ShoeBuy.com fessed up to lying about the true price of a new pair of heels. Most women aren't too proud to own knock-offs however, with 82per cent admitting to possessing fake designer shoes. Shh: One in five women admit to being more turned on by a pair of new shoes than by their significant other, finds a new study, and half are willing to lie about the price they really paid for them . The study, which focused on 1,000 women between the ages of 35 and 44, also revealed that the subject of shoes is a hotbed for female cattiness. Nearly half admit to having judged someone based entirely on their shoes; and it's an even split on whether or not those judgements were positive or negative - depending, presumably, on the caliber of said shoes. Quite what it is about fancy footwear that has such an enduring appeal among women remains something of a mystery, but its prevalence is undeniable. Revealed: The study also indicated that women can be catty about shoes, with half admitting they have judged someone else on their footwear alone . New shoes you say? As Carrie Bradshaw infamously once said in Sex and the City, 'Men I may not know, but shoes, shoes I know' In the immortal words of Sex and the City front-girl, Carrie Bradshaw: 'Men I may not know, but shoes, shoes I know.' Marilyn Monroe echoed the sentiment when she proclaimed: 'Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world.' And shoe designer to the stars Christian Louboutin famously delivered the verdict: 'A woman can carry a bag, but it is the shoe that carries the woman.' In an ironic twist on the fashion staple that entices more lust in some women than their spouses, high-heeled shoes were actually first invented in the 1500s, for men on horseback to stay in their stirrups. 'A woman can carry a bag, but it is the shoe that carries the woman' That trend evidently failed to endure for the men, but these days, the average American woman owns 17 pairs of shoes, and admits to only wearing three pairs regularly. And in a final testament to women's utter devotion to their shoes, the recent study reveals that a quarter refuse to kick their high heels off in the interest of comfort, no matter how painful they might be.","Shoebuy.com's new study also found that half of women lie to their spouses about the true cost of their shoes .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Today show co-host Tamron Hall has finally embraced her curls, appearing on TV this morning sporting her natural hair for the first time. The 43-year-old announced her foray into the follicular unknown on Twitter, stating: 'Keeping my promise this morning to the Queen of #naturalhair @CurlyNikki This morning on @TODAYshow no flat iron no heat no chemicals :)' An hour later, she elaborated on her reasons behind ditching the styling apparatus, tweeting: 'I was out with @BearGrylls until midnight living in the wild. Got 4hrs of sleep simply too tired to blow dry and flat iron my hair.' Scroll down for video . Ta-da! Today show co-host Tamron Hall, 43, (pictured) showcased her natural hair on air yesterday, tweeting that she had been up until midnight filming a special with Bear Grylls and was 'too tired' to style it . Ms Hall is referring to her part in NBC's new reality series, Running Wild with Bear Grylls, which sees the British survival specialist take a handful of U.S. stars off into the wilderness to be 'stripped of all the benefits of celebrity,' and pushed 'out of their comfort zones.' As the only woman scheduled to appear in the series - which has so far signed up Zac Efron, Ben Stiller and Channing Tatum - it's no wonder Ms Hall is pushing her beauty routine a few rungs down the priority pole. 'I was out with @BearGrylls until . midnight living in the wild. Got 4hrs of sleep simply too tired to blow . dry and flat iron my hair' Ms Hall, though appearing sheepish when she admitted on air that she had until then never been on TV without taming her curls, was flooded with compliments. Co-host Savannah Guthrie tweeted: 'Loving @TamronHall's hair this morning!' NewsHour host Gwen Ifill echoed the applause, posting: 'Is there an @tamronshair account yet? Get on it!' And according to Carson Dailey, the rest of the twittersphere was awash with praise too, telling Ms Hall during the segment: 'Every two seconds there's a whole thing about your hair...You rock.' First time: Ms Hall, pictured yesterday (left), and last week sporting her usual hairstyle (right), says she does her morning hair and make-up routine by herself, and normally uses a flat iron 'daily' to 'smooth the edges' Last month, Ms Hall detailed her usual morning regimen for Today.com; which involves a 4.30am daily start, a spot of prayer and meditation, and a 30 minute hair and make-up session, which she claims to do herself. 'I find more things to ""fix"" the longer I take,' she wrote. 'My hair is naturally curly, so I do flat iron it daily to smooth the edges, but on the weekends I go heat-free. I use a little paste on the weekdays for lift.' Baring her natural appearance for the sake of TV is becoming something of a habit for Ms Hall, who last month tested software that predicted how she would look aged 60, and earlier this year, braved the cameras completely make-up free - although she didn't neglect to straighten her locks on that occasion.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and James Nye . Forced out: Former FBI Newark Field Office director David Velazquez resigned Friday from his job as head of WTC security . The head of security for the World Trade Center site has been forced to resign after a series of highly-publicized security breaches. David Velazquez, who previously was director of the Newark FBI Field Office, resigned Friday after BASE jumpers leaped off the roof of One World Trade Center late last year and a New Jersey teen eluded a sleeping security guard last week to reach the roof. Velasquez formally resigned from his role as assistant director for security for the Durst Organization, which oversees the site, the New York Post first reported Friday evening. 'He submitted his resignation and it was accepted,' a company spokesperson told the paper when reached for comment. The outgoing exec spent 31 years at the FBI before taking the WTC gig in August 2013, according to the Post. The BASE jumpers launched themselves off the 1,776-foot tall building only weeks later, but that was only the beginning of the an embarrassing series of blunders by WTC security staff that would do Velazquez in. Security at the nation's tallest . building has been called into question after that breach and that of New Jersey teen Justin Casquejo, who sneaked to the roof earlier this month after sliding through a hole in the fence and riding an elevator operated by a construction worker. He then slid past at least one security guard he told police was sleeping on the job to access the roof. '2013 Security Officer of the Year': One World Trade Center guard Abdul Basher 'exercises' his eyes while on duty at the nation's tallest skyscraper and site of the 9/11 terror atrocity . An alarming photograph taken earlier this week in the lobby of One World Trade Center shows a half-blind security guard sleeping on the job - but the security guard swears he was in fact 'exercising' his bad eyes. Instead of acting as the first line of defense for the world's number one terror target, Abdul Basher, 65, is laid out almost horizontal in a chair. Tallest and most sacred: One World Trade Center is seen from the top of Rockefeller Center on March 21, 2014 in New York City . The intensely embarrassing image was taken at around 2.45am on Saturday - six days after a New Jersey teen made it past another guard on the 104th floor. Two CNN producers were also arrested earlier this week attempting to expose dangerous flaws in the tower's security. Basher, who can't open his left eye and has 'hazy' vision out of his right was fired as soon as the Port Authority became aware of the picture. 'Sometimes I cannot recognize people, stairs,' said Basher to The New York Post. 'That post was so hard to cover for me. It was very, very stressful. I could barely see half of the lobby.' The dozing guard - who was named the 'Security Officer of the Year' was spotted by another Port Authority worker who took the picture. The image emerged just the day after President Obama revealed his biggest fear was a nuclear attack on Manhattan after brushing off Russia as a major threat to the United States. However, Basher vented his fury on . the Port Authority and said that he shouldn't have been placed at the . south lobby of the tower and he denied he was asleep. 'To . my knowledge, actually I was not sleeping. I was mistaken to be . sleeping. I was exercising my eyes,' he insisted to the New York Post. 'The security division is so poorly managed . . . Every security guard that works for them is mentally stressed,' he said. A . Port Authority insider admitted to the New York Post that the incident . was troubling and said they would take the security firm Durst . Organization to task. Embarrassing: A security camera is positioned next to a barbed wire fence outside Ground Zero and One World Trade Center on March 21, 2014 in New York City. Earlier this week a teenager successfully evaded security, climbed One World Trade Center and posted photos of the view to social networking sites . Durst spokesman Jordan Barowitz confirmed that Basher 'was terminated on the spot after he was found sleeping on the job.' Construction workers at the nearly completed tower were infuriated by the image. 'There’s our hardworking security right there . . . What a joke!' one said to The New York Post. In a week where security at One World Trade Center has dominated the news, the base jumpers who filmed as they leaped off One World Trade Center in a daredevil stunt have said they didn't mean to be disrespectful. James Brady and Andrew Rossig, who leaped off the 104th floor of Freedom Tower with their friend, Marko Markovich, in September, said the jump was supposed to be a private moment. But, after handing themselves into police Monday, the friends uploaded footage of the jump, made at 3am on September 30, last year. The video has quickly gone viral, with more than 200,000 views in just over one day. Collared: CNN producer Yon Pomrenze, 35, and . 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals were arrested Tuesday after trying . three times to break into the World Trade Center site . Their actions were condemned by the Port Authority and New York Police Department, which said the jump 'violated the spirit of respect and reverence for this sacred site that almost all connected with the WTC project feel'. This followed the news that 16-year-old Justin Casquejo, of Weehakwen, bypassed security and climbed to the top of 1 World Trade Center. The teen was arrested at 6am on Sunday and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass, said Joe Pentangelo, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. The teen accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4.00 a.m., Pentangelo said. He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing scaffolding. Captured: Police allegedly seized the GoPro video of the BASE jump during a search of the four men's home last month, and it was not posted online until Monday . Going down: The initial free-fall from the 1,776ft tall One World Trade Center tower is several hundred feet . City that never sleeps: One of the jumpers descends on the streets of New York City . Confessed: James Brady, left, and Andrew Rossig, right, are accompanied by attorney Timothy Parlatore as they turn themselves in to police on Monday . 'He’s a skinny kid who got through a skinny hole,' a police source told the New York Post. Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper. He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof. That guard has since been fired, the spokesman said, but the elevator operator was able to keep his job because he is in a union. Sneaky: Weehawken, New Jersey teen Justin Casquejo, 16, was arrested after successfully making it to the top of One World Trade Center in the middle of the night on March 16 . And as part of an investigation to expose perceived lapses in security, CNN producer Yon Promrenze, 35, and his 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals tried to break in on Tuesday night. The two men first tried blatantly walking through a security gate on Vesey and Washington Streets but were stopped by an officer, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said. 'If a 16-year-old can get on the site, we should be able to get in as well,' one of them allegedly told the officer.","Former FBI Newark Field Office director David Velasquez resigned Friday from his job as head of WTC security .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Jessa Duggar, the 21-year-old star of TLC's 19 Kids and Counting, has sparked a social media storm after she was snapped posing boldly with a pink-trimmed high-capacity semi-automatic assault rifle. The photo was posted on Facebook by Jessa's boyfriend, 19-year-old Ben Seewald; a staunch Christian conservative who is highly vocal about his support for guns and his commendation of abortion. 'My AWESOME girlfriend. #DontmesswithJessa', reads the caption. Eyebrow raising: Jessa Duggar (pictured) has sparked controversy after this photo appeared on her boyfriend Ben Seewald's Facebook account, captioned 'My AWESOME girlfriend. #DontmesswithJessa' Happy couple: Ben (left) followed the gun-toting photo of his sweetheart with a series of loved up snaps of himself and Jessa looking happy as can be together (pictured) The photo seems to have been taken in a gun store, and has attracted a predictable wash of debate, with users taking to the comments section to vent their views. 'Isn't that the kind of guns they give soldiers who are at war? No wars going on in North America. People who think it's okay to keep weapons like this in their homes scare me', wrote one user. 'Brain washed fools. I'm glad she knows how to defend herself...Btw, if you wait for the police to defend you, you will die waiting. I on the other hand will lock and load', wrote another. One commenter posed the frank question: 'Wow, would Jesus carry that weapon?' To which another responded with a specific reference to the Bible: 'Jesus would carry that, were he walking among us today. He exhorts his followers to buy the best personal defense weapon of the day, the sword, even if they had to sell their only cloak to get one. Luke 22:36.' Strong views: Ben is a strict conservative Christian who stands firmly behind the Second Amendment, which allows for gun ownership, and staunchly against abortion . It isn't the first time the Duggar family have come under fire for their gun-related antics. In 2011, 23-year-old John David Duggar, the family's third eldest sibling, was photographed posing with two large rifles hugged to his chest, along with his exchange student friend, before heading out to target practice. 'We believe it is important for children to learn safety about guns and knives' In response to the backlash, the Duggars stressed that gun safety was a top priority in their house. Guns are kept in a safe that can only be accessed by a few family members, they claim, and everyone who handles the guns has taken gun safety classes. 'We believe it is important for children to learn safety about guns and knives. To learn how to use them properly and to learn not to use them to hurt others but to use them as a tool', Jim Bob Duggar, the 48-year-old family patriarch told Radar Online. Previous antics: In 2011, this photo of Jessa's brother, 23-year-old John David Duggar (left), posing with two rifles, also caused a negative backlash . Pro-guns: The Duggar parents (pictured) have previously . been vocal with their views about gun ownership, with Jim Bob (left) once . saying, 'It’s really not the gun or the knife, it’s the person that has . it in their hands' Jim Bob has also likened guns to knives in the past, saying: 'We’ve all used knives to cut a steak or open a box. It’s really not the gun or the knife, it’s the person that has it in their hands.' 'Jesus is EVERYTHING to me. Without Him, I am nothing' Since posting the controversial photo of his rifle-welding sweetheart, Ben - whose Facebook profile summary reads: 'Jesus is EVERYTHING to me. Without Him, I am nothing' -  has been busy sharing a series of loved up photos of himself and Jessa, with captions including: 'Love you, Babe!' and, 'Spending the day with my Sweetheart!' Also appearing are several of Ben's commonly dropped pro-life references, such as: 'Abortion is a matter of life and death. We must abolish abortion!' According to the Duggar family's views on dating, Jessa and Ben are just 'courting' for now, which means they refrain from kissing or holding hands and always have a chaperone on dates. The Duggars, from Tontitown, Arkansas, see courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families. Only once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold hands for the first time, but they will have to wait until their wedding day before sharing their first kiss. Marriage on the cards? Jessa recently launched official Instagram and Twitter accounts in which she takes on Ben's last name, identifying herself as 'Jessa Seewald' Last month, the couple went on a double date with Ben's parents, and Jessa spoke to Ben's father about her initial feelings for his son. 'I noticed him right off. I was like,  ""Hmm, he seems like a nice guy,"" but I never really consider a guy unless he's approached my dad', she said. 'Definitely in the early stages of our friendship, I thought he was a great guy,' she continued. 'But I'm that type of person that I'm not going to get emotional or like daydream about [a guy] unless he really expresses his interest. I'm not gonna set my expectations on anything happening.' Family portrait: Jim Bob Duggar (center right) once said of his 19-strong brood, 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions' Although an official engagement hasn't yet been announced, two weeks ago, Jessa opened official Instagram and Twitter accounts with the name 'Jessa Seewald' - the pair's biggest hint yet that marriage may be just around the corner. The Duggar family are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which teaches that 'children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.' Addressing their critics, Jim Bob once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.'","Jessa, 21, is holding a .22 caliber high-capacity semi-automatic assault rifle .

The Mexican food chain states: 'The Quesarito is filled with seasoned beef, premium Latin rice, Chipotle sauce, and reduced-fat sour cream, and then wrapped up in a grilled quesadilla loaded with melted cheeses' From June 9, the menu item mash-up will be available 'permanently' in Taco Bell's around the U.S., retailing for $1.99 for its seasoned beef option, $2.79 for shredded chicken and $2.99 for a steak filling. Hybrid: Taco Bell's new Quesarito (pictured) is the love child of its meat and rice-filled burrito, wrapped in its cheese-loaded quaesadilla and topped off with reduced-fat sour cream and Chipotle sauce . According to Taco Bell's chief marketing officer, Chris Brandt, the Quesarito - which packs 620 calories for its chicken version, 640 calories for its steak filling and 650 calories for its seasoned beef - has been road-tested in Oklahoma to a roaring reception. In fact, it's the best-selling test product since the legendary Doritos Locos tacos; a meaty taco encased in a hard shell made out of Doritos Cool Ranch chips - a whopping 825 million of which have been sold since March 2012. Last month, Taco Bell finally revealed the list of additions made to its '88 per cent beef', to account for the remaining 12per cent. The meat of the matter: Taco Bell recently launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12per cent of its beef that is not really beef (pictured, the Doritos Locos tacos) According to the brand, each of the two billion tacos it serves up every year contain USDA-inspected quality beef, water added to keep it moist, 'Mexican spices and flavors', plus oats, yeast, citric acid and 'other ingredients' to ensure the consistency of its seasoned beef. Taco Bell's unexpected move toward greater transparency, followed by its launch of a breakfast menu in March and now its announcement of the Quesarito, is further evidence of the brand stepping up its game in a bid to take on fast food giant McDonald's. Taco Bell's addition of breakfast was its largest menu expansion in the chain's 50-year history. The Waffle Taco - eggs and bacon wrapped in a waffle and drizzled with syrup - has been a national hit. Morning snack? Taco Bell started serving breakfast nationwide in March, with the Waffle Taco (pictured) proving particularly popular . Trial: Taco Bell will launch its first fast-casual restaurant, U.S. Taco Co. (pictured) in California's Huntington Beach, and depending on its reception, could expand to other locations . As for its the evening crowd, Taco Bell is also planning to test the waters of the fancier, fast-casual eatery scene with a new restaurant called U.S. Taco Co. In addition to fancier food, the new joint will also have booze. Jeff Jenkins, . Taco Bell senior brand manager, said in a statement: 'U.S. Taco is a new concept sit-down restaurant that offers the best fusion of . American-inspired flavors in tacos, fries and shakes, for [the] emerging . demographic of edgy foodies looking for a unique dining experience.' The opening of its first restaurant, in Huntington Beach, California, is still a few months away, but fans of Taco Bell's fare will only have to wait until Monday to get their hands on the Quesarito: the next installment of the brand's master plan to take over the fast food world.","The Quesarito will launch nationwide on June 9 and will retail for between $1.99 and $2.99 .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Last week, Brazilian supermodel Barbara Fialho revealed the very unusual secret to her glossy locks: she burns her hair to keep it healthy. Velaterapia, we learned, is a process whereby an open flame - usually a candle - is used to singe off and 'cauterize' split ends, opening up the follicles to make hair more receptive to conditioning; all without taking anything off the length. Femail jumped at the opportunity to test out the procedure, in the hopes that this tester would emerge from the flames with a luscious mane, rather than a frazzled mop. Scroll down to see video . From frazzled to sleek: Much to my surprise, Velaterapia actually worked wonders, transforming my damaged locks (left) into hair that verges on healthy (right) I should admit upfront that I haven't so much as trimmed my hair for over three years, such is my love affair with long tresses. So between this obstinate refusal - I practically have to prize the snapping scissors out of the hands of hair stylists when I get it colored - and my bleached ends, there is nothing healthy about my hair, long though it may be. I tracked down one of the only salons in New York City to offer Velaterapia - or 'candle-cutting' as it also known - an upscale Brazilian salon in Nolita called Maria Bonita; frequented by Victoria's Secret models Alessandra Ambrosio, Ana Beatriz Barros, Isabeli Fontana, and Barbara Fialho herself. Girl (literally) on fire: My stylist twisted my hair into small sections, leaving my copious number of split ends to stick out, then ran a candle back and forth under them, singeing off the damaged parts . Ricardo Gomes - my chirpy, chiseled Brazilian stylist - sits me down and starts twisting my hair tightly into small sections as he launches into a mini-history of the practice, while I eye his hands suspiciously. After I make him promise, at least three times, that he is not going to hack off any of my length - despite our mutual agreement that my ends are crispy and my attachment to them is bordering on the insane - he takes up his candle, and proceeds to run it methodically back and forth under the length of each twisted section. Yes, this was fear-inducing, and yes, it smelled exactly as you'd expect: of burning hair. After he had finished with my full head, I was left with small white globs of candle wax clinging to a mass of poodle-like dreadlocks, before being whisked off to have my hair rinsed, and an intensive conditioner applied. The graveyard of split ends: You can clearly see the sizzled remnants of my split ends and the flecks of white candle wax at this, the most undignified stage of the process . The open flame, I'm told, has opened up my hair follicles to allow better absorption of the conditioner, and I'm propped under a heat lamp for 10 minutes as it works its magic. As Ricardo rinses and then blow dries my hair, he invites me to think of candle cutting as a regular trim, and recommends I get the treatment every eight to 12 weeks, in the manner of Ms Fialho. I'm surprised to learn that candle cutting has been a popular and . widespread hair care method in South America since the 1960s, and many women there literally burn off their split ends with candles at home. A . terrible idea, he points out, assuring me that stylists such as himself . are carefully trained in the art, and very practiced. Pesky ends: While the mid-section of my hair was left in much better condition after the candle-cutting (before, left, and after, right) the crispy tips which were left untreated do still stand out . No scissors! Left, my hair just before I had my candle-cutting appointment and right, two days after; just as long in length but with a freshly-cut, layered look - achieved only with the help of an expert flame-thrower . Ricardo says that while Brazilian glamor pusses have been stopping by this New York salon for candle-cutting for years, he first noticed a sudden surge in demand for the practice around two months ago, when curious Americans started asking for it too. Indeed, at one point during my treatment, a perky blonde customer strolls in for her appointment and, upon seeing Ricardo dancing around my hair, calming setting fire to it with an elegant long-stemmed candle, asks the receptionist with barely concealed alarm: 'Excuse me, but what on earth is he doing to her hair?' - before coming round to the idea and actually appearing quite impressed. At the end of my two-hour treatment, which costs between $150 and $200 depending on the length of your hair, I run my fingers through my freshly blow-dried tresses and am extremely impressed. It feels a good deal smoother and healthier than it did before, and neat layers have appeared, as if my hair has been expertly cut, but not shortened. Devotees: Barbara Fialho (left) recently revealed she was a die-hard fan of candle-cutting, and fellow Brazilian supermodels Alessandra Ambrosio (center) and Isabeli Fontana (right) also employ the technique . One problem that remains, of course, is . my crispy ends, which, if Ricardo had run his flame under, would have . been eaten off in a moment. Because the mid-section of my hair is now so . much more sleek, the dry ends are even more noticeable - which has led . me to concede that perhaps it is finally time to give them the chop. Brazilian supermodels swear by it, the beauty editor at Brazilian Vogue has labelled it 'unbelievably' effective, and for me, it blows a regular haircut out of the water. Velaterapia appears to rid (almost) the entire length of your hair of split ends, leaving the rest of your tresses healthy and soft to the touch. In summary, having a candle taken to your hair is not nearly as crazy as it sounds.","Velaterapia, or 'candle-cutting,' is popular with Victoria's Secret models including Barbara Fialho, Alessandra Ambrosio and Isabeli Fontana .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Florida, the home of white beaches, oranges and Disneyland, is actually the most stressed-out state in the U.S., according to a new study. Movoto.com compiled the rankings based on a number of lifestyle stressors, and rated Florida and its neighboring Georgia, which came in second, highest on the stress-out meter, both for having high unemployment rates and high numbers of people risking it without health insurance, among other factors. New Jersey came in third and New York came in seventh, both for being particularly overcrowded, with inhabitants facing long commutes, and 'stupid-expensive property tax', while oil-rich North Dakota, and agricultural hubs Iowa and South Dakota, appear to have it easiest across the board, finds the study. Life's no beach: Geographically speaking, it appears that states dotted around the coast experience some of the highest stress-out factors, while Midwestern regions have a much easier time of it (pictured) Six stress-inducing factors were compiled to into a final 'Big Deal Score' for each of the 48 states analyzed; unemployment rates, hours worked, population density, percentage of income spent on housing, percentage of population with long commutes the number of people without health insurance. In at number four on the scale was California, another state where even its exceptionally good weather doesn't make up for its stress factors. Although Californians work some of the shortest hours nationwide, the unemployment rate is the fifth highest, housing costs swallow up a high percentage of people's budget, plenty don't have health insurance, and the commute time is up there as being the ninth worst in the U.S - Maryland taking the top spot on that factor. Nevada was ranked the fifth most stressful state to live in, with the second highest unemployment rate in the country, beaten only by Michigan, and the second highest number of people without health insurance, narrowly beaten by Texas on that front. On the bright side, the population density is low, so at least Nevadans have space to stretch out as they contemplate their stressful existences. Results: Florida (left) was ranked highest on the stress-o-meter for factors including its high unemployment rates and high numbers of people risking it without health insurance, while North Dakotans enjoy plenty of space, short commutes and cheap housing (right) Illinois came in at number six on the scale, with more than 61per cent of its population faced with soul-destroyingly long commutes every day, as well as expensive housing. North Carolina scored ninth, with a high number of people per square mile, but with housing costs below average. Similarly, working hours are long but commutes aren't too bad, followed by Arizona at number ten, with very similar attributes. Bang in the middle of the road in terms of stress-out factors, are Louisiana, Delaware and Ohio, and hanging loose as some of the least stressed states after North Dakota, Iowa and South Dakota, are Minnesota, Nebraska, Vermont, Wyoming and Montana. Nightmare: Maryland (pictured) scored highly on the stress scale for being overcrowded, with the longest commute times in the whole country . The three hardest working states in terms of long hours are Wyoming, Louisiana and North Dakota respectively; all notably low on their overall stress-out scores, however. States with the shortest working hours are Utah, Oregon and Rhode Island. Unemployment is highest of all in Michigan, Nevada and the aforementioned Florida, and lowest in North Dakota, followed by South Dakota and Wyoming. And more people have health insurance in Massachusetts, Vermont and Minnesota than in any other states, but Texans, Nevadans and Floridians have the lowest numbers respectively. All rankings were compiled using data from the most recent U.S. Census' American Community Survey, from 2008-2012. Florida . Georgia . New Jersey . California . Nevada . Illinois . New York .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . They have both been high-ranking Victoria's Secret Angels who have graced the covers of Vogue over 40 times collectively. But 31-year-old Miranda Kerr and 21-year-old Karlie Kloss have both recently claimed they don't identify themselves as models. 'I never saw myself as a model,' Ms Kerr, who has an estimated net worth of $20million, said recently to Net-a-porter's Edit magazine, while Miss Kloss, worth a more modest $4million, told Into the Gloss: 'I have never considered modelling an actual job title.' Not models? Miranda Kerr (left) may be worth an estimated $40million, and Karlie Kloss (right) around $4million, but both successful supermodels are reluctant to identify themselves as such . And while most people would define their jobs as the thing they get paid to do - extremely lucratively in the case of these two professional beautiful people - it is true that these days, both can count themselves as established entrepreneurs too. 'If someone asks me what I do, I say, ""I have my own skincare line."" I don’t define myself as a model,' Ms Kerr says, in reference to her highly successful skincare care, Kora Organics, which she launched in 2009. 'I like being able to find different aspects of myself ... It's fun. I might as well do it while I can. It's not going to last forever.' Walking advert: Ms Kerr mists herself with a product from her successful Kora Organics skincare range (pictured), just one of her many entrepreneurial pursuits outside of modeling . Branching out: The Australian model ended her contract as a Victoria's Secret Angel (left) last year to focus on other projects, such as the single she recently released; a cover of Elvis Presley's You're The Boss (right) And Kora Organics is far from the only pie she has her perfectly manicured finger in. Last year, the newly single mother-of-one hung up her Angel wings to pursue a wide range of different business ventures, and to focus more on being a mother. 'The thing is, I've been modeling since I was 13. I'm now entering a new phase in my life. I have felt this coming since my son was born and, after I became a mother, I realized I needed to prioritize my time,' the Australian-born supermodel told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'If someone asks me what I do, I say, ""I have my own skincare line."" I don’t define myself as a model' As well as being ranked second in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's highest-paid models - Gisele taking the top spot - Ms Kerr recently released her second second-help book aimed at young women, entitled Empower Yourself, last month launched her first music single; a cover of Elvis Presley's You're The Boss, and has graced the covers of Edit, Vogue Australia, and Lucky magazine all in the last few weeks. Not just a pretty face: Miss Kloss recently took part in a week-long program at the Harvard Business School (pictured), with the aim of getting more involved in the successful running of a company . Multi-talented: One of Victoria's Secret's newest Angels (left), Miss Kloss has been pounding the catwalk since she was 13 years old, and has a gluten-free baking company called Karlie's Kookies (right) As for Miss Kloss, a Chicagoan-born former trained ballet dancer, she has this definition on how she earns her bread: 'I treat myself more as an athlete than just a model. I love to challenge myself physically and mentally. 'But I'm not a professional athlete, I'm not a professional dancer, I'm not a professional anything; I have never considered modelling an actual job title. I have yet to determine what my job actually is but, yeah, modelling is a fun and funny gig.' Miss Kloss, who, much like Ms Kerr, kicked off her modeling career when she was only 13, seems to have set her eyes on a different prize of late. Tough cookie: Miss Kloss (pictured) was a trained ballet dancer before she got into the fashion business, and says she treats herself more like an 'athlete' than a model . Dedicated: Ms Kerr is a long-time yoga fan, and regularly loops her practice into her affiliations with brands, including Reebok (pictured), Kora Organics, and Net-a-porter, to name a few . Last month, Miss Kloss attended the Harvard School of Business for a short course in The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. Speaking to The Daily, she said: 'I feel fortunate to have an incredible career but there is so much more that I want to do with my life. 'Now that I am getting more and more involved in these entrepreneurial projects I think business is something that would also be fascinating. 'I have never considered modelling an . actual job title. I have yet to determine what my job actually is but, . yeah, modelling is a fun and funny gig' 'To have a better understanding of economics and business, and the way to run a successful company.' Proving her business acumen, she launched a gluten-free cookie product called Karlie's Kookies at New York Fashion Week two years ago, in collaboration with popular Manhattan bakery Momofuku Milk Bar. Miss Kloss, who is a relationship with investment mogul Joshua Kushner, has recently teamed up with Warby Parker to collaborate on a collection of sunglasses. And the energetic model recently showed up at the Global Accelerator program run by the UN Foundation, where she attended a panel on the topic of formulating social solutions to global issues. Still, while both Miss Kloss and Ms Kerr may be stretching their wings way past the realms of catwalk, it seems unlikely that either will be permanently leaving their undeniable posts as 'models' any time soon.","Miranda Kerr would rather be recognized for her skincare line, Kora Organics .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A photographer has recreated the wacky diet plans of the rich and famous as a series of artfully shot still lifes, shot in the style of Old Master paintings. Dan Bannino, who is based between Italy and France, studied and reproduced the restrictive diets of Gwyneth Paltrow and Beyonce Knowles, the hedonistic table fares of Kate Moss and even the banquet spread of King Henry VIII. 'My aim was to capture the beauty that lies in this terrible constriction of diets and deprivation', explains Mr Bannino. '[And] to show how this weirdness hasn’t changed even since the 15th century.' 'Strict detox diet': Photographer Dan Bannino has recreated the wacky diets of the rich and famous, including this still life representation (pictured) of Gwyneth Paltrow's daily menu . Picture of health: A die hard promoter of her strict, detoxifying diet, Ms Paltrow (pictured) has authored four healthy-living cookbooks, and runs a popular diet and lifestyle blog called Goop . 'I started this project because I’m fascinated and obsessed by food', Mr Bannino tells The Times. He says he shot the table scenes in the style of an Old Master's painting - pre-19th Century art which is characterized by its extreme technical skill - to lend the photographs 'importance'. 'I wanted to make them significant, like classic works of arts that are becoming more and more weighty as they grow older', he says. 'Master Cleanse Diet': Beyonce took on this liquid diet consisting of nothing but lemon juice, maple syrup, cayenne pepper, salt, and laxative herbal tea - thus the plush pink toilet roll - to lose weight in a hurry . 'Hollywood diet': Kate Moss's shiny glass table - notably absent of food - holds half empty bottles of vodka and Coca-Cola, a champagne cork, and a tray of freshly chopped white 'powder' (flour for the purposes of legality) All in the name of beauty: Beyonce (left) admitted to being 'cranky' while on the Master Cleanse Diet and Kate Moss (right) is famed for once saying.. 'Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels' Mr Bannino researched the bizarre diets of his nine subjects in magazines and on the Internet and shot the tables in the self-made studio he has created in his Italian apartment. 'I'm lucky enough to live in a quite big place with high ceilings and loads of natural light', he tells the publication. 'Light is extremely important to me, as it was for painters like Caravaggio.' Each photograph took several hours for him to set up; dressing the tables, arranging the food and perfecting the background light. 'When I explain to [people] that I haven't used any post-production, they're terribly surprised', he reveals. 'Life enhancing': Music mogul Simon Cowell is said to enjoy fresh fruit delivered via airfreight, a multitude of 'vitamin drips', and bathing in milk (far left) 'Cabbage diet': Former president Bill Clinton's very patriotic table spread consists of an array of crunchy vegetables for the strict vegan . Big smiles: Simon Cowell (left) is a firm fan of anything - edible, injectable, or otherwise - that might help him maintain his squeaky clean appearance, and Bill Clinton (right) went vegan for health reasons . The diets portrayed by Mr Bannino vary dramatically. Beyonce, for example, famously credited a 14-day run of the Master Cleanse Diet, with helping her lose enough weight to perform her role in Dreamgirls. The Master Cleanse is a liquid diet consisting of nothing but lemon juice, maple syrup, cayenne pepper, salt, and laxative herbal tea, and purports to cleanse and detoxify the body while reportedly stimulating healthy tissue growth. 'I was cranky', Beyonce admitted to Oprah about her emotional state while on diet. 'People were eating Krispy Kreme Donuts around me.' Mr Bannino has teasingly included a few rolls of toilet paper to the table as a nod to the unpleasant side effects of the laxative tea, and scattered an array of Beyonce-worthy gold bling on the table. 'The egg diet': Eccentric art collector Charles Saatchi is said to have lost over 60 lbs by eating nine eggs a day for ten months, but refusing to forgo his much-loved red wine . 'Romantic poet's diet': Ethereal poet Lord Byron, who lived in 19th Century England, existed solely on biscuits and soda water or potatoes drenched in vinegar (pictured) Odd-balls: Charles Saatchi (left) was married to celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, who dutifully cooked him 'eggs, eggs and eggs', while Lord Byron's (right) intense fear of being fat led him to his extremely strict diet . Gwyneth Paltrow's table is spread with a vegetable-heavy array of highly nutritious food, set on blue checkered table and strewn with matching china. A die-hard promoter of her strict, detoxifying diet, Ms Paltrow has authored four healthy-living cookbooks, and runs a popular diet and lifestyle blog called Goop. On the other end of the crunchy-living spectrum is Kate Moss's hedonistic array of effects. Notably lacking any food at all; as Ms Moss infamously once tossed the statement: 'Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels'. Her shiny glass table holds half empty bottles of vodka and Coca-Cola, a champagne cork, a tray of freshly chopped white 'powder' (flour for the purposes of legality), and a crystal ashtray littered with used cigarette butts. Poignantly, a sharp-edged VIP badge sits neatly in the center. 'The banquet diet': 16th Century British monarch King Henry VIII regularly hosted opulent feasts like this one, consisting of a whole wild boar, a selection of other meats, and exotic fruit . '(Not so) Sober Life': Luigi Cornaro was a 15th Century Venetian nobleman, whose daily self-allowance was 14 oz of solid food and 17 oz of wine; a then-famous diet he confoundingly named 'the sober life' Polar opposites: King Henry (left) was well-known for his voracious appetite and glutinous eating habits while Luigi Cornaro (right) abandoned his excessive approach to food for health reasons and lived until he was 98 . Simon Cowell's 'Life enhancing' table is the purveyor of all things faddish; seemingly a reflection of the music mogul's never-ending quest for eternal youth. He apparently eats fresh fruit delivered via airfreight and drinks up to two smoothies a day made from exotic plants. He is also said to use a drip that boosts his levels of magnesium and vitamins C, for half an hour each week. And then there is the big tank of milk, which he reportedly bathes in. Former president Bill Clinton's table is entitled 'Cabbage diet' and displays an array of leafy vegetables, set on a table cloaked in the American flag. Faced with heart disease back in 2009, this political heavyweight overhauled his diet and went completely vegan. 'I've stopped eating meat, cheese, milk, even fish. No dairy at all', he said of his new eating habits. 'I've lost 30 lbs and I have so much more energy now! I feel great.' Behind the scenes: Mr Bannino shot the tables in the self-made studio he has created in his Italian apartment. 'I'm lucky enough to live in a quite big place with high ceilings and loads of natural light', he says . Eccentric art collector Charles Saatchi is said to have lost over 60 lbs by eating nine eggs a day for ten months. Good job he was happily married to celebrity chef Nigella Lawson at the time, who said of her husband's diet: 'It was all about eggs, eggs and eggs, with an occasional slice of toast.' For this shot, Mr Bannino placed a variety of eggy snacks on an elegant table with an nearly-empty glass of red wine - Mr Saatchi is said to truly love his grapes - and an imitation of Damien Hirst's famous Shark Tank artwork, which Mr Saatchi commissioned in 1991. Yum yum: A close up of the real boar the photographer used in his table assortment for King Henry VIII . And next, a step back into the archives, as the photographer recreates the diet of ethereal poet Lord Byron, who lived in 19th Century England. According to historian Louise Foxcroft, who wrote for the BBC: 'His horror of being fat led to a shockingly strict diet. Existing on biscuits and soda water or potatoes drenched in vinegar, he wore woolly layers to sweat off the pounds and measured himself obsessively.' Lord Byron's table displays this restrictive diet, with two poetry books and a single rose in a vase - a nod to the romantic nature of his work - thrown in for good measure. Dirty dishes: Each photograph took several hours for Mr Bannino to set up; dressing the tables, arranging the food and perfecting the background light . Henry VIII, the 16th Century British King who burned through a whopping six wives, was well-known for his voracious appetite and glutinous eating habits. He regularly hosted opulent feasts like the one displayed in Mr Bannino's still life, prepared by his 200-strong kitchen staff; a whole wild boar, as well as half munched chicken, pork, rabbit and lamb's meat, served with exotic pomegranate and a hearty tumbler of spilling wine. Last but not least, Luigi Cornaro; a 15th Century Venetian nobleman famous for his writings on nutrition. Finding himself near death at the age of 35, Mr Cornaro took the questionable advice of his doctors and adopted a rather peculiar diet plan. His daily initial self-allowance was 14 oz of solid food and 17 oz of wine. He later reduced that intake to no more than an egg a day, but hung onto the booze. Amusingly, for naysayers, he didn't die until the ripe old age of 98, fast asleep in his rocking chair.","Dan Bannino's photos are shot in the style of Old Master paintings .

"By . Louise Eccles . A social worker on St Helena who claims she was forced to resign after authorities failed to tackle ‘appalling’ child sexual abuse on the island will have her shocking allegations probed by an independent investigation, Mail Online can reveal. The social services manager, who has asked not to be named, said she was shocked when she arrived on the British overseas territory by the sheer volume of sexual abuse allegations. But she claims she was harassed and threatened when she blew the whistle on the alleged failure of police to properly investigate such crimes. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has promised an independent investigation will be launched into the social worker's claims about St Helena . Now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has promised an independent investigation will be launched into her claims. The probe comes after Mail Online revealed that a report by UK child protection charity The Lucy Faithfull Foundation found St Helena was rife with child sexual abuse, domestic violence and sexual exploitation. The charity was sent to the remote South Atlantic island by the British government, although the report was never released. A spokeswoman for the FCO said: ‘These are extremely worrying allegations which we take very seriously. ‘In response, we are setting up a full and transparent investigation to be led by a senior independent figure and supported by a team of experts.’ The social services manager was recruited from the UK for her expertise and moved to St Helena in February 2013. The mother-of-one said that, after talking to victims and health workers, she quickly learned that ‘paedophilia had become normal, it was the routine.’ She claimed the community and the authorities ‘had been turning a blind eye to it’ and expressed her frustration at trying to get historic closed cases re-opened. The probe comes after a report by UK child protection charity The Lucy Faithfull Foundation found St Helena was rife with child sexual abuse, domestic violence and sexual exploitation . She says she frequently clashed with police over how to deal with claims of child sex abuse, saying: ‘There is a very close expat community and they don’t want to disrupt the status quo. ‘It often felt like the police were trying to disprove cases, rather than find out the truth.’ The mother-of-one, who returned to the UK last month on leave and never returned, said she raised about 20 serious sexual abuse cases to the police during her 14 months on the island which had not been investigated when they were reported previously. The manager said she believed corruption was ‘everywhere’ among the authorities on the island. When she arrived she says she found child safeguarding was ‘in tatters’ and consisted of just two unqualified social workers. She said some police officers treated her with hostility. ‘They did not want to be challenged over their failure to tackle certain known paedophiles’, she said. ‘I began to uncover significant unaddressed child abuse problems. ‘Paedophiles were found to be private foster carers. Staff were allowed to have sexual relationships with vulnerable adults. Reported rapes were not dealt with. ‘Paedophilia was not being tackled if it involved public officials or connected people. They were not being investigated or charged.’ She claims that she was constructively dismissed on 8 July 2014. The manager said she had ‘no choice’ but to resign because she had been targeted by officials ever since whistleblowing to the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in March. She was also threatened with perjury charges in relation to an adoption case – something she believes was done to ensure she would leave the island. A social services manager, who has asked not to be named, said she was shocked when she arrived on the British overseas territory by the sheer volume of sexual abuse allegations . The whistleblower has now issued proceedings against the FCO and DFID at the employment tribunal, along with a fellow UK social worker who recently left the island. The manager said cases were not thoroughly investigated and pointed to the case of a two-year-old child, now some years older, who was taken to hospital by her foster carer with a perforated bowel, bruising, hair loss and malnutrition. Her foster carers claimed she had fallen off a rocking horse and the case was taken no further. Despite presenting the case to the police when she was told about the girl, the manager said no further action has been taken. She believes this was because the foster carer was a former public official on the island. She said: ‘Her injuries were entirely consistent with violent physical and sexual abuse. The injuries were the equivalent of a child being hit by a car at 30 mph. ‘Two paediatricians said her injuries were consistent with abuse, but nothing was done about it because of who the foster carers were.’ The Lucy Faithfull Report, which found there had been an ‘evident failure’ by police to tackle sex offenders, was full of praise for the social services manager. It found there was some ‘unhelpful attitudes’ about her on the island, while others said she had had not been on island long enough to appreciate ‘how things are done here’ and was like ‘a bull in a china shop’. The charity disputed this, saying: ‘Our view was that her approach was correct, and that the expressed urgency was measured and proportionate, since cases had been mishandled and badly managed for some time, and changes in practice and the philosophy underlying practice were long overdue.’ The charity used an example of an incident while they were on the island where ‘a child’s complaint that she was sharing a bed with her foster father had not been acted upon’. It said this became ‘sinister’ when the manager realised ‘the man had a previous conviction for child molestation’ for a victim of the same age and gender of the child. The charity said that, while they were fully supportive of her approach, they ‘did not agree with the Chief of Police’s view that her practice amounted to ‘cold case reviews.’ The social services manager described a culture where the rape victims were often dismissed by locals as ‘asking for it’. When a woman in her 20s came forward to report being repeatedly raped as a nine-year-old child by fishermen on the island, she was apparently shunned by her colleagues and the wider community. She said: ‘They blamed her for it, even though she was only a child when it happened. They would say she dressed a certain way or came on to them.’ She said victims were terrified that if they reported a crime to a teacher, police officer or social workers, that these figures of authority would be related or friends with the attacker. She said: ‘If you disclosed a crime, there was a fear the person you reported it to might be related. ‘They were worried about upsetting someone in a position of power. If they spoke out, no one would employ them in the community, and the benefits are not big enough to survive on.’ The manager also expressed concern that the creation of a new airport, which will cost UK taxpayers £246.6million, and opens in 2016, would ‘become a Gary Glitter type tour destination’, with child sex abuse 'effectively being financed by the British public’. She said she feared paedophiles would flood to the island in search of an ‘easy target, because sexual abuse and grooming of young girls was widely accepted. Facilities for children and adults with physical and learning disabilities were ‘horrific’, she said. ‘It was absolutely shocking and so incredibly depressing. A spokeswoman for the FCO said: 'These are extremely worrying allegations which we take very seriously . ‘A 15-year-old girl had been locked up in the unit since she was five-years-old. Most of the children did not have challenging behaviour but had learning difficulties. ‘One woman in her 30s had been there since she was a child when she was found neglected, another had autism and one woman was in there because she had been sexually abused by her step-father. ‘None of them should have been in there. It was heart-breaking.’ She said she immediately ordered staff to lock up a ‘padded cell’ for children at the so-called ‘challenging behaviour unit’ who ‘kicked off’, with mattresses attached to the walls. An FCO spokesman said: ‘The independent inquiry is in response to allegations made to us on 9 July by former employees of the St Helena Government.’ Responding to the employment tribunal application, they said: ‘We have been named as the first respondent in an employment tribunal regarding two workers on St Helena. ‘Due to the ongoing legal situation it would be inappropriate to comment further.’ A spokesman for the St Helena government said: 'Child safeguarding is an absolute priority for St Helena Government, the FCO and DfID. 'Working together over recent years we have taken great steps on St Helena and Ascension Island in protecting children and the vulnerable against abuse of any kind. 'The number of successful prosecutions over the period, with substantial sentences handed down, illustrates this.' They said the allegations made by the social worker were 'serious and will be examined'. 'With the UK Government we are setting up a full and transparent inquiry to investigate these claims and related matters. 'The inquriy will be led by a senior independent figure, supported by a team of experts. 'In view of this and because of the ongoing legal matters it would be inappropriate to comment further.'","Foreign and Commonwealth Office promise independent investigation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Women graduates are delaying the age they have children until 35 - almost a decade later than those who do not go to university. The phenomenon has grown as the number of female students has more than doubled in the past 20 years - in 2010 half of all young women in England went to university. Now, new research suggests, a baby’s social class can be determined by the age of their mother. Mature mum: BBC News presenter Kate Silverton, 42, who gave birth to her first child Clemency last November . Delaying motherhood by a decade helps . secure these women’s position on the career and housing ladders, but it . may be at some personal cost. Les Mayhew, professor of statistics . at Cass business school, part of City University London, said: ‘Women . who have children later in life may well have established their careers, . but they also face the risk of becoming the sandwich generation - . looking after ageing parents or other relatives while also bringing up . children.’ Danny Dorling, the professor of human . geography at Sheffield University whose research identified the trend, . said: ‘Until the massive expansion in university education, you couldn’t . guess social class by the age of a child’s mother. ‘Birth age was similar at all levels of society. Now the word ‘generation’ doesn’t mean the same thing across society any more. ‘Society has split into two groups. One group, of women graduates, clustered particularly in London and the . commuter belt, is having children very late and the rest are having them . at much the same age as their mothers and their grandmothers did.’ Younger mum: Peaches Geldof, 23, with her husband Thomas Cohen and five-month-old son Astala, is more typical of the social split of women who didn't attend university . If the phenomenon continues for . another generation, it means some grandparents will have to wait an . extra 20 years, until the age of 70, to have their first grandchild. Prof Dorling pointed out that although life spans are increasing, this is not happening quickly enough to make up for the gap. Women who delay childbirth are also . at higher risk of birth abnormalities, are more reliant on IVF and . cannot draw on the same energy levels as younger mothers. Last year, the average age at which . married women had their first child rose to 30.6, according to the . Office for National Statistics (ONS). The average age for all births outside marriage was 27.1, and 31.8 for all those within marriage. The ONS figures, however, fail to . pick up the sharp divide between graduate and non-graduate mothers, . because birth registers do not question a mother on her education. Ann Berrington, reader in demography . at Southampton University, has just published a paper showing that half . of women born in 1958 who obtained no educational qualifications had a . child by the age of 22, while for those with degrees the age was 32. Prof Dorling has mapped the impact . with more women graduates by looking at the number of babies born to . mothers aged 35 or older across European parliamentary constituencies, . and comparing them with the number of university graduates identified in . 2001 census data. Six London constituencies each had . more than 150,000 births to mothers aged 35 or over, over an eight-year . period, while a further seven in commuting range had more than 125,000. They also had some of the highest concentrations of university . graduates. By contrast, South Wales West had . only 5,550 births in the same period to mothers aged 35 or over, while . Mid and West Wales had 6,500. There are low numbers of graduates in . these areas. Prof Dorling, whose findings will be . published by Sage next month in The Population of the UK: A different . view of life in the United Kingdom, said: ‘Once you have a cluster of . women doing this it becomes normal and these trends become . self-reinforcing. ‘You would be seen as very strange as a young graduate woman working in London if you had a baby at 25. ‘Attitudes to women in high-paid work . have changed, and many families need two salaries to pay for a London . mortgage. Before the house price boom you wouldn’t need that.’ One graduate woman who has delayed childbirth is Nina Davies, 37, who has three degrees. She had her first child at 33 and her second last year. Mrs Davies, head of student . recruitment at London’s Royal Veterinary College said: ‘I had no . intention of becoming a stay-at-home mother when I had a child.’ However, she admitted that she will have to wait three years before she can make full use of her academic background .","The number of female students has more than doubled in 20 years .

"By . Louise Eccles . The Tom Cruise film Jack Reacher prompted 26 complaints to the British Board of Film Classification last year . A record number of films were given a 12A rating last year raising concerns a growing number of children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex. In 2012, 321 films were given this classification, up a third from 234 the previous year. The rating means children aged 12 and over can go and see a film at the cinema or watch on DVD unaccompanied, and those under this age can also view the film with an adult. The figures come on the same day it emerged Tom Cruise’s 12A hit Jack Reacher prompted the most number of complaints to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) over its’ violent, dark and sadistic’ content which was felt to be unsuitable for young children. The thriller in which a man shoots dead five people using a sniper rifle and then flees had already been subject to a number of cuts to get it down to the certificate it actually achieved but still generated 26 complaints last year. Wolverine, The Impossible and About Time were other 12A films that also saw the BBFC receive complaints in 2013 with many parents disapproving of the strong language often included, sexual references in some instances and the graphic content. The rise in the number of 12A films comes despite a study by the BBFC, in January, showing 27 per cent of consumers were unable to describe accurately what the rating meant. Patrick Swaffer, president of the BBFC, said in yesterday’s annual report more needed to be done to improve understanding. Miranda Suit, co-founder of the Safer Media campaign group, said she always suspected that when the 12A category was introduced it would benefit the film industry far more than parents or children, and the record numbers of 12As in 2013 appears to confirm this. Mrs Suit said: ‘12As are a gift to the industry – allowing a whole extra group of children, the under 12s, to provide a new revenue stream, as long as they are with an adult. ‘Meanwhile the BBFC are happy to allow surprisingly explicit violence and sadism in 12As, as evidenced by the complaints made about 12A Jack Reacher. ‘Explicit sex is also an issue, and the BBFC have actually relaxed controls on bad language in this category. ‘The BBFC need to provide much better protection – our children are far too precious to justify weighting regulation in favour of the industry rather than young people’s wellbeing.’ The movie Jack Reacher, featuring Rosamund Pike and Tom Cruise, was rated 12A but was called 'sadistic' Earlier this year the BBFC said age ratings would be relaxed after claiming parents accept it is ‘game over’ when protecting their children from bad language. Updating its guidance for cinema films and DVDs, the BBFC said from February 24 it would be ‘more flexible about allowing very strong language at 15’. The changes also impact on 12A films which according to the new rules can now include strong language, such as f**k may be used regularly if in context and that moderate sex references are permitted. As a result there are now concerns more films will be given a 12A rating this year and could generate more complaints from parents. Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Mediawatch UK, said the findings and changes only highlight how children are being used to turn films into lucrative business ventures. She said: ‘The increase would appear to underline the fact that producers want to get that crucial 12A rating because it means children can go and leads to a substantial increase in the potential audience. ‘You can sell a lot more lunchboxes and duvet covers linked to the film if under 12s have been allowed to see it. ‘The problem arises at the top end of the classification, when producers make a snip here and a cut there to a film so they can get the 12A rating. It does not always mean the film is suitable for children.’ A spokeswoman for the BBFC said: ‘The rise is not down to more strong language being allowed at 12A. ‘The very minor tweak in the Guidelines to take more account of context when classifying strong language at 12A only came into use in January this year and is unlikely to result in a sharp rise in films passed 12A. ‘The rise in 12A films in 2013 is more likely due to an increase in film submissions generally.’","Record number of films given a 12A rating last year, raising concerns a growing number of children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Armani Exchange has launched a set of his-and-hers bracelets crafted from recycled illegal gun metal and bullet casings. Created in partnership with Liberty United - a philanthropic jewelry brand which aims to reduce gun violence in the U.S. - each bracelet bears a serial number of an illegal gun it that Liberty United has recycled. 'Gun violence is rampant in the United States, but it doesn't have to be,' reads Liberty United's mission statement. Scroll down for video . Turning violence into beauty: Armani Exchange has teamed up with Liberty United to craft a set of bracelets (pictured) for $98.50, made out of seized illegal firearms in the U.S. The bracelet, which retails for $98.50, is available in men's and women's sizing, and 20per cent of Liberty United's profits from the collection will aid in funding programs aimed at reducing gun violence, according to Armani Exchange. The ancient Torc twist design symbolizes unity, according to Peter Thum, founder of Liberty United, but also the 'tension' involved in addressing the difficult issue of gun control. The bracelets' unique serial numbers, however, are perhaps their most poignant characteristic. 'In the case of what we do, the serial number is the only thing that's left of that gun, so it's a thread back', Mr Thum says on the collection's promotion video. 'It's like a piece of DNA, and it goes back to the source, but the physical thing where it came from doesn't exist anymore.' His and hers: The ancient Torc twist design symbolizes both the unity required to bring about change, but also the tension involved in addressing the controversial topic of American gun laws . Detail: Each bracelet comes with the original serial number from the gun used to make it, its last remaining element, which appears on the steel end caps . According . to Pew research, The U.S. has an estimated 283million guns in civilian . hands, and more than 30,000 people are killed by firearms each year - a . third of whom are under the age of 20. Of those deaths, over 10,000 are listed as homicides. In Canada, that . figure is around 200; in most parts of Europe, it's 150 and in Japan, . its less than 50 per year. 'Gun violence is rampant in the United States, but it doesn't have to be' 'We . focus very specifically on partnering with the police department, who . give us illegal guns and bullets', says Mr Thum, adding that the bracelets are . made exclusively in the U.S. This range is an extension of Liberty . United's wider collection of rings, bracelets and necklaces. The . brand has also collaborated with jewelry designers Giles & Brother . and Pamela Love, on pieces priced between $175 and $1,545. Roots: Liberty United's mission was born a few years ago in Africa, where founder Peter Thum (pictured) was disturbed by the number of young kids who were armed with assault rifles . Hoards: Mr Thum collected up over 30,000 banned AK47's (pictured) around Africa and melted them down to make jewelery, the profits of which still go towards his aim of reducing gun violence . Liberty United's story began 6 years ago on a trip to Africa, when Mr Thum stumbled across worrying hoards of young children armed with assault rifles. He started accumulating banned AK47's from around the continent, melting them down, recycling them and turning them into fine jewelry. 'Each piece of jewelry worn represents a gun which is no longer on the street killing somebody' The . proceeds were churned back into the project of destroying guns - about . 35,000 of them in Africa over the last three years - simultaneously . making a broader political statement about the problem at hand. In the words of one of Liberty United's collaborating designers, Philip Crangi: 'Each piece of jewelry worn represents a gun which is no longer on the street killing somebody'.","The $98 bracelet was created in partnership with Liberty United, a philanthropic cause which aims to reduce gun violence in the U.S."
"By . Louise Eccles . and Sean Poulter . It may not be the most obvious toy for a child’s Christmas wish-list, but a cuddly monster designed to ‘eat’ their worries is apparently in high demand. Amazon predicted the Sorgenfresser Worry Eater would be among the 20 most popular Christmas toys for 2014. The idea behind the £20 toy is that children write down or draw a picture of something which has upset them and put it into the monster’s mouth, which is zipped shut, banishing their worries. Scroll down for video . Popular gift: The idea behind the £20 Sorgenfresser Worry Eater is that children write down something which has upset them and put it into the monster’s mouth, which is zipped shut, banishing their worries . The award-winning toy was created in 2008 by German children’s TV animator Gerd Hahn and has become a huge success across Europe. The first monster was called Saggo, however, there are now several others including Frula, Betti and Biff. Flamm, an orange and white-striped monster with spiky hair, will be released in time for Christmas. Rachel Wyatt, who works for the distributors, said: ‘There is a symbolic element to zipping away a worry and it disappearing. But if mum or dad finds a worry in a Sorgenfresser’s mouth it will help them to talk it through with the child.’ Amazon said the toys are already proving popular on children’s online Christmas ‘wishlists’. The wishlists are created by parents so that family members, such as grandparents, can log on to buy the presents, in the same way as a wedding gift list.

"By . Louise Eccles . and Ian Drury . and Jack Doyle . Thousands of families’ half-term holidays could be ruined next week due to mounting chaos at UK passport offices. Staff are so overwhelmed they are struggling to issue the travel documents in time. There are claims holidaymakers are being advised to pay up to £55.50 extra each to get passports fast-tracked, guaranteeing they arrive on time. Huge demand: Passport applications are 300,000 up on the same period last year. Staff are so overwhelmed that they are struggling to issue the travel documents in time for next week's half-term holidays . A whistleblower said customers were left waiting on the phone for up to an hour because HM Passport Office had just eight staff to take more than 1,000 calls a day. Unions said the agency was in crisis because job cuts and office closures had left it unable to handle the level of demand. The Passport Office, part of the Home Office, has received around 300,000 more applications since January than in the same period last year. A spokesman for the agency blamed the surge on ‘the improving economy and a rise in holiday bookings’. Parents already pay a premium during school breaks because travel firms, airlines and hotels raise prices. But if a family of four wanted to ensure passports in time they would have to pay almost £200 in fast-track fees. The Passport Office, which recorded a . surplus of £72.9million in 2012-13, has been accused by parents of . running a ‘scam’ to increase revenue. A standard adult passport or renewal costs £72.50, or £81.25 if you use the Post Office’s Check and Send service, which ensures forms have been filled out correctly. Choosing to fast-track the passport – meaning it is delivered in just a week –  costs £103 and the premium four-hour  service costs £128. A standard child passport costs £46, or £54.75 with the Post Office’s Check and Send service. Fast-tracking the application is £87. In September 2012, the Government reduced the standard adult passport fee by £5 for two years, from £77.50. It followed criticism of a price increase from £72 to £77.50 in 2009, during the recession. One mother-of-two said her son’s passport arrived just three days before their half-term trip to Italy this weekend. The 43-year-old said she phoned the agency every day for a week and then received an unexpected call last Sunday offering to guarantee delivery if she agreed to pay the additional fee. The Passport Office advice line is closed at weekends so the family, from north London, believe it is exploiting customers’ frustration over delays by getting staff to suggest upgrades. The woman, who asked not be named, said: ‘We were told by a member of staff that hundreds and hundreds of people are upgrading … The implication was that if we didn’t pay it, we wouldn’t get our passport. ‘We felt held over a barrel … The cynical side of me thinks they may be incentivised in some way. We assume that staff paint the most negative picture to try and scare people into paying.’ She said the passport was help up by a spot check, adding: ‘There seems to be a particular money-making scam involving children’s passports, forcing parents to pay the extra money.’ An anonymous whistleblower, who worked at the agency, said: ‘The truth is people are all at the mercy of the Passport Office. ‘If you don’t go down the premium route then getting your passport is a bit like playing the lottery.’ Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn’s office said the Passport Office was ‘overwhelmed’ and one Tory MP has dealt with 20 constituents’ complaints about the agency in just one month. Users of online forum Mumsnet vented their frustration. Cost: There are claims some holidaymakers are being advised to pay up to £55.50 extra each to get their passport applications fast-tracked, guaranteeing the documents arrive on time . One called Dylan said: ‘We were told originally that four weeks was plenty for the passport to be returned … Now it looks as though we won’t get it in time … Our holiday has been booked for over a year and now it’s ruined at the last minute.’ Another parent called Mike branded the waiting times ‘a complete joke’, adding: ‘In my workplace, if it’s going to be a busy period, more people are given shifts so problems like this don’t happen.’ The Home Office website advises it takes three weeks to renew a passport. But Richard Simcox, of the Public and Commercial Services union, said cuts meant holidaymakers would ‘suffer’ – and warned problems would worsen in the summer. When the Mail called the Passport Office a reporter was told delivery of the travel documents was likely to take longer than the usual three weeks. A customer service adviser said: ‘It is extremely busy … You should get your passport within four weeks, but if you want it guaranteed then I would advise the upgrade service.’ Labour’s immigration spokesman, David Hanson, said ministers owed victims an ‘apology’, adding: ‘It’s unbelievable but yet again on Theresa May’s watch there’s a crisis in her department which is ruining people’s holidays, honeymoons and family visits.’ Home Office figures show that since the start of April, 6,753 passports did not meet target times, out of a total of 980,695. A spokesman for the Passport Office said: ‘We have brought in extra staff to respond to the extra demand, we are operating seven days a week and our couriers are delivering passports within 24 hours of [them] being produced. ‘There is no backlog, we have issued over three million passports so far this year and more than 98 per cent of straightforward passport renewals continue to be processed within three weeks.’","Passport applications are up by 300,000 on the same period last year .

"By . Louise Eccles . Benefits: Bethany Burnett (left), 19, and her mother Marie, 35, have blown £30,000 on cannabis . A mother and daughter have admitted they blew £30,000 in benefits on the teenager’s cannabis habit. Unemployed Bethany Burnett became addicted to cannabis at 16 and used her own Jobseeker’s Allowance and her mother’s child benefit to pay for it. Astonishingly the teenager blames her drug use on the UK’s generous benefits system, saying that if she hadn’t been given so much money she would not have developed her £30-a-day habit. Miss Burnett admitted she would smoke at least 10 joints every day and up to seven bongs, in which the drug is inhaled through a pipe. Her weight plummeted from 13 stone to just eight stone in a few months as she substituted cannabis with food. Just two weeks ago, the 19-year-old was taken to A&E by ambulance when she suffered a fit after smoking the drug through a bong. Claiming it was a ‘turning point’, she has been referred to a psychiatrist and is taking a concoction of medication to help beat her addiction. Miss Burnett, of Grangetown, Middlesbrough, claims she is now too ill to work – and has consequently seen her benefits double. But she says she wants to warn others about the dangers of cannabis. ‘I was desperate for cash to buy drugs. I’d use my Jobseeker’s Allowance to buy cannabis every week,’ she said. ‘I would have done anything to get my hands on cannabis. I just couldn’t be bothered to work or study and just wanted to get stoned.’ Blaming the generosity of the welfare system for the extent of her addiction, Miss Burnett said: ‘It’s shocking how much they give you. If they didn’t give me so much money, I wouldn’t have been able to spend it on drugs. It’s their fault my addiction got so bad.’ She began taking cannabis three years ago when she fell in with a ‘bad crowd’ at school and smoked the drug to fit in. But unlike her peers, her addiction spiralled out of control. She funded her habit with the £57.35 a week she received in Jobseeker’s Allowance. High cost: Bethany was spending £30 a day on the habit, funded by the £57.35 a week she received in JSA. And her mother would dip into her £115 child benefits, £34 child tax credits and £40 a week housing benefits . She also asked for up to £70 a week from her unemployed mother Marie, who was receiving £115 a week in child benefit, £34 in child tax credits and £40 in housing benefit. Addiction: Two weeks ago Bethany was taken to hospital in Middlesborough after smoking cannabis . Miss Burnett, who moved out of her family home when she was 17, estimated that she had spent £30,000 of the benefits paid to her and her mother on cannabis over the past three years. Her 35-year-old mother said she initially thought the money was to pay her daughter’s electricity bills, but later discovered it was to partially fund her habit. The mother, who has two other children, Anthony, 14, and Amy, 16, said: ‘I was really strapped for cash and Bethany kept asking me for money to buy food or to pay her house bills. ‘I knew she was smoking weed but at first I didn’t twig that she was using my benefits to buy it. ‘I tried to put my foot down and stop giving her cash handouts but if I didn’t give her the cash she would go crazy.’ Miss Burnett said she was now taking diazepam to control her anxiety as well as anti-depressants and a drug to control her heart rate. Miss Burnett has been placed on Employment and Support Allowance rather than Jobseeker’s Allowance because she says she is unable to work. She now receives £250 every fortnight, instead of £57 a week. She said: ‘I can’t work now because of all the tablets I’m on. They’ve put me on the sick.’","Bethany Burnett was just 16 when she became hooked on class B drug .

"By . Louise Eccles . It was once the sport of choice for retired gentlemen across Britain’s leafy villages. But 24-year-old Natalie Melmore hopes to transform the fusty image of lawn bowls this week when she steps out on to the green for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The glamorous sportswoman is England’s reigning champion after she became the surprise winner of the singles competition at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, in Delhi. Natalie Melmore, 24, hopes to transform the fusty image of lawn bowls this week when she steps out on to the green for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. She is a law and criminology graduate who has worked as a waitress to support herself . Now, Miss Melmore says she hopes her presence on Team England this summer will inspire young women to take up a sport, which is traditionally played by people many decades older than herself. She will play in singles and pairs when the Games begin on Wednesday. The sales manager, of Newton Abbott, Devon, is a law and criminology graduate who has worked as a waitress to support herself, and trains in her spare time . She said: ‘A lot of people still think bowls is exclusively for old people. ‘I’m working really hard to try to change that perception and speak to young kids in schools. ‘The problem is people do not want to try a sport where people take the mick out of them. Peer pressure is a big thing. ‘It is not a sport which impresses your friends at the moment. Unfortunately bowls isn’t as glamorous as other sports.’ To prove her point, she recalls a time when she appeared on BBC’s Newsround to promote bowls as an 11-year-old child. ‘I got a bit of stick about that at school’, she said. Miss Melmore at an award ceremony after winning gold in the women's lawn bowls singles during the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, 2010 . ‘Even now, I sometimes feel I have to justify why I play bowls to people by saying I am successful at it and that I play competitively.’ Her unlikely appearance for a bowls player, however, has its advantages, she says. ‘I joke that I should hustle older players by showing up at clubs and offering to play a quick game against someone for cash. ‘No one would suspect I was any good. Maybe if I get short of money...’. Miss Melmore, who was taught to play when she was nine by her father, said she had never encountered any sexism in the sport and that, playing with older men, meant she largely encountered ‘chivalry rather than chauvinism’. She said: ‘Our club is right by the sea so, on a glorious summer’s day, there is no better sport to play. ‘It is such a sociable hobby. I can’t think of any other sport where grandparents can take their grandchildren along and play together.’ The uniform of white tailored trousers, she says, is rather ‘old-fashioned’ and could do with an overhaul. But she admits with a smile that it was ‘really exciting’ when her Devon club introduced bright blue T-shirts. Miss Melmore, who was taught to play when she was nine by her father, said she had never encountered any sexism in the sport and that, playing with older men, meant she largely encountered ‘chivalry rather than chauvinism’ ‘It’s not exactly tie-dye tops, but we will get there eventually’, she says. ‘When I first started at county level, we would have to wear gloves, hats, tights, skirts and blouses – no trousers. ‘The rules were 20 years behind society.’ Miss Melmore is in a long-term relationship with Jamie Chestney, 27, a fellow bowls player and Commonwealth Games competitor for England, after meeting at a tournament in Cyprus several years ago. But when they tried to play mixed pairs for a year they ‘nearly strangled each other’ so now keep their work and personal lives separate. Both are now training in Glasgow in preparation for the games, which start on Wednesday. However, while Miss Melmore says there is a lot of ‘natural talent’ in the team, she also believes they would have been better prepared if they had received more funding from Sport England. She believes the Government was forced to cut back on funding for the Commonwealth Games after spending vast sums of money on the London 2012 Olympics. Miss Melmore, who must train in between her full-time job, because ‘there is no money in the sport’, said: ‘Unfortunately the funding from Sport England has been quite low this time around, as with other minority sports. ‘The London 2012 Olympics was heavily invested in, which is great and we did really well. I don’t want to take anything away from the Olympics. ‘But the money hasn’t been as free-flowing since then. ‘I think as a result quite a few smaller sports have not had as much funding as they did for Delhi.’ She said competitors from countries such as Australia, or the host city of Scotland, would be ‘better prepared’, having played in overseas tournaments over the winter. ‘In the last Games, the funding was one of the reasons we did so well. We could travel around the world playing against world-class players. ‘I should have been playing all winter like I did before Delhi and playing globally but, because we are so short of funding, we haven’t been able to do any international tournaments over the winter.’ She said it had been a ‘tough time’ for the squad, but that they were still hopeful of winning medals. ‘In the ideal world of course someone would be generous enough to sponsor us and allow me to train in the sport I love to do’, she said. But the ever-cheerful player heaped praise on the team of coaches and sports psychologists and said: ‘I play because I love the sport, not for money. If anything else, it keeps me out of trouble. ‘A medal of any colour would be amazing.’ Miss Melmore was a surprise gold medallist when she beat New Zealand’s world champion and world number one Val Smith to claim the title in Delhi four years ago. Growing up, she did ‘every sport under the sun’, including athletics, football hockey and swimming, including at county level. But when her father introduced her to bowls when she was still at primary school she fell in love with it and, at the age of 15, she was forced to pick her many hobbies. ‘It was hard to choose between swimming and bowls but, when I was told I was going to have to start swimming before school, it was all over. ‘Bowls is my hobby, I really love it.","Natalie Melmore is England’s reigning champion .

"By . Louise Eccles . ‘Fairly brutal sexual conduct’ has become ‘reasonably normal in St Helenian life’, a startling charity report has claimed. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation found puberty was widely regarded as a marker for young ‘girls’ availability’, rather than the age of consent on the British-owned island. The Mail revealed yesterday how a shocking report which was never made public by the British government found St Helena was rife with child sexual abuse, domestic violence and sexual exploitation. Scroll down for video . Culture: A report by the Lucy Faithful Foundation revealed that in the British territory of St Helena, 'society is generally tolerant of sexual assault' Now, we can reveal further details from the startling report into child sexual abuse on the British overseas territory, which is home to 3,800 people. The charity said the least charitable interpretation of the situation would be that ‘the society is generically tolerant of sexual assault, except of the most gross kind, and that the parameters of what was acceptable had been shifted’. They uncovered a ‘casual form of prostitution’, with women and teenage girls traded in return for food and consumer goods. Meanwhile, the Salvation Army and the Human Rights Office told them that ‘domestic violence was endemic’ on the island. Many older women had suffered a practice known as ‘downing’ in their childhood, when they were raped on the way to school. As a result of their own experiences, some did not recognise that grooming and abuse of their own children was a crime, but instead potentially ‘flattering’, if it was non-violent. Commissioned by DFID, two experts at the charity interviewed more than 50 St Helena residents including police officers, diplomats, school children, social workers and hospital staff. They also investigated Ascension Island, home to a Royal Air Force station and 900 residents, a two-day boat ride from St Helena. The report found evidence of the ‘grooming of children for sex’, particularly on Ascension Island’s bars, where alcohol was used as a ‘disabling narcotic’. It found young, male workers from the US air base preyed on young girls, saying: ‘The disinhibiting effects of alcohol, and being away from home, community and parental scrutiny meant that some of them considered local girls ‘fair game.’ Territory: On the island, one of the most remote in the world, some residents were involved in a 'casual form of prostitution' where women were exchange for food and consumer goods . The charity made 28 recommendations, including the removal of trial by jury for sexual offences on St Helena, claiming locals ‘appeared ‘extremely reluctant to convict alleged perpetrators of sexual abuses unless the perpetrator himself is hated by the community’ and that victims were often viewed as ‘slags’. It also called for urgent improvements to residential facilities for children and adults with disabilities to ‘avoid a public scandal’. Charity workers were shown a ‘home made padded cell’ for children who became upset or ‘difficult’, which had only just been taken out of use, at the insistence of a new social services manager. The buildings where children with physical and learning difficulties were housed were ‘terribly run down and extremely depressing’, while staff were forced to use their own wages to buy enough food for residents. One unit was used as a ‘dumping ground of sorts’, where residents included a distressed sixteen-year-old being bottle-fed and a woman in her sixties ‘in the final stages of multiple sclerosis’. A source who used to live on the island said: ‘What I saw happening on the island is absolutely appalling. ‘It reminds me very much of what happened on Pitcairn.’ Changes: The charity recommended that the island remove trial  by jury for sexual offences, because fellow residents were 'extremely reluctant' to convict alleged perpetrators of abuse . Hazel Wilmot, owner of the Consulate Hotel in Jamestown, St Helena, who moved to the island in 2008 from Botswana, said that the island had taken great strides to clamp down on sexual offenders in recent months. She said: ‘Five years ago I could not believe the total lack of empathy, the total lack of regard for sexual abuse victims. Everyone knew it happened. ‘Sexual abuse became part and parcel of island culture. There was a sense that ‘we know we have a problem but why don’t the expats go home and leave us to our island ways’. ‘Well, now the silence has been broken and it is time it was no longer accepted. ‘We are strengthening our police, we are strengthening our investigations, our laws, our child protection. The island is changing quickly and for the better.’ But she echoed concerns that Britain’s plans to build a £250million airport on the island would attract international paedophiles if it became known as an easy target for child sex abuse. The airport, which opens in 2016, will end centuries of isolation for the island, which is a five-day boat ride from Cape Town. She said: ‘We are sending out the message that sex tourists are not welcome on St Helena. ‘We don’t want to give the impression that here is another Thailand, that there is a culture of acceptance for abuse.’ She added: ‘We had a problem and we are dealing with it. We are playing catch-up.’ The island is mostly funded by British taxpayers . More than 90 per cent of public expenditure on St Helena is funded by British taxpayers. One of the most remote islands in the world, the island has few natural resources and no sustainable economy. As a result, thousands of St Helenians live and work in the UK, South Africa or the Falklands. The 3,800 inhabitants left on the island receive almost £20million a year to ensure the ‘reasonable needs’ of the population are met. The South Atlantic island, 1,200 miles from the African coast, was uninhabited until it was discovered by the Portuguese in 1502, and for centuries was only used as a stopover for ships, due to its extreme isolation. Britain colonised the island in 1659 and brought slaves from South Asia and Africa. It remains British-owned. Survival on the volcanic island has always been a struggle for its settlers and it now suffers from a steadily declining population as more people leave to find work. At the end of 2012, the population was 3,800, down from 4,200 in 2008. In 2011, Andrew Mitchell, the then-Secretary of State for International Development, said building an airport on the island was crucial to ‘end five centuries of isolation for this UK overseas territory’ and help it to achieve ‘financial self-sustainability and an end to UK budgetary aid’. He said: ‘Continued sea access as the only way to get to and from St Helena would consign the island to a bleak future of further emigration and economic decline.’ French emperor Napolean was famously exiled there in 1815 by the British and died in a prison on the island.","Charity found puberty was regarded as a 'marker' for 'girls' availability'

"By . Jason Groves . and Louise Eccles . David Cameron was last night urged to stand up to the ‘militant atheists’ who want to deny Britain’s Christian heritage. Leaders of many faiths backed the Prime Minister’s decision to talk openly about his beliefs after it was criticised in a letter by non-believers. MPs also said he must not allow himself to be shouted down by ‘aggressive’ atheists who want faith to be cut out of politics and national life. David Cameron faced criticism after calling Britain a Christian country but faith leaders and his own MPs have rallied around him in support . The Prime Minister came under fire after a group of celebrity atheists said he was wrong to declare Britain a ‘Christian country’. Their open letter said Britain is not a ‘Christian country’ and argued that most members of the public ‘do not want religions or religious identities to be actively prioritised by their elected government’. The letter, signed by more than 50 celebrities, scientists and academics, including the authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett and TV presenter Nick Ross, also accused the PM of sowing ‘alienation and division’ and fuelling ‘sectarian divides’. But the claims were rubbished by MPs along with British faith leaders from the Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities yesterday. Senior Tory Gary Streeter, chairman of the cross-party group Christians in Parliament, urged the PM to face down his atheist critics. He said: ‘These people say it is offensive to say Britain is a Christian country, but offensive to who? Other religious groups welcome the fact we are talking about faith.’ Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said that to claim Britain was not a Christian country was to ‘ignore historical and constitutional reality’. Here are some of the 55 public figures who signed a letter accusing David Cameron of fostering ‘alienation’ by emphasising Christianity . PHILIP PULLMANThe author, pictured, received hate mail for his book, The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ but said he was ‘trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief’. NICK ROSSThe former Crimewatch presenter is said to believe that religion has ‘enslaved and crushed as many as it has enlightened’. SIR TERRY PRATCHETTNow suffering from Alzheimer’s, the author supports legalising assisted death, but his documentary on the subject was criticised by religious leaders as ‘propaganda’. JIM AL-KHALILIThe letter’s lead signatory, the Iraqi born physicist and author is current president of the British Humanist Association. A.C. GRAYLING Philosopher, atheist and author of The Good Book - which has been described as ‘a secular bible’. STEVE JONESA geneticist, former head of the Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment at University College London and member of British Humanist Association. DAN SNOWThe television historian was married by The Bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, in 2012 – but said he was allowed to ‘take God out of my vows’. He said: ‘Where do David Cameron’s critics think our constitution, ethics and establishment come from?’ He added that as a Christian country, Britain had ‘ensured the freedom of all religious and non-religious voices to be heard’ whereas a secularist establishment would ‘inhibit’ them. He compared Britain to France, where ‘secularism in practice’ has seen the ‘illiberal banning of some forms of religious dress and the suppression of religious voices in public debate’. Farooq Murad, of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, said: ‘No one can deny that Britain remains largely a Christian country, with deep historical and structural links with the established Church. The 2011 census indicates that more than 60 per cent of the English self-identify as Christian. We respect that.’ Lord Indarjit Singh, of the Network of Sikh Organisations, said: ‘Christianity is the religion of the majority. It is not the greatest sin to say this. What is of greater concern is the letter in response, which says we are not a religious country.’ Anil Bhanot, of the Hindu Council UK, said he was ‘grateful’ for Christianity’s inclusive attitude towards other religions and pointed out that many British Hindus even celebrated Christian holidays. ‘I attend the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey each year,’ he added. ‘I gave my nieces and family Easter eggs on Saturday. Many Hindus celebrate Christmas, although they do not go to church, because they are living in Britain. As long as religion is not imposed there is no problem.’ In 2008, Mr Cameron likened his faith to the reception of radio station Magic FM in the Chilterns, saying it ‘comes and goes’. But earlier this week, he said that he believed Britain should be more ‘evangelical’ about Christianity and ‘more confident about our status as a Christian country’. In an article for the Church Times, he argued that some atheists and agnostics did not understand that faith could be a ‘guide or a helpful prod’  towards morality. It was this intervention that prompted yesterday’s letter – signed by 55 atheist public figures – denouncing his language and accusing him of ‘fostering alienation and division’. Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell went further by suggesting that Mr Cameron was faking the extent of his religious belief in a cynical ‘tactic’ to distract attention away from the resignation of Culture Secretary Maria Miller. Mr Campbell – who famously barred journalists from asking Mr Blair about his faith – said: ‘Like so much of what he does it feels like a tactic in search of a strategy.’ But Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Cameron was ‘brave’ to take on the atheists. ‘The extreme secularists are an aggressive and unpleasant lobby and they have a degree of self-righteousness that the Pharisees would be proud of,’ he said. ‘They are not representative. People have in their hearts a fundamental belief in God in surprisingly large numbers.’ Downing Street said Mr Cameron had made clear as far back as 2011 that he believed the UK was a Christian country ‘and should not be afraid to say so’. ‘He also added that this was not to say in any way that to have another faith – or no faith – was somehow wrong,’ a spokesman said.","Celebrity atheists wrote open letter criticising David Cameron for calling Britain a Christian country .

"By . Mark Prigg . Antarctic sea ice may not be expanding as rapidly previously thought - with much of the increase potentially down to a data error, scientists have said. While Arctic sea ice has been melting significantly in recent years, satellite observations suggest sea ice cover in the southern hemisphere has been increasing and has reached record highs in the past few years. The increase in Antarctic sea ice despite rising global temperatures has puzzled scientists and been highlighted by climate change sceptics as evidence of flaws in the theory of man-made global warming. Antarctic sea ice may not be expanding as rapidly previously thought - with much of the increase potentially down to a data error, scientists have said. A 2007 international assessment of climate science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) found that Antarctic sea ice cover remained constant between 1979 and 2005. But more recent research and the latest assessment by the IPCC, published in the last year, suggests that southern hemisphere sea ice extent increased at a rate of about 16,500 square kilometres (6,370 square miles) a year between 1979 and 2012. The difference has been attributed to adding more years to the data. However, now researchers say there is a 'significant' error in one of the reports. The hole in the ozone layer, increases in freshwater from melting glaciers, winds and natural variability are among the theories put forward for the growth in Antarctic sea ice, which appears to be increasing at a third of the rate the Arctic’s sea ice is retreating. But now research published in the European Geosciences Union journal The Cryosphere suggests that much of the measured expansion could be down to a previously undocumented error in the way satellite data was processed. A 2007 international assessment of climate science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) found that Antarctic sea ice cover remained constant between 1979 and 2005. But more recent research and the latest assessment by the IPCC, published in the last year, suggests that southern hemisphere sea ice extent increased at a rate of about 16,500 square kilometres (6,370 square miles) a year between 1979 and 2012. The difference has been attributed to adding more years to the data. But lead author of the new paper, Ian Eisenman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, US, said: 'When we looked at how the numbers reported for the trend had changed, and we looked at the time series of Antarctic sea ice extent, it didn’t look right.' He added: 'Our findings show that the data used in one of the reports contains a significant error. 'But we have not yet been able to identify which one contains the error.' The data for sea ice cover is sourced from observations by a number of different instruments on a number of satellites, with scientists using a mathematical formulae and further processing to calculate what the extent of the sea ice is from the readings. The researchers compared two datasets, calculated with different versions of the formula, which were used in the two IPCC assessments. Antarctic ice maps for September 2009 until September 2012 reveal an increase in the level of sea ice . The study shows a difference between the the datasets, relating to a change in satellite sensors in December 1991 and the way the data from the two instruments was calibrated. Prof Eisenman said: 'It appears that one of the records did this calibration incorrectly, introducing a step-like change in December 1991 that was big enough to have a large influence on the long-term trend.' He said it is not readily apparent which record contains the step change. But by comparing the datasets and calculating Antarctic sea ice extent for each of them, the researchers discovered that the newer assessment gave larger rates of sea ice expansion than the old one in any given period. They found the large increase in the reported rate of Antarctic sea ice expansion since the IPCC assessment in 2007 was down to the effect of a change in the way the observations were processed, rather than due to adding more years of data. But the researchers said they could not tell if the change corrected a problem or introduced one. If it introduced a problem, the rate of Antarctic sea ice expansion could have been overestimated - potentially solving the puzzle of why Antarctic sea ice has been recorded as increasing to such an extent despite rising global temperatures.","Increase in Antarctic sea ice despite rising global temperatures puzzled scientists .

"By . Louise Eccles . Andy Murray’s mother has told of her feelings of ‘survivor’s guilt’ over the Dunblane massacre as her two sons escaped unhurt. Judy Murray was speaking at length for the first time about the 1996  tragedy when 16 children and a teacher were killed at the school attended by Andy, then eight, and his brother Jamie, then ten.In her moving account, Mrs Murray told how at first she did not believe it when news filtered through of a shooting at Dunblane Primary School, Perthshire. ‘My mother had a toy shop in the town, . which I ran with her,’ she said. ‘I was working with a girl in the shop . and her daughter phoned because she’d heard something on the radio. Scroll down for video . Judy Murray, centre did not initially believe there had been a massacre at Dunblane Primary school where her sons Andy, left, and Jamie, right were pupils . Andy Murray, left, with his mother Judy at the winner's ball following his triumph at Wimbledon . ‘My colleague turned to me and said, “There’s been a shooting at the primary school”. I replied, “Don’t be silly”. Then my mum ran in saying, “There’s been a shooting at the school. You need to go”. ‘I picked up my car keys – didn’t take my bag or jacket or anything – and just ran out.’ As she drove to the school, she recalled: ‘There were too many cars on the road – everyone was trying to get there. ‘I got angry, shouting “Get out of the way!” About a quarter of a mile away, I just got out and ran.’ When tennis coach Mrs Murray, 54, whose sons have both won Wimbledon titles, arrived, ambulances and police cars were parked outside but the school gates were locked. Judy Murray spoke to the Radio Times for the first time about her relief that her sons had escaped injury during the Dunblane massacre . Parents were moved to a classroom, where they ‘waited for absolutely hours before we knew what had happened or which class it was’. Speaking to Radio Times, Mrs Murray continued: ‘There were 50 or 60 of us – so many that I was sharing a chair with a girl I had gone to school with, who lived opposite me when we were growing up. ‘A policeman came in and said that the parents of children from Mrs Mayor’s class were to leave with him. The girl sharing my chair said, “That’s my daughter’s class”. ‘I don’t know if I have survivor’s guilt, but I had an awful moment then when I was so relieved it wasn’t my kids. And then feeling terrible. She lost her daughter.’ Mrs Murray said Jamie was in a prefab building and believed the gunfire was someone hammering on the roof. Andy’s class heard the shootings while on their way to the gym, the scene of the horror when local man Thomas Hamilton stormed in armed with four handguns and 700 rounds of ammunition. ‘That’s how close he was to what happened,’ she said. ‘They heard the noise and someone went ahead to investigate. They came back and told all the kids to go to the headmaster’s study and the deputy head’s study. ‘They were told to sit down below the windows and they were singing songs. ‘The teachers and dinner ladies did an amazing job,  containing all these children, feeding them and getting them out without them being aware of what had happened.’ Mrs Murray said that Wimbledon champion Andy had heard the gunfire because his class was on its way to the gym, pictured, when Hamilton began shooting . Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 children during his 1996 rampage before he killed himself . On the drive home, she ‘knew I had to stop the car to tell Jamie and Andy what had happened’ but was grateful they were ‘too young to understand the enormity of it’. She later realised she knew Hamilton and had given him lifts from the station to the boys’ club which he ran. ‘He was a bit of an odd bod, but I wouldn’t have thought he was dangerous,’ she said. ‘It was impossible to believe something like that could  happen in your little town. Sometimes it still is.’ Mrs Murray, who is divorced from her children’s father  Willie, said she still becomes emotional when she revisits the town to talk about ‘everything that Andy and Jamie have achieved’. She added: ‘What it definitely does is make you appreciate what you’ve got.’ Speaking about 27-year-old Andy’s historic Wimbledon singles victory last year, she said: ‘His win was so important to people.’ He starts the defence of his title on Monday. Jamie won the mixed doubles in 2007.

"By . Louise Eccles . Lady Justice Black, pictured, described the case as 'very sad' while sitting in the court of appeal . Twin five-year-old girls who effectively have three mothers are at the centre of a fierce custody battle between the two lesbians who brought them into the world. The children live with their birth mother but were conceived from eggs donated by her ex-partner – and later adopted by her current partner. Under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, the egg donor has no legal status as a parent. But she is fighting for a shared residence order which would allow her part-time custody of the girls – and would recognise her as a third legal guardian. The court battle prompted warnings over informal sperm and egg donor agreements and concern over the effect on the children. Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said: ‘This is a disturbing harbinger of things to come. These kinds of cases will continue to rise as the number of people seeking egg and sperm donation increases. In this situation, the mothers appear to have deliberately created a situation where the parentage of the children is malleable. The twins now have a birth mother, an adoptive mother, a biological mother and an anonymous father, who they can have no contact with until they are 18. It is hugely confusing for  the children. ‘Too many of these kinds of egg and sperm donor arrangements are done informally, with no concrete decisions made about what role the different parents will play.’ A court heard the birth mother and genetic mother had an ‘intimate relationship’ after meeting in the 1990s and continued to live together after their relationship became platonic. When one of them struggled to conceive, the other agreed to donate her eggs, which were fertilised using an anonymous sperm donor in 2007. But when relations soured in 2012 and the genetic mother moved out, she found she was not recognised as the twins’ legal parent. The girls continued to live with the birth mother and she later entered a civil partnership with another woman, who was subsequently made a legal parent of the twins by the courts. In the first hearing in the custody case, at Portsmouth County Court last August, Judge Helen Black ruled in favour of the birth mother, saying the egg donor was ‘not a parent of the children and that her status should not be elevated in that way’. She raised concerns about how the egg donor ‘would operate her parental responsibility if given it’. But she challenged the decision in the Court of Appeal, insisting she had a right to look after the twins. She argued she had raised the girls for the first few years of  their lives when she was still living with the birth mother, who had returned to work. In March, three judges upheld the appeal, claiming the initial judgment had been built on ‘wobbly’ foundations and the full evidence had not been heard. The three-judge Court of Appeal has sent the case back to Portsmouth County Court for a fresh hearing . The case will now be sent back to the county court for a fresh hearing. Lady Justice [Jill] Black, sitting at the Court of Appeal, said: ‘Childhood is over all too quickly and, whilst I appreciate that both sides think they are motivated only by concern for the children, it is still very sad to see it being allowed to slip away whilst energy is devoted to adult wrangles and to litigation.’ To further complicate the case, the genetic mother used some of the embryos that were created to conceive the twins to impregnate herself. It means her toddler daughter is a full sibling to the twins. Mrs Taylor said that donors should be aware that they have no automatic parental rights over the child, adding: ‘More and more cases like this are coming through the courts. ‘The focus seems to be what rights the parents have rather than the children’s rights to their biological heritage.’ The number of single women opting to use IVF has more than doubled in five years, from 259 to 632 in 2012. Use of donor sperm has also become popular, with 468 women choosing that route to motherhood in 2012, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. But family solicitor Marcus Malin said people were often not aware of the complex legal issues surrounding surrogacy and egg and sperm donation. ‘People must go into these kinds of agreements with their eyes wide open,’ he said. ‘If someone agrees to donate their eggs or sperm when they are not in a relationship, then it becomes an arrangement, and I think some people go into these arrangements too lightly. ‘While everybody enters into these agreements with the best intentions, many don’t fully consider how the childcare will work in practice.’ Mr Malin said sperm donors must be aware that as the biological father they could be liable for  child maintenance.","Lesbian couple engaged in 'informal' sperm and egg donor arrangement .

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Louise Eccles . and Jason Groves . Tories accused church leaders of playing politics last night for using their Easter messages to attack the Government over poverty and ‘sinful’ cuts. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury highlighted the plight of struggling families ‘left broken and weeping’ by hunger and debt. He told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral: ‘In this country, even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families, in people ashamed to seek help from food banks, or frightened by debt.’ The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in his sermon: 'Even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families' And the Bishop of Truro the Right Reverend Tim Thornton spoke of the ‘sinful consequences’ of the squeeze on local authority budgets. The bishop, who sits on a committee looking at food banks, told Radio 5 Live: ‘Politicians have to decide how to allocate resources. And in allocating some resources, you are then inevitably taking away from other people. Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes said last night: 'Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance' ‘I am not saying it’s a sin. I am saying that some of these policies lead to effects and consequences which have sinful elements in them.’ The bishops’ comments come amid growing unease over the use of political messages by figures in the Church of England. Last week saw a letter signed by 600 church leaders, including 36 Anglican bishops, calling on the Government to tackle what it called a ‘national crisis’ of hunger and poverty. The letter cited the rise of food banks as evidence that ‘unfair and harsh benefits sanctions’ were causing people to go hungry. But the claims contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing food poverty in Britain has reduced. Many argue there will always be an almost unlimited demand for food that is given away for free and that it does not necessarily mean people are going hungry. Last night Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes, chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said: ‘I don’t remember church leaders in years gone by talking about the huge debt mountain this Government inherited, or talking positively about the number of people now back in work. ‘Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance. David Cameron’s statement that Britain is a Christian country risks dividing society, a group of leading public figures has warned. More than 50 writers, scientists, broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the ‘negative consequences’ of his assertion. Signatories include authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett, broadcasters Dan Snow and Nick Ross, philosopher AC Grayling, and human rights activist Peter Tatchell. Last week the Prime Minister wrote in the Church Times of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with Christian ideals and values. But the letter says: ‘Repeated surveys, polls, and studies show most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities...  To constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society.’ 'It cheapens the message of Easter if you engage in party politics.’ Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, said: ‘You can’t criticise debt from the pulpit and then have a go at a Government that is trying to do something about it.’ Archbishop Welby left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after it emerged yesterday that the Church of England still has financial interests in Wonga. The Archbishop lambasted the payday loan company last year, only for it to be revealed that the church’s pension fund had invested money in one of the high-interest lender’s financial backers. Church Commissioners continue to hold shares in the firm worth around £90,000. But in a newspaper interview on Saturday Archbishop Welby dismissed the issue, saying he had not acted because he had ‘a million other things to do’ and was not an ‘investment manager’.","Archbishop of Canterbury highlighted the plight of struggling families .

Mail photographer Mark Richards spotted the 6ft tall flightless bird running through fields in Hertfordshire and tracked the six-year-old female for more than an hour. He said: ‘I was able to follow it for quite a while but, much like the Road Runner, it was too fast for me.’ The giant Rhea ran amok for more than an hour running through Barkway Park Golf Club in Nuthampstead . Robert Hardman of the Daily Mail spent the morning trying to track down the bird . The giant bird sped-off at more than 40mph to escape into a field . The Giant Rhea  can move at 45mph and is said to be capable of disembowelling a human with its six-inch claws. The RSPCA has warned against approaching it.

"By . Dan Bloom . Three people have now died in a powerful storm which is sweeping through Japan, forcing rivers to burst their banks and triggering a landslide which killed a 12-year-old boy. Half a million people were told to evacuate on Monday under the threat of Typhoon Neoguri, which had winds of up to 155mph and waves almost 50ft high. First feared to be a 'super typhoon', Neoguri was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it made landfall but has left a trail of devastation in its wake. Scroll down for video .

Salvage: Seen through the sleepers of a stricken railway line, workers inspect the damage after the mudslide . Horror: The storm has now killed three people, including a pensioner who fell into a swollen river . In Nagiso, central Japan, a landslide sent mud and rock tumbling . down a mountainside last night, killing a 12-year-old boy - the third victim of the storm. The torrent of rock destroyed bridges, railway lines and cars and left water pouring freely down the mountainside. One victim of the landslide said: 'At . first I thought it was an earthquake, then the house started filling . with mud. 'I clung to . a pillar with all my strength.' Another of the three people killed was an 83-year-old man who fell into a swollen river and died. At least another 50 people have been injured, many of them from falls. Heavy rains and gusts inland of 78mph yesterday prompted hundreds more flights and trains to be cancelled and left schools closed. The storm - whose name means 'raccoon dog' in Korean - also threatened flooding in remote regions of Japan which has halted its heavy industries.

The storm is due to sweep north east up Japan's eastern coast today, battering Tokyo and Osaka and touching on the Fukushima region. Torrential rainfall could trigger . more high tides, landslides and floods, and much of eastern Japan was at risk of . lightning and tornadoes. On . the island of Okinawa, more than 105,000 homes lost power at the storm's peak and 32 people were injured, two of them seriously.

And former Armani model Slavica Ecclestone, became one of the richest women in Britain following her divorce from Bernie Ecclestone. Her wealth is said to be £740million  making her the 136th richest individual in the country. Asked why there were not more self-made female millionaires in Britain, Kate Grussing, the boss of executive recruitment firm Sapphire Partners, said: ‘Women are not less able – they may be less pushy and demanding.’ Kirsty Bertarelli, 42, is the richest woman in Britain, worth £9.75billion with her husband Ernesto, a Swiss businessman. The Staffordshire-born former Miss World contestant said: ‘I am a girl from the North who has been incredibly lucky in life.’ Meanwhile, The . Queen’s wealth rose by £10million to £330million as the value of . personal property such as Sandringham and Balmoral rose, although her . ranking fell from 268th to 285th. The Queen has seen her wealth increase by an estimated £10 million with a value of £330 million . Emma Watson has amassed a fortune of £30 million . Actress Emma Watson's wealth has soared to £30 million, making her Britain's 20th richest person under-30. Miss Watson, 24, who appeared in Noah with Russel Crowe and is about to leave Brown University made £3 million last year. There were 114 women on the Sunday Times Rich List this year - down from 118 last year. But the figure is up nearly 50 per cent over the last decade from 78 in 2004. Below is a list of the five richest women in Britain: . 1. Kirsty Bertarelli is worth £9.75billion with her husband Ernesto, a Swiss businessman involved in pharmaceuticals. The pair are fifth over all on the list. Kirsty Bertarelli, Britain's richest woman, performing at Edinburgh Castle in 2010 . 2.

The combined total of the nation's mega-rich has risen 15 per cent from the previous high of £449billion last year, and is a huge leap from £258billion in 2009. At £255billion, the joint fortune of . the 64 richest is equal to the total wealth of the poorest 19million . people in Britain, or 30 per cent of the population. The Duke of Westminster, pictured, has seen his wealth increase by £700 million to £8.5 billion . Britain . also has 104 billionaires – more than ever – compared with 30 a decade . ago, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. The amount of money needed to join the ranks of Britain’s 1,000 richest is £85million, up from £80million in 2008 during the pre-crash boom.

The UK now . has more billionaires per capita than any other country, with one for . every 607,692 people, compared with one in every 1,022,475 in the US. London alone has 72 billionaires, way ahead of Moscow’s 48 and New . York’s 43. Forty . per cent of Britain’s billionaires were born outside the UK, while many . pay little or no income tax because their main homes are abroad. Philip Beresford, who has compiled the list since 1989, said: ‘I’ve never seen such a phenomenal rise in personal wealth.’ The . figures show that the worst financial crisis since the Great . Depression, which started six years ago when US bank Lehman Brothers . collapsed, has been kind to Britain’s ultra-wealthy. Critics say their increasing fortunes prove the gap between the rich and poor is widening as wages fall in real terms. But . Mr Beresford said: ‘The richest have had an astonishing year, and while . some may criticise them, many of these people are at the heart of the . economy and their success brings more jobs and more wealth for the . country.’ So-called old money was largely unaffected by the economic crisis, and in many cases fared extremely well. The . sixth Duke of Westminster, who owns 300 acres of Mayfair and Belgravia . and much of Oxford Street in Central London, saw his wealth climb by . £700million last year to £8.5billion and is tenth on the rich list.

"By . Mark Prigg . Astronauts on the moon and Mars could soon have fresh food to eat, thanks to a radical new 'space greenhouse'. German researchers are testing the system, which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer. They hope to build a complete greenhouse in Antactica to test the first space garden in 2016. Engineer Daniel Schubert holds lettuce at the German Aerospace Center on July 21, 2014 in Bremen, Germany: Researchers hope their system could allow astronauts on the moon and Mars to grow their own food. The system could eventually be used to create a greenhouse on the lunar surface . The greenhouses will contain combined life-support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer, helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and Mars environment. It also uses specially developed purple LED lighting to boost growth rates. The system is being developed at the German Aerospace Center in Bremen, and is called EDEN (Evolution & Design of Environmentally-closed Nutrition sources). Funded by the European space Agency, the greenhouses will contain combined life-support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer, helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and Mars environment. The first greenhouse will be tested for nine months in 2016/17 in an inhospitable environment in the Antarctic. This research initiative focuses on bioregenerative life support systems, especially greenhouse modules and technologies for future human habitats in remote locations in space (the Moon, Mars) and on Earth (Antarctica), the team say. 'One of our projects is to test a greenhouse module at the Neumayer Station III in Antarctica, where the winter team stays in total isolation for nine months in a row in a hostile environment,'  said DLR research engineer Lucie Poulet. Engineer Daniel Schubert measures the size of a cucumber at the German Aerospace Center, where Scientists and engineers from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are developing greenhouses for a potential Mars colony. The first greenhouse will be tested for nine months in 2016/17 in an inhospitable environment in the Antarctic. 'We want to find ways to meet the group’s needs when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables but it will also enable us to study the psychological influence of plants on human isolation.' 'Ultimately this analog test site will enable to generate good research data for future human space exploration and in extension human settlement in the solar system.

'Naturally, space travel is interesting in itself, but it is equally important for us to be involved in this project in order to demonstrate that our technology is the light system of choice for plant science research,' said Christopher Steele of Heliospectra, which manufactures the LED lights in the system. 'We want to be a part of developing the plant growing opportunities of the future, whether it is here on earth or in space.","German system uses recycled urine to manufacture fertilizer .

"By . Lydia Warren . A high-priced prostitute accused of leaving a Google exec to die on his yacht in California after giving him a fatal dose of heroin has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and heroin charges. Alix Tichelman, 26, entered the plea on Wednesday in a Santa Cruz County courtroom, where a judge refused to reduce her $1.5 million bail. Prosecutors also charged her with great bodily injury. After the hearing, her defense attorney Larry Biggam insisted she had no reason to kill 51-year-old married father-of-five Forrest Hayes last November because he was paying her so much money. Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. Scroll down for video . Denial: Alix Tichelman, pictured in court during her arraignment on Wednesday, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter in the death of one of her clients. She is accused of giving him a fatal dose of heroin . In court: Her attorney said she had every reason to keep him alive because he was paying her so much . That day, . they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft . Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, . police said. Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said. Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside. Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported. 'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday. 'Callous': Tichelman, 26, left, allegedly did nothing . as her wealthy client Forrest Hayes, right, suffered complications from . a heroin overdose and died. Instead of calling 911, she gathered her . belongings and left . Scene: She allegedly took the heroin to his yacht, pictured, and administered the drug but as he lay dying, she stepped over his body to finish a glass of wine before leaving the boat . Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. They also identified her from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said. They . then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her . parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client . who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a . luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested. Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state. Former flame Dean Riopelle, also 51, reportedly died under similar circumstances only months prior. The investigation into Riopelle's death - from an overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol - has been reopened, police told WSB. 'It's . still conjecture looking at the similarities of the two situations, but . obviously we're going to go back and look at it and make sure that . everything determined to be correct, almost a year ago, is still factual . and still accurate,' said Capt. Shawn McCarty with the Milton Police Department. Second victim? Dean Riopelle, 53, died of a heroin overdose in September 2013 in Georgia about two months before Hayes passed away. Riopelle had also been seeing Tichelman at the time of his death . Tichelman claimed at the time that Riopelle had been drinking and shooting heroin all day, police said. The . call girl was also arrested for biting Riopelle, McCarty recalled to . the station. She was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and . falsely reporting a crime but it is not clear if she was charged. Riopelle, once the lead singer for the Impotent Sea Snakes, lived in fear or Tichelman, according to at least one friend. 'At . first he was really happy. But toward the end, he had a lot of fears of . her. He even tried to stop her from going to his own club,' Michael Lacy told the San Francisco Chronicle. Hayes, . who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to . wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his . obituary. Tichelman's . Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before . majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty . school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist. On social . media, she posed in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and . posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months . ago. Working girl: Tichelman was a high-price prostitute and met her clients, including Hayes, online . Speaking to fiXE fETISH, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an ""intense child"" and already liked horror movies.' She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'. 'Really . nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in . cold blood...and they love it too,' she wrote in a June 28 post. 'No judgement, Yay! F*** all of that positivity bulls***. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die,' she added. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.","Alix Tichelman's attorney said she had every reason to keep Forresst Hayes, 51, alive because he was paying her so much .

"By . Candace Trunzo . Julia Roberts’ family have accused her sister’s fiance of refusing to hand over her personal items as the legal war between them over control of Nancy Motes’ estate turns increasingly hostile. Relatives of the August: Osage County star say that John Dilbeck has not given up Nancy Motes' furniture and a painting she made before she died - as the two sides wrestle for control. According to legal documents the work is a painting of Galena, Illinois which is of ‘great sentimental value’ to her mother Betty Motes. Fighting for control: Relatives of Julia Roberts say John Dilbeck (left) has not given up Nancy Motes' (RIGHT) furniture and a painting she made before she died - as the two sides wrestle for control in the wake of Motes' suicide . Angry mother: In harsh language Betty Motes (at right with daughter Julia Roberts) accuses John of being ¿self-serving¿ and accuses him of ¿profiteering¿ over Nancy¿s death by selling his story to tabloid newspapers . In harsh language Betty accuses John of being ‘self-serving’ and accuses him of ‘profiteering’ over Nancy’s death by selling his story to tabloid newspapers. She also alleges that he has has been trying to ‘harass’ Roberts and her family in court papers that lay bare the extent of the rancor. Betty and Roberts have been at war with John since Nancy took an overdose on February 9 which killed her at the age of 37. The former production assistant on the TV show Glee drowned in a bath surrounded by a mixture of nonprescription and prescription pills, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner. The row now boils down to Nancy’s 13-page, three part suicide note, one part to John, one to her mother and Julia and a third to ‘everyone.’ John claims that he should be the administrator as the only part where Nancy talks about allocating her belongings is addressed to him. But Betty claims that it is invalid because Nancy did not sign any of the sheets of handwritten paper, making it invalid under Californian law. A close examination of five months of court documents filed at the Los Angeles Supreme Court, reveals the full timeline of the angry confrontation. On February 13 - just four days after Nancy’s death -  Judge Daniel Murphy passed an order making Betty Motes the special administrator of Nancy’s estate. He ruled that she could take possession of all her belongings and ‘valuable personal property’ such as financial information to prevent them from ‘damage, waste or injury’. John was forced to hand over Nancy’s 2006 Honda Accord as well as 30 boxes of her items including jewelry and other personal effects, along with credit cards that Nancy had at the time of her death. In a filing Betty’s lawyer Robert Eroen said that John’s attempts to take control over the estate are ‘meritless and meant solely to harass (Nancy) and (her) family’. From the suicide note: Betty¿s lawyer said that John¿s attempts to take control over the estate are ¿meritless and meant solely to harass (Nancy) and (her) family¿. On March 19 John however hit back with his own petition and claimed that the note that said Nancy¿s suicide note to him showed he should be the administrator. Family mystery: Among the items which John is accused of withholding is the painting, which Betty has supposedly paid him for, and several other items of furniture. It is not clear why Nancy painted a painting of Galena - her family are originally from Georgia . On March 19 John however hit back with his own petition and claimed that the note that said Nancy’s suicide note to him showed he should be the administrator. It alleged that represented a ‘single expression of (her) final wishes for the disposition of her estate and contains the final words she desired to share with various people that were part of her life’. On April 2 Eroen filed a response demanding the John come before the court to see if he had ‘wrongfully taken, concealed or disposed of property’ that was part of Nancy’s estate. It also called for John to be hit with a ‘citation’ for his alleged wrongdoing. Among the items which John is accused of withholding is the painting, which Betty has supposedly paid him for, and several other items of furniture. Deep depression: MailOnline has already revealed how Nancy claimed in her suicide note that Roberts was so vindictive that she ¿drove me into the deepest depression I¿ve ever been in¿. She described her famous sister as a ¿so-called sibling¿ who should get nothing if she died except the memory that she pushed her over the edge. It is not clear why Nancy painted a painting of Galena - her family are originally from Georgia. In her filing Betty says that John’s claims on the estate are based on ‘fiction entirely made out of whole cloth’. She says it is an ‘attempt to make money off Nancy’s death that started when he took money from tabloids shortly after her death'. 'The court should not be a party to such profiteering,' she adds. Finally, a May 30 filing on behalf of Betty attacks John’s ‘self-serving characterization’ of the notes as false. The last motions deal with John having to appear before the court last month to explain himself, which he did, his lawyer confirmed. MailOnline has already revealed how Nancy claimed in her suicide note that Roberts was so vindictive that she ‘drove me into the deepest depression I’ve ever been in’. She described her famous sister as a ‘so-called sibling’ who should get nothing if she died except the memory that she pushed her over the edge. Nancy also said that Roberts’s abuse had been so bad that ‘I burst into tears because I wake up’. In a further twist the legal documents reveal that Michael Motes, Nancy’s estranged father, has been tracked down by heir chasing firm Trust and Estate Search. He has agreed to give them 15 per cent of anything that he gets from Nancy’s estate in exchange for alerting him to his potential windfall, the documents state. Class act: At a memorial for Nancy last May, Julia looked grief-stricken. But Nancy claimed in tweets before she died that Julia treated her badly. In one she said: 'Just so you all know, America¿s Sweetheart is a b*****' Bequest: Nancy note said she wanted her jewelry and clothese to go to her closest friends - not her sister and mother . The latest hearing in the case took place on Monday at the Los Angeles Superior Court. Eroen informed the court examination that John had been questioned by a judge about what other property he had in his possession. He also requested that the court maintain the order that the Coroner's report into Nancy’s death would be kept confidential and could only be reviewed by court order. The court agreed and no new hearing dates were set. Downhill: Julia puts a protective arm around Nancy in this 2002 photo but the sisters had a parting of the ways . Sad goodbye: Nancy's totured last words are a loving tribute to her fiance . Afterwards Eroen told MailOnline: ‘The estate still needs to be administered and presently we are in a holding pattern.’ John’s lawyer Morris Bird told MaillOnline: ‘Nancy Motes estate is being administered by Beth Motes so by law my client, Mr Dilbeck,  has to deliver any and all property of Nancy Motes  to her mother Betty.’ Neither John, Betty or Roberts were present.","Nancy Motes' mother Betty accuses the dead woman's fiance John Dilbeck of being 'self-serving' and a 'profiteer'

"By . Dan Bloom . A Staffordshire bull terrier stolen more than five years ago has turned up 500 miles away in Scotland. Ellie disappeared in 2009 after her owner tied her up for two minutes outside a newsagent in Bere Regis, Dorset - and despite a lengthy search she was not seen again. That was until last week, when the microchipped pet was finally reunited with her shocked 36-year-old owner Sharon Collins after being found wandering the streets of Kirkcaldy, Fife. Scroll down for video . Gonna be there next to you: Ellie the staffie may have walked 500 miles after turning up in Scotland five years after she was stolen from owner Sharon Collins (left) - or she may have been driven there and escaped . A dognapper is thought to have unclipped Ellie’s lead in January 2009, sparking a search which included the missing pet directory Dog Lost. To Ms Collins' shock, a volunteer from the directory knocked on her door last week after the black staffie was taken in to Langdyke Boarding Kennels in Fife. Staff who tried to contact the pub worker discovered her mobile number had expired - but fortunately the volunteer lived just round the corner from her Dorset home. Ms Collins said: 'It was like losing a child. 'You never lose hope completely, but I just wanted to know that she was okay and being looked after.

Sylvia Pass, the kennels owner who made the drive to Peterborough, said: 'Ellie was in excellent condition with excellent muscle tone and teeth. 'There is no way of knowing where she has been for five years but she could have been taken to Scotland from Dorset and been kept as a pet for five years before escaping. 'When we scanned her microchip the number for Sharon was wrong so we went through the Dog Lost records and found a mention of Ellie, and Sharon’s old address was listed.

"By . Dan Bloom . These are the suits by a boutique clothes label which a crime boss has allegedly used to hide his ill-gotten gains - including the blue satin number he wore to court. N1 Angel claims to be an outfitter to famous figures including Brazilian footballers Tiago Silva and Neymar Jr. But its £400 designs have been drawn into a High Court battle by crime boss Terry Adams, 58, after prosecutors said the firm - run by his wife - was a front to hide his past earnings. Accused: N1 Angel - which designed the blue satin suit worn by crime boss Terry Adams in his battle at the High Court (pictured) - has been described as not being a 'legitimate business' by prosecutors . Adams is the head designer for N1 Angel, which shot to prominence after he appeared at the High Court this week wearing one of its bolder designs. The blue suit had first appeared on the company's Twitter feed last month, billed as 'coming soon', and press photographs of Adams wearing it outside his court appearance were proudly reproduced by the firm online yesterday. Adams is fighting at the High Court to write off £628,000 which he still owes to the state seven years after he was convicted of conspiring to conceal criminal proceeds. He says he is broke and his enterprises make little money - but prosecutors insist Adams does have the cash, pointing to his and his wife's life of luxury. His wife Ruth's spending included £12,000 on dental . treatment, £3,850 on spa membership . for her husband and nearly £15,000 on restaurants and . holidays including 20 meals at Brown's in Mayfair, prosecutors said. Signature look: The firm's suits (pictured) are by Adams himself, who is said to have designed a suit at 14 . The firm's suits sell mostly for £400, but it is also selling a limited edition leather overcoat for £3,000 . Proud: The firm's website and Twitter feed do not shy away from revealing the identity of its designer . And the prosecutors focused on N1 Angel, the clothing firm owned by Mrs Adams and registered at a flat the couple share in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Its website and Twitter feed do not shy away from revealing the identity of its designer. 'Our . name is an affectionate homage to Angel, Islington (N1, London) – the . area that head designer, Terrence (Terry) Adams, was born and raised,' the website says. 'It was in Angel . that Terrence designed his first bespoke suit at the age of just 14, and . it was in Angel that Terrence came to understand the “transformative . power of style”. 'Our . collections are peppered with historical references that have been . interpreted by Terrence, with the modern gentleman in mind. 'Three-button . tailored suit jackets are a nod to the dapper 1960s aesthetic, yet bold . and eclectic garment detailing invites modernity into the collections.' The firm's suits sell mostly for £400, but it is also currently selling a limited edition black leather overcoat for £3,000. Famous names: The firm said its designs were sported by Brazilian footballers including Neymar (pictured) Proud: The firm did not shy away from the publicity it earned from the case involving its crime boss designer . On Twitter it boasts of celebrity endorsements, including by three of Brazil's most famous footballers. 'N1 Angel thanks Brazil players, Marcelo, Tiago Silva and Neymar for wearing N1 Angel', it said on June 1. But Kennedy Talbot for the Crown . Prosecution Service, which is fighting Adams' application for a . court-approved 'certificate of inadequacy', told the High Court the . company was not a 'legitimate business'. Terry Adams rose to power as the head of the Adams family, which detectives believed was linked to a string of criminal operations. Based in Clerkenwell, North London, they evaded prosecution for years by running their syndicate at arm's length. In 2007 the Old Bailey was told Adams traded on his feared family name 'like a board of directors would guard a trademark'. In March that year he was convicted and jailed for seven years over a £1million money-laundering scam. He was known for living the high life. In 2003 police found a £274,000 haul of art at his north London home - including Picasso etchings, Henry Moore prints . and Asprey's vases. He accused Mrs Adams, 53, a former Eastenders actress who appeared recently in the cockney musical Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be, of hiding profits her husband made when he was a 'career criminal'. And the CPS says there is 'a strong case' that he has 'substantial undisclosed assets'. Mrs Adams insisted the firm was genuine and she had employed her husband because she could see he dressed well. Of her generous spending, she added: 'I obviously live above my means. What else can I say?'. Mr Adams has been described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the UK. The . 58-year-old owes £628,497 of a confiscation order of £750,000 that was . imposed after his conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2007 for . conspiring to conceal the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year . period. He was also ordered . to pay prosecution costs of £50,000 and the £4.6 million bill for his . publicly funded defence. A judge previously said he had accumulated a 'considerable . fortune' from his life as 'a highly successful career criminal' over a . 'significant' period of time. The civil hearing continues.

"By . Daniel Martin . and David Martosko . Barack Obama last night refused to choose between Britain and France in a sign that our relationship with the States may not be as special as once thought. The US president said both France and England are ‘wonderful in their own ways’ and - just like his two daughters - he would never choose between the two countries. He was speaking at the White House during a state visit by unpopular French president Francois Hollande, whose colourful love life has captured the attention of the world. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Barack Obama and French  Francois Hollande share a laugh during an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House . Special relationship? Cameron and Obama were also seen joking around during a basketball game . 'I have two daughters,' the president . said, referring to Sasha and Malia. 'And they are both gorgeous and . wonderful, and I would never choose between them.' 'And that's how I feel about my outstanding European partners. All of them are wonderful in their own ways.' Obama . was speaking during a joint press conference with French President . Francois Hollande, on the occasion of the first State Visit by a French . head of state since 1976. The . move is the latest snub of London, after Secretary of State John Kerry . angered some in the British government by praising France as America's . 'oldest ally' and part of a coalition of the willing prepared to strike . against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom he called a 'thug and . murderer.' Kerry made no mention of Britain in his speech on Syria, but praised France, Australia and even Turkey. In a coded swipe at the UK, the President said: ‘A lot of people think something should be done but nobody wants to do it.’ Rivals? UK Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande may both want super-best-friend status with Washington, but Obama is no longer playing favorites . Today, the Prime Minister focused on the floods and told the press that 'money was no object' Deteriorating relationship: Cameron and Obama walk side-by-side during the G8 summit last June . Insisting . that the use of chemical weapons is the ‘kind of offence that is a . challenge to the world,’ he confirmed the US was considering a ‘limited, . narrow act’ intended to deter their use. Weeks later, Cameron failed to get Parliament to vote for the use of military force in the country. Tory MPs . feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to Mr Cameron’s . standing at home and abroad – and to the Anglo-US ‘special . relationship.’ At the time, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said . last night it would be deeply ‘uncomfortable’ to see the Americans and . French working together ‘while we stand and watch’. 'The U.S.-French alliance has never been stronger,' Obama said. 'That's good for France. It's good for the United States. It's good for the world, because we share certain values and certain commitments and are willing to act on behalf of those commitments and values.' Obama appeared to cast aside an episode from the George W. Bush administration that had France refusing to participate in a coalition effort to invade Iraq while the UK led the way. Within weeks 'French fries' were replaced in high profile eateries – including at least one congressional cafeteria on Capitol Hill – by 'Freedom fries.' And a character on the animated comedy show The Simpsons offered a label for the French that stuck: 'Cheese-eating surrender monkeys.' Britain, meanwhile, enjoyed favored status in Washington. Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair had famously promised after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York and the Washington, D.C. suburbs that Britain would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the American people against a 'new evil of mass terrorism.' What a difference an election makes! George W. Bush and Tony Blair once personified the 'special' U.S.-UK relationship, partnering in an effort to oust Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein from power . The U.S.-France bilateral talks are happening on a global stage, with the very real possibility of putting England's collective nose out of joint . Despite his projection of a strong relationship between the U.S. and France, Obama offered no word on Tuesday about whether the result would be helpful to England. A French journalist had noted that he 'actually praised France very warmly today' and granted our President the first state visit of your second term.' 'Does that mean that France has become the best European ally of the U.S. and has replaced Great Britain in that role?' 'Oh, my,' a smiling Obama said, to a round of laughter. Hollande followed Obama's lead with his own family comparison. 'I have four children,' he said through a translator, 'so that makes it even more difficult for me to make any choice at all.' 'But we're not trying to be anyone's favorite. There are historic links. We share common values.' 'And I can see that our views converge on many issues. But it's not about hierarchy; it's just about being useful to the world.' Will David Cameron be pressed on Washington's 'special relationship' with London during Prime Minister's Questions? But the journalist's question wasn't meant to be playful. It continued with a more serious demand about the implications of whether BFF status exists between Washington and Paris. 'If so,' came the zinger, 'why not extend to France the no-spying agreement that you have with England after the big scandal of the NSA’s surveillance program?' Obama took issue with the premise of the question, cautioning that 'it's not actually correct to say that we have a ""no-spy agreement"" with Great Britain. That’s not actually what happens.' 'We don’t have – there’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' he said. 'We have, like every other country, an intelligence capability. And then we have a range of partnerships with all kinds of countries. And we’ve been in consultations with the French government to deepen those commitments.'","Obama and Hollande took turns saying they couldn't declare a 'varotie' ally .

"By . David Martosko . Former president Bill Clinton and a local Planned Parenthood affiliate both endorsed San Diego's sex pest mayor Bob Filner as recently as last year, it emerged today. Clinton has had his own female problems in Washington, most notably involving a sexual dalliance with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and during his terms as Arkansas governor. Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest provider of pregnancy terminations, and advocates a platform of defending women's health and abortion access. SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO AND VIDEO . 'The ""war on women"" can be done at any level,' Filner said wryly on October 26, 2012, after a Planned Parenthood representative praised him for 'protecting our rights, and the rights of women and families' 'Bob has the experience to move San Diego forward,' Clinton said last year. 'As a Freedom Rider in the 1960s, Bob showed he has the courage to do what's right' Clinton endorsed Filner when he was standing for election as the southern California city's chief executive, last October in a recorded message that Filner's supporters played at pre-election rallies, as KPBS first reported. The Daily Caller dug up the audio last week as Filner's troubles reached their peak and he announced he was entering counseling. 'As president I worked with Bob to save San Diego taxpayers more than $3 billion,' Clinton said then, 'and to secure funding for construction of a veterans home. Bob has the experience to move San Diego forward.' 'As a Freedom Rider in the 1960s, Bob showed he has the courage to do what's right. That's what he did in Congress, and that's exactly what he'll do as mayor of San Diego.' The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, where the former president has an office, did not respond to a request for comment. Planned Parenthood's endorsement was more specific to Filner's positions on women's issues. San Diego mayor Bob Filner has been slammed on all fronts following allegations that he groped and sexually harassed more than a dozen women while in office . 'For twenty years, Bob Filner has defended women,' wrote local Planned Parenthood chair Julie Bornstein (L) in a 2012 endorsement. 'Filner has a 100% voting record on women’s health' 'He is the only 100 per cent pro-choice in the race,' said an unidentified Planned Parenthood leader in a YouTube video shot at an October 26, 2012 rally. He has 'worked tirelessly to protect Planned Parenthood from vicious ideological attacks in Congress,' she said, 'and spent the last 20 years in D.C. protecting our rights, and the rights of women and families.' During the brief speech that followed, Filner encouraged voters to support him as they had previously during his runs for city council and Congress. 'The ""war on women"" can be done at any level,' he said. The abortion rights group formally endorsed him in an email blast a few days before the election. 'For twenty years, Bob Filner has defended women… our right to choice, our right to healthcare, our right to equal pay,' wrote Planned Parenthood Action Fund of the Pacific Southwest chair Julie Bornstein. 'Filner has a 100% voting record on women’s health. He put the Lily Ledbetter Equal Pay for Women Act on President Obama’s desk.  Now, it’s the law.' While women in Filner's . administration may be paid as much as men, they have allegedly been . subjected to the kind of attention he reserved for attractive female . staffers. So far 14 of them have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances and comments. Irene McCormack Jackson, his former communications director, has sued Filner in San Diego County Superior Court, seeking unspecified damages for sexual harassment. Michelle Tyler (R) gave an August 6 press conference with her attorney Gloria Allred (L), during which she alleged that Filner made inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for a disabled Marine . Monica Lewinsky (L), shown with then-President Clinton, told congressional investigators that he had sexual contact with Clinton in a hallway near the Oval Office . Many of the women have told media outlets similar stories, describing initial meetings with Filner on official business during which he allegedly made by sexually inappropriate comments and asked them out on dates. In a few cases, the women have claimed he kissed or sexually touched them. Polls of San Diegans show that between two-thirds and three-quarters of them want their mayor to resign, but he has insisted that he's not going quietly. On Tuesday the Associated Press reported that he will fight an effort to remove him through a voter referendum. 'As your Mayor, I am committed to moving San Diego forward!' he wrote in an official response to a citizens' recall effort. Filner, said recall chairman Michael Pallamary in a statement to the AP, 'obviously believes his policy initiatives excuse his being a sexual predator. His reply is unacceptable.' 'San Diegans want a mayor that doesn't grope and demean women, who doesn't abuse his office to satisfy a perverted quest for a sense of power, and who has the ability to lead our great city — an ability Filner can never, ever reclaim.' The San Diego city council and California Sen. Barbara Boxer – a longtime Filner ally – have added their voices to the chorus calling for him to leave office. On Tuesday a Yahoo News reporter spotted Planned Parenthood's 2012 campaign mailer that praised Filner as an advocate for women . Planned Parenthood almost universally supports Democratic politicians. This group protested outside the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa .","Irony: San Diego's mayor warned during a Planned Parenthood rally last year that 'the ""war on women"" can be done at any level'

"By . David Martosko . McCain is the first of Obama's hard-won GOP cheerleaders to start bailing water, in a 180-degree shift from comments just 24 hours age . John McCain today said he will not back a use-of-force resolution to be voted on by lawmakers – less than 24 hours after warning of a 'catastrophic' end to President Obama's Syria saga if Congress refused to back the proposal. The Republican senator for Arizona said it was a mistake for the president to approach legislators in the first place, and said he believes the resolution is too weak in its current form. But Obama shot back from across the Atlantic ocean during a trip to Sweden that Congress should do more than 'sit on the sidelines [and] snipe.' A resolution crafted by New Jersey . Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez and Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker . would limit military action to 90 days, and would make no provision for . American ground troops entering Syria. A McCain aide told MailOnline Wednesday that the senator 'does not support' that resolution. McCain would vote 'no,' he said on NBC's Today show, if his only other option was 'to do something that really doesn’t . change anything – in other words, some token strikes, and then some time . later, [Assad] uses those chemical weapons . again.' 'What then? Go through the same . routine?' Speaking during a press conference with Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt of Sweden, Obama insisted he ultimately does not need Congress' permission to strike Syria, even though he has asked for it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Not my 'red line': Obama cast the U.S. ultimatum against Syria as the work of Congress and the international community . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (C) has allegedly hidden military hardware and chemical weapons smuggled out of Iraq during the early days of the first Gulf War. Some of those weapons were used against Syrian civilians in late August . Obama and Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt are meeting in Stockholm ahead of the upcoming G-20 summit . 'As commander in chief, I always . preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of America’s . national security,' Obama said. 'I do not believe that I was required to . take this to Congress ... I did not take this to Congress just because . it’s an empty exercise; I think it’s important to have Congress’s . support on it.' In Washington, McCain said that Congress should only support measures that can 'reverse the situation on the battlefield.' 'It's an unfair fight. Russian . weapons are pouring in, Iranian weapons are pouring in. Have no doubt, . this is a proxy war, and the Iranians are the ones who will gain or lose . by this.' 'I have to see . the concrete action' from the Obama administration, he said on the CBS . This Morning program. 'And it's not that I don't trust the word of the . president. 'It's just that I need to see the concrete measures that are . going to be taken.' 'And if . we don't take those concrete measures and if the resolution doesn't . allow it, then obviously I can’t support it. It’s almost as bad as not . passing a resolution, is passing a resolution that doesn’t allow us to . take action that reverses the situation on the battlefield so that . Bashar al-Assad will sooner or later leave. The only way he’s going to . leave is if he thinks he’s losing.' Obama announced Saturday that he would take the unusual step of asking for congressional approval before engaging in a limited bombing campaign in Syria. McCain said Wednesday morning that this was a mistake. Hundreds of children were among the more than 1,400 killed by what U.S. officials have called a sarin nerve gas attack in the Duma neighborhood of Damascus on August 21 . Protesters in northern Syria carried banners on Aug. 30 during a demonstration calling for international action against the Assad regime . 'Once he announced that we were going . to have strikes, I think he should have acted, as other presidents . have, both Republican or Democrat,' McCain said. 'But it is what it is. The word of the President of the United States is out there in the world . that we will not stand him crossing a red line. And not only did he say . that, he said that there would be strikes against those persecutors. Obviously that’s Assad.' Sens. Bob Menendez and Bob Corker have floated a proposal that would outline the conditions for U.S. bombing campaigns in Syria. 'The President is authorized ... to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in a limited and tailored manner against legitimate military targets in Syria,' it reads. Action could be taken 'only to: (1) respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction by the Syrian government in the conflict in Syria; (2) deter Syria’s use of such weapons in order to protect the national security interests of the United States and to protect our allies and partners against the use of such weapons; and (3) degrade Syria’s capacity to use such weapons in the future.' Most critically, Congress would 'not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Syria for the purpose of combat operations.' The authorization would expire in 60 days, but President Obama would have the option to extend it a single time for another 30 days. 'So then for the United States to do nothing will have a ripple effect all over the world.' Obama said Wednesday that bringing the matter to Congress had been 'brewing . in my mind for some time,' suggesting that it was part of his broader . Middle East plan long before he made the surprising public announcement. In Sweden, the president claimed that his 2012 'red line' speech, in which he warned Assad that the use of chemical weapons would have dire consequences, was also a conscious tactic. 'That wasn't something I just kind . of made up,' Obama said. 'I didn't just pluck it out of thin air.' He insisted that 'my credibility's not on the line.' 'The international community's credibility is on the line,' Obama said, 'and America's and Congress's credibility's on the line.' 'I didn't set a red line,' Obama said. 'The world set a red line.' And Congress, he claimed, 'set a red line when it ratified that treaty.' Obama added that he 'believe[s] that Congress will approve it' a resolution, but maintained that 'I do not believe that I was required to take this to Congress.' The president, who received the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, declined to answer a question about whether he would bomb Syria on his own if Congress declines to approve military action. What a difference a day makes: McCain (L) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) said yesterday that President Obama made them comfortable with his plan to attack the Syrian regime . 'They call him the Maverick...' -- McCain was calling a $100 bet (in fake money) as Secretary of State John Kerry made the case for bombing Syria . Cruise missiles' arrival on targets there, however, might happen far more quickly than other U.S. shipments of Syria-related war materiel. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday night that three months after the White House authorized the CIA to arm some of the resistance fighters opposing the Assad regime, they are still waiting. The delay was attributed to an abundance of caution in ensuring the weapons don't fall into the hands of other resistance elements who identify with extremist jihadi causes. McCain has made news three times in the past 24 hours, including his initial declaration Tuesday that it would be 'catastrophic' if Congress withheld its support from the White House, and an Associated Press photographer's snapshot of him playing poker on his iPhone during a marathon Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the matter.","In Sweden, Obama warns Congress not to 'sit on the sidelines [and] snipe'

"By . David Martosko . and Associated  Press Reporter . With the U.S. facing massive overcrowding in its prisons, Attorney General Eric Holder today announced that the Department of Justice will scale back the use of mandatory minimum prison terms for certain drug-related crimes. Holder said he would alter Justice Department policy so that low-level, . nonviolent drug offenders with no ties to large-scale organizations, . gangs or cartels won't be charged with offenses that impose those mandatory . minimum sentences. America, he told a meeting of the American Bar Association, will begin 'fundamentally rethinking the notion of mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes.' While leaks of Holder's remarks made news Monday morning, no major news outlet noted the racial component to what Holder announced. But Holder himself brought race to the front burner. Scroll down for video . In a speech in front of the American Bar Association in San Francisco, Eric Holder announced major changes to how the federal government will prosecute minor drug cases . 'People of color' in the federal criminal justice system 'often face harsher punishments than their peers,' he said. Should low-level drug offenders be sent for treatment instead of federal prison? 'One deeply troubling report, . released in February, indicates that – in recent years – black male . offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those . imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes.  This isn’t just . unacceptable – it is shameful.' Holder said he had 'directed a group . of U.S. Attorneys to examine sentencing disparities, and to develop . recommendations on how we can address them.' His frank comments about race in the justice system will come as a surprise to some, and welcome news to others. Ohio State University law professor Doug . Berman told MailOnline that 'there's usually an eagerness in the . government to avoid talking about the racial overlay in criminal . justice policy.' 'But just as we saw the comments about Trayvon Martin from . the president, or Attorney General Holder's willingness to give us a . preview of this speech back in April when he spoke to Al Sharpton's . National Action Network, these issues are necessarily more salient for . an African-American AG serving an African-American president.' 'They grew up in communities of . color,' Berman said, 'places that are disproportionately affected by . this kind of imprisonment and this kind of crime.' Hilary Shelton, the director of the . the NAACP's Washington Bureau and the group's senior vice president for . policy and advocacy, said Holder's message is long overdue. Race 'is a major component' in the lack of fairness in sentencing laws, Shelton told MailOnline. 'There's a need for us to address these overly punitive measures, especially when there's a racial component.' Ending the War on Drugs? Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to announce a new policy scaling back mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders in an attempt to reduce U.S. prison populations . The nation's dozens of federal prisoners are 40percent over-capacity. Some 219,000 men and women are serving federal prison time, many of them drug offenders . 'Congress addressed this' by . recalibrating the sentencing disparities in 2010,' Shelton said, and 'they . noted the racial differences in sentencing as well.' But differences in how blacks and . whites are treated in federal courts, said Shelton, 'affect too many . people. Racial disparities have a huge impact, but in addition we also . have major disparities in income – in class.' 'We're delighted that this issue is getting the attention it deserves.' Some sort of reform is needed, says the American Civil Liberties Union, even if it's not informed by perceptions of racism. Fully . 60 per cent of federal drug offenders, the ACLU notes, received . mandatory minimum sentences in 2012. One-third of them were sentenced to . 10-year terms or longer. Typically under federal law, crack . cocaine users – most often black defendants – who possess only 28 grams . of the drug are charged with felonies. Meanwhile, historically white . powder cocaine users are not charged with felonies unless they are . caught with 500 grams. That 18-to-1 disparity was 100-to-1 . until Congress acted in 2010. But incarceration at the federal level, . say some, is still applied in a fashion that appears to play racial . favorites. 'As the so-called “war on drugs” enters its fifth decade,' Holder said Monday, 'we need to ask whether . it, and the approaches that comprise it, have been truly effective – and . build on the Administration’s efforts, led by the Office of National . Drug Control Policy, to usher in a new approach.' 'Some statutes that mandate . inflexible sentences ... have had a destabilizing effect on particular . communities, largely poor and of color,' he added. And, applied . inappropriately, they are ultimately counterproductive.' An estimated 9 to 10 million people - many of them arrested for drug possession - pass through local jails every year . Part of that dysfunction involves . overcrowding in the federal prison system, which is now 40 per cent over . capacity with 219,000 inmates.But some states have experimented with reforms that the federal government has noted with surprise. 'In Texas,' Holder said Monday, . 'investments in drug treatment for nonviolent offenders and changes to . parole policies brought about a reduction in the prison population of . more than 5,000 inmates last year alone. The same year, similar efforts . helped Arkansas reduce its prison population by more than 1,400.' 'Federal prosecutors, he explained, . 'cannot – and should not – bring every case or charge every defendant . who stands accused of violating federal law.' Holder specifically noted the racial implications of the rule change and said 'people of color' are often treated more harshly by the federal justice system . Devolving some cases to state or . local law enforcers, he suggested, would free up federal government . resources while also emphasizing community-level policing. It has become easier for the federal government to act, said Berman, the Ohio State law professor, now that 'deep-red states like Texas, Georgia, Alabama – just to name a few – have been notably successful with these kinds of reforms.' 'I know the DOJ has been emphasizing . this in a number of way, but now it can be done properly,' Berman told . MailOnline, 'because it appears that this is what's sensible regardless . of your politics, and regardless of your perceptions of what's ""soft"" or . ""hard"" on drugs.' 'The evolving politics in the last five years have made this possible.' 'Democrats are suddenly saying, much like the Republicans have, that we trust the states to do this,' Berman added. 'I don't think this represents a . broader sense of the Obama administration being on board with cutting . funds in Washington and putting power back in the states – like helping Rick Perry remember which three cabinet departments to cut – but it does provide the White House with a good opportunity to play nice with the right.' Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, a former federal . prosecutor in the United States Attorney’s Office in Albuquerque, New . Mexico, told MailOnline that 'mandatory minimum sentences have ... unfairly targeted minorities' and 'led to prosecutorial abuses, . especially when law enforcement find a firearm anywhere remotely close . to where drugs were found.' 'For example, if law enforcement stop . a courier on the highway transporting drugs and agents also find a . firearm somewhere in the vehicle, this courier would be facing not only . a mandatory minimum of 10 years for the drug offense, he would also be . facing a five year mandatory consecutive sentence for the firearm.' 'People of color often face harsher punishments than their peers. One deeply troubling report, released in February, indicates that – in recent years – black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes.  This isn’t just unacceptable – it is shameful.' Attorney General Eric Holder on the racial implications of his decision . Aggressive enforcement of federal criminal laws is necessary,' Holder said Monday, 'but 'we cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safer nation.' 'Today, a vicious cycle of poverty, . criminality and incarceration traps too many Americans and weakens too . many communities. However, many aspects of our criminal justice system . may actually exacerbate this problem, rather than alleviate it.' 'We . need to ensure that incarceration is used to punish, deter and . rehabilitate - not merely to convict, warehouse and forget,' said the . attorney general. Holder . said mandatory minimum sentences 'breed disrespect for the system. When . applied indiscriminately, they do not serve public safety. They have had . a disabling effect on communities. And they are ultimately . counterproductive.' Senators Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, Mike Lee, an Utah Republican, and Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, have introduced legislation aimed at giving federal judges more discretion in applying mandatory minimums to certain drug offenders. 'We definitely need the bill passed,' said Johnson, the former federal prosecutor. 'I would not rely on just the DOJ's policy, because that's very arbitrary, subject to change, and each district may apply it differently.'","Most frequent mandatory minimum prison terms go to black offenders who use, buy or sell crack cocaine .
White offenders typically use powder cocaine, which carries a much lower minimum prison term .

"By . John Hall . A huge former container ship will this week begin the unprecedented and complicated task of destroying the deadly chemical weapon stockpile handed over by Syria's president Bashar al-Assad. The vessel will be accompanied by armed guards throughout the six-stage journey that take its cargo of nerve agents and mustard gas from Syria to Finland via a mafia-plagued port in southern Italy. The final consignment left the Syrian port of Latakla for Calabria in Italy last week, meaning - officially at least - Assad no longer has any chemical weapons in the country. Route: The vessel will be accompanied by armed guards throughout the six-stage journey that take its cargo of nerve agents and mustard gas from Syria to Finland, via the mafia-plagued Gioia Tauro port in southern Italy . The ship carrying out most of the decommissioning is the American-owned Cape Ray, which will be loaded up with 700 tons of the most dangerous chemicals ever taken to sea. The material has been transported in small amounts to Gioia Tauro in Calabria, southern Italy - a large port which is regularly used by the notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia to smuggle shipments of drugs and weapons into Europe. The presence of the chemical weapons will be of little interest to the criminal organisation, however, as the Cape Ray - onto which the Syrian material is being loaded - is so heavily guarded. Now that the vessel is fully loaded, it will begin making its way into undisclosed international waters where the process of destroying the worst of the chemical weapons will begin. According to the Independent, the Cape Ray has two titanium-lined reactors which can work 24 hours a day, six days a week for up to three months breaking the chemicals down. By the end of the process, some of the most hazardous material known to mankind will be reduced to little more than 1.5million gallons of relatively harmless industrial waste. This material will then make be transported on Norwegian and Danish vessels to northern European countries - including Britain, Germany and Finland - where it can easily be disposed of safely. The ship carrying out most of the decommissioning is the American-owned Cape Ray, which will be loaded with 700 tons of dangerous chemicals. Two processing plants have been set-up on board the vessel . Complex: Each processing plant on board the Cape Ray contains a complex set of machines that allow some of most dangerous material ever taken to sea to be turned into relatively harmless industrial waste . The M/V Cape Ray, which is complete with two titanium-lined reactors which can work 24 hours a day, six a week . Although the removal of the material means Syria is officially free of chemical weapons, a number of observers claims Assad's forces are still using chlorine gas against rebel forces. Unsubstantiated reports from doctors and medical staff within the country suggest pro-government forces may be using crude but barrel bombs to deploy the deadly chlorine gas - which was developed as a weapon during the First World War. While the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been unable to confirm its use, one expert has little doubt Assad has been deploying chlorine gas. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of British chemical-weapons forces and head of specialist security compnay SecureBio told The Independent: 'In my opinion, Assad sees that chemical weapons have a battle-winning . ability and, no matter how crude chlorine gas is, it still has the power . to terrify.' Once complete, the operation to destroy Assad's chemical weapon will have involved more than 30 countries - some of which are dealing with the decommissioning and disposal of the waste, while others are merely providing transportation, or allowing the Cape Ray to safe passage through their waters. Britain's involvement in the operation will see material totalling 150 tons processed and incinerated at Veolia Environmental Services plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. The Foreign Office insists this material will not include dangerous chemical weapons, and will instead be relatively harmless waste material.","Chemical weapons will be transported from Middle East to Scandinavia .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Chinese police shot dead dozens of knife-wielding 'terrorists' dead yesterday after they attacked two towns in the country's western Xinjiang province. A gang armed with knives assaulted a police station and government offices in the town of Elixku, in Shache county, according to local police. Some then moved on to the nearby town of Huangdi, attacking civilians and smashing and setting fire to six vehicles. Chinese police say they have shot dozens of 'terrorists' dead in the towns of Elixku and Huangdi after a knife wielding mob staged attacks on government buildings and police stations (file pic) The attacks took place in the township of Elixcu,  Xinjiang province, which is home to the Uighur people who have been previously accused of carrying out attacks by the government . 'Police officers at the scene shot dead dozens of members of the mob,' a brief report from the country's state-controlled Xinhua news agency said. An initial investigation showed that it was an 'organised and premeditated terrorist attack', Xinhua added. The dead and injured include not just Uighurs, a Muslim people native to the region, but members of China's majority Han Chinese population, the report said. U.S.-based Rebiya Kadeer, president of the exiled World Uighur Congress, called for restraint, saying  that she was worried 'China will use this incident to step up repression, causing more people to lose their freedom.' The attack took place at the end of the holy month of Ramadan, which officials had tried to suppress in Xinjiang, an indication of what rights groups say is discrimination targeting the Uighurs. Xinjiang, home to many Turkic-speaking Uighurs, has been marked by violence for years which the government blames on Islamist militants or separatists. Officials say the rebels are  bent on establishing an independent state called East Turkestan. Earlier this year bomb attacks on a market in in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, left 39 people dead. China says Uighur militants have based themselves in countries including Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent years, and this week China's special envoy for the Middle East said some had also likely been trained in Syria and Iraq. During a bomb attack on a market in Xinjiang in May, 39 people were killed after terrorists threw explosives into a market, setting off huge blasts . Violence has also spread outside of Xinjiang, with activists also blamed for a knife attack on a train station in Kunming in March which killed 33 people including four attackers . Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang, including controls on Islam, have provoked unrest, a claim Beijing denies. Xinjiang, resource-rich and strategically located on the borders of central Asia, is crucial to meeting China's growing energy needs. Exiles, rights groups and many foreign experts say that most of the proceeds from this industry have gone to the Han Chinese, stoking resentment among Uighurs. More than 200 people have died in unrest in Xinjiang in the past year, the government says, prompting a tough crackdown by Beijing. Violence blamed by China on Uighur extremists has begun to spread outside of Xinjiang. In March, 29 people were stabbed to death at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming.","Knife-wielding gang attacked government buildings in Xinjaing province .

"By . David Martosko . Matt Damon no longer has a crush on Barack Obama. 'He broke up with me,' the movie star said in an interview published online Thursday. The star of the upcoming film 'Elysium' told BET that he and the president 'no longer see eye-to-eye.' 'There are a lot of things that I really question, he said, specifically about the Obama administration's national security posture. 'The legality of the drone strikes,' Damon said, 'and these NSA revelations are – like, you know – Jimmy Carter came out and said we don’t live in a democracy. That’s a little intense when an ex-president says that. So you know, he’s got some explaining to do, particularly for a constitutional law professor.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In August 2011, Damon told reporters that he was 'really dissatisfied' with Obama 'doubling down' on George W. Bush's 'bad ideas' for education . What a difference four years can make: Damon campaigned aggressively for Obama in 2008 . Obama has come under fire for presiding over an NSA with a mandate for domestic spying. The agency's biggest secrets are now exposed publicly since contractor Edward Snowden leaked them to the press and fled to Russia. And the president has faced growing outrage from Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and other libertarian-minded Republicans, following his Department of Justice's longtime refusal to guarantee that it won't use drones to surveil Americans – an assurance it gave only in the face of an embarrassing Senate filibuster. The White House continues to use unmanned drones as first-strike weapons against terrorism targets overseas. Damon campaigned aggressively for then-Senator Obama during the 2008 election season. Nine days before the 2008 election, Damon told a room full of volunteers in Florida that they should work hard to ‘make sure Barack wins’ But in the president's second term, the bloom is clearly off the rose. In Elysium, a crew of gun-toting officers secures the line between the Occupy-inspired 1 per cent and the rest of humanity . Damon told reporters in August 2011 . that he was 'really dissatisfied' with Obama 'doubling down' on George . W. Bush's 'bad ideas' for education. Three . months later in an interview with Elle magazine he said, 'I've talked . to a lot of people who worked for Obama at the grassroots level. One of . them said to me, ""Never again. I will never be fooled again by a . politician.""' 'You . know,' he added, 'a one-term president with some balls who actually got . stuff done would have been, in the long run of the country, much . better.' Damon's criticism of Obama began in late 2010, and by April 2011 the president was ready to fire back, albeit in good fun. 'It's fair to say that when it comes to my presidency, the honeymoon is over,' he at the White House Correspondents Dinner. 'Matt Damon said he was disappointed in my performance. Well Matt, I just saw The Adjustment Bureau so right back atcha buddy.' Nine days before the 2008 presidential election, Damon visited an Obama volunteer center in South Florida, urging dozens of students to 'make sure Barack wins' Damon has come under fire this week following revelations that despite his long-term advocacy for improving public education, he sends his own children to a private school. 'II pay for a private education and I’m trying to get the one that most matches the public education that I had,' he told The Guardian, 'but that kind of progressive education no longer exists in the public system. It’s unfair.' During a 2011 rally in Washington D.C., Damon told a crowd of teachers that he would not trade his own public school education 'for anything.' His film 'Elysium' which opens Friday, has been panned by conservatives for arguing for a socialist utopia as an alternative to a future world of haves and have-nots. The Occupy Wall Street-inspired plot line involves a wealthy elite class that has abandoned an overcrowded Earth for a luxury space station, leaving the rest of humanity in crime-ridden and poverty-stricken squalor.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Thomas Sidley, 21, has been jailed for more than four years after joking that it was easier to steal from people than to get a job . A cocky criminal who boasted that he stole from people because it was easier than going to the job centre has been jailed for more than four years. Thomas Sidley, 21, was arrested in January when he went on a two-day burglary spree just after being released from jail for similar offences. He was caught after a gang he was leading beat and robbed a man in the street, taking his bag before before the victim managed to call police. Sidley was arrested, pleaded guilty to robbery and four burglaries, but while being questioned by probation officers he joked that he stole because it was easier than trying to get a job. After hearing of the remark at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn sentenced him to 50 months in jail for his crimes and shameless attitude. He said: 'You accept you were the initial aggressor in the robbery, throwing the first punch, before a second man administered kicks. 'The victim's bag was snatched. He was chased briefly. He received an injury to his ear and thigh, but was very frightened. 'You were arrested soon afterwards, you were intoxicated. You say your motivation was to raise money to buy cannabis. 'You even commented to the probation officer that it was easier to commit burglaries than attend the job centre.' Sidley broke into six homes across Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, in the days and weeks following his release from prison in January. One victim returned home to find his property had been broken into and goods worth £880, including three laptops, stolen. An iPad and jewellery were stolen from another house two days later after a glass door was smashed. Judge Paul Glenn jailed Sidley for 50 months on one count of robbery and four of burglary after hearing the 'joke' Another homeowner found a glass window smashed and a safe worth £80, which contained about £200 and a driving licence, had been stolen. He was also the lead member of a gang who robbed a man as he walked home from work. Prosecutor Steven Bailey told the court the robbery happened in January as the victim left his job at a takeaway. Mr Bailey said: 'The victim was about to leave when a group of men, including the defendant, went in and aggressively demanded free food. 'The manager eventually gave them old chips to get rid of them. The victim spent £8.49 at a shop on whisky and cookies and was also carrying a box of spare ribs. 'He saw the group and tried to avoid them, but they noticed him. He tried to walk away to avoid any confrontation. 'But he was punched to the side of his head and kicked a couple of times to the thigh. His bag was snatched, but his phone wasn't and he was able to use it to call the police after the incident.' During the case at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured), the judge was told that Sidley committed a spree of burglaries shortly after being released from prison for similar offences . Officers arrived and the defendant was found with the others a short distance away. Two were eating food and the cookies and whisky were unopened nearby. Sidley, of Tunstall, Staffs, pleaded guilty to robbery and four burglaries. He asked for two other burglaries to be taken into consideration. Jason Holt, defending, admitted the robbery was a 'mean' offence, adding: 'It was to try and humiliate rather than any particular desire to steal.'","Thomas Sidley, 21, arrested after a spree of burglaries and a robbery .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A dog shelter has been forced to hand a dog abandoned at Glastonbury festival back to its owners after animal rescue workers said they had 'no other option'. A female lurcher, nicknamed Dolly after country singer Dolly Parton offered to adopt her, was found cowering among 5,000 abandoned tents on the 900-acre festival site at Worthy Farm in Somerset. At the time shelter workers expressed disbelief and anger at how anyone could mistreat an animal so badly, but now, despite seeking legal advice, rescue workers have been forced to hand the pet back after her foreign owners came forward to collect her. Dolly the lurcher was found abandoned in a tent after Glastonbury festival but has been handed back to her owners after foreign couple came forward . The RSPCA said it had sought legal advice before giving the animal back, but said it had been left with 'no other option' after the owners came forward .

After being left behind at the festival site, she was cared for by Happy Landings . animal shelter in Pylle, Somerset, who are still unsure how the dog . ended up being forgotten. A spokesperson for the shelter said: 'Although we have concerns and unanswered questions legally we have had to hand her back. 'The .

"By . Chris Pleasance . One of the first Romanian immigrants to arrive in the UK after border controls were relaxed in January has complained that this country is too expensive. Victor Spirescu became a minor celebrity earlier this year after being pictured with politicians after climbing off a plane at Luton airport. At the time he said he came to London to send money back to his wife in Romania so he could start his own business, but now says he cannot make savings because the capital is too expensive. Scroll down for video . Romanian Victor Spirescu (right) who was pictured with Labour MP Keith Vaz after arriving in this country on New Year's Day has complained that the UK is too expensive . Spirescu told the BBC that London rent is too high, and he is unhappy he has to pay so much on tax and transport (pictured having a coffee with Keith Vaz and fellow immigrant Julian Barbat, centre) Speaking on the Today show on BBC Radio 4 he said: 'I haven't saved any money. It is very expensive here. 'I want to save some money to make my own business in Romania. I expected to save some money but no. Spirescu said he believes the border was opened in January because the UK needs more workers, as all British men are at home on benefits . 'I believe England opened the border because they need people to work. English guys are at home on benefits. 'I want to go home but I haven't saved any money. The system is wrong I pay too much tax, too much money for travel and rent it is too expensive to live in London.' Spirescu arrived in the UK on New Year's Day and was treated to a Costa Coffee by LAbour Party politician Keith Vaz. At the time he told reporters that he was not here 'to rob your country', adding that he wanted to get a job, earn money, and then go back to Romania with his wife. He initially got a job washing cars in an Aldi car park in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, but quit after just one day to start a construction job at a building site in east London. Since then he has announced plans to move his 19-year-old wife Catalina Curcean to the UK from their pig and sheep farm in Transylvania. It is not known whether she has joined him in this country. Spirescu gained notoriety after his ex-girlfirend, a 26-year-old woman named Ana, claimed he was arrested and fined in Romania for attacking her in a car park. The pair began dating in 2009 but she split up with him seven months later. She eventually agreed to meet up with him again in a park in January 2010 after he had tried to contact her up to 40 times. Spirescu said he wanted to save money to send home to his wife Catalina Curcean in Transylvania, but he cannot afford to do it . When they met up, she said he launched his attack, punching her to the floor then hitting her repeatedly while she was on the ground. It was reported that Spirescu was fined £600 and ordered to pay his ex-girlfriend £400 compensation in June 2011 by Bucharest's 3rd District Court following the incident. In addition, he was given a 35 day suspended jail sentence.","Victor Spirescu arrived on New Year's Day after border controls relaxed .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Russia has refused to allow the hit U.S. TV series House of Cards to film new episodes for the show inside the U.N. Security Council chamber in New York. The show's producers approached the United Nations to request permission to use the chamber and the 15 council members, which include Russia, America and the UK were asked whether it could be used when the council is not in session. It is thought that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon agreed to allow two episodes to be filmed in the chamber as a way of raising awareness of the work of the U.N. Kevin Spacey, who stars at conniving politician Frank Underwood in the hit TV show House of Cards . The UN Security Council Chamber in New York, where producers of House of Cards wanted to film . However according to diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions were private, Russia refused to grant permission for filming to take place. It is thought Russia was against using the chamber for filming as they believed it should be free at all times to deal with international crises not for filming TV shows. Foreign Policy also reported that Russia said the chamber should be' available at any time and at short notice'. It has also been reported that China, where House of Cards is extremely popular, expressed concern about filming the series in the chamber but would be more accommodating if they were granted script approval. House of Cards is a Washington-based series starring Kevin Spacey as the conniving politician Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as his wife. The popular programme charts the rise of Frank Underwood as a Democratic congressman and House Majority Whip as he becomes president. The show also stars Robin Wright, right, as the wife of Kevin Spacey's character Frank Underwood . He comes up with a highly intricate plan to disgrace his enemies and obtain a cabinet position after the President goes back on his promise to appoint him Secretary of State. It is unclear if Russian diplomats had taken offence to the political nature of House of Cards, but a Russian security expert, Mark Galeotti believed they were just playing it safe. He told Russia Today: 'It shows the American policy process as thoroughly corrupt and conducted by moral degenerates. Maybe the diplomats were just playing it safe.' Despite being screened on online streaming service Netflix it has attracted an army of fans with U.S. president Barack Obama even expressing his anticipation for the arrival of the second series in February. It is unclear if Russian diplomats had taken offence to the political nature of House of Cards, but refused filming to take place in the Security Council chamber . But France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters yesterday: 'It's disappointing for you, I guess, because you wanted to see the actors. 'It's reassuring because I think the actors would have seemed so much more elegant than we are, you know,' he added laughing. The U.N. Security Council chamber was re-opened in April last year after being closed for three years for improvements. The majority of the renovations were paid for by Norway and included new wallpaper, curtains and refurbishing the horseshoe-shaped table where the members of the council sit. The work is part of an overall programme of improvements to the United Nations' headquarters in New York.","Producers wanted to film inside UN Security Council chamber in New York .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Just a few years ago, finding an England football fan openly supporting the German team would have been almost unheard of. So it is perhaps surprising that, for tomorrow's World Cup final, English fans are flocking to support the old rival Germany against a newer rival in Argentina. Sir Geoff Hurst , England's hat-trick hero of 1966, has already pledged his support, as has UK Prime Minister David Cameron. In a final between two old enemies of English football, English fans seem to be backing old rivals Germany over newer adversaries Argentina . The two countries have plenty of history when it comes to their relationship with England, both on and off the field. It was Germany who knocked England out of the last World Cup, beating Capello's side 4-1, inflicting England's heaviest World Cup defeat thanks in part to a disallowed goal from Frank Lampard. It was Germany that England beat 4-2 in 1966 to win the World Cup, thanks to two controversial goals from Hurst - one which bounced off the inside of the cross bar and on to the goal line, and another at the end of extra time as fans were streaming on to the pitch. Of course, in terms of real-world rivalries, the two World Wars are what made Germany into the enemy in the first place. England's hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst (left, holding captain Bobby Moore), who helped England to victory over the Germans in 1966 has come out in support of the European team over the South Americans . Meanwhile, on the Argentine side, the Falklands war and the still-bitter argument over the islands has done nothing to endear English minds to the prospect of an Argentine win. On the pitch, Diego Maradona's 'hand of God' moment, when he scored against England from an unpenalised handball in 1986, still sticks in the memory, as does the memory of Diego Simeone hitting the turf after being tapped on the leg by David Beckham in 1998. Given the animosity that most England supporters feel towards the two nations, it is almost a shame that they cannot both lose. But when it comes to picking a winner, it seems that the English are choosing to back the Europeans over the South Americans. For German fans, a win tomorrow would put an end to their status as perennial nearly-men, making the semi finals or finals of the last four World Cups without a win . If Argentina were to emerge victorious it would mark the third World Cup win in the country's history . Hurst told the Sun on Sunday: 'I know England supporters will be shocked to see me backing the Germans but they are the tournament's best team. 'They are a great football nation - very much like us in that they are determined, strong and proud.' While the Argentinians are capable of playing with flair and style, particularly their star man Lionel Messi, the Germans play a solid  style of football, more akin to the English way. There may also be a sense of underdog spirit to backing the team, since the Germans have been pegged as perennial nearly-men, reaching the final or semi-final of the last four tournaments without a win. David Cameron is also lending his support to our European neighbours, though it has been suggested that this in only to curry favour with Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Cameron was rooting for Holland to beat Messi and Co. in last night's crunch semi final and had been texting the country's prime minister Mark Rutte 'furiously'. But after the Dutch crashed out in a penalty shoot out, Mr Cameron has turned his support to the Germans.","Germany and Argentina will face off in World Cup final tomorrow night .

"By . Chris Pleasance . For the last six weeks, homeowners in one Oregon city have been under siege from vandals attacking their property and cars. But rather than using spray paint or bricks to do damage, these bandits have taken a different approach by throwing donuts, yogurt and even potato salad. The bizarre attacks include chocolate donuts spiked on the end of one woman's windscreen wipers, eggs and cakes thrown at a car bonnet, and pastries strewn across another woman's lawn along with a book from the 'Twilight' series. Mysterious bakery bandits have targeted cars and houses in Hillboro, Oregon, throwing donuts, pastries, potato salad, yogurt and Maple bars at cars and houses . Lt. Mike Rouches, a Hillsboro police spokesman, told Oregon Live: 'In my 25 years in police services, I have never investigated or seen a criminal mischief involving pastries.' Police first heard about the attacks on July 11 when a woman contacted them to say her flatmate and neighbours had been targeted at least 13 times. She told officers that the crimes had all happened in and around the 5600 block of Northeast Farmcrest Street, Hillsboro, and had been going on since June 1. She said Maple bars, cinnamon donuts, potato salad, pink yogurt and bread covered with a white 'slimy' liquid had all been thrown at her car. Police discovered that, on several occasions, WinCo Foods or Albertsons packaging had been discovered at the scene of the attacks. When they investigated three stores in the area they found that all of them stored their trash securely, meaning the items were bought or stolen from the shops, rather than the bins. Officers investigating the attacks, which have been going on for six weeks, say they have taken place in and around the 5600 block of Northeast Farmcrest Street (pictured) between 11pm and 5am . Another woman contacted officers to say that on July 2 she found doughnuts in her yard along with an empty Albertsons box, while a 'Twilight' book was also left in her driveway. On July 15 the same woman said that two chocolate donuts had been left spiked on the ends of the wiper blades of her son's car. According to residents of Hillboro, all of the attacks have happened between 11pm and 5am. So far the bakery bandit attacks have left officers stumped. Investigators believe the targets are selected at random and that youngsters are the likely culprits, but otherwise have no leads. However, Rouches added: 'We'll solve it. It's just a matter of catching up with the bakery bandits.'","Cars and homes in Hillboro, Oregon, targeted by so-called 'bakery bandits'

President Barack Obama has revealed that has hasn't ruled out abandoning an attack on Syria, and that he has been secretly discussing a non-military resolution to the Syrian crisis with Russian President Vladimir Putin 'for quite some time.' 'We will pursue this diplomatic track,' Obama told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace. 'I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way.' But 'it's fair to say that I haven't decided' what to do if Congress fails to authorize a military strike against the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, he conceded to NBC News' Savannah Guthrie. While he said he was 'heartbroken' seeing videos of a suspected sarin gas attack's aftermath in Syria, the president admitted that 'I wouldn't say I'm confident' about the outcome on Capitol Hill. But if Assad were to voluntarily give up his chemical weapons, would Obama call off the Pentagon? 'Absolutely,' he told ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer, 'if in fact that happens.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Obama said Monday that he would prefer to find a diplomatic solution to the Syrian chemical weapons crisis . Obama's unprecedented cluster of sit-down TV interviews included chats with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN Fox News and PBS -- all to be broadcast on the same evennig . 'It's fair to say I haven't decided' whether to bomb Syria if Congress doesn't vote to authorize it, Obama told NBC's Savannah Guthrie when her turn came in the White House's Blue Room . 'Let's see if we can come up with language that avoids a strike but accomplishes our key goals to make sure that these chemical weapons are not used.' The comments came as part of an unprecedented series of sit-down television interviews Monday, in which Obama was expected to make the the case for military intervention in Syria but instead seemed to cleave to a softer approach. Secretary of State John Kerry provided the president with an unlikely opening earlier on Monday in London, offering an off-hand answer to a reporter's question about what Assad might do to avert a U.S. military attack. The . Obama administration would not launch a military strike against Syria, Kerry said, . if the dictator were to 'turn over every single bit of his . chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.' A White House official had told . CNN that the episode was the result of a 'major goof' by Kerry, who had . 'clearly gone off script.' Still, Lavrov and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem leaped at the concept and quickly announced that they would be in favor of it. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney cautioned, however, that it might be a 'stalling tactic.' Secretary of State John Kerry started the day's confusing series of events by suggesting that the U.s. would forgo an attack if Assad turned over his chemical weapons within a week . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (L)  and his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Mouallem (R) both said they would push for a proposal that would turn Syria's chemical weapons over to international forces that would destroy them, but Kerry later said the idea he floated wasn't a serious one . Despite Kerry's backpedal, Obama told Fox News that he would 'welcome the possibility of the development. We should explore and exhaust all avenues of diplomatic resolution to this.' Gwen Ifill of the PBS NewsHour and Savannah Guthrie of the NBC Nightly News both asked Presdient Obama what his wife thinks about attacking Syria. He replied that the first lady opposes the idea. 'My own family members ... they're very wary and suspicious,' the president said during his PBS interview. 'If you ask Michelle, ""Do we – do we want to be involved in another war?"" The answer is no,' he added on NBC. Most Americans share Michelle Obama's view, despite the White House's recent saber-rattling and the president's pursuit of congressional approval to attack Syria. The Pew Research Center reported Monday that 63 per cent of American adults think the U.S. should not strike the Assad regime. 'We are going to be immediately talking to the Russians and looking for some actual language they might be proposing,' Obama added. None of the three news anchors whose interviews aired first on Monday challenged the president with the fact that Kerry had later said that he wasn't presenting a serious proposal. Obama explained during his NBC News interview that Russia's willingness to help its ally Syria negotiate a handover of its chemical weapons was 'a potentially positive development,' but also said the Reagan-era maxim 'trust but verify' would apply. 'We don't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now,' he cautioned. And when PBS NewsHour host Gwen Ifill asked the president if he had broached the subject of a Russia-brokered deal with Syria, he said, 'I did have those conversations. And this is the continuation of conversations I've had with President Putin for quite some time.' While maintaining that Syria violated international norms and expressed a desire to see that 'the blatant use of chemical weapons that we saw' on August 21 in a Damascus suburb 'doesn't happen again.' 'If, in fact, there is a way to accomplish that diplomatically, that is overwhelmingly my preference,' he said firmly. By MailOnline's count, Fox's Chris Wallace was the first anchor to air an interview, beating the field by mere seconds in what turned out to be a race to see which program could capture its audience with the quickest Obama quote on Monday night . Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken (L) told reporters that his department wasn't aware of any proposal for Syria to give up its chemical weapons until Secretary of State John Kerry suggested it Monday, off-the-cuff, in London . 'And I have instructed John Kerry to . talk directly to the Russians and run this to ground. And if we can . exhaust these diplomatic efforts and come up with a formula that gives . the international community a verifiable, enforceable mechanism to deal . with these weapons on Syria, then I'm all for it.' 'But . we're going to have to see specifics,' the president cautioned. 'And I . think it is reasonable to assume that we would not be at this point if . there were not a credible military threat standing behind the norm . against the use of chemical weapons.' The president faces a steep uphill climb in Congress, with the Senate facing a filibuster possibility from the GOP's right wing and a rising tide of opposition in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. No fewer than 70 federal lawmakers made treks to the White House on Monday to hear the president's argument for why they should vote in favor of authorizing a military strike, if he should deem it necessary. But while Obama has asked both houses to endorse the proposal, he insisted on Fox that 'the American people are right not to want to have us entangled in a sectarian civil war inside of Syria.' Continuing to pursue the congressional war-powers resolution, Obama said, was primarily a tactical move at this point. 'I think it is important for us not to let the pedal off the metal when it comes to making sure they understand we mean what we say,' he said. Of all the major news networks. CBS was the only one that did not broadcast an interview during the dinner hour. Its coverage was pre-empted by the U.S. Open tennis men's final match.","'We will pursue this diplomatic track,' Obama told Fox News .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Americans are becoming increasingly alienated from the political system with most believing that the government can't do anything to improve their lives, a new study has revealed. In a survey conducted by EMC Research, two-thirds said they believe that they have no say in what happens in government with 73 per cent of those who responded saying they do not believe the government rules with the consent of the people. The research will come as a blow to the current government after another poll earlier this week rated President Barack Obama as the worst U.S. leader since World War Two. The research comes after a separate poll showed that voters believe that President Barack Obama is the worst U.S. leader since the Second World War . 69 per cent of American voters believe the country is on the wrong track . The new survey asked those taking part about their levels of trust in the government and how optimistic they were about the future of America. However, 69 per cent of respondents believed the country is on the 'wrong track' and remain negative about the direction of the country. In addition 71 per cent also responded saying that they believe future generations will not have a better standard of life than current Americans. And more worryingly the survey showed that 84 per cent of people felt alienated from the political system. More than 40 per cent of respondents also described themselves as sad about the state of America's political system and economy with a further 65 per cent believing that politicians are now lying more and undermining democracy. 71 per cent believe that future generations will not have a better standards of lives than them . Meanwhile 59 per cent say that America would be better off all together if all elected officials in Washington were removed in favour of ordinary citizens. This is supported by 92 per cent of people saying they prefer ordinary citizens rather than hand-picked elites running for office. The poll has been commissioned by Patrick Caddell, who with a team has launched the website We Need Smith, which describes itself as a new movement to support ordinary citizens to take on America's political elites. Involved in the launch is Bob Perkins, a former senior official with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who explained that today, July 4 was the best time to launch the campaign. He said: 'While the political elites have purposely divided our nation, the Fourth of July reminds us how we united to seize our own future from the British. 65 per cent of respondents said politicians are lying more and undermining democracy . 'Similarly, We Need Smith aims to unite, showing Americans that they aren’t alone in their frustrations.  No single issue has united all voters like this reform platform.' Earlier this week, a third of Americans singled-out Mr Obama as their least favourite president since 1945 in Quinnipiac University's latest presidential poll, just ahead of George W. Bush, who received 28 percent of the vote. His favorability ratings were underwater in nearly every issue area the poll asked voters about except the environment. The majority of people think the country would be better off if all elected officials in Washington were removed . The president scored below 50 percent on healthcare, the economy, terrorism and foreign policy. Voters go to the ballot box in four months to elect a new Congress. Generic congressional polls taken in the last several weeks put Democrats slightly ahead, but still within the margin of error. Republicans are likely to keep the House, but the Senate, which is currently controlled by the president's party, could go either way.","New research shows most Americans believe they have no say in what happens in government .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Jessica Jerreat . The last of the 29 Navajos whose tribal language was used to develop a code that stumped the Japanese during the Second World War has died aged 93. Chester Nez, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, died Wednesday morning of kidney failure, Judy Avila, who helped Nez write his memoirs, said. He was one of seven veterans honored for their bravery in November last year, when he was presented with the Audie Murphy Award for distinguished service. Hero: Chester Nez, who was one of the 29 members of the Navajo tribe who created a secret code, has died . Code: A two-man team of Navajo code talkers send orders over a radio during the Second World War . Before hundreds of men from the Navajo . Nation became Code Talkers, 29 Navajos were recruited to develop the . code based on their then-unwritten language. Nez was in 10th grade when he enlisted, . keeping his decision a secret from his family and lying about his age, . as did many others. The U.S. Marines used codetalkers in every Pacific assault from 1942 to 1945. The Native Americans used a code based on their language, which was never cracked by the Japanese. It was estimated that outside of tribes, fewer than 30 people understood the Najavo lanaguage during the Second World War. Native American language had also been used for code purposes in the First World War. The . code was made up of unrelated Najavo words that would be translated . into English. The first letter of the translated word would then be used . to build up the message. When . the Marines developed the code they had to create new words in the . language to incorporate military terms, including 'besh-lo' meaning iron . fish for submarine, and 'dah-he-tih-hi', which translates as humming . bird, for fighter planes. The . Windtalkers, as the Native American Marines became known, were . essential to the war effort, with Major Howard Connor, a 5th Marine . Division signal officer, saying: 'Were it not for the Navajos, the . Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.' Source: Naval History and Heritage . 'It's one of the greatest parts of history that we used our own native language during World War II,' Nez told The Associated Press in 2010. 'We're very proud of it.' Of the 250 Navajos who showed up at Fort Defiance, Arizona, - then a U.S. Army base - 29 were selected to join the first all-Native American unit of Marines. They were inducted in May 1942. Nez became part of the 382nd Platoon. Using Navajo words for red soil, war chief, clan, braided hair, beads, ant and hummingbird, for example, they came up with a glossary of more than 200 terms that later was expanded, and an alphabet. Nez has said he was concerned the code wouldn't work. At the time, few non-Navajos spoke the language. Even Navajos who did couldn't understand the code. It proved impenetrable. 'I was very proud to say that the Japanese did everything in their power to break that code but they never did,' he told Stars and Stripes last year. Having his language used as a code was a big step for Nez, who recalled how he and other Native American boys would have their mouths washed out with soap for speaking it at government boarding schools. When he was a child, the Navajo language was all Nez spoke, as he helped his family tend sheep on a reservation. He was eventually sent to a government-run boarding school that had been set up to assimilate Native Americans with mainstream culture, according to the Washington Times. Proud: Nez, pictured during a signing for Navajo Weapon, was pleased that the Japanese were never able to break their code . Honor: Marine Code Talkers were presented with a Congressional Medal of Honor in 2001 . Secret weapon: The Navajo language made the perfect basis for a code because so few people knew it. Pictured are two Code Talkers in Papua New Guinea in 1943 . The Navajos trained in radio . communications for the war effort were walking copies of the code. Each message read aloud . by a Code Talker was immediately destroyed. 'The Japanese did everything in their power to break the code but they never did,' Nez said in 2010. After the war Nez volunteered to serve two more years during the Korean War. He retired in 1974 after a 25-year career as a painter at the Veterans hospital in Albuquerque. Nez was eager to tell his family about his role as a Code Talker, Avila said, but he couldn't. Their mission wasn't declassified until 1968. The accolades came much later. The Code Talkers are now widely celebrated. The original group received Congressional Gold Medals in 2001, and a movie - WIndtalkers - which was based on the unit was released the following year. War hero: Chester Nez helped develop the code from his tribal language . Vital: The work of the Native American codetalkers was celebrated in the 2002 film Windtalkers, above . They have appeared on television and in parades, and routinely are asked to speak to veterans groups and students. Nez . threw the opening pitch at a 2004 Major League Baseball game and . offered a blessing for the presidential campaign of John Kerry. In . 2012, he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas, . where he abandoned his studies in fine arts after money from his GI Bill . ran out. Despite having both legs partially amputated, confining him to a wheelchair, Avila said Nez loved to travel and tell his story. 'He always wanted to go, he loved meeting people,' she said. 'And with something like kidney failure, it comes really gradually. At the end, he was really tired.' Funeral arrangements are pending.","Chester Nez was part of the original team who created unbreakable code .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Incredible pictures show the dramatic moment rescuers met a deputy sheriff off who spent 45-minutes bravely battling choppy seas to keep a teenage surfer's head above water and pulled the two to safety. Deputy Terry Brown kept the 14-year-old boy identified only as Joshua afloat off Southern Oregon's coast after he got caught in a rip current on Monday and the two are now recovering from hypothermia at Sutter Coast Hospital. The teen was in only around three-feet of water at Harris Beach, north of Brookings when he got pulled out by the current and was kept alive for nearly an hour by Brown until help arrived. Near the point of exhaustion: Rescue swimmers Logan Couch and John Ward (in helmets) keep 14-year-old Joshua Peterson and Deputy Terry Brown afloat in the ocean off Brookings' Harris Beach Monday . Relief: 14-year-old Joshua Peterson is helped ashore while other rescuers attend to Deputy Terry Brown, who was struggling to stay conscious . Brown was among the first responding to the 911 call from the panicked boys family and he immediately stripped to his uniform pants and T-shirt, put on an orange life vest and went after the boy. When he got to him, Bishop said Tuesday, the deputy had to let go of the rope he'd brought along so that he could keep the teenager from going under. 'Brown swam out to the boy, grabbed a hold of him and kept him afloat,' Ward said. 'They were not able to make it back in. He tried to calm the boy, telling him, 'Hey, we got help on the way.' said Curry County Sheriff Lt. John Ward to Oregon.Live. The deputy and the teenager were 100 to 200 yards offshore as the surf churned, swirling the two in a large circle and defeating attempts by vessels - from a kayak to a Coast Guard boat - to reach them or get ropes to them. Critical: Curry County Sheriff's deputy Terry Brown, spent 45 minutes battling 50-degree rough surf to keep a teenager's head above water was hypothermic and hospitalized in critical condition Monday June 3, 2014 . Recovering: Deputy Brown and Joshua in Sutter Coast Hospital, Oregon, after both undergoing treatment for Hypothermia . 'They were getting pulled underwater,' Ward said. 'Either the rope was disconnected or it came undone. The deputy was in pretty bad shape by that time. They had been in the water probably 30-35 minutes,' said Ward. Eventually, a rescue swimmer was able to tie ropes to them so they could be pulled ashore. Both were hypothermic, Bishop said, but Brown was in worse shape. 'He was within minutes,' said Bishop. 'If he had been in the water 5 or 10 minutes more, we would have lost him.' The deputy may be kept in the hospital a few more days so his lungs can be monitored for salt water damage, Bishop said. 'Deputy Brown is doing well,' Ward said Tuesday. 'He is still in the hospital. He has fluid on his lungs, but they got his core temperature back up and he will have a full recovery.'","Sheriff was responding to a 911 call at Harris Beach on Oregon's southern coast Monday evening .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . The defense attorney for a man charged with raping and strangling to death a University of New Hampshire student spent his first day cross-examining the state's star witness trying to convince jurors she was possessed by imaginary characters she had created. Defense attorney Joachim Barth also asserted the witness, 20-year-old Kathryn McDonough, changed her story and shifted the blame from herself to defendant Seth Mazzaglia, her ex-boyfriend, just to get a reduced sentence. Mazzaglia is charged with first-degree murder in the October 2012 strangulation death of 19-year-old Elizabeth ‘Lizzi’ Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say he and McDonough dumped Marriott's body in a river and it hasn't been recovered. Doesn't hear voices: Kathryn McDonough, 20, testified for a third day Thursday in the trial of Seth Mazzaglia, her 31-year-old ex-boyfriend who in 2012 prosecutors say strangled to death and raped a 19-year-old college student and co-worker of McDonough's who refused to have sex with Mazzaglia . Cross-examination: McDonough was grilled by the defense attorney for Mazzaglia over her recorded confessions that she has various personas in her own head who can take over and cause her to black out at times . McDonough, 20, testified Thursday the imaginary characters she began creating during childhood were to help her get through difficult situations after an horrific retelling of events the day before of the shocking circumstances that led to Marriott’s death. After being rebuffed twice by the 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student, Mazzaglia crept up behind her as she watched a movie with McDonough and quickly incapacitated her with a rope before raping her, McDonough told the court. Afterwards he ordered her to hold the white rope - which he and McDonough had used in their sex games - around the already-motionless girl's neck, she said, and she did as she was told. Barth opened his cross-examination reminding McDonough that she gave a statement to him and his investigators two days after Mazzaglia's arrest and told them Marriott died while McDonough was having sex with her with a restraint that kept Marriott from raising her head. McDonough told the defense team that Marriott had a seizure and died. McDonough agreed that was what she said at the time. 'I was trying to make it sound believable...I knew what happened to Lizzi': Defense attorney Joachim Barth exhaustively went over conversations involving McDonough and her friends, one of whom she told she was under the influence of one of her 'personas' during the murder and could not remember it . He blames her: Defendant Seth Mazzaglia listens to testimony by his former girlfriend McDonough as she claims he strangled to death and raped 19-year-old Lizzi Marriott. Mazzaglia claims McDonough committed the murder . Barth emphasized that she changed her story only after she was given an immunity deal ‘to reduce your years in prison.’ McDonough agreed with the timing. Barth spent several hours going over Facebook pages dating to 2011 and other conversations with Mazzaglia, 31, and others in which she talked of other characters or personas she had created. She testified repeatedly Thursday that they were ‘masks’ she would use when she wanted to be stronger. During questioning peppered by objections by prosecutors, Barth referenced conversation after conversation in which McDonough had talked about the personas, including a strong one dubbed Scarlet. Barth told jurors during his opening statement May 28 that McDonough had ‘a real problem. She had five voices in her head.’ And he told them McDonough was secretly recorded telling a friend that the night Marriott died one of the personas took control and McDonough blacked out. On cross-examination, McDonough disputed that her reference was to the night Marriott died. She said that she told Roberta Gerkin that the persona was taking over during that conversation and blocking her memory. ‘I was telling her Anay, or Charlotte, was blocking my memory of that night so I wouldn't have to tell her about it,’ McDonough said. 'I was trying to make it sound believable...I knew what happened to Lizzi that night. I was aware, but I did not want to tell Roberta.' She denied that Charlotte, who Mazzaglia referred to as Annay, interfered with her thinking or caused her to black out. Accused: Seth Mazzaglia, left, allegedly raped and killed Lizzi Marriott, right, when she rebuffed his advances . ‘She's just a character I came up with, not someone who can take over my mind or control me,’ McDonough said. Barth said she repeatedly referred to her characters in texts and Facebook conversations with Mazzaglia and battled her assertions that she didn't take them seriously. She said she invoked them because Mazzaglia took his own personas very seriously. ‘I was just a 17-year-old kid,’ she testified Thursday. ‘I had just met his person. When I mentioned it (a persona) he took it very seriously.’ McDonough testified Wednesday she lured Marriott, her co-worker, to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a video game. In reality, she testified, she was offering Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that McDonough had left him alone for 12 days.

She said she watched as . he did it . Breakdown: The judge called a break when McDonough's sobs became uncontrollable during the trial . But McDonough said Marriott twice refused sexual suggestions by Mazzaglia. ‘That's when he moved up behind her and he pulled the rope up over her head and he strangled her,’ she said. She said Mazzaglia raped Marriott while calling her names as her motionless body lay on the floor. On . Tuesday, McDonough testified how she had lured Marriott, her co-worker, . to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a . video game. In reality, McDonough testified, she . was offering Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that . McDonough had left him alone for 12 days. Mazzaglia sent her a text message at 10:26 p.m. asking, 'We painting tonight?' - a coded reference to having sex with Marriott. She replied: 'Your decision, I guess. If you have a plan. Nervous.' 'I didn't really know what he wanted to do,' McDonough testified. After a game of strip poker, Mazzaglia suggested to Marriott that she kiss McDonough. When . Marriott said no, saying she was in a committed relationship, he said . he wanted the college student to watch McDonough and Mazzaglia have sex. Marriott again refused. McDonough, . who previously told the jury about the couple's sadomasochistic . relationship, testified that Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to hearing 'no'. 'That's . when he moved up behind her and he pulled the rope up over her head and . he strangled her,' she said. 'She let out a quick noise and she sort of . stopped. Her arms curled up against her chest and her eyes were . closed.' McDonough said he . had brutally sodomized her a month earlier as 'punishment' for failing . to find him a sex 'slave' so she was willing to 'try and please him' however she could. 'I . think it would be fitting if the first thing you saw me do when you got . back is pleasure one of your friends until they died of orgasms and only . then turned my brutal attention to you,' Mazzaglia allegedly wrote in a . text message he sent to McDonough. On trial: Seth Mazzaglia is escorted out of the court room for a break on Wednesday after the testimony . She added that Mazzaglia wanted her to recruit Marriott as the slave because of her physique and personality, SeaCoastOnline reported. McDonough, 20, is the key witness against her ex and lawyers on both sides cast her differently. Prosecutors portray her as the sexual submissive, dominated in all aspects of their relationship by a man 10 years older than her, but Mazzaglia's lawyers say she was the dominatrix, a woman obsessed with finding another woman to dominate, and it was Mazzaglia who was her sexual slave. Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology. She was a commuter student, living with her aunt and uncle in Chester during the week and returning home to Westborough most weekends. Marriott had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts. On the night she died, Marriot text messaged Atwood minutes before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends. The text message was Marriott's last communication.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A 23-year-old who was friends with the brothers accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings last year has been accused of obstructing the investigation. Khairullozhon Matanov appeared in court on Friday just a few hours after he was arrested in his Quincy apartment. Matanov, who is accused of deleting information from his computer and lying to investigators, entered no plea when he appeared in federal court. Charges: Khairullozhon Matanov, second left, appears before a judge on Friday after being accused of obstructing the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings . The 23-year-old, who was made a legal resident of the U.S. because of unrest in his home country of Krygyzstan, is being held until a detention hearing due to take place Wednesday. According to U.S. attorney Carmen Ortiz's office, he allegedly destroyed, altered, and falsified records in a federal investigation, and made false statements. Among the information he deleted from his computer was references to videos and photos of the bombing suspects that were released by the FBI, a photo of the MIT police officer who authorities say the bombing suspects killed days after the attack, and files that contained violent content or calls to violence. Ortiz said in a news release that Matanov is not charged with participating in the bombings or knowing about them in advance, but a spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether additional charges were possible against him. Accusations: Matanov was friends with the brothers accused of carrying out the bombing, and allegedly had dinner with them after the attack . Connection: Brothers Tamerlan, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, knew Matanov . Matanov knew Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who authorities say planted two homemade bombs that killed three people and wounded more than 260 at the marathon finish line last year. He realized the FBI would want to talk with him because he shared their 'philosophical justification for violence', federal prosecutors said. When Matanov spoke to federal investigators, he quickly dropped the pretense that he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev had not seen each other much, but he continued to downplay their friendship, an indictment alleges. Matanov's lawyer, Edward Hayden, called the allegations unsubstantiated and said his client looked forward to contesting the charges. 'He had no intent to mislead the FBI, and from what I can see, what he said and did didn't impede the investigation,' Hayden said of his client. Hayden said Matanov came to the U.S. in 2010 on a student visa and attended college briefly. He was later granted political asylum because of unrest in Kyrgyzstan. He said Matanov left his parents and brothers behind and had no family in the U.S. 'He's very frightened - very frightened,' Hayden said, adding that Matanov spoke to investigators several times but never tried to slip away and was surprised when authorities arrived to arrest him. Matanov and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were friends who discussed religion and hiked up a mountain in New Hampshire in order to praise and emulate the training of the mujahedeen, the indictment said. Just 40 minutes after the bombing, Matanov called Tamerlan and invited him to dinner, prosecutors said. That night, the Tsarnaev brothers dined with Matanov. Afterwards, prosecutors said, Matanov told an unnamed witness that he could support the bombings for a 'just reason' - for example, if they were done in the name of Islam. 'In the days following the bombings, Matanov continued to express support for the bombings, although later that week he said that maybe the bombings were wrong,' the indictment said. Prosecutors said Matanov asked a friend to destroy his cellphones after the Tsarnaevs were identified as suspects, but that friend refused. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and is awaiting trial. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a gunbattle with police days after the bombings.","Khairullozhon Matanov is accused of removing video of Tsarnaev brothers from his computer .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . Western drought has left Lake Powell on Colorado River less than half full, with satellite images captured this month revealing the strained reservoir is sitting at just 42 percent capacity. According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) data, the lake, which sits on the border of Utah and Arizona and is crucial for both water and electricity, has been depleted by the drought, and is now not much more than a muddy river along an empty river bed. Some 20 million people drink water from the reservoir. In 2000, Lake Powell was at 94 percent of capacity, according to NASA's Earth Observatory, which released the image. Depleted: Lake Powell is a major reservoir on the Colorado River. According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Lake Powell is currently only at 42 percent of capacity as of May 20. This image was captured by a NASA satellite on May 12, 2014 . Lake Powell, the nation's second-largest manmade reservoir, was at only 42 percent capacity as of Tuesday . In 2000, Lake Powell was at 94 percent of capacity. Drought over the years in the southwestern U.S. has taken a toll on the huge reservoir . Lake Powell has slowly dried up over the years as a result of the drought. This image was taken in April 2010 . According to NASA Earth Observatory ""water levels are expected to rebound to about 51 percent of capacity by October 2014, the end of the water year . Lake Powell is a major vacation spot, with about two million people visiting each year . But 14 straight years of drought have done a number on Lake Powell's levels. Between now and then, all but three years have been years of drought. The reservoir will probably top out around 51 percent of capacity in 2014. Experts say the snow packs in the northern reaches of the Colorado River are above-average, and as the snow melts the water will run into the river. Lake levels are likely to drop even more over the next few years, perhaps reaching 3,536 feet (1,080 meters) above sea level, or 164 feet (50 m) feet lower than a full pool of 3,700 feet (1,128 m) above sea level. To get a sense of the amount of volume lost in that sort of drop, consider that Lake Powell covers 254 square miles (658 square kilometers). Before: In 2011, FOlsom Lake, northeast of Sacramento, California, was almost full, sitting at a capacity of 97 percent . After: The capacity of Folsom Lake in January was just 17 percent, a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago . As of May 21, Lake Powell was about 117 feet (36 m) below full pool, at 3,583 feet (1,092 m) above sea level. The effects of a half-full Lake Powell are varied. Glen Canyon National Recreation area, which encompasses the lake and much of its surroundings, is currently warning park visitors to take care using boat launch ramps into the park. Because the water levels are so low, water on the ramps is very shallow and leads to sudden drop-offs. But tourists may have reasons other than boating to come to the area. The lower-than-usual water levels have revealed spots flooded after the creation of the Glen Canyon Dam in the 1960s. Among these spots are the Cathedral in the Desert, a water-carved grotto partially exposed by low lake levels. Parched: Water levels for many of California's . major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is . mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought . of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977 . Parched: A warning buoy sits on the dry, cracked bed of Lake Mendocino . near Ukiah, Calif. The reservoir measured a capacity of about 37 percent earlier this year . Another beloved spot, Rock Creek Canyon, features an exposed arch that boaters can float beneath. The low water has also revealed bad news in the form of an extensive infestation of quagga mussels, an invasive species that multiply quickly, compete with native species for food and can clog water intake pipes. In February, National Park Service officials reported that dropping water levels had revealed more than 1,000 mussels attached to canyon walls, the Glen Canyon dam and other underwater structures.","Lake Powell, the nation's second-largest man-made reservoir, was at only 42 percent capacity as of Tuesday .

Conservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28,  is accused of taking a picture of Rose Cochran in her nursing home . Tea Party member Mark Mayfield and John Mary were allegedly planning to use the image of Rose Cochran in a ad claiming her senator husband was having an affair . School teacher Richard Sager was also arrested for his part in the plot . 'It's . an unfortunate, sort of bizarre incident, but it's being handled by the . authorities and I trust in their good judgment,' said Cochran, who has . been in Washington most of the week. He also . said: 'The nursing home people are worried, you know, about the impact . it might have on their reputation. But I think everybody is trying to do . the right thing.' The photo incident has . created turmoil during the final two weeks of a campaign in which a tea . party-backed candidate, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, is trying to defeat a . former Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who's been in . Washington more than 40 years. The primary is June 3. McDaniel . has said repeatedly that his campaign had nothing to do with the . photos. He called the violation of Rose Cochran's privacy 'reprehensible.' She has lived in St. Catherine's Village nursing home in Madison for the past 13 years.The couple have been married 50 years and have two children together. The . Cochran family says she has lost the ability to speak and is receiving . hospice care. Police investigator Vickie . Currie said in city court Thursday that when blogger Clayton Kelly . photographed Rose Cochran on Easter Sunday, it was his third attempt to . do so. Kelly told investigators that he photographed her through a door . that opened to a hallway, his attorney, Kevin Camp, told The Associated . Press. Cochran's campaign has started running a . TV ad that mentions the photo incident, shows Kelly's jail mug shot and . identifies Kelly as a McDaniel supporter. A narrator says: 'Rise up . and say `no' to dirty politics.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . Remorseless: Mark Sewell, 53, abused girls as young as 12 at his Jehovah's Witness church congregation in Barry near Cardiff, Wales, in a string of attacks that spanned eight years . A Jehovah’s Witness elder has been jailed for 14 years for sexually abusing girls as young as 12. Mark Sewell, 53, raped one woman in his congregation in Barry, near Cardiff, leaving her pregnant. He also molested one girl and abused two others in a string of attacks that spanned eight years. But when the victims reported him to the church, a committee cleared him of all allegations - and shredded the evidence. Finally, after 19 years, he has been found guilty of eight counts of sexual abuse. Judge Richard Twomlow told him: 'You were in a position of trust as a senior member of the church. 'Your victims felt inhibited about what they could say because of your position as an elder. 'You caused distress in the lives of your victims who had the feeling they were disbelieved. 'You have shown not a thread of remorse.' The jury heard how, between 1987 and 1995, he raped one woman, 'shredding' her underwear in an attack which left her pregnant. She later miscarried. One of his victims was just 12 when he kissed her on the lips and started giving her massages. Another girl was forced to take off her top while he massaged her, while a third was made to rub up against him. The jury heard he stripped to his underwear during one incident and bribed his victim with alcohol before molesting her. During a three-week trial at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court jurors heard how . Sewell would kiss the girl using his tongue and would pull her on top . of his body as he lay on the sofa of his £200,000 terraced house in Barry. After the teenager reported the sickening abuse she was forced to face Sewell at three meetings organised by the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Respect church elder Sewell branded her a liar and avoided being disciplined. His victims were banned from 'gossiping' about the attacks by other church elders. One . said: 'I just felt totally crushed. It was as if he had this power over . everyone and no-one could see the real him except for me.' Jehovah's Witnesses, a Christian denomination renowned for literal translation of the Bible. Rather than being led by a paid clergy, they have 'spiritually mature' men - 'elders' - who shepherd the congregation. Secrets: The respected church elder was let off the charges by his church when the victims originally brought forward allegations. The court heard Sewell's church also shredded the evidence and refused to help the trial . Sewell . was cleared of the complaints by a Jehovah’s Witness 'judicial . committee' after the women reported his behaviour to the church. But . a jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court found him guilty of a string of . attacks between 1987 and 1995. He was convicted of eight sexual offences . including one of rape. The . Jehovah’s Witness church provided nothing to help the police in their . investigation and allegedly shredded documents showing complaints about . Sewell. Prosecutor Sarah Waters said: 'Sewell is a . sexual predator that took opportunities available to him to satisfy his . sexual desires. Attacks: He would take his victims to his house in Barry, near Cardiff, Wales, strip naked and massage them . 'He used his high position in the Jehovah’s Witness congregation to act in a sexually inappropriate manner with women. 'He used his influence to perpetrate sexual abuse over a number of years for his own sexual gratification.' All Jehovah’s Witness congregation are registered charities.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A woman was horrified when she bit into a piece of newly-bought cheese - and a stranger's tooth fell out. Jane Betts, 42, had bought the Wensleydale Jervaulx Blueat from Sainsbury's last week for an after-dinner treat. But when she put a piece in her mouth, she bit on something hard, and a tooth fell to the floor. Horrified: Jane Betts, 42, was disgusted when she ate a piece of cheese, bit on something hard, and a tooth fell to the floor. The tooth (pictured right) has been verified as human by a dentist and is believed to be dental work . Alarmed, Mrs Betts first checked she had not lost one of her own teeth before realising she had been chewing on someone else's. She took the tooth to a dentist who confirmed it belonged to a human. Mrs Betts, from Cambridge, said: 'This was extremely disturbing and even more so as I had just been to the dentist myself the day before. 'Because of this I thought a piece of my own dental work had come off. 'I was completely disgusted to find that it was in fact someone else's. 'I was also very confused for several minutes as I searched my mouth and all my teeth looking for where the piece had come off. 'Now I just feel sick. Investigation: Mrs Betts had no more of the blue cheese that is now being examined by Cambridge City Council . 'It was a bizarre and truly horrible coincidence.' The . tooth - which is believed to be dental work - has been handed to the . environmental health team at Cambridge City Council for investigation.

"By . Daniel Bates . Cameron Diaz has railed against our obsession with youth and claimed women feel like they have ‘failed’ if they look old. The 41-year-old There’s Something About Mary star said that it is ‘crazy’ how women are under pressure to look like they are 25 even when they are more mature. She said that women ‘don’t give ourselves permission to age gracefully’ and that they are constantly told they have to ‘defy nature’. Scroll down for video . Her looks are the envy of thousands of women, and Cameron admits she feels pressure to remain looking young, saying she now regrets having had Botox . Diaz herself has in the past fallen victim to the guilt she describes and has had Botox which she regrets as it changed her face in a ‘weird way’. She had a nose job after breaking it four times and has spoken about her battle with acne, revealing that she tried everything from makeup to medication to make it go away. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Diaz became the latest Hollywood star in recent weeks to talk about the process of aging. Diaz said: ‘For me I feel like if I - it is almost as if we have failed if we don't remain 25 for the rest of our lives. ‘Like we are failures. It is a personal failure.

"By . Hugo Gye . and Will Stewart In Moscow . and Associated  Press Reporter . Edward Snowden has finally been allowed to leave the airport in Moscow where he has been living for over a month after he received a document granting him asylum in Russia for one year. The American fugitive wanted for leaking classified intelligence documents stepped out of Sheremetyevo airport this afternoon after weeks spent in legal limbo. His Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said: 'I have just handed him the documents from the Russian Federal Migration Service. They allow him to leave the airport.' Scroll down for video . Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena shows a temporary document to allow Edward Snowden to cross the border into Russia . AFP correspondant Maria Antonova tweeted this screen grab from Russian TV station Rossiya 24 showing what they report is the back of Edward Snowden's head as he leaves the Moscow airport . Russian police officers stand outside the embassy of Venezuela in Moscow, August 1, 2013. Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia have offered Snowden refuge but there are no direct commercial flights to Latin America and he was concerned the United States would intercept his flight to prevent him reaching his destination . He added: 'I have just seen him off. He has left for a secure location. Security is a very serious matter for him.' Out: Edward Snowden has left the Moscow airport where he had been living for the past month . Snowden . slipped out of the airport in a taxi without being spotted by the . dozens of reporters and photographers who have camped out in the airport . for weeks. 'He is the . most wanted man on planet Earth,' his lawyer said. 'What do you think he . is going to do? He has to think about his personal security. I cannot . tell you where he is going. 'I . put him in a taxi 15 to 20 minutes ago and gave him his certificate on . getting refugee status in the Russian Federation. He can live wherever . he wants in Russia. It's his personal choice.' The . refugee was accompanied by Sarah Harrison, a British representative of . WikiLeaks who has been staying with Snowden in the airport. The group tweeted: 'Edward Snowden has successfully acquired refugee status in Russia and will shortly leave the airport.' It added: 'We would like to thank the Russian people and all those others who have helped to protect Mr Snowden. We have won the battle - now the war.' The 30-year-old has apparently agreed not to disclose any more classified information as a condition of his remaining in Russia. Snowden faces living under strict . curbs imposed by the Russian security agencies even though he has been . allowed to move from his hideaway in an airport transit zone. Gone: Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena announced that his client had been granted asylum . Long stay: Snowden has been in legal limbo in the airport for more than a month since arriving in Hong Kong . He arrived at Sheremetyevo from Hong Kong on June 23 but was unable to leave because the U.S. had revoked his passport. The . runaway's movements will initially be strictly curtailed, but President . Vladimir Putin has denied his intelligence services are seeking secrets . known to the former contractor for the National Security Agency. The revelation will fuel U.S. concerns . that further sensitive data is in jeopardy and could fall into the hands of the Russian government. The White House has been ‘seeking clarity’ about Snowden's status. In the US, Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, has said Snowden is a 'fugitive who belongs in a United States courtroom' and said the episode damaged U.S.-Russian relations. 'Edward Snowden is a fugitive who belongs in a United States courtroom, not a free man deserving of asylum in Russia,' he said, according to the Guardian. 'Regardless of the fact that Russia is granting asylum for one year, this action is a setback to US-Russia relations. 'Edward Snowden will potentially do great damage to US national security interests and the information he is leaking could aid terrorists and others around the world who want to do real harm to our country. 'Russia must return Snowden to face trial at home.' Vladimir . Volokh, the head of the public council of the Russian Federal Migration . Service, insisted: ‘He will only be allowed to stay in places . designated by Russian law enforcement agencies.’ Kremlin . official Yuri Ushakov insisted today that the long-running saga would . not affect ties between the U.S. and Russia, saying Snowden's case was . 'relatively insignificant'. In demand: Kucherena said that Snowden had been inundated with job offers and attention from Russian women . Exit: Airport security staff secured an area yesterday in preparation for Snowden to leave the airport at last . He added: 'Our president has expressed hope many times that this will not affect the character of our relations.' Snowden has indicated he later hopes . to secure exile in South America with offers from Venezuela, Bolivia and . Nicaragua, but this week his lawyer said he might apply for Russian . citizenship. ‘Edward . also asked me to thank all the women in Russia for offering him to marry . them,’ added the lawyer. ‘He was in stitches of laughter when he heard . that there were a lot of such proposals. ‘I passed him some clothes. I noticed that each time we meet he wears one and the same shirt. ‘So . I went out and bought him some shirts and trousers so that he at least . could have a chance to change. There is no laundry or ironing service in . the conditions where he lives right now.’ Home: Snowden has been in Sheremetyevo Airport (pictured) since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23 . Dragging on: View of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, which Snowden called home for a month . He brought the fugitive classic Russian books by Anton Chekhov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. The novel is about the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of a poor ex-student who kills a pawnbroker for her cash, but Kucherena said: ‘I'm not implying he's going through a similar mental anguish.’ Russia has rejected White House calls for Snowden to be deported to the US to face espionage charges for leaking details of the NSA's wide-ranging spying activities targeting data and phone communication. Volokh confirmed Snowden would ‘not be extradited to any country where his life might be in danger, because he has applied for asylum here.’  Putin demanded that Snowden stops leaking secrets damaging to the U.S. while he is in Russia. May 20: Edward Snowden, 29, arrives in Hong Kong, just after taking leave from his National Security Agency contracting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. June 5: A British newspaper, the Guardian, reports that the NSA is collecting the telephone records of millions of American customers of Verizon under a secret court order. Security experts say the records of other phone companies are also involved. Subsequent stories by the Guardian and The Washington post contain further surveillance revelations. June 9: Snowden, who claims to have worked at the National Security Agency and the CIA, allows himself to be identified as the source of disclosures about the secret U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden tells the Guardian his 'sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.' June 10: Snowden checks out of his Hong Kong hotel, new whereabouts unknown. A day later, Booz Allen Hamilton says it has fired Snowden 'for violations of the firm's code of ethics and firm policy.' June 12: The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong says it interviewed Snowden at a secret location. 'I am not here to hide from justice. I am here to reveal criminality,' it quoted Snowden as saying. June 14: British government issues worldwide alert to airlines, urging them not to allow Snowden aboard flights to the United Kingdom. June 19: Iceland says a spokesman for secret-spilling organization WikiLeaks who claims to represent Snowden has contacted to government officials about a possible application for asylum. June 22: Unsealed criminal complaint shows the U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage and theft, and the National Security Council says U.S. officials have contacted authorities in Hong Kong for Snowden's extradition. June 23: Snowden leaves Hong Kong on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow. June 24: Snowden has a seat booked on an Aeroflot flight bound for Cuba, but is not seen on board. WikiLeaks officials say Snowden has applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries. June 25: Russian President Vladimir Putin says Snowden is in the transit zone of a Moscow airport and will not be extradited to the United States, adding that he is free to go anywhere. Without a U.S. passport, Snowden is effectively stranded. The White House says Russia has a 'clear legal basis' to expel the leaker. June 27: President Barack Obama says he won't engage in 'wheeling, dealing and trading' to get Snowden extradited to the U.S. July 1: Putin says Snowden will have to stop leaking U.S. secrets if he wants asylum in Russia - which he says is something Snowden doesn't want to do. July 2: Wikileaks says Snowden is seeking asylum in 19 more countries, including China, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and India. July 3: A plane carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales was rerouted to Austria after various European countries refused to let it cross their airspace because of suspicions that Snowden was on board. European nations later apologize. July 5: Wikileaks says Snowden has put in asylum applications to six new countries, which it does not identify. The next day, the presidents of Nicaragua, Venezuela and Bolivia say Snowden is welcome in their countries. July 12: Snowden meets activists and Russian officials, says he is willing to stop leaking secrets about U.S. surveillance programs if Russia will give him asylum until he can move on to Latin America. July 16: Snowden asks his lawyer to submit a request for temporary asylum in Russia, claiming he faces persecution from the U.S. government and could face torture or death. July 26: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder tells the Russian government that the U.S. will not seek the death penalty for Snowden.

"By . Daniel Bates . The AOL boss at the center of the ‘distressed baby’ row allegedly called another female employee who lost three of her unborn quadruplets an ‘HR nightmare’. Tim Armstrong was accused of firing Christina Elwell because she was unable to travel due to her troubled pregnancy. The fact that she lost three of her babies before giving birth to the fourth made little difference to his decision, it was claimed. The lawsuit was filed in 2005 and was . dismissed in 2008 after going through arbitration but sheds new light on . Armstrong’s recent comments. Past problems: Tim Armstrong was accused of forcing a sales executive out when she was suffering a terrible pregnancy with quadruplets when he worked for Google . Spotlight: Armstrong's views of women at work were put under scrutiny after he accused two mothers of 'distressed babies' of being to blame for cutting AOL 401(k) benefits. One was Deanna Fei. They had their daughter, pictured shortly after birth, in October 2012. She was four months premature . He was criticized after revealing that AOL had cut benefits to employees after having to pay out $1 million to care for what he called two ‘distressed babies’. Armstrong reversed the decision after a firestorm and because Deanna Fei, one of the mothers of the two children, wrote a scathing article in which she accused him of using her story as ‘an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting’. But this is not the first time he has been in trouble for his comments about female employees. Miss Elwell’s lawsuit dates back to the time before Mr Armstrong joined AOL, where he is currently chief executive. Before that he was Google’s vice president for national sales and was working out of their New York office, as was Miss Elwell. In her lawsuit she says that by 2003 she had risen to National Sales Director where she was  ‘highly successful and well regarded’ and was managing the company’s North America sales force. In February the next year she became pregnant with quadruplets and told Armstrong that this meant she could no longer travel. Miss Elwell then lost two of her babies, a tragedy she informed Mr Armstrong about. Nevertheless, the lawsuit claims, Miss Ewell claims that one day when she came in, he showed her a chart which revealed her job had been eliminated. He allegedly tried to move to her to another role that would have been a ‘significant demotion’ - and the reason was because she could not travel by air. Miss Elwell offered to take lesser role that would let her travel by train and car and Mr Armstrong is said to have accepted then allegedly ‘almost immediately’ changed his mind. At a meeting on June 4 2004 the lawsuit claims that Mr Armstrong ‘told her that she was an HR nightmare and that he no longer wanted her in the New York office’. Miss Elwell claimed that she was fired the next day over the phone by Mr Armstrong because he said it was the ‘right thing to do’. The lawsuit states that during this period Miss Elwell was ‘in danger of losing another of her unborn children’ - her husband had apparently contacted Google to tell them she was going through a ‘health crisis’. On June 29 2004 she then lost her third child. The reason for the child’s death is not explained in the lawsuit. After negotiations Miss Elwell returned to work the following month but Mr Armstrong allegedly said he felt ‘uncomfortable’ around her and asked that she work from home. Shocking: This gorgeous little girl was one of the 'distressed babies' AOL chief Tim Armstrong blamed for scaling back retirement savings plans . Shocked: New York couple Deanna Fei (left) and . Peter Goodman (right) are still in shock at the way Armstrong announced . AOL's pension policy changes . She was signed off work by her doctor due to her ‘high-risk pregnancy’ and claims that she was cheated out of money owed from sales commissions - her checks were ‘substantially less’ than they should have been, according to the lawsuit. Miss Elwell gave birth to her remaining child and towards the end of her maternity leave was looking forward to going back to work. But she was allegedly told she would have to take a ‘low level operations position’ which she found ‘intolerable’. In 2005 Miss Elwell was 'constructively dismissed' and filed a discrimination lawsuit with the backing of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Miss Elwell, 45, is now president of Manhattan-based CAC Media investing and Consulting, a marketing and advertising company. Reached by phone Miss Elwell said: ‘I’m so sorry, I can’t comment. Of course I have thoughts (about Armstrong) but I really can’t comment. ‘It’s behind me now’. AOL and Google have not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Google and Mr Armstrong were both named as defendants in the lawsuit. But at the time of the case Google said the claims were 'without merit' and vowed to fight the lawsuit 'vigorously'. Ironically AOL's conference which aims to 'reset the agenda for women in the workplace' begins today, with Mr Armstrong due to be one of the speakers.","AOL CEO Tim Armstrong blamed the costs of two women who incurred huge medical costs because of the care for their premature babies for the company cutting 401(k) benefits .

"By . David Wilkes . Packed up neatly, the Princess Mary gift boxes were all ready to be sent to the Tommies in the trenches 100 years ago. But the cardboard carton containing 80 embossed brass tins in packs of eight was never sent to the Western Front and they remained unopened – until now. Fittingly, the honour of snipping the string tied round the carton and opening the tins for the first time in a century fell to Lady Emma Kitchener, great-great-niece of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the then Secretary of State for War whose mustachioed face and pointing hand were made famous on Britain’s best known First World War recruitment poster. Family: The gift boxes, intended for the trenches were opened at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival in Whiltshire, by Lady Emma Kitchener, posing with a poster of her ancestor . His face gazed down from one of only four known surviving originals of that poster as Lady Kitchener – with her husband Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, by her side – literally lifted the lid on these  poignant pieces of history. Lady Kitchener agreed to open them at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival at an event staged by Onslows auctioneers. The carton was found in Ireland where it was part of a private collection of Great  War memorabilia. Princess Mary, daughter of King George V, started a Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund in November 1914 to give those wearing the King’s uniform and serving overseas on Christmas Day 1914 a ‘gift from the nation’. At the time, it was expected the war would be over by early 1915. History box: The 80 embossed Princess Mary brass tins were found to contain a pencil made from a .303 shell case and a printed note from Princess Mary . Previous examples of the tins have contained cigarettes, boiled sweets, chocolate and a pencil made from a .303 shell case along with a printed note reading: ‘With best wishes for a victorious New Year from the Princess Mary and friends at home.’ Those opened at the festival in Wiltshire on Saturday only contained the pen and note. Experts said other items would have been added later to suit individual  recipients – for example, non-smokers would get sweets rather than cigarettes. It is not known why the carton was never sent. After opening the boxes, Lady Kitchener, a former lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent, told the Mail: ‘It was really extraordinary – a really, really moving experience, and I was tremendously honoured, and humbled actually, at doing such a thing. ‘The smell as I opened them was a mixture of sawdust and damp … and funnily enough, Julian said, of his grandmother’s drawing room.’ She added: ‘It was perhaps the very first time the soldiers who received these boxes were away from home … to be in the trenches in all that discomfort and being so frightened, you can’t imagine what that was like. ‘So to get a little present like that from Princess Mary was thrilling and I’m sure unexpected as well.’ Patrick Bogue, of Onslows, said the boxes would be offered for sale for £300 each, with 10 per cent of proceeds going to military charities. Mr Bogue added that he had thought there were only three of the Kitchener recruitment posters – until Lady Kitchener remarked that she had one too..","Box of embossed Princess Mary brass tins for WWI soldiers uncovered .

"By . Daniel Bates . IF you want to know what to paint your house or how to dress next year, a leading colour forecaster has the answer: radiant orchid. Pantone said that in 2014 the dominant hue will be the shade of purple because it can ‘intrigue the eye and spark the imagination’. The company said that it drew you in with its ‘beguiling charm’ and that when worn by either men or women it was a ‘dazzling attention-getter’. Colour of the year: The purple-pink 'Raidant Orchid' is the one to go for to stay on trend in 2014, says Pantone . Radiant orchid has already been seen on the catwalks for the Spring 2014 shows and is expected to feature heavily in more collections next year. And since Pantone’s prediction is watched by everyone from designers to furniture makers, the chances are that you will be seeing a lot more of it in the months to come. Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Colour Institute, said: ‘Radiant orchid encourages expanded creativity and originality, which is increasingly valued in today’s society. ‘An enchanting harmony of fuchsia, purple and pink undertones, radiant orchid inspires confidence and emanates great joy, love and health.’ Pantone also praised radiant orchid for being versatile and said that it looks ‘seductive’ when paired with reds or purple and pink. In 2012, orange hue 'Tangerine Tango' was the one to paint with, according to the US colour company . In home furnishings, the colour is ‘bold without being overpowering’ and combines well with deep greens, though it matches especially well with turquoise, teal and light yellows. Pantone, which is based in the US and describes itself as the ‘global colour authority’, scours films, art, technology and other influences to make its selection. Last year the company said the colour of the year was emerald because it was ‘lively, radiant and lush’ - with no link at all to jealousy. Emerald also promotes balance and harmony and enhances our sense of well-being with its ‘elegance and beauty’. The award in 2012 went to ‘Tangerine Tango’, a bright shade of orange, which was chosen because it was ‘a bit exotic, but in a non-threatening way.’","'Radiant Orchid' is the colour of 2014, says Pantone .

"By . Daniel Bates . Mark Zuckerberg has said it drives him ‘crazy’ when people claim that he is just out to make money with Facebook’s new advertising blitz. The founder of the social network, who made $2.3bn last year from the company, said he just wants to connect people and not line his pockets. Mr Zuckerberg added that he gets angry when he reads news articles that say his ‘goal is to make a lot of money’. Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) has said it drives him 'crazy' when people claim that he is just out to make money with Facebook¿s new advertising blitz, despite making $2.3bn last year from the social network. Mr Zuckerberg claims he simply wants to connect people and not line his pocket . His claims will ring hollow to many users, not least as, according to an article in the Wall Street Journal, he personally approved adverts in the news feed. Facebook users now have to endure news feeds which are cluttered with posts by companies like McDonald’s even if they have not ‘liked’ them. Video adverts in the future could also start playing automatically, a move which many users believe is too intrusive. The increase in advertising is because Facebook is now a public company. The bottom line was brought into sharp focus by the bungled stock market floatation in May last year and the demands of shareholders, who want a profit on their investment. Facebook users now have to endure news feeds which are cluttered with posts by companies like McDonald's even if they have not 'liked' them. Video adverts in the future could also start playing automatically, in a move which many users believe is too intrusive . Mr Zuckerberg is, as a result, being forced to turn from hoodie-wearing computer hacker to corporate chief executive, even if it means angering some users. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, he said that he had a ‘continuous trajectory’ for the company and that it was not just about profit. He said: ‘It drives me crazy when people write stuff and assert that we're doing something because the goal is to make a lot of money’. Mr Zuckerberg added that it was ‘not like I just decided to get more involved in ads’ and that it was part of a long process. He said: ‘I needed to because basically the ad product had to be more integrated. And that created all these hard decisions that we needed to do well.’ Mr Zuckerberg’s change of mind happened just before Facebook went public in May last year - a bungled stock market launch which saw one quarter of its share price vanish in a day. Until then he had resisted the idea of adverts in the news feed but stunned his top engineers by suggesting they do it during a meeting. The increased advertising is because Facebook is now a public company. The bottom line was brought into sharp focus by the stock market floatation in May last year and the demands of shareholders, who want to make a profit. Here, a television presenter is pictured inside Nasdaq ahead of the company's IPO . One executive who was present said that they were astonished and thought to themselves: ‘Oh, my gosh, he's actually open to it’. The results have been dramatic and Facebook saw its sales jump 53 per cent to $1.81 billion in the second quarter of last year - the biggest increase it has ever seen. Mr Zuckerberg has accepted that some users will quit in exchange for more advertising revenue, the article claims. Internal assessments at Facebook showed that more adverts reduced user activity by two per cent although ‘engagement’ - a measure of user activity- rose. In July, Zuckerberg addressed all 5,000 Facebook employees and told them: ‘We did a good job. We’re figuring this out’. Facebook still faces long term difficulties, however. Research last month found that Facebook is ‘dead and buried’ to teenagers who are turning to Instagram and Snapchat instead. A University College London study found that young people were embarrassed by their parents being on the social network, so were quitting. Research last month found that Facebook is 'dead and buried' to teenagers who are turning to Instagram (pictured) and Snapchat instead. A University College London study found that young people were embarrassed by their parents being on the social network, so were quitting . Facebook is being sued over claims it has been scanning users’ private messages for personal information to sell to advertisers. The social networking site, is accused of monitoring messages and website links sent between users so they can profile what people read online. This in turn allows the website, which has 24million UK members, to charge more for the information. It is thought the information is particularly valuable because people are more likely to reveal their true interests in messages they think are private. The alleged breach of privacy has been exposed by internet experts, who examined whether messages that Facebook insists are private were actually being monitored. The claim relates to messages sent directly to a friend’s inbox, rather than posted on a profile wall, which can be seen publicly. Many people use private messages to send friends links to other websites, such as news articles, shopping sites or sports blogs. Facebook apparently tracked such messages so they could collect data on the interests of people who use the site. Advertising agencies and marketing companies are then allegedly sold this information so they can build up profiles of a person’s interests, and target them accordingly. If the linked webpage contains a ‘like’ button, Facebook will activate this so any company who has been ‘liked’ will see the person is interested in their products. Google, Yahoo! and LinkedIn are among six companies facing accusations of intercepting communications for profit. The allegations have been made in a US lawsuit taken out by Matthew Campbell, from Arkansas, and Michael Hurley, from Oregon.","Mark Zuckerberg admitted he gets angry when articles claim his ‘goal is to make a lot of money’

"By . David Wilkes . Swept off her feet: Cystic Fibrosis sufferer Iona Kesteven,17, with husband Laurie  on their wedding day . She was barely 16. He was 18 and about to go to university. And despite objections from their families, sweethearts Iona Lindley and Laurie Kesteven were determined to marry – while they still had time. For schoolgirl Iona has cystic fibrosis. The life-threatening genetic disorder often leaves her gasping for breath and some sufferers do not reach 30. She pleaded with her parents for permission, saying: ‘We’re in love, I don’t know how long I’ve got to live and I didn’t think I’d ever get the chance to marry.’ Laurie had to persuade his family that they were not too young and that, with the help of Iona’s mother, he could care for Iona while also finishing his studies. To the couple’s joy, both sets of relatives quickly overcame their reservations about the marriage. Dressed in white, Iona walked down the aisle at the South Parade Baptist Church in Headingley, Leeds, nervously clutching her bouquet over her face to hide her tears of joy from the 125 guests. At the reception, she and Laurie danced to a version of the Coldplay hit Fix You, sung by a friend. The new Mrs Kesteven and her husband then enjoyed a one-week honeymoon on the Greek island of Rhodes. It was the first time Iona had been abroad without her parents and needed meticulous planning to ensure she could take oxygen with her on the flight, in case she needed help with her breathing. Now they are planning their first anniversary celebrations and have decided to tell their story for the first time to help raise awareness of cystic fibrosis. The pair got to know each other after they began chatting on BlackBerry Messenger, and in March 2012 arranged to meet at a fast food restaurant. Iona was nervous about telling Laurie . about her condition, but after three weeks plucked up the courage. Permission: The schoolgirl had to plead with her parents Jole Iwanicki and David Lindley to be allowed to marry . Dressed in white, Iona walked down the aisle at the South Parade Baptist Church in Headingley, Leeds, nervously clutching her bouquet over her face to hide her tears of joy from the 125 guests . He . took it in his stride and they continued dating, often meeting in a park . near their homes in Leeds. She nervously told her mother Julie Iwanicki, 47, who is divorced from her father, that she had a boyfriend. Iona told Laurie how much she wanted to experience marriage in whatever time she had left. He understood and, just nine months after they met, he proposed. She accepted instantly and they married on May 17 last year. Born battler: Iona aged one . Iona, now 17, whose condition has deteriorated to the extent she gets exhausted going up stairs, said: ‘I knew I was in love. I felt so comfortable with Laurie. ‘It was really important to me to get married because I don’t know how long I have left. My mind does end up thinking about the future but I try not to let it worry me. I just wouldn’t enjoy my life.’ Laurie, now 19, is doing a degree in physical education and sports development at Leeds Trinity University and is considering a career as a paramedic. ‘There’s no point getting upset, you just have to enjoy life as it is,’ he said. ‘Everyone was shocked when we said we wanted to marry, but now they are supportive.’ Mrs Iwanicki said: ‘Iona has had a horrible life because of CF – she has suffered so much, missed most of the joy, freedom and spontaneity that kids have. ‘They wanted to spend the rest of their lives together, however long that may be. I think that’s beautiful, especially when you see how many other teenagers behave these days. I just want them to be happy while they can.’ Iona, who needs oxygen, an array of medications and frequent hospital visits, has continued to live at her family’s home, where her mother can provide the care she needs. Laurie often stays over but still has a room at his mother’s home. Despite her health, Iona is taking A-levels in photography and art and also attends dance classes.‘I feel like normal when I’m dancing,’ she said. ‘I go blue in the face but I’m determined to do it.’ Cystic fibrosis is the UK’s most common life-threatening inherited disease. Each week five babies are born with it and it  affects around 7,500 Britons. Glands which produce mucus, saliva and intestinal fluids do not work properly, resulting in the lungs and digestive system becoming clogged with thick, sticky secretions – making it difficult for sufferers to breathe and digest food. There is no cure but medical advances have extended life expectancy. In the 1960s sufferers did not live beyond five years, but the average is now 41 years. For a baby to be born with cystic fibrosis, both parents must be carriers of the faulty gene responsible. However, carriers show no symptoms and most are unaware they could pass on the condition.","Leeds Schoolgirl Iona Lindley suffers from cystic fibrosis .

"By . David Wilkes . Pictured dancing naked around his office, this is the boss of fashion brand American Apparel who was sacked over alleged misconduct. Dov Charney founded the firm in 1989 but has been accused of sexual harassment by at least eight of his staff – and was kicked out of the company this week. The video of the businessman gyrating in the nude in front of two women emerged 24 hours after he was fired. Scroll down for video .

One of the . women off-camera is heard telling him to shake his ‘booty’, and he then . scuttles away with his hands covering his modesty. It was not clear last night when the video was taken or whether its discovery had contributed to him being fired. But . a former model for American Apparel has confirmed that the man in the . video is ‘100 per cent’ Charney. Ousted millionaire: Dov Charney, 45, has been fired as president and CEO of American Apparel for cause amid allegations of misconduct . Mad genius? Dov Charney, 45, a Canadian national, started American Apparel in 1991 as a humble wholesale T-shirt manufacturer . Another former staff member at the . fashion retailer claimed the women in the footage both worked for . American Apparel. Born in Montreal, Charney started American Apparel while he was still a student. The . business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, . including the US and the UK – but the brand has faced criticism for . using overtly sexual images in some of its advertisements.And . Charney, who once described himself as ‘a bit of a dirty guy’, has faced . repeated accusations of sexual misconduct from female employees. Big business: American Apparel currently employs 10,000 employees and operates 249 retail stores in 20 countries . Courting controversy: The retailer has repeatedly come under fire for using young models dressed in sexy clothes to promote the brand . In . one, former saleswoman Irene Morales claimed she was held as a sex slave . for eight months just after she turned 18, when she was forced to . perform sexual acts in Charney’s Manhattan apartment. In a separate . claim, Miss Morales and several other woman said they were forced to . pose nude in a series of pictures which later surfaced on the internet. All the cases have been either dismissed or settled, but the company . announced Charney’s departure on Wednesday. Explosive allegations: In 2011, Irene Morales (left) sued Dov Charney (right) accusing him of treated her as a 'sex slave' Weakened: Morales's claims were later  undermined by a trove of explicit pictures and messages she allegedly sent her boss . Legal victory: Two years ago, a New York judge tossed Morales' $260million lawsuit against Charney . Chairman Allan Mayer, who . has been on the board since the company went public in 2007, said: ‘We . take no joy in this, but the board felt it was the right thing to do. ‘Dov . Charney created American Apparel, but the company has grown much larger . than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are . still ahead.’ American Apparel’s share price rose by more than 20 . per cent after the announcement. But at 40p a share, the firm’s value . has dropped dramatically since 2008, when it could command more than £8 a . share. Master of his domain: Dov Charney, then-chairman and chief executive officer of American Apparel Inc., stands for a portrait in a company retail store in New York in 2010 . Unexpected dismissal: Charney reportedly did not see his termination coming and will fight to regain control of American Apparel . As a teen growing up in Montreal, Canada, Dov Charney was obsessed with American culture. He has described his early envy of the choice available in America as compared to Canada in terms of how many 'hundred' different breakfast cereals teenagers south of the border could have. He adored the simple fashions of classic, bargain brands such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and began importing them and selling them to classmates while in High School. His early entrepreneurial spirit is evidenced by his claims to have sold 10,000 t-shirts while still a student, buying and transporting his stock himself in a rented U-Haul truck. Charney launched American Apparel in 1991 with a $10,000 loan from his father while still attending Tufts University. The company was originally conceived as a wholesale business manufacturing basic T-shirts, allegedly inspired by Charney's ex-girlfriend. By 1997, the humble sewing operation cranking out T-shirts has grown significantly, moving first to Charleston, South Carolina, and then to its now famous seven-story 800,000-square-foot Los Angeles factory. In 2003, American Apparel expanded into the retail market, with stores popping up from coast to coast and beyond. American Apparel has built a large fan base thanks to its commitment to manufacturing all its clothing in the U.S. instead of outsourcing the work to other countries. The company also prides itself on paying employees fair wages and providing health insurance, which is uncommon in the garment industry. Charney claimed to have the 'highest earning apparel workers in the world.' By 2005, Charney was looking at over $200million in annual revenue and in 2014, he had more than 260 stores worldwide, with revenue in excess of $500million. A year later, the prosperous business was sold for more than $380million to Endeavor Acquisition Corporation, but Dov Charney stayed on as president and CEO. Beginning in early 2000s, the fashion mogul has faced accusations of sexual misconduct, with as many as nine former employees suing Charney for alleged harassment. However, all the cases have been either dismissed or settled out of court. In 2009, things took a turn for the worse for American Apparel when the company found itself teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, which was narrowly avoided thanks to an $80million loan. Six months later, American Apparel was forced to fire 1,800 workers after federal agents raided its factory and discovered that many employees were in the U.S. illegally. The once-thriving retailer continued struggling, and three years after American Apparel went public the New York Stock Exchange threatened to remove its listing because of delayed quarterly filings. In a bid to turn the company around, Dov Charney went on the offensive, closing several dozen stores, focusing on efficiency and harnessing the power of Groupon to sell clothes at a discount. The past two years have been a roller coaster ride for American Apparel, with strong quarters followed by losses and more bankruptcy talk. With Dov Charney’s firing, the company is once again looking at an uncertain future.                                                                                                                         Source: Business Insider .","Video posted two months ago on Vidd.me titled 'Dov Charney dancing for employees...' shows the ousted CEO gyrating in the buff .

"By . David Wilkes . Just days ago Stephen Sutton bravely told the world he was on the brink of death, and thanked well-wishers for helping him raise more than £1million for charity. But the teenage cancer patient’s achievement was only the beginning. He has sparked one of the most extraordinary fundraising drives the country has ever seen. In the four days since he posted his heartbreaking message on Tuesday donations have poured in at an astonishing rate of more than £400,000 a day. Scroll down for video . Thrillseeker: Stephen made a bucket list when he was diagnosed aged 15, but now believes he has days to live . Stephen said last night: 'The tumours in my body are still rife, but I feel so lucky to just still be here' Stephen Sutton, 19, has raised more than £2million since posting this 'thumbs up' from his hospital bed . On Wednesday Stephen’s plight had prompted donations of £1.4million – an amazing achievement considering the former school athlete had set out to raise a modest £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust charity. Last night the total had soared to just under £2.5m with contributions from more than 96,000 supporters. It prompted Stephen, 19, to gather the strength to write a Facebook message from his hospital bed to thank his supporters. He said: ‘Hi guys, it’s Stephen here again, and it feels so good to be able to put that. Currently I am feeling well and would describe my current situation as stable. Wide attention: The teenager gave a speech at 10 Downing Street last year before his illness worsened . ‘Different people will put my recent physical improvement down to different reasons; I don’t want to over dramatise things too much, but I do just want to mention that everyone’s positive thoughts and support has been hugely appreciated, so thank you for that. ‘The tumours in my body are still rife and dangerous, but I feel so lucky to just still be here, and in fact I feel completely privileged to be in this position where I can help make such a difference to other people’s lives. ‘The main thing I’ve always felt passionately about is helping others... I’ve always been a firm believer that people are “good”, and to see people come together for the cause recently in the way they have is incredibly touching and heartwarming. ‘Thank you from me, and also thank you from every young cancer patient in the future who will benefit invaluably from the money raised!’ He added: ‘I always describe my cancer as a huge kick up the backside that taught me a lot of good: the importance of helping others, of making every second count, of making sure life is for LIVING, amongst other things.’ Stephen, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer when he was 15. After he realised he did not have long to live, he set himself a ‘bucket list’ of 46 challenges to tick off in his final days, including a charity skydive, quizzes, a football match and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd. Stephen managed to tick off  33 goals, the first of which was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. But his plight so captured the hearts of those who followed his Facebook, Twitter and other internet updates that he used the growing goodwill to continue fundraising. Living life to the full: The teenager crowd-surfing at the Slam Dunk Festival in Wolverhampton . Smiling: Stephen hugging a three and a half tonne elephant at West Midlands Safari Park last year . Stephen’s ever-increasing fund is the single largest donation  the Teenage Cancer Trust has ever received. Siobhan Dunn, the charity’s chief executive, said: ‘I’ve had the privilege of meeting him and his positivity is always remembered by all who meet him or hear him speak. ‘Stephen is making the biggest possible difference to Teenage Cancer Trust and the young people who need our help.’ In a post on Thursday Stephen revealed how he had bounced back after suffering a collapsed lung, adding with characteristic fearlessness: ‘In all honesty I was probably not too far from nearly leaving you all.’ He said: ‘One doctor while seeing me even said how my   medical notes and how I was actually doing didn’t quite seem to match up. Fundraiser: Stephen organised a World Record Attempt for the world's longest continuous group drum roll . ‘The progress since has continued to be good but steady.

"By . David Wilkes . He intended his mini VW camper van to be an eye-catching way to raise money for charity. But when Rio Beardmore took the vehicle for a spin one Friday night, he attracted attention from the police instead. The 43-year-old attempted to drive the van, which has a top speed of 6mph, the half mile to his home from a local pub. 'I thought they were joking': Rio Beardmore, 43, in the hand built miniature electric VW camper he was driving when police pulled him over. Magistrates banned him from driving for a year and fined him £500 . But after a few drinks – two pints of lager and six shots of spirits – the sight of him at the wheel did not go down well with officers. Mr Beardmore was stopped, breathalysed and found to be nearly three times over the drink-driving limit. Mr Beardmore said: ‘I didn’t know I was doing anything wrong or breaking any rules by driving it. When the police pulled me in I thought they were joking. I couldn’t believe what was happening. ‘I admit I’d had a few drinks before driving it home but it wasn’t as if I was rolling drunk or anything. The last ever delivery of brand new . Volkswagen campervans has arrived in Britain, heralding the end of an . era for the iconic 'hippy bus'. Ninety-nine . of the final batch of vans rolled off the production line and onto a . container ship bound for Britain after manufacture ceased for good in . Brazil in December. The . consignment has just arrived at the only British importer, but already . most of them have been snapped up by enthusiasts more than happy to pay . the £35,000 starting price. They are the last brand new campers in all of Europe. ‘I really didn’t think it would be a . problem as the camper van doesn’t need road tax or anything like that. It’s a toy car as far as I’m concerned. I found the sentence rather . harsh.’ The . self-employed locksmith from Stoke-on-Trent said he was found to have 92 . microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit . is 35. The blue and white van, which took seven months to build, was originally made for Mr Beardmore’s son Daniel, 16, who is a camper van enthusiast and visits VW shows with his father. ‘About halfway through the build, we were road-testing it and a couple of people said why not use it to raise money, so we did,’ said Mr Beardmore. The van cost about £1,200 to construct and has an electric motor from a mobility scooter and fibre glass bodywork. He bought the bodywork, already designed to look like a VW camper, on the internet. Mr Beardmore pleaded guilty at Newcastle-under-Lyme Magistrates’ Court to a charge of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while being unfit to drive through alcohol. ‘I raised about £40 for the cancer charity [Macmillan Cancer Support] the night I was breathalysed,’ he said. ‘People would just come up and ask to take a photograph and then make a donation.’ Due to the ban, Mr Beardmore now has to employ a driver to travel to his customers’ addresses.

"By . Suzannah Hills . and David Wilkes . Pay back: Chef Jim Knight, pictured, hijacked the Plough Inn pub's Twitter account after he was fired for requesting time off over Christmas . Fired from the village pub after asking for Christmas Day off, chef Jim Knight had the perfect recipe for revenge. The new father took to The Plough’s Twitter account to share his feelings with the world – and claim the pub bought supermarket meat which it passed off as high-quality cuts. The 28-year-old first posted: ‘We’d like to inform you that we’ve just fired our head chef’, swiftly followed by: ‘Unfortunately he wanted to have a weekend off this month and Christmas Day this year for family commitments so we thought we’d sack him.’ He then tweeted in quick succession: ‘Yeah a week before Christmas!’, ‘We don’t care that he has a 7 1/2 month old baby daughter’ and then: ‘So anyway come on down and continue to pay a premium for Australian sirloins, New Zealand lamb and everything else that is bought from Asda.’ Mr Knight, who has a daughter called Daisy with partner Louise Thompson, 24, had worked at the community-owned pub in Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, for three months. He posted the messages to the pub's 2,200 followers, and they were quickly retweeted by hundreds of Twitter users in a matter of hours. On . his own Twitter account, Mr Knight explained his actions, writing: . 'It's my daughters first Christmas. I wouldn't miss that for ANYTHING.' The . chef, who has written pieces for the Telegraph, then added that he . didn't hack into the pub's Twitter account as he was the one who set it . up. Mr . Knight wrote: 'I would like to make it CRYSTAL CLEAR I have not . ""hacked"" any account. I created the account with permission of my . ex-employers.

Steve Potts yesterday confirmed that Mr Knight was sacked for refusing . to work on Christmas Day and on Sundays in the near future.

I had been . quite clear with him when he started here that Sundays are our busiest . days of the week and that all our chefs have to work that day.’ Roasting: The new father took to The Plough¿s Twitter account to share his feelings with the world ¿ and claim the pub bought supermarket meat which it passed off as high-quality cuts . He . also vehemently denied the claim that the pub’s produce is bought from . supermarkets, saying it is fresh and comes from high-end suppliers and . local farmers. 'Our . suppliers are transparent: our meat is fresh, never frozen, and comes . from Booker’s in High Wycombe and from a local farmer called Peter Vogt, . ' he said. 'Certain . staples of fish come from our nearest supermarket, which is Asda, but . the implied suggestion that we are buying cheap meat and passing it off . at a premium is, frankly, outrageous and untrue.' He added that The Plough employs three . other chefs, all of whom are remaining in their post to ensure a full . service over the Christmas period. But Mr Potts admitted he is now recruiting another head chef. At work: Mr Knight, 28, pictured in his work clothes, said he has already been offered a new job . He . continued: 'I’ve been in this business 25 years and have a lot of . contacts who have been asking me on an ongoing basis if there is a . position available, as this is a fantastic pub to work for.

Mr Knight posted yesterday: ‘I have very kindly been offered a serious job offer directly off the back of this Twitter storm.’ Mr Knight also wrote on his Twitter account that a 'reply statement was inevitable' and he stands by his comments.

"By . David Wilkes . A retired GP told last night how his wife died in a swollen waterfall as he tried desperately to save her. Malcolm Jones was walking with Sue, 60, at a beauty spot near their home in the Lake District when she slipped and fell in. He followed her into the water but the torrent prevented him from reaching her and she was washed down a series of fast-flowing falls and out of his sight. Tragic: Sue and Malcolm Jones, of Satterthwaite, Cumbria, above, were out walking at Force Forge when the mother-of-two slipped into a powerful waterfall and fell to her death . Mother-of-two Sue, 60, was a popular member of the community in Satterthwaite, Cumbria. Several people have sent cards and flowers to Dr Jones and the village church is flying its flag at half mast out of respect . ‘At one point I could see her but I . could not get to her because she was trapped between rocks,’ he said. ‘When I finally got to her I knew it was too late. ‘I managed to drag her on to the bank and then I crawled up on to the main road for help. It was freezing cold.’ Police . said a passer-by raised the alarm at 10.45am on Saturday and fire and . ambulance crews were at the scene at Force Beck, Force Forge, near . Coniston, by 11am. The . mother of two was flown by air ambulance to the Royal Lancaster . Infirmary, where she was later pronounced dead. Police are not treating . the incident as suspicious. Dr Jones, 61, and his wife of 36 years moved . to the old vicarage in the village of Satterthwaite, Cumbria, close to . the scene of the tragedy, two years ago after enjoying many holidays in . the area for more than a decade. They previously owned a holiday cottage in Satterthwaite and lived in Thame, Oxfordshire. Since . making the permanent move north, they had spent their time renovating . their new home. Dr Jones said: ‘We have always travelled to the Lakes . and we knew that we would eventually want to move here. ‘This . was the house my wife had always had her eye on and so when it came on . the market we decided to take the opportunity to move here. It is a . beautiful place to live, and Sue loved everything about it.’ The . couple’s daughter Emma, 29, and her partner Simon Cole, took over the . village’s Eagles Head pub in November, with all the family becoming . popular members of the community. A devoted housewife and enthusiastic cook, Mrs Jones also helped out in the pub.

"By . Steph Cockroft . The Archbishop of Canterbury is due to withdraw his membership at one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs after it decided not to allow women to join. Justin Welby's decision to quit the Travellers Club in Pall Mall comes just days after the Church of England voted in favour of women becoming bishops. Earlier this year, 60 per cent of members rejected a move to allow women to join the gentlemen's club. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is due to resign from the exclusive gentlemen's Travellers Club in Pall Mall, which does not allow women to join as members . According to the Independent, a Lambeth Palace spokesman confirmed Mr Welby - who she said would have voted for the inclusion of women - intended to resign. She told the . paper: 'He can’t remember the vote, which is usually done via correspondence, but would have voted for the inclusion of women.' The club - whose patron is the Duke of Edinburgh - was founded in 1819 for . gentlemen who travelled 500 miles out of Britain. It has many foreign . ambassadors and high commissioners in London among its members. The Archbishop reportedly used the club as a base when he was Bishop of Durham and Dean of Liverpool. The club on Pall Mall, London, of which the Duke of Edinburgh is patron, rejected plans earlier this year to welcome women as members . Women are currently allowed in the club as guests but remain banned from the smoking room and cocktail bar, which are reserved for members and their male guests. The survey which asked members to vote on further inclusion was carried out by club chairman Anthony Layden, a former UK ambassador to Morocco and Libya. After it was rejected, Mr Layden concluded that 'no further steps should be taken . towards admitting lady members for the time being'. Speaking of Mr Welby's resignation, Hilary Cotton, from the organisation Women and the Church, added: 'It sounds like he has made a sensible decision here. It is mainly thanks to him that we will finally have women bishops.' The Lambeth Palace spokesman said Mr Welby hardly used the club as he now has accommodation in London.","Justin Welby will resign membership from Travellers Club, Pall Mall, London .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Allison Baden-Clay was murdered by her husband Gerard at their home in Brisbane, Australia . The great-grandson of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the world-wide Scout Movement, was yesterday sentenced to life in jail for murdering his former beauty queen wife. Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, killed his wife Allison at their home in Brisbane, Australia, during an argument before dumping her body beside a river several miles away. Mrs Baden-Clay’s family, who were seated in the crowded public gallery, cheered when the jury said they found her husband guilty at the end of the high-profile six-week trial. He will serve 15 years in jail before he is eligible for parole. The court had heard that Baden-Clay had multiple pressures weighing down on him on the night his wife disappeared in April 2012, among them the fact that he was having an affair and his Brisbane real estate business was in debt. Crown Prosecutor Todd Fuller, QC, told the court that Baden-Clay had ‘efficiently and effectively’ killed his wife, probably by smothering her, as she fought for her life at their home. During the struggle, he said Mrs Baden-Clay scratched her husband’s face as she tried to fight him off. ‘They are fingernail marks, they are on his face, they occurred after his children went to sleep and before his children got up,’ said the prosecutor. ‘There was a struggle between the two of them and she left her mark upon him. Gerard Baden-Clay, pictured here giggling on camera and saying 'everything is going to be all right', has been jailed for life with a non-parole period of 15 years . ‘They are damning and link to the act of violence without any doubt.’ After . killing his wife, the court heard, Baden-Clay dragged her body across . the back patio, where leaves unique to the property became entangled in . her hair and clothing. He . then drove with the body to a bridge nearly eight miles away away and . dragged his wife down an embankment where he left her. It was 11 days . before her body was found. In an exclusive interview set to air on 60 Minutes in Australia this Sunday night, . Gerard Baden-Clay's mistress Toni McHugh tells of his promise to marry . him . The preview of the full interview also includes a testimony from a witness who did not appear before the court claims Gerard called her looking for someone to kill his wife . During . the trial it was heard that Baden-Clay had had a long-running affair as . well as trysts with other women throughout his 14-year marriage. He . told his current lover, Toni McHugh, in an email that he loved her . unconditionally and would be out of his marriage by the start of July . 2012. In . his defence, Baden-Clay insisted he did not kill his wife and said the . scratch marks on his face were not from his wife’s fingernails but were . the result of cutting himself while shaving. Parents of Alison Baden-Clay, Geoff and Priscilla Dickie (centre) and her close friend Kerry Anne Walker leave the court following the verdict - all wearing yellow in tribute to Allison's favourite colour . Allison's mother said her family had been sentenced to a lifetime of grief . Supporters of Allison placed yellow balloons outside the Brisbane Supreme Court. Yellow was her favourite colour . A . profile about Mr Baden-Clay on a Brisbane real estate web page had . stated before it was removed: . ‘His personal philosophies of ethical . excellence and team loyalty, derived from his lineage as the . great-grandson of international Scouts founder Englishman Baden Powell, . have clearly found their perfect landing spot in the field of real . estate.’ Ms McHugh has given an interview which will screen on 60 minutes on Sunday night detailing her affair with Baden-Clay. Yellow for Allison: Inside the courtroom Gerard Baden-Clay wore a yellow tie . A spokeswoman for the family said the family were relieved but said of the result: 'This is not a win' Gerard Baden-Clay's mother Elaine, pictured outside court with his father Nigel, wept as she left court after the guilty verdict was announced . Allison's body was found dumped near a creek in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012 . 'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future,' she told reported Tara Brown. 'He had told me that he would marry me one day.' Ms McHugh said she loved the convicted murderer 'very much' and wanted to be Mrs Baden-Clay. 'I don't like to use that word ""unconditional"" anymore but I did love him unconditionally. 'And I was very forgiving, too forgiving.' Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay took his wife's body and dumped it at a nearby creek, and then put in place, and persisted in, a deception plan . Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face . Allison's parents read out emotional impact statements in court, reflecting on the difficult road ahead for their three granddaughters . Allison's close friend Kerry Anne Walker said the priority now was Allison's three daughters . The three-and-a-half year affair between Baden-Clay and Ms McHugh commenced in August 2008. During . the trial, the court heard evidence that Gerard Baden-Clay attended . corporate functions and night time events connected with his real estate . business in the company of mistress Toni McHugh rather than his wife . Allison. Ms McHugh also reveals the 'dark side of Baden-Clay' who . is described as a man who 'lost all concept of right and wrong', and . when pressed she admits she believes Baden-Clay did kill his wife. The . 60 Minutes piece will also include testimony from a witness the jury . never heard from, who claimed Baden-Clay called her and asked 'I'm . looking for someone to kill my wife.' Allison's supporters spoke outside court of their relief, but said the day was not a win and that their primary concern was for the welfare of the three Baden-Clay children . We finally have justice for Allison. The evidence presented at this trial has proven that Gerard Baden-Clay is responsible for the murder of his wife Allison. It has been a long wait over the last two years. And this result today marks the beginning of our long journey towards healing and finally allowing us to mourn and grieve this beautiful woman. Today is not a win for our family, for it will not bring our beautiful Allison back. However it is the closure in another chapter of our journey for this family. We have lost Allison and nothing that has happened here today will bring her back. We as a family will grieve her tragic death forever. Her memory is tarnished by the fact that she was taken from us in such horrific circumstances. We would like to sincerely thank the Queensland Police Service and the officers involved in the investigation, the SES volunteers who searched night and day in all weather, the scientific experts and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who have all worked tirelessly to ensure that we have justice for Allison. We would also like to thank them for their compassion and support over what has been the darkest of days. We have appreciated your efforts to protect the privacy of Allison's daughters. Our primary concern has always been and remains the physical and emotional wellbeing of Allison's three beautiful girls. We will help them to rebuild their lives and ask for your support, co-operation and privacy in order to do this. We have a long way to go to ensure that they will cope with a future without their mother. Allison was a kind-hearted, generous woman, a loving wife and devoted mother whose legacy will continue if we all remember that life is precious, and to take the time to be kind, smile at those who pass you by and live for today. We, her family and friends, didn't get a chance to say goodbye but Allison will always remain forever in our hearts. Thankyou. Baden-Clay wept as Allison's mother read her impact statement . Allison's father Geoffrey told the court he was 'devastated by the murder' of his 'precious, gifted and talented daughter' Allison's sister, Vanessa Fowler, says she feels 'cheated' that she never got to say goodbye on her terms .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Compensation: April Hall, 24, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had a normal pregnancy with her first child Ethan, carrying him to full-term - but he was born stillborn after an error by midwives . The mother of a baby boy who was delivered stillborn after midwives missed signs that his heart was beating too slowly has spoken of her heartbreak in the hope no other parent will go through the same ordeal. April Hall, 24, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had a normal pregnancy with her first child Ethan, carrying him to full-term. But during labour, two midwives at the Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to notice that her baby son had a fatal condition, bradycardia. It meant Ethan had an unusually slow heart rate and was delivered stillborn. Now the mother-of-two has been given an undisclosed amount of compensation by The Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after it made an admission of liability. Miss . Hall's lawyers started legal action against the trust alleging that, if . the condition had been detected, Ethan could have been given a quicker . delivery. The lawyers said it would have meant Ethan could have been resuscitated 15 minutes earlier, increasing his chance of survival. Miss Hall said: 'It breaks my heart to know that if . Ethan’s slow heart rate had been detected during my labour, the midwives . could have delivered him quickly and I would have him here with me now. 'I . have really struggled to come to terms with what happened and I hope . that through what happened with Ethan that all of the maternity staff at . the hospital have had additional training to ensure that lessons can be . learned.' Throughout her labour, Miss Hall was . monitored by a trainee midwife and a supervisor. But medical records . show Ethan’s heart rate was not taken after 10.45am, half an hour before . he was born. When Ethan was born, staff began to resuscitate him but he could not be saved. Miss Hall said: 'I had no problems throughout my pregnancy. 'Whilst I was at the hospital during labour, I felt that the midwives were not monitoring me and Ethan as they should have been doing, but I thought I have to put my trust in the hospital staff to take care of me and my baby. 'When I finally delivered Ethan, I immediately noticed he didn’t cry or make any sound at all. I kept asking the midwives what was wrong with him as they rubbed his chest to stimulate his breathing. 'Suddenly the crash team arrived and they tried to revive him in front of me and my dad. I was in pieces. I just wanted to be able to hold my newborn son. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Miss Hall had a normal pregnancy and carried her son full-term, but complication ensued during Ethan's labour at the Bradford Royal Infirmary. Her son is pictured in this scan image . 'Nothing could bring Ethan back or begin to make up for what happened but knowing that everything possible has been done to prevent another baby from dying might mean we can finally lay him to rest and try to begin the long process of rebuilding our lives.' After his death, Miss Hall continued to visit the hospital to see her son until he was taken for a post-mortem. She . took photographs with her son that she now treasures in a family photo album. The post mortem revealed her little boy’s heart . rate had slowed down half-an-hour before she gave birth. Miss Hall said: 'I had gone into labour the evening before and was pacing up and down at home. 'I . first went into hospital at 4am but was sent home because I wasn’t . dilated enough. I went back in at 6am and stayed there after progressing . further into labour.' She added: 'When . he was delivered, it was a odd because my baby wasn’t passed to me, he . was placed on the bed between my knees and the midwife walked out of the . room. 'At first I smiled and was happy to have a baby boy but I then I realised he was not breathing. I . started screaming that he wasn’t breathing and the trainee hit the . button to call for the crash team, who immediately rushed into the . room.' Miss Hall, 24, has been paid an undisclosed amount by the Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after her first child Ethan, with whom she is pictured, was delivered stillborn. She released this image of him . Miss Hall, who now has children Sapphire, two, and Dalton James, nine weeks, started legal action in an attempt to move on with her life. April’s lawyers at Irwin Mitchell took the case again the trust, alleging that staff failed to pick up Ethan's slow heart rate, a sign that the foetus is in distress and struggling. Lawyers suggested that, if the midwives had picked up Ethan’s slow heart rate, they would have performed an assisted delivery, meaning Ethan would have been born sooner. The lawyers added that the heart rate readings were taken by the trainee midwife and did not appear to have been checked by the supervising midwife. The final allegation was that the supervising midwife had not undergone the necessary training to supervise a trainee midwife . Margaret Ryan, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell’s Leeds office, said: 'This is a tragic case that has seen April absolutely devastated by the loss of her son Ethan and she understandably wants answers about what went wrong. 'April has found it incredibly hard to accept what happened and has needed extensive support to help her come to terms with her loss. 'What is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect basic signs which would have showed them things weren’t right and ultimately led to Ethan being stillborn. 'It is difficult for the family to come to terms with the fact his death could have been avoided. 'We welcome the fact the trust has admitted responsibility and we back April’s calls to see that the trust has made improvements to maternity services to protect patient safety. 'We have assisted her reporting the substandard care to the nursing and midwifery council and we hope that their investigation will highlight the hospitals failings and ensure appropriate measures are put in place to stop this happening again.' Miss Hall now hopes lessons will be learned from what happened to her. She said: 'I knew I was right. I knew something had gone wrong. But it . hurts because what I should have is a three-year-old boy with me today. 'But no matter what I do, nothing can ever get me that back.' According to the Bradford Telegraph and Argus, . the trust, which runs BRI, admitted 'on the balance of . probability' that Ethan's bradycardia was missed during the birth. Chief Nurse Juliette Greenwood, for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We would like to reiterate our sincere condolences to Ms Hall on the tragic loss of her son, Ethan. 'The Foundation Trust takes the safety of its patients very seriously and we launched an immediate and thorough investigation into Ethan’s stillbirth; a copy of which was shared with Ms Hall. 'Although staff did everything that was expected of them, in keeping with nationally accepted practice, we appreciate that this was a very sad and unexpected outcome for Ms Hall. 'All through this process we have openly answered any questions that Ms Hall asked in the wake of Ethan’s death and we have offered her our support to deal with her very sad bereavement.'","April Hall, 24, from Bradford, had normal pregnancy until labour in June 2011 .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A 20-year-old beauty queen who was kidnapped and sold to gypsies in exchange for a pair of gold earrings as a young child has been reunited with her family - sixteen years later. Olga Romanovich was just four years old when she cruelly snatched from . her mother Tamara by a group of gypsies. The group abducted the young girl after persuading her mother, who had moved from Belarus to Moldova after breaking up with her husband, to go into a shop and buy a packet of cigarettes. Olga Romanovich, 20, was abducted from her mother Tamara in Moldova when she was just four years old but has now been reunited with her birth family in Belarus 16 years on . The young girl was then sold on to another gypsy in the town of Soroki, near the Ukrainian border, in exchange for a pair of gold earrings. Now Miss Romanovich - whose name was changed to Maria Preyda by her adopted family - has been reunited with her birth family in Belarus after Interpol helped her track them down. The astonishing case will give hope to parents whose children have disappeared, while also raising concern about how many others might have been traded by gypsies. Speaking after the reunion, she told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'I was loved in that gypsy family, they raised me as well as they could. 'Even . more in fact. But that feeling comes when you realise that it's not . your life.  You're not one of them like everybody else. You're . different.' Miss Romanovich, who won a beauty contest before she returned to Belarus, said she was given a happy, normal childhood by her adopted family. She was mainly brought up by her adopted grandmother. Miss Romanovich was sold to gypsies in exchange for a pair of gold earrings when she was just four years old, pictured left, but went on to be 'loved' by the gypsy family and was raised as a 'normal kid', right . The 20-year-old . - who trained to be a chef and a hairdresser - is now living with her birth aunt and wants to start training to become a doctor . She told the paper: 'I got a new name - Maria, which I . could not get used to, because I was actually called Olga. 'And I had another surname - Preyda. My grandmother's son, Igor Preyda adopted me. My grandmother was a second mother to me. I grew up as a normal kid.' But she said there was always a part of her which felt 'tormented' about wanting to find her birth family. She said: 'Over time, I learned the gypsy language and gradually Moldovan. I went to a Russian langauge school, entered college, studied as a cook and hairdresser. 'Yes, you live by their customs, talking, behaving. But always I was asking one question: ""Who am I? Where I come from? How did I come here?"" Speaking after her reunion, Miss Romanovich, pictured here with her adopted family, said she was raised as well . as she could have been, but still  always wanted to know the truth about where she came from . 'These questions always tormented and tortured me. I wanted to know the truth. Who were my parents, even if they sold me. I would like to know who I am, what is the blood flowing in me. 'I never talked about it with anyone, it was all hidden inside me. All my life I wanted to know my parents and their relatives.' It was only when her grandmother fell ill before her death at age 73 that Miss Romanovich decided to track down her parents, spurred on by her grandmother. She said: 'She told me: ""Find your relatives! If I knew anything about your real mother, I would have told you"".' Before being reunited with her birth mother, who is ill, the 20-year-old took part in a beauty . contest in Moldova and won . The young woman used a psychologist to get in touch with police colonel Valery Rogozhine who contacted Interpol. Now DNA testing has proved that Maria Preyda is in fact Olga Romanovich. She is living with an aunt in Minsk and has been accepted back into her real family. Speaking about meeting her mother, she said: 'I cried. My mother is very ill. She doesn't live, she just exists. She lives in her own corner of the world, and I do not want to hurt her. 'I do not resent what happened. She also experienced a lot of things. I cannot judge her. She is not to blame for what happened, it was just fate.' The young woman is also looking forward to meeting her three blood brothers. After Miss Romanovich's kidnapping, her mother had three more children but eventually was unable to care for them. They . were adopted by a wealthy couple - who also demanded the police investigate Miss Romanovich's disappearance - . but no progress was made. At the time of her kidnapping, Miss . Romanovich's mother also reported her daughter . missing to police in Minsk, but there was no investigation. Romanovich said: 'I have been accepted back here very well.' She said she is determined to start studying to become a doctor.","Olga Romanovich, 20, abducted from destitute mother Tamara in Moldova .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Playing cards and draughts and doing crossword puzzles could help stave off Alzheimer's disease, scientists say. New research shows . brain-stimulating activities could help to preserve vulnerable . structures and cognitive functions in regions of the brain involved in the disease. Research suggests people who spend more time playing these games are also more likely to perform better in . learning, memory and information processing tests. Scientists say brain-stimulating activities, such as doing a crossword, could help to preserve vulnerable brain structures and cognitive functions in regions of the brain involved in Alzheimer's disease . But charity Alzheimer's Research UK said that the study - while 'useful for identifying factors that may influence our risk of memory decline' - does not confirm whether or not playing such games actively prevents the condition. As part of the study, scientists from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in the US performed a series of tests on 329 people with an average age of 60. Those taking part were healthy but deemed to be at a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease due to their genetic background or family history. As well as giving them brain scans, scientists also asked the participants how often they took part in activities such as reading books, going to museums and playing card games or doing . puzzles. The researchers, who presented their findings to the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen, . found those who reported playing games were more likely to have a greater brain . volume. They also scored higher on cognitive tests. The researchers concluded that, for some individuals, participating in such games could help prevent Alzheimer's disease. The researchers from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in the USafound those who reported playing games were more likely to have a greater brain volume and scored higher on cognitive tests, which could prevent the disease . Dr Laura Phipps, science communications manager at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'Observational studies like this are not able to pinpoint cause and effect, but they can be useful for identifying factors that may influence our risk of memory decline and dementia. 'Previous evidence has suggested that keeping the brain active may help boost 'cognitive reserve', allowing the brain to resist damage for longer, and this study adds to the ongoing 'use it or lose it' debate. 'It's important to note that the people in this study did not have dementia, and we can't say from these results that playing card games, reading books or doing crosswords will prevent the condition. 'The best evidence suggests that we can reduce our risk of dementia with a healthy lifestyle - eating a balanced, healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, and keeping blood pressure and weight in check.' Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society charity, added: 'This research shows an interesting association between the size of certain brain areas, memory performance and time spent challenging the brain with games and puzzles. 'However, it doesn't tell us that playing mind-stimulating games can cause positive changes in brain volume or memory- this needs to be tested in longer term studies or clinical trials. 'Although there is no harm in playing games and puzzles, research shows that the best steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing dementia is taking regular exercise, eating a healthy balanced diet, not smoking and keeping cholesterol and blood pressure under control.'","Brain-stimulating activities can preserve cognitive functions, scientists say .

"By . Steph Cockroft . and Jill Reilly . A bride and groom have been forced to cancel their wedding after a fire ripped through the 11th century church where they planned to marry - just two days before the ceremony. Alicia Hardy, 46, said it had been a 'no-brainer' to pick St Peter's Church in her home village of Ropley, near Winchester, as the place to marry her 45-year-old fiancé Darren Bunce. But now the solicitor fears she might have to get married 'in a field' after the historic church, which has stood at the centre of the village for 800 years, was destroyed by a 'catastrophic' fire. The historic church of St Peter's in Ropley, near Winchester in Hampshire, was partially destroyed by fire today. The fire broke out just after residents reported a power surge in their homes . Alicia Hardy, 46, who has lived in the village for 16 years, planned to . marry Darren Bunce, 45, in the church on Saturday but now say they might . have to get married in a field . The 14th century bell tower and the tiled roof were destroyed after flames ripped through the imposing Norman structure, just moments after nearby . residents reported power surges in their homes. Miss Hardy said: 'We’re all just so shocked. It’s a real tragedy for the village. The church is ancient and is in the centre of the village. 'We chose the church the day we got . engaged, on Christmas Day. It was a no-brainer. I don’t think we ever . thought of anywhere else. 'I’ve . lived here for 16 years and my fiance was born and raised in the area . and we have done family weddings, christenings and funerals at the . church.' But now the bride-to-be has begun sending messages and making phone calls, to spread the word about the change of plan to the couple's 132 guests. She was due to collect her . brother, who was flying in from Colorado, today while another brother was . expected in from Australia. The historic church, parts of which date back to the 11th century, has stood at the centre of the village for more than 800 years . Flames were seen coming out of the church's roof and during the worst . part of the fire, black smoke could be seen half a mile away on the A31 . Alresford bypass. She said: 'We’re meant to be having the . wedding rehearsal today. I haven’t spoken to the vicar as he’s . pretty preoccupied. 'We will get married somewhere on Saturday. That’s all I know. If . the worst comes to the worst we would just do everything but the . marriage, or get married somewhere in a field, and formalise the . marriage later. 'We haven’t got an alternative. We’ve just said it won’t be St Peter’s in Ropley. At least it’s not tomorrow or Saturday and nobody died. That’s one way to look at things.' Around 80 firefighters and 12 fire . engines were called to the medieval church in a bid to save it from . the blaze. Flames . were seen coming out the church’s roof and, during the worst part of the fire, black smoke could be seen half a mile away on the A31 Alresford bypass. 'We chose the church the day we got . engaged, on Christmas Day. It was a no-brainer. I don’t think we ever . thought of anywhere else' Miss Hardy said: 'I got a call at about 9.30am from somebody in the village, saying her husband had seen the church on fire. 'Then . I got a stream of texts and phone calls. I haven’t seen it myself. I . was just about to go up there. I’ve just seen pictures taken by someone . else.' Whatever they do, the couple say they will still go on a brief honeymoon to West Wittering, in West Sussex, for a few days. The . couple’s four children - Amy Webb, 20, Louise Hardy, 12, Ben Hardy, 15 and Kieran Webb, 23 - will be their . bridesmaids and ushers. But the fire has caused long-term devastation in the village. Reverend . Royston Such, who has been the vicar of St Peter’s for 24 years, said it was 'catastrophic' to see the flames destroy the historic . landmark. Although most of the exterior was renovated in 1896, and now consists of flint walls, the church's nave and transepts date back as far as the 11th century. Around 80 firefighters spent the day tackling the fire, after a 100metre square area of the roof caught fire . He said: 'It’s . absolutely devastating. The building has so many memories attached to . it, we have a book called ‘A Years Mind’ which we use to commemorate . people who have died in the village. 'It’s not just my church, it’s everybody’s church. It hasn’t sunk in, and it doesn’t feel real. It’s utterly catastrophic. 'Although we have . tragically lost our church building, the real value of a church is its . congregation and community and these, thank God, are all safe.' Villager Terry Neilson saw the fire unfold. He said: 'I came up to get a paper this morning and saw smoke, so wandered down out of curiosity and saw this. Revered Royston Such, who watched on as the fire ravaged the historic church, said the fire was 'utterly catastrophic' but was thankful that the congregation was safe . The 14th century bell tower and the roof of the Grade II-listed property have been destroyed in the fire . 'The church has been at the heart of the village for 800 years. Hopefully the stone will be saved.' The church is yards from Ropley Primary School, from where pupils were collected early after the fire broke out. Maria . Burr, an administrator at the school, said: 'The children and . the school are in no danger at all but we have very close links with the . church - Reverend Sutch comes in to school regularly. 'It is pretty dramatic unfortunately, it seems the bell tower and roof are completely destroyed. It is just such a shame.' A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It’s a substantial fire and a 10 metre by 10 metre part of the roof was well alight when our teams arrived. 'Crews from stations around the county including Basingstoke, Alresford, Eastleigh and Portchester are tackling the blaze. 'It is the roof and bell tower, which are both 100 per cent alight in the fire.' Steve . Foye, area manager for the fire service, said: 'This . was a significant fire that has seriously affected a prominent building . within the village. 'Crews have worked hard in arduous conditions to . bring the fire under control. 'We . are still working with partner agencies to bring this incident to a . close. We would like to thank the local community for their support . during this time.' Investigations as to what caused the fire are underway.","Alicia Hardy was due to marry her fiancé in her village church this Saturday .

But one American magazine might have taken the issue more seriously - by covering up Prince William's bald patch for its front page photo. A photo of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their son Prince George, which was taken during the family's visit to the Taronga Zoo in Sydney in April this year, is featured on the front cover of Vanity Fair's August edition. Scroll down for video . Vanity Fair is accused of digitally thickening The Duke of Cambridge's hair in its front cover photo, pictured left, from an original image taken in Australia, pictured right . The image shows the Duchess of Cambridge smiling at her husband as he looks fondly at his son. But a comparison of the front cover with the original photo appears to show Prince William's hair looking much thicker than it is. The suggested retouching of the image was spotted by fashion website Racked, which compared the two images side-by-side. The website then commented: 'Upon comparison it . is undeniable that Vanity Fair has photoshopped a little more hair onto . that head. Le scandal!' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appear on the cover of the August edition of American Vanity Fair . The original photo which was taken of the family as they visited Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia, in April this year . A spokesman for the magazine told the Telegraph that it had altered the photo but that it had not added more hair to Prince William's head. The spokesman said: 'We gave the image a poster-like palette. Because it is a cover image, the colours are richer and more graphic and vibrant. We obviously did not add more hair. 'His face, head and shoulders were just darkened as though he was a bit in the shadow... which put more emphasis on Prince George,' During that same tour of Australia and New Zealand, from which the photo was taken, the Duchess of Cambridge handed her husband some alpaca wool and suggested he use it as a wig, commenting: 'You need it more than me.' The future king himself joked about his receding hairline after Prince George was born, telling waiting photographers and reporters: 'He's got more hair than me, thank God.' Previously, the Duchess has been given an airbrushed waist by Grazia magazine in pictures of the royal wedding, while US Weekly was also accused of manipulating a photo of their son Prince . George, who turns one on July 22. Historian Dan Snow told the Telegraph that retouching images of the Royal Family was historically about highlighting the positive parts of a royal. He said: 'It is following an honourable tradition of making the best of your subject, whether royal or not.'","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge feature with son George on August cover .

A four-year-old girl on her first holiday abroad is fighting for her life after being found at the bottom of a swimming pool in Spain. Cally Simpson was on holiday at the Villa Marina resort in Salou, Catalonia, with her dad Steven and grandmother when she was found unconscious. The girl, from Arbroath, Angus, was pulled from the pool by another tourist and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She is now said be in a stable condition at the intensive care unit at a children's hospital in Barcelona. Earlier today, her mother Kate fought her . way through a strike by French air traffic controllers to get on a . flight to Spain so she could be by her daughter's bedside.

'We are all praying that she will pull through. There has been a slight improvement. They have started to raise her temperature to 36.5 degrees. She is now stable. 'We were all there, but we don't know what happened. 'The last time we saw her she was walking behind her dad to the main building. We have no idea how she came to be in the pool. 'A man called Ash found her after a couple of minutes in the pool, I don't know his full name.'

"By . James Tozer . and Steph Cockroft . Award winning author Jeanette Winterson caused outrage online after she put a snap of a rabbit she had killed and skinned . Jeanette Winterson has long championed the joys of eating only the freshest organic produce. So perhaps the novelist’s online followers should not have been surprised when she posted a picture of a skinned rabbit she had caught and killed and was about to eat – because it was nibbling her parsley. But her actions caused fury, particularly after she told her 32,700 Twitter followers that its head would make a great glove puppet. The 54-year-old author of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit insisted the unfortunate bunny was trapped humanely before being cooked in cider with rosemary and thyme. However, she then risked further controversy by uploading a photograph of her cat finishing off its entrails. Miss Winterson posted the first picture of the skinned animal on a worktop – thought to be at her Cotswolds cottage – with the caption: ‘Rabbit ate my parsley. I am eating the rabbit.’ Asked by one follower how she had caught it, Winterson replied: ‘In a trap next to the parsley bed. The skin which includes the head makes a great glove puppet.’ Shots of the meat bubbling on her Aga followed, but her tweets began to attract angry responses from followers. Jacqueline Looker wrote: ‘Before I unfollow you, you make me sick. I will never again read a word you write. Rest in peace, little rabbit.’ Winterson replied: ‘Do you only read vegetarians? If not, why is farmed meat fine but personally trapped disgusting? Think about it.’ She then posted the image of her pet cat  in front of a bowl of the rabbit’s innards,  adding: ‘No waste no packaging no processing no food miles.’ A picture of the cat devouring the entrails followed, captioned: ‘For all the Tweeters who said my cat would prefer Whiskers [sic] (where do u think pet food comes from BTW?)’ Twitter user HollyHox replied: ‘Thing is  that most people don’t feel a need to post such a graphic image and joke about it.  That’s the difference.’ Arthur Japin said: ‘How your cat and you have disappointed me. At least the cat has  an excuse.’ However, some users defended Miss Winterson’s tweets – with a few of them even asking for tips. One of the pictures posted on Twitter by author Jeanette Winterson after she killed and skinned a rabbit that was eating her parsley . Jeanette Winterson, the author of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, also used the social media site the tell her 32,700 followers that the offed bunny would make a 'great glove puppet' Hazel James wrote: ‘Isn’t that the balance of nature? At least it’s fresh, not like the frozen tasteless ones butchers sell.’ Annie-Marie Speed posted: ‘Delicious . and very eco friendly’, while Keith Morton asked: ‘Which wine did you . have with it? Looks lovely.’  Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, published . in 1985, is based on . Miss Winterson’s own upbringing and . tells the story of a young lesbian girl growing up in Accrington, . Lancashire. In 1990 it was made into a BBC TV series starring Geraldine . McEwan and Celia Imrie. She has told of how her adoptive parents ran a self-reliant household where it was normal to keep hens and rabbits for the pot. In an article in 2005, she wrote: ‘We . had what Mrs Winterson called “butcher’s meat” only on Sundays,’ she . wrote. ‘Mid-week, it was either our own chicken or our own rabbit, and . plenty of veg.’ Bemoaning the advent of large . supermarkets in the Seventies, with cheap, shrink-wrapped produce, she . added: ‘I find it odd though, that my family, who had no car, no phone, . no inside loo, no bank account, no credit cards, slot meters for . electricity and gas, and one winter coat, ate far better than today’s so . called working classes. We were not fat but we were fed.’ Winterson also uploaded pictures of her cooking rabbit meat 'in cider with rosemary and thyme', and a picture of her cat eating the rabbit's innards .

Many praised the game's wonderful graphics - going so far as to judge other gamers' 'rigs' on whether or not they could run the game at optimal settings. Others couldn't look past the somewhat clunky gameplay. Even now, the combined use of MSAA anti-aliasing, advanced depth of field effects, DirectX 10 object-based motion blur and a host of post processing effects is a challenge for most graphics cards. And Last Light will be no different. What a view: Last Light is set to push PCs to their absolute limit - but can still be enjoyed on mid-range cards . Following on from the events of 2033, you play Artyom, who is part of a dwindling number of survivors living underneath a ruined Moscow. On the surface, animals and humans have been exposed to poisonous substances turning them into ravenous flesh-eating monsters. Thankfully, Artyom has an exotic array of improvised hand-made weapons at his disposal. Developer 4A games have optimised their 4A engine, allowing it run faster than in its predecessor. The already eye-poppingly realistic textures have been made even more detailed, through the use of 2048x2048 textures, and geometric detail has improved through extra environmental and object-based tessellation. The Nvidia Titan is one of the . most powerful graphics cards in the world. The single-chip card uses the same technology behind the world's fastest super computer. It has its own . vapor chamber, allowing heat to escape and features a dynamic fan to prevent the card . from overheating. Similar to 2033, Last Light also features hardware-accelerated NVIDIA PhysX effects. This allows for the realistic destruction of scene objects during combat, . and the enhancement of other game elements, such as particle effects. It's for these reasons that the developers recommend the game be played using either one of the two fastest graphics cards around, these being the Nvidia Titan and the flagship GTX 690. No details have emerged yet on the optimum AMD equivalents. However, those with lesser cards can . still enjoy the game, too - as 'optimum settings' is likely to represent . 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. Photorealistic? Metro: Last Light features more open expanses than its claustrophobic predecessor - a likely reason behind the immense hardware demands . On the mid-range to high GTX cards, for example the 670 or above, you're likely to see the same graphical fidelity just at a lower frame rate - a spokesperson at Nvidia confirming to MailOnline that the game will still be 'very playable'. Last Light will also support Nvidia 3D, however, only the most powerful PCs will be able to run the game at its best using that display. Although console owners will likely see a dip in visual quality, the 4A engine will squeeze every last drop of power from the aging Xbox 360 and PS3. For more information visit: www.geforce.co.uk .

"By . Tim Shipman . Ministers are trying to use emergency powers to ban the publication of a damning report into the £50billion High Speed Rail project. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin called on David Cameron to veto releasing a report that labelled HS2 ‘red/amber’ and in danger of failing. They claim it would cause ‘political and presentational difficulties’ and could seriously damage the project. HS2: Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin called on David Cameron to veto releasing the report . HS2 critics say the gagging attempt is ‘absolutely disgraceful’ and are using Freedom of Information laws to demand that the Project Assessment Review, from November 2011, be published. The Information Commissioner has rejected ministers’ objections and ordered them to release the report. But in a leaked letter to Mr Cameron, circulated to ministers, Mr Maude and Mr McLoughlin urge that an emergency veto be put in place. Such a veto is hardly ever used, but was deployed to stop publication of Cabinet discussions of the Iraq War. Ministers are also considering whether to appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision.HS2 has faced widespread opposition and claims of soaring costs. The letter to Mr Cameron says: ‘Continuing with the appeal would create political and presentational difficulties at a crucial point in the HS2 project’s development . . . [therefore we should] exercise the veto now . . . Counsel has advised that we are very likely to lose the appeal. ‘We consider that the importance the Government attaches to the successful implementation of the HS2 project . . . justifies the use of the veto in this case as exceptional. ‘Disclosure of such recent information would also have a chilling effect on assessments of other Government projects and, indeed, on advice prepared for Government ministers on many other subjects. ‘Counsel has advised that it  will be better to veto now rather than after an adverse tribunal decision.’ Francis Maude: He claims the report would claim it would cause 'political and presentational difficulties' and could seriously damage the project . A Whitehall source accused ministers of treating the report ‘like top secret intelligence’. Senior Government sources believe Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wants publication blocked because it would ‘create a precedent’ meaning all Project Assessment Reviews would have to be released. Sir Jeremy is also blocking the release of correspondence between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and former US President George W Bush, which the Iraq Inquiry wants to publish. Despite calls for the appeal to be dropped, the Mail understands it is likely to go ahead. Whitehall sources predicted that if the Government loses the appeal – as its lawyers expect – then ministers will apply the veto. ‘I’m sure that’s what will happen,’ one insider said. Joe Rukin, of the Stop HS2 campaign, said it was ‘absolutely disgraceful’ that MPs and the public will not be given the information before a Commons vote to approve HS2 next spring. ‘Trying to keep this secret is an absolute scandal,’ he said. ‘It seems that David Cameron’s so-called transparency agenda  is just a fraudulent aspiration.’ The Department for Transport refused to comment, but a source in the department said the latest review found that HS2 was only an ‘amber’ risk, rather than ‘red/amber’. A Cabinet Office source argued that it was in the public interest to ensure that advice to ministers is not inhibited or watered down because of concerns it may be made public. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on leaked documents. ‘This Government is proud to lead the world on transparency. ‘We have published over 10,000 datasets on health, education, justice and transport to drive up the standards of public services and improve accountability.’","Ministers are trying to use emergency powers to ban report .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A French doctor faces life imprisonment if he is convicted of poisoning seven terminally-ill patients at a hospital in Bayonne, south west France. Nicolas Bonnemaison, 53, has been accused of administering lethal injections to the patients to help them die in alleged mercy killings. His lawyer Arnaud Dupin said Dr . Bonnemaison, who was struck off amid the allegations, faces life in prison if he is convicted of the charges. Nicolas Bonnemaison, 53, pictured left with his wife Julie and right with his lawyer Arnaud Dupin, arrived at the court in Pau, southwestern France, today where he will be tried for poisoning seven terminally-ill patients . The trial, which is taking place in Pau, near to the city of Bayonne, comes amid debate in France over whether to legalise . euthanasia or loosen laws on treatment for people with incurable . illnesses. The medic, who worked in the emergency department, is accused of having poisoned the terminally-ill patients - described as 'particularly vulnerable people' - between March 2010 and July 2011. He is also accused of having given drugs to the patients without asking other doctors' advice. During his first day in court, where he arrived supported by his wife Julie, Dr Bonnemaison said: 'I'm thinking of the patients today. 'You experience powerful things with terminally-ill patients, things that leave their mark on doctors. 'They leave their mark on the human being too, beyond our job as doctors. It's important that the family be informed so that they can understand what is going on.' Dr Bonnemaison faced a media circus as he arrived at the courthouse for . the start of his trial. He faces life imprisonment if he is convicted of . the crimes, his lawyer said . He added that he hoped he had been 'up to the challenge' before adding: 'I did what I could'. The case came to light in August 2011 . after the doctor was reported to bosses by nurses and a carer who said they found his behaviour suspicious. The case, which came after the doctor was struck off, has stirred up considerable emotion, including among the victims' families . The trial has since stirred up considerable emotion, . including among the victims' families. In comments made on television as the trial began, the widow of one the patients said she had asked Bonnemaison to help her husband die, and that what the doctor did was 'good'. Patricia Dhooge, her voice shaking with emotion, said in remarks carried on French television Wednesday that 'it would hurt me very much if they gave him any kind of punishment'. A petition in favour of the defendant has also garnered 60,000 signatures. Euthanasia is illegal in France, but President Francois Hollande promised during his 2012 campaign to look into legalising the hugely divisive practice. A law passed in France in 2005 has already legalised passive euthanasia, where a person causes death by withholding or withdrawing treatment that is necessary to maintain life. Last year, a panel set up by Hollande also recommended legalising assisted suicide. That allows a doctor to provide a patient with all the necessary lethal substances to end their life, but lets them carry out the final act. .

"By . Damien Gayle . The wealthy mayor of a Lebanese town has been arrested in Spain over allegations he offered to pay poor migrants 40,000 euros (£33,500) for a liver transplant. The 61-year-old was arrested in January at Manises Airport, Valencia, and is on bail in the country facing preliminary charges of alleged organ trafficking. Authorities would not release his name, nor those of his alleged accomplices, because the suspects were the subjects of an ongoing court investigation. Deadly trade: The wealthy mayor of a Lebanese town has been arrested in Spain over allegations he offered to pay poor migrants 40,000 euros (£33,500) for a liver transplant . The arrests are the first time that allegations human organ trafficking have been detected in Spain, said Rafael Matesanz, director of the government's National Transplants Organisation. 'The main message is that no country is totally free of this problem, so that everybody should be alert,' he was quoted as saying by CNN. 'Organ trafficking is more or less like slaves of some centuries ago. It's the way some people really control other people. It's exploitation of human beings.' Organ traffickers charge between $100,000 (£60,000) and $200,000 to organise transplants . Donors receive as little as $1000 . In 2004, police broke up an international ring which arranged for Israelis to receive kidneys from poor Brazilians at a clinic in South Africa . Brazil, India and Moldova are well-known sources of donors . Growing hospital waiting lists have increased organ trafficking . Source: WHO . Police say the mayor enlisted four . alleged accomplices - three Lebanese and a Palestinian - who recruited . nine poor people to have liver compatibility tests at a clinic in . Valencia last summer. Just one, a Romanian immigrant, proved to . be a match. But when he went with the Lebanese mayor to a Barcelona . transplant clinic, medical workers blocked the procedure, police said. Spanish rules stipulate that organs must only be donated for altruistic reasons by donors who are family members or close friends of the recipient. Hospital staff quickly discovered that the Lebanese mayor did not have that kind of relationship with his Romanian donor. The mayor eventually got his liver transplant using tissue donated by his son, who had earlier been turned down after tests in Lebanon where medics had told him he was too young. Seized: Police arrested the mayor at Manises airport in Valencia when he came back to Spain for a check up . By this time, however, police in Valencia were investigating a report from an NGO that works with immigrants that an Algerian woman had told them people were offering her money for part of her liver. She was among the nine who had been tested for compatibility with the Lebanese recipient and police traced their investigation back to him and his four alleged accomplices, who live in spain. Police arrested the mayor when he flew back in to spain for a check up on his new organ. The five suspects face jail terms of up to 12 years if convicted, although the case is still in its early stages.","Wealthy 61-year-old arrested in January with four alleged accomplices .

But one woman decided to be inspired by her sibling's success and lost an incredible 10 stone after copying her slender glamour model sister. Kate Lappin, 32, from Warrington, was overweight and targeted by bullies during her schooldays while her younger sister Kim was popular and had model good looks. After Kim launched a career as a glamour model, 22st Kate decided to take control of her life and ditched extra-large portions of comfort food. Scroll down for video . Kate Lappin, 32, from Warrington, was obese at 22st (left) but has seen her weight drop to 9st 7 lbs (right) Kate's sister Kim, a glamour model, was always active when she was younger and more outgoing . The delighted carer has seen her weight drop to 9st 7lb and her dress size shrink down to a slim 8. She said: 'I detested being the larger sister. I have a clear memory of mum and dad taking me to Eurodisney when we were kids. We had matching Minnie Mouse outfits on and mine was so much bigger than hers. It was very upsetting. 'I hated myself for a long time, and struggled with so many issues to do with food but I wasn't ready to make lasting change for a long time.' Kate, who is several years older than Kim, saw her body develop differently through adolescence and she became increasingly shy. She said: 'Kim was always active. She was more outgoing. I didn't like joining in, doing things with other children. I preferred staying at home, keeping myself to myself. When Kim went off to parties, I hid under the dinner table because I didn't want to go. When they were kids Kate was very upset that her outfit was much bigger than Kim's . Kate and Kim pictured recently. Kate now goes to the gym regularly and loves long bike rides . 'I developed so many issues over eating and food. As my size grew, I started to experience bullying in school. When I was 15 I was walking along the street when a car full of lads pulled over and they all called me fat. 'Later I tried to go to the theatre with a boyfriend and I couldn't fit into the tiny seats. All I could do was fake a panic attack and rush out of the audience, absolutely mortified. 'Kim, who was the most popular girl in school, was very protective of me when she saw I was upset. She would pin the bullies down and get them to apologise. She's still very caring towards me, even today.' In early 2010, the sisters' stepfather, Dave Easton, passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack.Kate said: 'My stepdad's death hit me incredibly hard. He had been very supportive of me.

In contrast, Kim was in the early stages of what is today a successful career in modelling, seeing her photographs printed in magazines and making appearances at live events. Kate said: 'I knew that if my stepdad was looking down he would be upset to see me in the state I was. I decided to make huge changes. I realised that if Kim could do it, there was nothing to stop me getting back to a good state of health.' Kate drew up her own vegetarian diet plan which moved her daily diet away from stodgy comfort food towards lighter options with a focus on vegetables. In just over a month she lost a remarkable three stone. Since embarking on her weight loss journey Kate's confidence grew and she felt able to go out and meet people.

'My weight loss was definitely a factor - I wouldn't have had the confidence to go out and meet someone otherwise,' says Kate. 'Before, I just kept myself to myself. After I slimmed down I enjoyed meeting new people, and that's how Darren came into my life.' One of Kim's modeling shots. After her career kicked off Kate was inspired to make changes . Before beginning her weight loss journey, Kate typically ate four rounds of bread, butter and jam for breakfast, followed by an extra-large portion of spaghetti bolognese for lunch, and an Indian or Chinese takeaway or pizza with extra cheese for evening meal. She would snack on crisps, particularly Pringles, throughout the day. Today, Kate eats a banana for breakfast, followed by a Quorn ham salad sandwich on lighter-calorie bread for lunch, followed by Quorn chicken fillets with vegetables for her evening meal. She tried to avoid snacking, but when she does, she eats fruit. She is now at 9st 7lb and can fit into size 8 clothing - having lost 10st 6lb and shrunk seven dress sizes.

"By . Jenny Hope . Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer could be denied a new drug after a U-turn by the NHS rationing body . Thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer could be denied a new drug after a U-turn by the NHS rationing body. Enzalutamide extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options – with some patients surviving more than 18 months. It was initially recommended for NHS funding last October but revised draft guidance issued today imposes curbs that will deny many men the chance to use it. It will be banned for patients in England previously treated with abiraterone, another new drug currently used in advanced cases. Men in Scotland are getting enzalutamide without restrictions. Rationing watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says lack of evidence about the two drugs has led to its revised decision, which is now out for consultation. Cancer specialists are outraged, saying it is a perverse U-turn based on fears about the cost. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to standard hormone treatments. Doctors say enzalutamide could help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness. Dr Alison Birtle, consultant oncologist at the Rosemere Cancer Centre, Royal Preston Hospital, described the ruling as a tragedy. ‘Thousands of men have been prescribed abiraterone or are using it in trials, and they will be denied this new drug at some point,’ she said. ‘New drugs have shown that advanced prostate cancer can be turned into a chronic disease, with men having good quality of life for months or even years. They are able to work and reach the milestones in life that matter to them. ‘I’m outraged by this perverse decision. This would not happen in breast cancer.’ Enzalutamide, a new type of hormone treatment, was assessed in 1,199 patients with advanced prostate cancer who had previously received chemotherapy. Their survival rates were significantly extended, with almost half having a better quality of life as a result. Around 10,500 British men have advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to standard hormone treatments . Enzalutamide, which is a pill taken at home, costs around £25,000 for an average course of treatment. But manufacturer Astellas Pharma has reduced the price through a patient scheme that makes it cost-effective, according to Nice. Owen Sharp, chief executive at the charity Prostate Cancer UK, criticised Nice. ‘Adding this restriction to their draft decision, without any explanation, leaves hundreds of men, who have few treatments anyway, with no hope of accessing enzalutamide,’ he said. ‘Nice is playing fast and loose with men with prostate cancer in the advanced stages of the disease who may become resistant to other treatments, and what’s worse, without saying why. ‘We will fight this decision, but it will not help the men who could be benefiting during this delay. We hope Nice follow the decision made in Scotland, and allow clinicians to make the decisions about what drugs are best for patients.’ Professor Jonathan Waxman, a leading prostate cancer specialist, said Nice was an organisation ‘not fit for purpose’ that persists in using a faulty system for rationing drugs that disadvantages patients in England. ‘It continues to evaluate drugs using calculations that do not reflect reality and exaggerate the cost,’ he said. ‘These nonsensical decisions are made on behalf of patients but conflict with what specialists consider is best for them.’ He accused Nice of creating a postcode lottery. ‘This iniquitous guidance means men in England will be treated differently from Scotland,’ said Professor Waxman. Professor Carole Longson, director of Nice’s Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ‘There are few treatments available for patients at this stage of prostate cancer so we are very pleased that we are able to produce draft guidance recommending enzalutamide.’","10,500 British men have advanced treatment resistant prostate cancer .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A British serviceman was crushed to death under a damaged Jackal armoured vehicle which was being driven by an unqualified driver. An inquest was told senior aircraftsman Kinikki Griffiths, 20, was killed when the vehicle rolled backwards while he tried to fix a diesel leak in July 2010. And that Corporal William Wortley, who did not have a driving licence, could not even remember if he had put the hand brake on when the fatality occurred. Senior aircraftsman Kinikki Griffiths, 20, suffered devastating crush injuries to his chest and abdomen after a Jackal armoured personnel vehicle rolled on top of him as he helped fix a diesel leak . He also did not know what worked when the engine was switched on or off and was not not aware of any chocks which could stop it rolling. The coroner was told about a catalogue of shortcomings leading to the accident and a lawyer asked during the hearing if servicemen were operating in a ‘blissful ignorance of hazards’. More...

The death happened after a three vehicle convoy was sent from Camp Bastion to recover explosive equipment and thermal imaging gear and occurred three kilometres from the military base.

The inquest was told their was 'naivety' around operating the Jackal, seen here being crewed by British soldiers in Afghanistan, and that better training on how to use it would of helped prevent accidents . The accident happened three kilometres from Camp Bastion, seen above, after three vehicles were deployed to recover explosive equipment and thermal imaging gear .

Under cross examination he admitted: 'I had limited experience of anything automatic.' He . said he was ‘keen to drive because the lads were tired’ and admitted . breaching an order by saying he was in the command seat and not driving. The hearing heard reports that he had driven the vehicle as many as 15 times previous. The death happened after the Jackal was stopped so the leak could be repaired. Military witnesses were seriously affected by the tragedy, near Camp Bastion, seen above, and at one point a witness left the inquest in tears . Cpl Wortley said he cannot remember damaging the Jackal in a dip while driving, and . wasn't speeding because of the difficult terrain and the risk of rolling. RAF . sergeant James Whitby told the hearing he went underneath the Jackal to . examine the leak and found a black plastic bag where someone had tried . to fix it previously. He had ordered the engine to be turned off to avoid a possible explosion. SAC Griffiths, from Exmouth, Devon, then went underneath to shine a torch on the problem area. The . hearing was told there was a hissing sound which may have come from the . hydraulics before the Jackal moved down towards the ground and rolled . backwards and on top of SAC Griffiths. The inquest heard that SAC Griffiths  was wearing body armour and his helmet but that could not have saved him when the armoured vehicle rolled backwards trapping him, near Camp Bastion .

The wealthy family of the real-estate developer whose wife is pregnant with Simon Cowell's baby refused to go to their wedding, it has been claimed. Socialite Lauren Silverman, 36, who is now 10 weeks pregnant with the music mogul's child, married Andrew Silverman, 37, in their mid 20s. But now Andrew - a . close friend of Cowell's - has filed for divorce, naming Cowell as a co-respondent in the papers and listing adultery as the cause of the ending of the marriage. Revealing that Andrew's parents, weathly real-estate owner Allen Silverman and his wife Eleonore, always had concerns about the relationship, a source said: 'Andrew's parents boycotted their wedding because they had their doubts . about Lauren, she thought she was suspect.' Betrayal: Andrew and Lauren Silverman, pictured in January 2013, were married for 10 years. Their marriage ended following her affair with Cowell with whom she now has a baby son, Eric . An acquaintance told the New York Post: 'I always found her very pretty, but I . found them to be very pretentious. And I always wondered why she married him.' Andrew works . alongside his father Allen, who founded property company The Andalex . Group by combining his sons names, Andrew and Alexander, in the 1980s. Both brothers now work for the firm and have been named as rising stars in New York real-estate scene.

Troubled: There was no sign of her husband Andrew, who filed for divorce two weeks ago . Luxurious: She is hiding out at the family's $4 million home in Bridgehampton, New York . On Thursday . morning, Lauren was photographed dropping the couple's . son at the school bus outside the $4 million family home in Bridgehampton, New . York, where she is hiding out. Lauren, who was dressed casually and wore flip flops, dark colored shorts, a loose fitting white shirt and a light blue cap, smiled as she spoke to a friend in the driveway before returning to the house. A family friend had said that Lauren would come to the end of the drive and speak if she wanted to but instead she returned into the house. Lauren is being comforted by her mother Carole and another woman at the seven-bedroom property.It had been listed for rent recently and the description on a real estate website says it has four fireplaces, seven and a half bathrooms and a country eat-in kitchen. Bridgehampton is in the millionaires playground of The Hamptons where the likes of Alec Baldwin, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel have properties. The Silvermans have been married for 10 years and have a seven-year-old son called Adam. Good spirits: The property magnate was smiling as he left his New York apartment on Wednesday evening, in spite of hitting headlines the world over after it was revealed his wife was having Simon Cowell's baby . Andrew Silverman graduated the . University of Pennsylvania and began his career on the trading floor of . Credit Lyonnais before becoming the chief investment officer at the . family's firm, Andalex. He met Silverman in his early 20s when she was a frequent presences in the city's social scene. Since 2000, the couple have been . living in a stunning apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 'white glove condominium' aptly named The Savoy. The . condo was actually bought by Andrew’s father, Allen, for $1,213,500 in . 1999 and remains in his name. The property, will, of course, . now be worth considerably more. The . building boasts a doorman, concierge, valet service, health club and a . sundeck overlooking Manhattan – with superstore Bloomingdales just a . block away.

A close friend of Cowell told MailOnline today that Andrew Silverman had named him in the divorce 'to cause the utmost embarrassment' to the star. The source said: 'This is just to exact revenge. Andrew wants to embarrass Simon. There's no way this will actually go to trial, but Andrew just wants to get back at him.' Cowell, 53, and Lauren, 36, are believed to have met while on vacation in Barbados some years ago through Mr Silverman. Biographer . Tom Bower witnessed the beginnings of Cowell and Lauren's close . friendship a year-and-a-half ago, when he spent time on a yacht called . the Slipstream, which the mogul had chartered for  £2 million a month. In . his biography, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, Bower . noted that there were a number of high-octane glamour women who were . competing for Cowell’s attention, but that Lauren was ‘his closest . confidante’. Bower also . details in the book Lauren's shock when Cowell initially told her about . his engagement to Mezhgan Hussainy in February 2010. Happy families: Lauren Silverman, Andrew Silverman, their son Adam and Lauren's sister Nicole Davis are all smiles at Bridgehampton Polo in August 2007 . According . to Bower, Lauren, who he calls Cowell's 'best friend in New York' was . 'completely flabbergasted' by the news, telling Andrew as she finished . her phone call with the mogul: 'The whole thing is wrong.' The high-profile couple never . made a secret of their friendship with Cowell and indeed when questions . were constantly asked about the exact nature of Lauren’s friendship with . the X Factor svengali, the reply would always be the same – an . insistence that they were just close friends, and that Lauren was merely . the wife of one of Cowell’s best friends.

On Tuesday Azaz, 35, pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention. He was given six penalty points and a fine at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court, a punishment Ms Orrock slammed as 'disgusting'.

The family, of South Shields, South Tyneside, had been driving to McDonald's and to Asda to buy Jessica an outfit for World Book Day. While stopped at traffic lights Azaz careered into them from the right, hitting them from behind. Jessica, who had been strapped into a booster seat in the back of the car, severely banged her head. Lisa Orrock and her partner Chris Bootes are launching a civil case to try and secure funds to help pay for the specialist rehabilitation their daughter Jessica needs . She suffered a seizure on the road-side before being rushed to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where she was placed in an induced coma for 11 days and given a blood transfusion. She also underwent emergency surgery to repair a damaged skull. Jessica is now in a wheelchair and is only able to get out of it with the use of a specially made leg splint.

"By . Ray Massey . and Steve Hopkins . Criminal gangs are increasingly targeting van drivers in ‘crash for cash’ scams, and have driven up personal injury claims by 51 per cent in a year, it has emerged. Insurance giant Aviva said that the number of staged accidents it . detected rose from 536 in 2012 to 820 last year. Meanwhile, the number of individual fraudulent cash-for-crash claims rose . from 1,417 to 2,200 over the same period – an increase of 55 per cent. Now it has emerged that gangs are increasingly scouting for tradesmen on the roads believing they are too busy to challenge them and may not be fully insured, according to anti-fraud company APU. Vans were involved in a third of all deliberate crashes last year. Scam: 'Crash for cash' criminals are increasingly targeting van drivers in 'crash for cash' scams believing they are too busy to debate who is to blame . Neil Thomas, APU's director of investigative services, said: 'Criminal fraud gangs are becoming more sophisticated - they are thinking quite hard about who they target.' Innocent . drivers who appear the most likely to be insured and the least likely to . make a fuss are also falling victim, such as those with well-maintained . cars, older drivers and families with young children. Since 2011 cash-for-crash incidents have nearly doubled, rising from 447 incidents involving 1,273 fraudulent claims. Aviva said it detected bogus cash-for cash claims worth £10million among the . £59million of general motor insurance frauds, 'the highest levels we have ever detected'. The scams now account for more than a third of all the 6,000 . fraudulent motor claims the insurance firm dealt with last year –  a 20 . per cent rise overall. Central Buses axed a busy Birmingham route last month after falling victim to ‘crash for cash’ fraudsters 15 times in two years. The company received 15 insurance claims when just four people were involved . Usually, in accidents where one vehicle is hit from behind by another, it is the driver following who is deemed at fault. So, in a crash for cash incident, a car may brake suddenly in front of a chosen motorist, leaving them with little chance of avoiding a crash. There have also been reports of criminals disconnecting their brake lights so the car they target has even less warning. Other scams involve drivers flashing their lights at other motorists at junctions, only to then by struck by that vehicle. Even the public transport system has been hit. Central Buses axed a busy Birmingham route last month after falling victim to ‘crash for cash’ fraudsters 15 times in two years. The company said the final straw came when it received 15 insurance claims from people saying they were passengers hurt in a collision that actually involved just four people – none of whom was injured. A motorist travelling alone braked sharply in front of a single-decker bus. Aviva – which insures one in 10 . vehicles on the road - say that the number of staged accidents it . detected rose from 536 in 2012 to 820 last year – an increase of 51 per . cent. These resulted . in the number of individual fraudulent cash-for-crash claims rising . from 1,417 to 2,200 over the same period – an increase of 55 per cent, . it said. Since 2011 cash-for-crash incidents have nearly doubled, rising from 447 incidents involving 1,273 fraudulent claims. Cash . for crash scams now account for more than a third of all the 6,000 . fraudulent motor claims the insurance firm dealt with last year –  a 20 . per cent rise overall. Aviva . said it detected bogus cash-for cash claims worth £10million among the . £59million of general motor insurance frauds which in turn now account . for more than half of all insurance scams it uncovered. Aviva said that overall in 2013 it . detected more than £59m of motor injury fraud – more than any other form . of insurance fraud. Last year it detected more than £110million worth of fraud, up 19 per cent on 2012. Despite repairs to the bus and car costing only £500 each, the firm ended up paying out £25,000 fighting each claim in court. Birmingham has become a crash for cash hotspot, with six of its postcodes among the ten UK districts where the crime is most likely. In December, the charity Crimestoppers named Birmingham and Bradford as crash for cash capitals, based on insurance data. The cities host nine of the ten districts where the crime is most likely. The final area is in Bolton.’ Tom Gardiner, head of claims fraud at Aviva, said: ‘The fast growth of induced accidents on our roads is cause for serious concern. Fraudsters are prepared to put the safety of innocent motorists and their families and passengers at risk for their own personal gain. ‘We believe that convictions for motor injury fraud resulting from induced accidents should result in more custodial sentences. ‘Stronger sentences will deter would-be fraudsters and help to keep roads safer and premiums lower for customers.’ Data from The Sentencing Council reveals that community orders were the most common sentence handed out for fraud offences since 2004. But the Aviva report says: . ’We believe this does little to deter crash for cash fraudsters from committing – and re-committing – induced accidents.’ It notes: ‘Currently, even where a fraudster exaggerates his claim often by tens of thousands of pounds, he is still entitled to recover his original claim – and therefore there is little deterrent to discourage fraud.’ Consumer research shows two out of three respondents supported stronger sentences for convictions of motor injury fraud while almost 9 in 10 felt custodial sentences sent the strongest message. Last month a report by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the increase in staged crashes and false whiplash claims helped fuel an 18 per cent rise in insurance fraud last year that cost a record £1.3billion. Nearly two thirds was paid out to motoring claimants. The ABI calculates such bogus claims cost each of us an extra £90 a year onto motor insurance. The ABI report revealed a total of 118,500 bogus or exaggerated insurance claims were detected last year and almost half were for motoring claims. It concluded: ‘Fraudulent motor insurance claims were the most expensive and common, with the number of dishonest claims at 59,900 – up 34 per cent on 2012 – and their value at £811million, up 32 per cent’.","A third of all deliberate 'crash for crash' accidents involved vans last year .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A man set himself on fire at Tokyo's busy Shinjuku railway station on Sunday in what appears to be a rare violent political protest. The man, who appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, was taken to hospital after suffering serious injuries, said Daiji Kubota, an officer at the Shinjuku police station. He said the man's identity and the reason for the self-immolation was under investigation. Footage of the incident on Twitter and other social media showed a man wearing a suit and tie sitting on a small mat along the metal framework above a pedestrian walkway with two plastic bottles of what looked like gasoline beside him. Scroll down for video . The man, who appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, set himself on fire at Tokyo's Shinjuku station. He had two bottles with him, which may have been petrol - drinking one and covering himself in the other . The man was seen calmly sitting on a small mat on top of Tokyo's Shinjuku railway station bridge, dressed in a suit and next to two bottles of gasoline, before he set himself on fire . Firefighters pulled the man down onto the pedestrian bridge, using hoses and a fire extinguisher before he was taken away . The man was soon engulfed by a huge ball of fire as hundreds of people watched on in horror . Witnesses said the man spoke through a megaphone to protest the government's moves to change Japan's defence policy to allow it to play a more assertive role in international security . Witnesses were quoted as saying the man spoke through a megaphone to protest the government's moves to change Japan's defence policy. He then doused himself with gasoline and set himself alight as hundreds of people watched from below and from nearby buildings. Television reports showed firefighters pulling the man down onto the pedestrian bridge walkway and using hoses and a fire extinguisher to put out the fire. The man was then taken away in an ambulance. The man can be seen on top of the bridge, left, and right, emergency workers begin rescue efforts . Firefighters positioned on either side of the bridge used hoses to put out the fire . Police, firefighters, and medics stand atop the bridge after the severely burned man was taken to hospital . Japan's Cabinet is expected on Tuesday to approve a proposal calling for the right to 'collective self-defence,' which would allow Japan to play a more assertive role in international security amid China's growing military presence and rising regional tensions. Japan currently limits its participation even in U.N. peacekeeping activities to noncombat roles. Critics say the shift undermines the war-renouncing Article 9 of Japan's Constitution, and opposition groups have staged constant but peaceful protests outside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official residence. Japan has had very few self-immolations in past decades despite a long history of suicides by ritual disembowelment, or seppuku, dating back to the feudal era. The most high-profile suicide for political reasons in the modern era was by Yukio Mishima, a right-wing author considered to be one of Japan's greatest novelists, who killed himself in front of the headquarters of Japan's Self Defense Forces in 1970 after an unsuccessful coup attempt.","Hundreds of onlookers watched as the man set himself ablaze on the bridge .

"By . Bianca London . A woman lost six stone in seven months after being told she might never have children because of her weight. Siobhann O’Brien, 23, started her weight-loss campaign after doctors warned her that her weight could affect her chances of becoming pregnant. The receptionist, from Failsworth, Oldham, had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome when she was 16 and piled on the weight, reaching 19st 10lb at her heaviest. The sensible way: Siobhann O'Brien lost more than 6st in seven months by going to the gym and eating more healthily. She was warned to lose weight or risk infertility and has managed to do it without any faddy diets . Motivated by the doctor's warning, Siobhann joined her local gym seven months ago and enlisted the help of personal trainer Lee Greenall to help her shift the weight. She said: 'At my first weigh-in, I was horrified to see 19st 10lb on the scales with 48 per cent body fat. 'I’ve been on and off diets all my life but never really stuck to anything but this time I was a lot more determined.' She said: 'Lee put me on a full diet plan and even went shopping with me to educate me on the right foods to eat so I could implement this into my life. It’s all about being sensible and a lot of hard work. 'When I . first started out, I couldn’t even step up and down on a box without . getting tired. Sometimes I felt like crying and giving up and thought my . body was shutting down. But I’m amazed at what I can do now and feel . great when I come out. 'With determination and encouragement, I managed to push on resulting in a massive transformation in my life.' At her heaviest: Siobhann, who weighed 19st 10lb and had a 48 per cent body fat, was warned by doctors that she might not be able to conceive if she didn't lose weight . Helping hand: She enlisted the help of personal trainer Lee, who put her on a full diet plan and even went shopping with her to educate her on the right foods to eat . Siobhann, who now weighs 13st 10lb, has lost 13in off her stomach, 9in off her hips and 12.5in from her legs. She added: . 'I feel like a new person. Everyone has been so motivating and I’ve . been looking back over pictures on Facebook and Instagram and can’t . believe the change. 'All my friends and family are really impressed with the results and some people don't recognise me. 'There is no miracle cure. For anyone who is unhappy, there is only one answer. You can’t kid yourself. It’s not easy but it does actually work.' Her personal trainer Lee Greenall added: 'It’s been terrific to see Siobhann’s change. 'Her . courage and will is inspiring and she’s a testament to what hard work . and commitment can result in. It has been a pleasure to work with her.' Time to act: Siobhann said she had been on and off diets all of her life but never really stuck to anything but the doctor's warning was enough to motivate her . As she was: Siobhann, pictured on holiday at her heaviest, says that with determination and encouragement, she managed to push on and change her life .","Siobhann O’Brien, 23, was warned by doctors she might not conceive .

"By . Bianca London . They are the latest craze to sweep the playground and the must-have accessory of the summer, despite the recent alerts over their potential dangers. There's no denying that Britain has gone loom . band crazy and ever since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing . one during the royal tour, sales have rocketed by more than 300 per cent. And just to prove that hysteria a woman has jumped on the bandwagon by creating a dress made from 24,000 of the rubber pieces - and it's sparked a bidding war on eBay reaching a price of £154,000 in just three days. Rubber goes couture: The craze for loom bands has spiralled even further, with a dress made from 24,000 of the wristbands up on eBay for £154,000. The dress, made by Kathryn Burnand, and modelled by her friend's daughter, received 126 bids in less than three days . Kathryn Burnand, 50, took three-and-a-half weeks painstakingly weaving the tiny bands together to make the size 4 outfit. She spent £45 on 40 bags of 600 bands and expected to scrape a £50 profit from the venture. Her best friend Helen Wright put the frock on eBay with a starting price of £50 and they were disappointed when it attracted little interest for the first two days. But on Thursday, 126 bids came through in the space of four hours and the bidding stood at £153,921 at midday today with four days still remaining. Intricate: She made the dress from 24,000 of the multicoloured bands, taking three-and-half-weeks to sew them together into a size 4 dress. Her best friend Helen Wright, also from Prestatyn, put the frock on eBay on Tuesday with a starting price of £50 . The auction listing shows Helen's daughter, Sian, 12, modelling the multi-coloured outfit. Mrs Burnand, who does not work as she suffers from Osteoarthritis said: 'I saw Sian was into these Loom Bands and thought I'd give a dress a go. 'It cost about £45 for the bands and I was working on the dress for 45 hours over three-and-a-half weeks. 'It's gone crazy. I phoned Helen at 2am [on Friday] and said ""You've got to be joking"". I would've been happy to make £50 profit, but this is ridiculous.' Life changing: Kathryn Burnand said she's no eBay expert but if this is for real then it would be 'amazing' and she would buy a car and a holiday . Mrs Burnand, of Prestatyn, north Wales, has watched 29 bidders from across the world send the price shooting up. 'What a difference that money would make to me and Helen,' she said. 'I'd buy a car for my husband and go on a holiday. 'I've made things like this before for friends and for people's birthdays, and I've done dress-making in the past. I guess this is quite unique though.' Ms Wright, 42, also of Prestatyn, said she had not told Sian about the bids yet, but said she would be 'the talk of school' once her friends found out. Trendsetter: Kate waves and shows off her loom band given to her by well wishers during the Royal Tour of New Zealand in April . 'It's not actually very nice to wear because it's very heavy,' she said. 'All the plastic bands make it quite uncomfortable to wear too. 'My daughter tried it on. She's found it quite a struggle to get on because it's a small dress. 'We're not a rich family. I'm not complaining with what I have at all, but this could be a great change in fortunes for us. These things never happen to people like us. 'I'm no eBay expert, I've only put on a few things here or there before, but if this is for real then it would be amazing.'

Anna Protherough, Senior Buyer for Kids at Hobbycraft said, ‘The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon. ‘We . began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and . since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been . flying off our shelves.

Preparation for his celeb-stalking trips can take anywhere between a few hours and six months, where he painstakingly tracks a celebrities movements and plots the perfect time to strike and snap his camera. Mr Carrington has hundreds of pictures with the stars, and says they would cover the floor, ceiling and walls of his home if we were to put them all up.

Mr Carrington, 46, who made his living as a stand up comedian until his father died in 2011, took his first celebrity selfie with Crissy Rock in June 2011.

'I stuck this programme on the wall with a few pictures around it, just to brighten the place up. 'Before long I was taking my own pictures just to put them on the wall. Now I have more pictures than I do wall space.' Since then, his obsession has grown, and he now spends up to six months tracking a celebrity’s movements to pinpoint the perfect moment to strike. He said: 'The easiest person to meet . was White Dee. From a simple comment on her Facebook and I was having a . cup of tea and a curry in her house a few hours later. 'That picture got the most likes I’ve ever had too - it got 78 in just 24 hours. 'I love White Dee as well. We’re actually quite close now.

The comedian said: 'Sometimes it’s easy, if you know they’re filming somewhere you can just fly in and hang around. 'I flew to Dublin where they were filming for the Mrs Brown’s Boys film and found their set in a few hours. I didn’t even check into a hotel. 'The most difficult to track down was Crissy Rock.

"By . Steve Hopkins . A street light has finally been turned off - after being left on 24 hours a day for six years. The faulty lamp in Dronfield was fixed by council engineers after angry residents complained. Local resident Wendy Davies, 64, said: 'It’s been shining into my house 24/7 for six years. What a waste of money over all that time. Wendy Davies stands underneath the street light that shone directly into her bedroom window 24 hours a day for six years before the council finally fixed it . 'I live in a semi-detached and the light would shine straight in to my bedroom window. I haven’t been very well recently and when I’d sit in the room and look out of the window all I could see was the bright light. 'It’s been on for six solid years day and night. I’ve told the council over the years and they said they would sort it, but I think it just got put to the bottom of the pile.' Richard Schumacher, from Sheffield based company Pro Spark Connextions, estimated keeping the light going for six years would have cost about £920. Mrs Davies said she mentioned the problem to the council again in May and 'they agreed it was a waste'. She added: 'Again they said they would sort it out, but they never did. The offending street light that was fixed this week in Dronfield. The Derbyshire County Council said they were unaware of the problem and sent an engineer to fix it as soon as they were informed . 'I stopped asking after a while because you start to feel like you’re being ignored. It was only when I saw the council’s plans to leave streets without light to save money that I thought I needed to do something. 'It just got me really riled up when I saw the plans and I thought how can they leave these people without light when this one is never switched off?' A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council said: 'This was the first we heard about a problem with this light but an engineer has been out and fixed it. 'Although we carry out regular checks on street lighting at night, we need members of the public to report lights which are on at the wrong times so we can repair them.' The spokesman said the council looked after an 'enormous amount of lights' in the county and had 'never heard of' a light being faulty for so long. The Taxpayers Alliance director John O'Connell said: 'Unlike the streetlight, the council needs to switch on to the fact that taxpayers will no longer tolerate poor service. 'The amount of taxpayers' money that's been wasted on the 24/7 streetlight will rub salt in the wound. Councils have to be more responsive when local residents complain.'","Wendy Davies was blinded by light that shone into her bedroom window .

'With . everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking . green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just . another beauty fad. 'We . all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens . contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the . most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help . keep us healthy. Green . smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, . and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as . nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so . it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it!

For instance, a daily . serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content . equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a . 32oz steak. Perhaps . most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food . natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of . fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy, . this is hugely important. Smoothies . are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients . which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume . food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the . Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell . walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.' Miranda . and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply . because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we . eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily . basis to help keep us healthy. Combining . these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many . of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and . blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways . of creating optimum health and energy. Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices . Juicing . or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy . varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and . helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a . rejuvenator of all body systems. Green . smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be . high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness. The . spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is . found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, . helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many . busy celebs are trying it! You’ll . notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their . juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily . serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content . equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a . 32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this . nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can . cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where . possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green . smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home.
