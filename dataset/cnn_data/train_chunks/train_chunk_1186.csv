"The daughter of a Jewish classmate of Anne Frank rescued from the horrors of Bergen Belsen concentration camp has met the British officer who saved her mother's life. Grateful Elizabeth Kahn, 59, flew to Israel to meet Major Leonard Berney, 93, from Plymouth, Devon, and present him with a special silver platter paid for by the family in recognition of his heroics. Jewish Leonard, of the British 11th Armoured division, was one of the first army officers through the gates of Belsen when the camp was liberated on April 15, 1945. Before the Holocaust: A school photo from 1941 shows Nanette Blitz Konig (left), aged 12, a classmate of Anne Frank (right) Recognition: Elizabeth Kahn, 59, with Major Leonard Berney, 93, in Haifa, Israel. The former British Army officer rescued her mother Nanette Blitz Konig from the hell of Bergen Belsen . It is estimated that 50,000 inmates died in the notorious northwest German camp between 1941 and 1945. Elizabeth's mother, Nanette Blitz Konig, 84, from Holland and who was mentioned in Anne Frank's world-famous diary, was in the horror camp and acted as translator for Leonard. At the then 16-year-old's request, the Major sent a letter to her relatives in north London to tell them she was alive before helping her get flown to safety. The war hero visited Mrs Blitz Konig in London in 1949 to make sure she was safe and that was the last time they had any contact. Mr Berney, who worked in the clothing industry after the war until his retirement in 1977 and now lives on a cruise ship, said: 'It was a complete surprise to meet Elizabeth and to remember the story about me and her mother. 'I must admit, I do not remember much about the specific story as I was very busy handling so many prisoners at the time and working on an enormous amount of stuff.' Leonard Berney, pictured in 1939 in London, was one of the first in when Bergen Belsen was liberated . he added: 'Having seen the copies of the letters I wrote I must have been keen on helping her. It is incredible. I am very happy that the mum survived and has had a happy life with a wonderful family. 'I must have used her as a translator as she spoke English, I would have done that as most people there did not and it would have been helpful. 'I followed up on her as well afterwards in London so I must have taken an interest. I was very honoured and grateful to the family for giving me the silver plate. It was very touching.' Nanette Blitz Konig, 84 and husband John, 86, at home in Sao Paulo, Brazil. She said the Major was a key reason she survived . Major Berney, pictured in Spain in 2008, was decorated for his efforts at the concentration camp . Mrs Blitz Konig, 84, who has lived in . Sao Paolo, Brazil, since 1953 and has three children, six grandchildren . and three great grandchildren, said: 'He was a big factor in the reason I . did survive. 'The amazing . thing is amidst this absolute horrendous overwhelming situation which no . normal person can ever understand, he saw the time to help me. 'I asked him to write a letter to my aunties but wasn't to know that he actually did. 'The British forces were not prepared for anything they saw, nobody can ever be prepared for something like that. 'Whoever . came out of this horrendous war were traumatised out of their minds. You cannot just shake it off, the human mind doesn't have a delete . button.' A family portrait in 1963.

Act of kindness: A letter written by Leonard on April 21 1945 to Nanette's aunties in London informing them she was alive. The inscription reads: 'Whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world' A family photo in 1938. Nanette, aged nine, is in the front row in the dress in the middle . Anne Frank died in Bergen Belsen in March 1945 but her wartime notes, 'The Diary of a Young Girl' gained international fame. Mrs . Blitz Konig said of her friend: 'In 1941 in Holland they organised 25 . schools for Jewish students. I was in the same school as Anne Frank . which was a coincidence. Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from Germany in 1933. By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped. In 1942 the family went into hiding in the hidden rooms of Otto Frank's office building . But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945. Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame. 'I . am the only one in that class who met her again in Bergen Belsen. I was . in camp seven and she was in camp eight, I saw her through the barbed . wire. 'I met her several . times and it was from Anne that I learnt what was happening in . Auschwitz. 'She told me about her diary and that she wanted to use it for . a book after the war, she never wanted to publish a diary. 'I don't know how we recognised each other as we were both skeletons.' Miami-based Elizabeth contacted Leonard's son, John Wood, 53, of East Grinstead, West Sussex, on Facebook to try and arrange a meeting. Elizabeth, who is making a documentary about the experience, said: 'It was wonderful to meet him, amazing. 'Initially when I heard he was alive and speaking on Belsen I almost passed out. It was very emotional. 'He played such an important and enormous role in my mother's survival. 'He really tried to get her to England but she was flown on an RAF plane to Holland and that was his doing. He must have been involved. 'He recognised his writing and the letters and was thrilled. 'It was great to go back to Israel after 30 years and speak to him. He rarely shows emotion but if you read between the lines you can see the pain. It is an extraordinary story. 'He was absolutely the typical English army officer, an amazing man. I think he is open and ready to meet the rest of the family.'","Leonard Berney, 93, was one of the first through the gates at Bergen Belsen .

"Animals in a Ukrainian zoo have been left to die of starvation in the wake of the country’s political turmoil, it has been claimed. The director of Kharkiv Zoo blamed Ukraine’s warring politicians for failing to provide funds, saying the zoo only have enough food to last until Monday. Alexey Grigoriev is said to be ‘in tears’ over the plight of the animals, and has pleaded with the prime minister for help. Starving: Staff at Kharkiv Zoo, Ukraine say a pregnant elephant, claimed to be 'hungry and on the point of expiring from exhaustion' ’Our animals are not fighting for power, they do not share anyone's political views, they just want to live,’ said a statement by the zoo. ‘Without emergency measures, our completely innocent animals will start dying next week.’ A pregnant elephant was hungry and on the point of expiring from exhaustion, it was claimed. Local reports say funds earmarked for the zoo have been sent elsewhere. At risk: The zoo only has food for their animals until Monday as a result for political turmoil in Ukraine . Not enough: The director of Kharkiv Zoo blamed Ukraine¿s warring politicians for failing to provide funds .

"His name is Snuffles and all he wants is a loving family to take him into a new home. But it seems when potential owners see him, they turn their noses up. Why? Because this particular pooch has two noses. Unfortunate: Snuffles is struggling to find a home because of his peculiar facial feature . The unfortunate dog, who is a Belgian Shepherd, is currently being looked after by staff at the Dog's Rehoming Centre in Uddingston, Glasgow. The German Shepherd cross was handed . to the centre by the local dog warden, and staff at the trust are . worried his bizarre looks will get him overlooked. He has a rare congenital defect which gives him the appearance of having two noses. Vet Angela McAllister said: 'Instead of his nostrils being fused together he's got some sort of split there. 'It's a defect in his palate which gives him the appearance of having two noses as his nostrils can move completely independently of each other. 'I've never seen the condition in my 20-year career.' As . other dogs around him are rehomed, he is struggling to attract a new . owner, despite being at the centre for more than a month. He is only four-months old and has already been in four previous . homes in his short life. But he has been given an endearing name by staff to make him feel at home. Striking: The dog has four nostrils, an attribute potential owners seem to dislike when they see Snuffles . Supportive: Staff at the care home gave him the endearing name because of his odd appearance . To add to his unique appearance Snuffles can also move both noses independently of each other. The centre's manager Sandra Lawton said: 'We take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but I have never seen anything quite like Snuffles. 'It is such a shame to think that this sweet-natured lad may not find the loving home he deserves just because he may not be considered a pretty pooch. Turning their noses up: When owners look down at the German Shephard cross, they see his weirdly partitioned nose . While other dogs have more success when it comes to finding a new home at the Dogs Trust centre, Snuffles has found it tough . Obedient: Staff at the centre say Snuffles would be a perfect dog to train . 'He is an affectionate, energetic . fun-loving boy who adores his carers. He needs an active family and . could live with a compatible dog and children over the age of 14. 'He may not have been blessed with the looks of Lassie but he has a heart of gold and really can claim to be a dog in several million."" Emma Louise Livingstone, supporter relations officer at the Dog's Trust said: 'He is just a typical, fun, bouncy puppy. 'He is very keen to learn and would be perfect to train up for any potential owner.' Young: The puppy is only four months old, but has already been rehomed four times . Desperate: Staff said he was just a 'typical,. bouncy puppy' who really wanted to find a home . Homeless: He was handed into the centre by his former owner . Things looking up? Staff at the centre say he is an energetic puppy, despite failing to attract an owner . The deformed calf which was born with two heads in Morocco . The piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was born with three eyes and two mouths . In December, a village in northern Morocco was shocked by the birth of a two-headed calf. The young animal was named Sana Saida, which means 'Happy New Year' in Arabic. After its birth, the creature attracted a lot of attention, with . locals of Sefrou, a village less than 20 miles from Fez, flocking to the . farm to see it. The calf is known as polycephalic, which means having more than one head. Just a few days earlier, a two-headed piglet came into the world among a litter of 10 that was born in Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi Province. Unfortunately for the animal, vets said it would find it very hard to survive with the mutation. In June, the San Antonio Zoo in Texas also welcomed a bizarre addition - a two-headed turtle they named Thelma and Louise. The . female Texas cooter was born with four others on June 18 displayed at the zoo's Friedrich Aquarium - swimming and walking as . normally as her one-headed brothers and sisters. The condition is supposedly common among snakes and turtles. In 2011, a piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was been born with three eyes and two mouths. Xiao . Jintu, owner of a local pig farm, said the piglet was one from a . 12-strong litter. 'It came out 5th and I was stunned in seeing its . appearance', he said. In 2009, a snake with two heads was . found in a drawer full of rubbish in the US, while a cat suffering the . same deformity was born in Australia a year earlier. In 2008, Fisherman Christopher Johnson found a pregnant bull shark in the Indian Ocean. When he cut it's stomach open, he found a foetus of a two-headed baby inside. Scientists said it was the first time the condition has been seen in a shark. Potential career?

"Pope Francis attacked the right to die movement saying euthanasia is a 'sin' Pope Francis denounced the right to die movement saying it was a 'false sense of compassion' to consider euthanasia as an act of dignity when in fact it's a sin against God and creation. His intervention in the end of life debate came after the Vatican's top bioethics official condemned as 'reprehensible' the assisted suicide of an American woman, Brittany Maynard, who was suffering terminal brain cancer and said she wanted to die with dignity. Francis didn't refer to the Maynard case specifically when he made the comments to the Association of Italian Catholic Doctors at the weekend. While denouncing euthanasia in general, he also condemned abortion, in vitro fertilization -or 'the scientific production of a child' - and embryonic stem cell research -or 'using human beings as laboratory experiments to presumably save others.' 'This is playing with life,' he said. 'Beware, because this is a sin against the creator, against God the creator.' While shying away from hot-button, culture war issues such as abortion, Francis has spoken out frequently about euthanasia. He considers the assisted suicide movement as a symptom of today's 'throw-away culture' that views the sick and elderly as useless drains on society. Francis urged doctors to take 'courageous and against-the-grain' decisions to uphold church teaching on the dignity of life, even if it requires resorting to conscientious objection.

"A woman is going to refund the US government for the medical evacuation of her husband, a surgeon who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone. Dr. Martin Salia, who was diagnosed with Ebola on Monday, continued treatment Sunday at a biocontainment unit in Nebraska where two other people with the disease have been successfully treated. He landed at Eppley Airfield in Omaha on Saturday afternoon and was taken by ambulance to the Nebraska Medical Center. The U.S. Department of State said in a release that Salia's wife 'has agreed to reimburse the U.S. Government for any expense.' The Department of State said it helped facilitate the transfer of Salia; the U.S. Embassy in Freetown said he paid for the expensive evacuation. ABC News reported a private air ambulance may cost upward of $100,000. Scroll down for video . Family: Dr. Martin Salia, right, seen with wife Isatu Salia, is currently being treated for Ebola in Nebraska. The Department of State has said Mrs. Salia 'has agreed to reimburse the U.S. Government for any expense' Transport: Health workers in protective suits carry  Dr. Martin Salia from a jet that brought him from Sierra Leone to an ambulance that took him to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha on Saturday . Expensive? The aircraft carrying Dr. Martin Salia is seen landing on Saturday. It has been reported that a private air ambulance may cost upward of $100,000 . Doctor: Salia has been working as a general surgeon at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown . The travel costs and care of other Ebola patients flown to the U.S. have been covered by the groups they worked for in West Africa. Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that when she spoke to her husband early Friday his voice sounded weak and shaky. But he told her 'I love you' in a steady voice, she said. The two prayed together, and their children, ages 12 and 20, are coping, Isatu Salia said, calling her husband 'my everything.' Nebraska Medical Center spokesman Taylor Wilson said members of Salia's family were not at the hospital Saturday, but were expected to arrive 'in the near future.' Discovery: Salia, a Sierra Leone citizen who lives in Maryland, first showed Ebola symptoms on November 6 but tested negative for the virus. He eventually tested positive on Monday . The team caring for Dr. Salia in Sierra Leone indicated he was critically ill and 'possibly sicker than the first patients successfully treated in the United States' Family: Isatu Salia has said she and husband Dr. Martin Salia have prayed together and that their children, ages 12 and 20, are coping . Arrival: Salia's ambulance to the hospital was accompanied by a single Nebraska State Patrol cruiser and a fire department vehicle . Loved one: Isatu Salia has said that her husband Dr. Martin Salia told her 'I love you' in a steady voice during a Friday phone call . The hospital said the medical crew that accompanied Salia, 44, from West Africa determined he was stable enough to fly, but that the team caring for him in Sierra Leone indicated he was critically ill and 'possibly sicker than the first patients successfully treated in the United States.' The disease has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leona. Of the 10 people treated for the disease in the U.S., all but one has recovered. Salia's ambulance to the hospital was accompanied by a single Nebraska State Patrol cruiser and a fire department vehicle - a subdued arrival in contrast to the August delivery of Dr. Rick Sacra, whose ambulance was flanked by numerous police cars, motorcycles and fire vehicles. Salia has been working as a general surgeon at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. It's not clear whether he was involved in the care of Ebola patients. Kissy is not an Ebola treatment unit, but Salia worked in at least three other facilities, United Methodist News said, citing health ministry sources. Salia, a Sierra Leone citizen who lives in Maryland, first showed Ebola symptoms on November 6 but tested negative for the virus. He eventually tested positive on Monday. Sierra Leone is one of the three West Africa nations hit hard by an Ebola epidemic this year.

"With their long glossy hair, heavy make-up and perfect skin, at first glance these glamourous women  appear to make the perfect companions. But look a little closer and their vacant stares give away the fact that they are in fact astonishingly realistic silicone love dolls, which sell for upwards of £1,000. Their owners, who enjoy long-term relationships with the dolls, were captured on camera by Copenhagen-based photojournalist Benita Marcussen, who approached the men via online forums - one of the only places where many of them can be open about their dolls - and spent nearly a year gaining their trust before photographing them  for her series Men & Dolls. For some of the owners, the life-sized dolls are their sole companion, others are married with children, and in a few cases the dolls have filled the space left by lost loved ones following death or divorce. Living doll: Phil stopped smoking for a year to be able to afford his doll Jessica, and his friends all know of her existence. He says he is under no illusions that she is a doll, and not a real woman, but does not care what anyone thinks about his choice of lifestyle . Collector: Everard, pictured in his garden with his doll Anouska, has collected dolls for years and prefers silicone models instead of the softer versions, known as 'teddy-babes'. His haul of 12 dolls includes figures made in the US, Russia and Asia dolls. He has eight bodies, but four extra faces, enabling him to create new dolls . Secret companion: Sam has had Paula for years, and although his wife is accepting of the doll, he keeps her out of their house and daily lives so their children who still live at home do not find out about her. The bands around the doll's wrists are protecting them as they are very fragile and are starting to come loose . Film star: This face of 'Bianca' was used in the 2007 comedy film Lars And The Real girl, starring Ryan Gosling. She was bought by a collector who says her identity is now that of a movie star . Starring role: Bianca with actor Ryan Gosling in the film, which told the story of a young man, played by Gosling, who developed a romantic relationship with a love doll . Embrace: Photographer Benita Marcussen got to meet some of the owners at a convention in Wales. Pictured is one, 'Shadowman' with his doll Carly at his Welsh hotel. He has a girlfriend and two adult daughters, and besides Carly has four other dolls which are not part of his daily life, but his friends and family know of their existance . Open: Shadowman cuddles up to Carly. She is a 'teddy-babe', which are known for being softer and easier to carry than a silicone model. Their average weight 11 lbs and they can easily be stored in a suitcase. Their skin is made of soft velour and they are most often used by their owners for hugging and sleeping next to . Photoshoot: Owners Clemens (left), Robert (centre) and Shadowman (right) arrange their dolls for a photoshoot at Llanthony Priory abbey in south east Wales. Clemens had forgotten to bring shoes for his doll Mariam, but Robert  had brought an extra pair for his doll Cathy so shared them with his friend . Friend: It is not just men who find companionship with the lifelike mannequins. Angela, pictured with Anna, bought her first doll in 2014 and owns two faces for the model so she can change her look and personality . One of the family: Kharn, (right), 56, and his doll Alektra. He was divorced from his wife 20 years ago and did try dating, but after eight years still had not met the right woman, sparking his interest in dolls. He bought the first one in 1998, and although he still has her she is packed away. Alektra, who is modelled on American porn actress Alektra Blue, is his latest purchase. Kharn does not have a sexual relationship with Alektra and does not see her as a girlfriend, but solely as a doll who he likes to photograph but who will never be able to replace a real woman. He is still hoping to meet the  love of his life . Secrecy: An owner who calls himself 'Baron von Doll' with Tania. Like many people in the doll community he has chosen to stay anonymous as enthusiasts often experience negative reactions, and often choose to keep the dolls secretly in their homes . Painful experience: In 1986, after having their first child, Chris's wife filed for divorce and he was unable to have any contact with his daughter for several years. He eventually managed to track her down on social media and although they are now reunited, he still does not understand why he and his ex-wife were unable to communicate better while their daughter was growing up. The bad experience of the divorce affected his relationships with women, and he still has not been able to find love. On the bed lies (left) Lala Salama, whose name means 'sweet dreams' in swahili, and who he uses to cuddle up to at night. Sharon (right) is named after the character played by  Canadian actress Grace Park on the SyFy Channel's series Battlestar Galactica . Tragedy: After loosing his wife to cancer 'Deerman' tried to meet someone new, but found the women he liked were not interested in him. Years later he bought a doll who looks similar to his wife and named her Erica. Deerman's youngest daughter knows of his interest in dolls . Mobility: Moving the dolls around the house can cause  back pain if they are not lifted correctly, and because the dolls are so fragile their PVC or metal skeleton can push through the silicone skin if they are dropped or damaged. Pictured is Everard with his doll Faina . Happiness: A doll owner who prefers to be known as 'Nescio50' (just seen), with his doll Lily. He has chosen to remain anonymous as he says society still has a hard time accepting his choice to live with dolls. He has told his parents about his dolls, but his mother has told him that she would prefer it if he lived with a real woman. Nescio50 has never had a girlfriend and says the dolls make him happy . Three's company: Lily is positioned in front of the computer, while Sasha and Nescio50 relax on the sofa at his home . Wardrobe: Nescio50 shares his wardrobe space with his three dolls, and says that their outfits take up most of the space . Damaged: The silicone dolls, such as Courtney (pictured) can be very fragile and often get small injuries, such as this cracking around the doll's mouth. Often owners can send them back to the factory to be repaired . Manufacture: A doll is prepared to be shipped from manufacturers Abyss Creation in California, while other dolls, seen behind her, are assembled. Each silicone doll takes around 80 hours to produce, with the price varying from around £1,000 to £30,000. Many doll owners use them as sex toys or for erotic fantasies, but some only use their dolls for art and photographic objects . Personality: A doll in a box is ready to be shipped from Abyss Creation. With many of the models it is possible to change the face on the body, allowing doll owners to alter the mood or personality of the mannequin .","Realistic silicone love dolls sell for upwards of £1,000 and can reach £33,000 for specialist models .

"Karl Stefanovic's blue suit is now world famous after the internet went 'a little bit crazy' over the fact the television presenter had been wearing the same thing every day for a year. The Today show co-host has worn the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry. Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. Scroll down for video . Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic has worn the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry . The Channel Nine presenter's year-long suit-wearing investigation came to light on Saturday and Stefanovic was still wearing it on Monday morning when he spoke of the hype surrounding it . The Channel Nine presenter's year-long suit-wearing investigation came to light on Saturday via Fairfax Media and Stefanovic was still wearing it on Monday morning when he spoke of the hype surrounding it. 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).' Stefanovic's  experiment has since sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post. He has worn the suit everyday and just changed his shirt and tie. The Channel Nine presenter conducted the year-long experiment into the double standards faced by his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson . Stefanovic (pictured with Richard Wilkins (left) and Ben Fordham (right) said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year . 'It does get a little bit stinky,' he quipped on the Today show on Monday. 'It has been dry-cleaned a couple of times and it gets harder and harder to wear.' The experiment was a show of support for Wilkinson who gave a speech 12 months ago on the pressures and scrutiny women in television faced on a daily basis. 'Some people have called it reverse sexism, or whatever it is, I don’t know whether it is that because can sexism be women judging mainly other women?' Stefanovic said. 'I think in this situation for women on TV, it’s mainly women judging women and what they wear.' Wilkinson said: 'From the emails I've received in this job, most have been from women and I don't know how we got into that space where it leans to a lack of support.' Stefanovic said his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson (left) regularly copped criticism about the way she looked . Stefanovic's sexism stance garnered worldwide attention with feminist website Jezabel among those to weigh in on the experiment. Reporter Isha Aran wrote: 'As hilarious and interesting as this is, he simply proved something we all already know, the double standard women deal with on a day-to-day basis'. MTV.com quipped that everyone should pitch in for his dry cleaning bill. 'Stefanovic’s experiment is definitely hilarious but it also shines an important light on what his female colleagues have to deal with every day,' they wrote. The experiment was a show of support for Wilkinson who gave a speech 12 months ago on the pressures and scrutiny women in television face on a daily basis . Stefanovic's experiment has since sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post . While Stefanovic said he was showing support for his co-host, female television hosts on other networks have also copped similar criticisms on their appearance. Samantha Armytage, co-host of Channel Seven's Sunrise breakfast program, was ridiculed earlier this year after a newspaper published photos of her in everyday clothes outside of work. 'She's a mate and she was hurt by that... and I can understand. You've got to have a thick skin in TV but there's a limit.,' Stefanovic told Fairfax Media. Just last month, ABC News Breakfast host Virginia Trioli made headlines after a viewer told her she needed a makeover and wasn't paying enough attention to her appearance. The veteran journalist posted a copy of the letter on social media to highlight the scrutiny she faced. Stefanovic in the same blue cheap Burberry suit with co-host Lisa Wilkinson and Tim Cahill . Social media jumped to support Stefanovic's experiment, labelling it 'magnificent', 'fabulous' Social media have jumped to support Stefanovic's experiment, labelling it 'magnificent', 'fabulous' and calling him 'a legend' and 'as big as Kim Kardashian's butt'. Others wondered whether the message would make any impact and commented that women in the media could not avoid being criticised. 'Stefanovic has shown, no matter what a man chooses to wear within a limited scope he will not be examined by the public. Female talk show hosts do not have that option. That's the point I think is being made. Female talk show hosts cannot escape this scrutiny,' said one Twitter user. Another pointed out that 'Female talk show hosts constantly have their wardrobe choices and bodies examined by the public. This is a consequence of being female. Being female in the workplace means there is no single way of dressing, so there is no escaping the criticism or admiration of the public.'","Australian TV host, Karl Stefanovic, has worn the same suit for a year to prove a point about double standards for men and women .

Boneco the donkey carries out his beekeeping duties in a head-to-toe custom made suit in Itatira, Brazil . The unlikely pair are now among the most successful beekeepers in the region. ‘The donkey is the only one in the entire Brazil that does this job,’ Mr Juraci told Brazilian television station, G1 Ceara. Of the 120 beekeepers in the rural town, Mr Juraci and his donkey Boneco harvest nine litres of honey each day – more than most farmers can manage alone. He turned to honey production 10 years ago when regular farming proved too difficult due to the region’s arid climate. Manuel Juraci, 59, created the protective suit for Boneco so they could increase the amount of honey they collect . The Association of Honey Producers recently approached Mr Juraci to see if he could produce custom suits for their animals. While he is still considering the offer, he said it was not only Boneco’s suit that led to his success as a honey farmer. ‘Not to discount the others but Boneco is a faithful friend,’ he said. Boneco's unusual beekeeping suit has caught the eye of the Association of Honey Producers who want custom suits for their own animals . But Boneco isn’t the only beekeeping animal. Bazz the black Labrador was specially trained by Australian beekeeper Josh Kennett to detect by smell a killer bee disease called American foulbrood.

Nice declined to disclose the name of the group, but he said he believed Winebrenner knew the suspect. Ivery came into the pub separately and 'was being very unruly,' Nice said. The pub's management asked Ivery to leave, which he did, but he came back shortly and had a gun. 'At this point, the restaurant patrons looked to Officer Winebrenner, knowing he's an officer, and needed his help,' Nice said. 'Officer Winebrenner began to deal with Mr. Ivery as a law enforcement officer. Ivery shot him at that point.' Condolences: Just hours after his death, condolences and 'R.I.P's' flooded Twitter as many recalled memories of the deceased officer . Likable Guy: Police Chief James Nice described Winebrenner as a good-natured officer: 'He's a well-liked guy — just a really friendly, likable guy.'

"Warning: 'There is a lot of ignorance and rather dim-witted prejudice of Christianity,' outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said . The Archbishop of Canterbury announced his decision to stand down yesterday – and took a parting shot at the 'dim-witted prejudice' of those who are trying to suppress Christianity. Dr Rowan Williams said he will quit at the end of the year to return to academic life as master of a Cambridge University college. Hinting at the pressures of the job, he said he hoped his successor would have 'the constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros'. His departure came at a time of continuing rancour inside the Church over the rights of gay clergy and the appointment of women bishops. Outside there is deepening controversy as ministers try to impose same-sex marriage and remove the right of Christians to wear the cross. But Dr Williams said he believes Christianity will survive the assault of those who believe faith has no place in public life. 'I think there is a great deal of interest still in the Christian faith,' he said. 'Although I think there is also a lot of ignorance and rather dim-witted prejudice about the visible manifestations of Christianity, which sometimes clouds the discussion. 'I don't think that there is somehow a single great argument that the Church is losing.' The Archbishop, 61, resigned after ten years at Lambeth Palace, a shorter tenancy than his predecessor Lord Carey, who was five years older than Dr Williams when he chose to retire. His period in office as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury was marked by difficulties and continual church in-fighting. Dr Williams, who is married to theologian Jane Williams, is known as a warm and humorous man, who said early in his tenure that he liked to watch The Simpsons cartoon series with his two children. He is known not to carry a mobile phone and also told the New Statesman in 2008 that The Muppet Christmas Carol was one of his favourite films. Past and future? Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, left, is now tipped to replace Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, right, who announced his departure yesterday . Dr Williams and his wife have been . careful to keep their children, Pip, now 16 and doing his GCSEs, and his . daughter Rhiannon, who is 24 and doing a master's degree, out of the . public eye. A favoured candidate of Church . liberals, Dr Williams had the worst possible start as Archbishop when he . was faced with the selection for the first time ever of an openly gay . priest for a bishop's job. The choice of Canon Jeffrey John as . Bishop of Reading was almost certainly inspired by the assumption in . 2003 that the new Archbishop, a long-time supporter of gay rights, would . warmly endorse the appointment. Crowning moment: Dr Williams married Prince William and Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29 last year in front of millions across Britain and the world . But Dr Williams forced Dr John to step down and the powerful CofE gay lobby has never forgiven him. The Archbishop however can look back . on success in promoting the cause of women bishops and the personal and . corporate success of William and Kate's royal wedding last year. He will . relinquish his role in December to take up the post of Master of . Magdalene College in Cambridge. His decision to step down won warm . tributes, particularly from the colleague who is favourite to succeed . him, Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu. Maverick: The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu is a seen both as a visionary and controversial character who is known for stunts like sky-diving with the Red Devils, pictured in 2008, as well as cutting up his dog collar on live TV . Dr Sentamu said: 'Archbishop Rowan is a . remarkable and gifted leader who has strengthened the bonds of . affection.' David Cameron said: 'As a man of great learning and . humility, he has guided the Church through times of challenge and . change.' Dr Williams gave an interview in which . he let slip his impatience with some secular critics of Christianity . and spoke of the pressures of his job. I think that it is a job of . immense demands and I would hope that my successor has the constitution . of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros really. 'But he will, I think, have to look . with positive, hopeful eyes on a Church which, for all its problems, is . still for so many people a place to which they resort in times of need . and crisis, a place to which they look for inspiration. 'I think the . Church of England is a great treasure.' Dr Williams' own worst moment is . likely to have been his speech on sharia law in 2008, when his  advocacy . of the legal recognition of Islamic law in Britain  briefly threatened . to tip him out of Lambeth Palace. The hot favourite to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury and first black leader of the Anglican Church has become well known for his strong opinions on the state of British society. Dr Sentamu, pictured right, the sixth of 13 brothers and . sisters, and a former barrister and judge, came to the UK in 1974 having . fled Uganda where he was a critic of the dictator Idi Amin. Dubbed by some as 'cleric of the people' he has most recently had a public row with the Government over gay marriage, accusing David Cameron of acting like a . ‘dictator’ and overruling the Bible if he chose to legalise it. He attracted controversy - and racist emails - when he spoke out against this issue. Recently he also launched a tirade against Britain's financial institutions and bankers for their role in the collapse of the UK economy. Using the words of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, he said: 'Banks are more dangerous than a standing army. They can destroy individuals, communities and nations.' Famously in 2007 he cut up his dog collar on live television in a dramatic protest against Robert Mugabe’s rule, vowing never to wear the symbol of his office again until the Zimbabwe president had been removed from power. He has also pitched a tent and camped in York Minster for a week, and sky-dived to raise money for families of servicemen wounded or killed in Afghanistan. In an attack on England he also argued the country must do more to mark St George’s Day on April 23, warning a failure to do so would lead to greater political extremism. Dr Sentamu’s enthronement in 2005 featured a ceremony with African singing and dancing and contemporary music, with the cleric playing African drums during the service. Such is his popularity in his archdiocese of York that he was named Yorkshire Man of the Year in 2007. As Bishop of Stepney in east London, Dr Sentamu acted as an adviser to the inquiry into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. He has also campaigned against guns, knives, drugs and gangs. Dr Sentamu is married with two grown-up children and two grown-up foster children.","Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu is tipped to replace him when he leaves at the end of the year .

"Dr. Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, is in extremely critical condition on Sunday at a Nebraska hospital . A surgeon who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone is in extremely critical condition on Sunday at a Nebraska hospital, his doctors said. Dr. Martin Salia, who was diagnosed with Ebola on Monday, arrived in Omaha on Saturday to be treated at the Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit that has successfully treated two other Ebola patients this fall. Salia is 'extremely ill,' said Dr. Phil Smith, who is helping oversee Salia's treatment. The 44-year-old Salia might be more ill than the first Ebola patients successfully treated in the United States, according to the hospital. 'This is an hour-by-hour situation,' Smith said on Sunday, adding that a team of specialists is treating Salia's most serious issues. 'We will do everything humanly possible to help him fight this disease.' Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leona. Of the 10 people treated for the virus in the U.S., all but one has recovered. After Salia arrived in Omaha, his ambulance to the hospital was accompanied by a single Nebraska State Patrol cruiser and a fire department vehicle - a subdued arrival in contrast to the August delivery of Dr. Rick Sacra, whose ambulance was flanked by numerous police cars, motorcycles and fire vehicles. Salia has been working as a general surgeon at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. It's not clear whether he was involved in the care of Ebola patients. Kissy is not an Ebola treatment unit, but Salia worked in at least three other facilities, United Methodist News said, citing health ministry sources. Scroll down for video . Touch down: Health workers in protective suits transport Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon working in West Africa who had been diagnosed with Ebola, from a jet that brought him from Sierra Leone to a waiting ambulance that will take him to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday . Salia, a Sierra Leone citizen who lives in Maryland, first showed Ebola symptoms on November 6 but tested negative for the virus. He eventually tested positive on Monday. The U.S. State Department said it helped facilitate the transfer of Salia; the U.S. Embassy in Freetown said he paid for the expensive evacuation. The travel costs and care of other Ebola patients flown to the U.S. have been covered by the groups they worked for in West Africa. Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, said in a telephone interview that when she spoke to her husband early Friday his voice sounded weak and shaky. But he told her 'I love you' in a steady voice, she said. The two prayed together, and their children, ages 12 and 20, are coping, Isatu Salia said, calling her husband 'my everything.' Arrival: Dr. Salia left landed in Nebraska from Freetown, Sierra Leone, on Saturday amid high security . Transport: The driver of the ambulance carrying Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon working in Sierra Leone who had been diagnosed with Ebola, gives a thumbs-up sign as he heads  to the Nebraska Medical Center . Treatment: Dr. Martin Salia is placed on a stretcher upon his arrival at the Nebraska Medical Center Biocontainment Unit in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday November 15, 2014 . Nebraska Medical Center spokesman Taylor Wilson said members of Salia's family were not at the hospital on Saturday, but were expected to arrive 'in the near future.' Sierra Leone is one of the three West Africa nations hit hard by an Ebola epidemic this year. Five other doctors in Sierra Leone have contracted Ebola, and all have died. Dr. Salia is the third Ebola patient to be treated by the UNMC, one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients. Both of the previous patients survived. 'Just as we have done in previous cases, every precaution is being taken to ensure the evacuation is completed safely and securely, that critical care is provided en route, and that strict isolation is maintained,' said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. 'We immediately started preparing the unit and notifying staff members of this possibility,' biocontainment unit medical director Phil Smith said in a statement. Wife: Isatu Salia, seen here with her husband, described him as 'caring' and 'hardworking'. She will now travel to Nebraska to be with him . Scene: The UNMC in Omaha is one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients . 'We've obviously been through this a couple of times before so we know what to expect.' There are currently no cases of Ebola in the United States, where nine people have been treated for the killer virus. Dr. Salia is the tenth. Only one - Liberian-born Thomas Eric Duncan - has died from the disease on U.S. soil. The cases are part of the deadliest Ebola outbreak ever, which has killed more than 5,100 people in West Africa and infected nearly 15,000 in total, mostly in hardest hit Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Despite some hopeful signs - Liberia has lifted its state of emergency and the DR Congo announced the end of its own, unrelated, outbreak of Ebola - the recent deaths of three people in Mali have fueled fears of a new African hotspot. Epidemic: . Health workers prepare to carry the body of an Ebola virus victim in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, as the country tried to combat the Ebola virus disease outbreak . Ebola outbreak in West Africa . Health workers from the Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team 7 place a body in a grave at King Tom cemetary in Freetown on November 12, 2014. Dr. Martin Salia arrived in the U.S. from Freetown on Saturday . There is no known cure for Ebola, one of the deadliest known pathogens, but trials for several possible treatments were announced this week in West Africa and Canada. The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids. Salia received his surgical training from a group called the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons, which seeks to train African doctors on a level comparable to training they would receive in the U.S., said Richard Toupin, of Auburn, Indiana, a fellow medical missionary. 'He is one of the best-trained surgeons in his country,' Toupin said. 'He is a very competent surgeon.' Bruce Steffes, executive director of PAACS, said Salia graduated from the surgical training program in 2008. The training includes a requirement to practice in Africa for four years after completion. As a result, Steffes said, Salia was free to practice anywhere he wanted, but elected to stay in Sierra Leone, where the need for surgeons is immense. Dr Salia (pictured, second right, with his wife and sons) was born in Sierre Leone, but is a permanent resident of the U.S. who lives in Maryland with his family . Sons: The medic, who has at least two sons, including Hinwaii (left) and Maada (right), came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6. Tests results on Monday were positive, according to the official . 'People like Martin are just absolutely dedicated, highly trained... and doing their best in absolutely horrifying conditions,' Steffes said. Jeff Bleijerveld, director of global ministries for the United Brethren in Christ church, said he last talked to Salia in February 2013, when they met to discuss planning for a hospital in the southern part of Sierra Leone. He recalled watching Salia perform a hernia surgery on a young boy, assisted by a handyman who was not actually a doctor. He recalled Salia leading the surgical team in prayer before the operation. The United Brethren played an early role in Salia's medical training. 'He's a quiet leader,' Bleijerveld said. 'Our people still have a real affection for him.'","Dr. Martin Salia, 44,  is undergoing treatment at the the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha .

"Two infamously flashy sons of arrested Sinaloa drug king pin El Chapo could see their flamboyant lifestyle slip away soon. Jorge Martín Torres was arrested last week and officials at his Thursday bond hearing said Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman's sons Alfredo and Ivan Guzmán--known for their social media accounts filled with photos of guns, cars, jets and women--got their flashy goods with the 37-year-old's help. Specifically, a DEA agent in San Antonia testified that Torres helped El Chapo's sons gain access to exotic cars and a twin-engine jet they used to transport cocaine and to avoid capture, reports Chron.com. And after their brother Ismael Zambada Imperial, AKA 'El Mayito Gordo,' became the third El Chapo son arrested in recent years last week, some are suggesting the net is closing in on not just their source of luxury goods but also the brothers themselves. End of an era? Ivan Guzman, son of Sinaloa king pin El Chapo, has a history of showing off his luxury lifestyle on Twitter, but a man accused of enabling his big dollar purchases has been arrested . Car keys: Guzman's Twitter shows a pile of luxury car keys . Cars: The cars in Guzman's Twitter feed are seemingly endless . If kingpin's sons truly do lose access to the world's finer things with Torres' arrest, theirs will be a precipitous fall from the apex of indulgence. Ivan Guzman's Twitter account looks like something out of a hip hop music video and reveals an impossibly lavish lifestyle allegedly built on the gruesome drug cartel wars raging south of the U.S. border and fueled by America's hunger for cocaine. A pile of keys sporting the emblems of  sportscar makers are piled on a counter in one shot--a not-so-subtle nod toward the other photos that show Ivan and Alfredo's seemingly countless Maseratis, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Mercedes and the like. One photo shows Ivan giving a quick thumbs up before boarding a prop plane. Along with Alfredo's Instagram, the two men have a vivid history of showing off on social media--but how long will it continue? Just last week, another son of the alleged Sinaloa drug cartel boss Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada was captured in northwestern Mexico, a federal official said Thursday.

Sports car lovers: The Guzmans car collection includes all the biggest names--Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini and the like . The Sinaloa cartel is considered to be Mexico's largest drug trafficking organization, with a global reach as far away as Australia . Ismael Zambada Imperial, alias 'El Mayito Gordo,' was arrested in Sinaloa state and transported to Mexico City, the official told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because authorities expected to make an official announcement later in the day. The official said Zambada Imperial assumed a more prominent role in the cartel this year after his father became the top leader following the capture of capo Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman in February. He is the third of Zambada's sons to be detained in recent years. Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla was arrested in 2009 and extradited the following year to the United States, where in 2013 he pleaded guilty to a drug trafficking charge. Serafin Zambada was arrested at the end of 2013 at an Arizona border crossing. He also pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in September and faces a sentence of at least 10 years in prison. The Sinaloa cartel is considered to be Mexico's largest drug trafficking organization, with a global reach as far away as Australia.

"The Obama administration's chief spokesman confirmed on Friday that the United States is officially 'at war' with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS, also called ISIL), the terror group that has become America's top military and foreign affairs priority. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday during his daily press briefing that the battle against ISIS now mirrors the ongoing War on Terror closely enough to use the 'W' word. 'The fact is ISIL has indicated that they're ready to go to war against the world,' Earnest said, 'and this president – as is expected of American presidents – is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat and to deny ISIL a safe haven. And ultimately this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying ISIL.' 'So I think what you could conclude from this is the United States is at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates all around the globe.' Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday that the U.S. is at war with ISIS . Earlier in the day, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby raised eyebrows with a saber-rattling declaration that 'make no mistake, we know we are at war with ISIL, in the same way we are at war, and continue to be at war, with al-Qaeda and its affiliates.' But as recently as Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry insisted that it would be wrong to label U.S. counter-terror efforts against the Islamist terror group as waging war. 'What we are doing is engaging in a very significant counter-terrorism operation,' Kerry told CNN just a day ago. 'It's going to go on for some period of time. If somebody wants to think about it as being a war with ISIL, they can do so, but the fact is it's a major counter-terrorism operation that will have many different moving parts.' The U.S. effort, he said, will involve 'many different things that one doesn't think of normally in context of war.' Separately, Kerry told CBS News on Thursday that 'I don't think people need to get into war fever on this. I think they have to view it as a heightened level of counter terrorist activity.' A senior State Department official told the Fox News Channel that Friday's turnabout 'was a deliberate, administration-wide adjustment in language, which Secretary Kerry would have also used today had he been asked.' That uniformity of language was underscored an hour after Earnest spoke, when State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf briefed reporters. Not a war? Secretary of State John Kerry was in Turkey on Thursday to try to persuade President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to support a US-led coalition in the fight against ISIS . Coordination: An hour after Earnest announced that the US is 'at war,' State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters the same thing – in exactly the same words . Asked about Adm. Kirby's statement, she conceded that 'there's been a lot of questions about what words we use.' Then, reading from a binder of prepared talking points, she announced: 'We are at war with ISIL in the same way that we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates around the world.' 'To be clear about what that looks like,' she said, 'it will be a counter-terrorism campaign to take ISIL out using a broad set of tools.' Harf insisted that 'this is not the kind of Iraq war that we had talked about in the recent past.' On Friday the administration seemed to execute a complete 180-degree turn as its efforts to recruit foreign nations into a new collaboration reached a fever pitch. Retired Marine Lieutenant General John Allen has been tapped to spearhead the coalition, and will report to Kerry. ISIS fighters now number as many as 31,000, according to the CIA, including some freed from prisons by ISIS, and Sunni loyalists who have joined the fight as the group advanced across Iraq . Only Congress has the authority to declare war. It's unclear if the administration consulted with the Speaker of the House or the Senate Majority Leader before publicly changing course. President Obama's national security adviser, the much-maligned Susan Rice, also told CNN on Thursday that America's military action in Iraq and Syria 'will not' involve 'American combat forces on the ground fighting as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.' That, she said, 'is what I think the American people think of when they think of a war. So I think this is very different from that.' The question over whether or not the Obama administration was on war footing has contributed for weeks to confusion about U.S. operations in the Middle East. Obama has personally taken flak from members of Congress and the media for failing to foresee that Iraq would descend into sectarian chaos after he pulled American troops out of the country at the end of 2011 without leaving a residual force behind.","White House: 'The United States is at war'

"Rare pictures of the U.S. Navy taken during the Spanish-American war have been unearthed after being found hidden away in storage by military archivists. A box, containing about 150 original glass plate photographs, was uncovered at the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington DC, featuring images of all aspects of the war from logistics to diplomacy. They were only brought to light again when the photo archive team was preparing for a major renovation and archivists Dave Colamaria and Jon Roscoe stumbled across the pictures. Lisa Crunk, head of the photo archives branch at the Naval History and Heritage Command, said: ‘The plates were individually wrapped in tissue paper and include full captions and dates, which were likely prepared by the photographer, Douglas White. ‘Research on Mr White discovered that he was a special war correspondent of the San Francisco Examiner during the Philippines War. ‘Once it was realised what we had uncovered, there was tremendous excitement amongst the staff, especially the historians. ‘The images are an amazing find, though they were never really lost - they were simply waiting to be rediscovered.’ Plans are now in place for the entire collection to be re-housed into new archival enclosures and shelving units.

The Spanish-American war was a conflict in 1898 that ended Spain’s rule of several countries in the Americas but resulted in the United States acquiring territories in the western Pacific and Latin America. In the build-up to the conflict, Cubans were struggling for independence from Spain and American sympathy for the Cuban rebels began to grow. On February 15, 1898, the U.S. battleship the USS Maine sunk in Havana harbour with no explanation after being sent to the Cuban capital to protect U.S. citizens. Two months later, the Spanish announced an armistice but the United States then declared that Cuba had a right to independence. Spain then declared war on the U.S on April 24, with America making the same declaration a day later. With an army and navy said to be unready for war, Spain crumbled due to the strength and power of the U.S. On May 1, 1898, Admiral George Dewey led a U.S. naval squadron into Manila Bay in the Philippines, destroying the Spanish fleet there. The Spanish Caribbean fleet, under Admiral Pascual Cervera was found in Santiago harbour in Cuba and U.S. forces landed to begin slowly advancing on the city. The Spanish tried to escape and in the battle that ensued, nearly all of the Spanish ships were destroyed. Santiago then surrendered to the U.S. on July 17, 1898, ending the war. Later that year, Spain renounced all claim to Cuba, and the U.S. took control of Guam and Puerto Rico, former Spanish colonies. The sovereignty of the Philippines was also transferred to America for $20million. A year later, the Philippine-American war began after Filipino revolutionaries refused to recognise U.S. sovereignty. The conflict lasted until 1902, when provincial governments were set up in the country.","Pictures found by photo archivists at the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington DC during a renovation .

"Republicans may have overtaken Congress with the mid-term elections, but President Obama has made it known that he will make sure immigration reform happens during his next last years in the White House - even if that means taking executive action. On Sunday, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney warned the president against passing reform on his own, saying the results of the recent elections show Americans are not in favor of his policies. 'My advice to the Democrats at this point and to the president in particular is to take a breath. The president said that he was not on the ballot in the election that was just held, but that his policies were. And the American people sent a very clear message to the president about his policies. They're not happy with them,' Romney said Sunday on Face the Nation. Scroll down for video . 'Take a breath': Mitt Romney appeared on Face the Nation Sunday morning to discuss President Barack Obama's threat to use executive action to pass immigration reform . At any cost: After Republicans won back Congress in the mid-term elections, Mr Obama vowed to pass immigration reform in the last two years of his presidency, even it that means executive action. Pictured above on Sunday in Brisbane, Australia for the G20 Leaders Summit . Romney went on to call executive action an 'extra-constitutional' move that would just be 'poking an eye of the Republican leaders in Congress'. 'The president has got to learn that he lost this last election round, the American people spoke loud and clear. Let those people who were elected come together with a piece of legislation on this and other topics, and then he has a chance to veto them if he doesn't like them. But the idea of violating the principles of our constitution, which is a balance of power, checks and balances, that is something which is wrong,' Romney, former governor of Utah, said. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri criticized Romney calling executive action a 'poke in the eye', saying it is the Republican party that has brought the issue to a standstill - while also admitting she's 'not crazy' about executive action. Continuing issue: Immigration reform came to the forefront earlier this year when masses of unaccompanied minors started crossing the border,overwhelming southern border patrol officers unsure what to do with the children. Above, Central American families turn themselves into border patrol after crossing the Rio Grande from Mexico into Texas on September 8, 2014 . 'I'll tell you what a poke in the eye is,' McCaskill said. ""A poke in the eye is for the United States Senate, almost a year and a half ago, passing by a two-thirds majority a comprehensive immigration bill with Republicans voting for it from places like Tennessee and South Carolina that just got reelected by double digits. And Speaker Boehner has refused to debate one of the most complicated and difficult problems facing our country. They won't take our bill up.' 'All he has to do next week if he doesn't want the president to act is take up the Senate bill,' McCaskill added. 'Amend it, change it, put up your own bill. Let's get back to doing our work instead of just blaming the president for everything.' Last year, President Obama tried to make a change in immigration reform by supporting a bipartisan bill that was approved in the Senate. The bill focused on changing immigration policies to offer a route to citizenship for the approximate 11million undocumented workers already in the country. While that bill made it through the Senate, it still has not been brought up for a vote in the House. One of the fears if President Obama decides on executive action is whether House Republicans will shut the government down like they did over the budget for Obamacare last year. However, Romney believes that method of blocking is unlikely. 'I think there's got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the president the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop-gap solution,' Romney said.","President Obama earlier this week said he would use executive action to pass immigration reform .
Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney appeared on Face the Nation Sunday to critique that plan .
Romney said the president should 'take a breath' and work with Republicans to find a long-term solution to the issue both parties can agree on ."
"The horrifying video of the mass murder of Syrian soldiers and an American aid worker is very different from other Islamic State propaganda films. Posted Sunday morning, it shows how the jihadists are seeking to heighten the disgust they provoke. Security and military analysts believe this new tactic is a plot to lure Western and other forces into a full-scale ground offensive IS leaders think they can win. Unmasked: The 16 followers of Jihadi John prepare to behead the Syrian soldiers they have held hostage. Nasser Muthana from Cardiff is to the right of John, who is dressed in black with a balaclava . The analysts reckon IS is already reeling from air attacks that have stopped it taking the key Syrian border town of Kobane. The murder of US aid worker Peter Kassig is not shown in the latest film – thought to feature UK medical student Nasser Muthana – and he does not deliver a final message as other hostages have. There is also no announcement of the name of the next victim. And for the first time the Islamic militants give away their location – showing what is believed to be Dabiq, a town in northern Syria – in the video’s background. PROPAGANDA MASQUERADING AS A HISTORY LESSON . Lasting 15 minutes and 53 seconds, the video – titled ‘Although the disbelievers dislike it’ – starts with a documentary-style history of Islamic State since the invasion of Iraq by western allies in 2003. It is in a different style from the rest of the footage, with more sophisticated graphics, and a treatment often used for major ‘state of the nation’ productions. There are scenes of bombings, summary executions and graphic video footage of dead civilians lying in the streets. It also shows what appears to be a dead child lying on a bed covered in blood. Some of the footage of the bombings has not been seen before, though other scenes showing the summary killings of suspected Iraqi soldiers has. It is designed to incite supporters and operatives back in the UK by justifying their actions and setting the stage for the next clip. Still covered up: Jihadi John has so far shown the world only his eyes . THE RETURN OF JIHADI JOHN WITH 16 FOLLOWERS . Filmed in the desert, the self-declared murderer, known as Jihadi John, is seen leading a line of Syrian troops to their deaths. A few paces behind him – and in the middle of a 16-strong line of Islamist jihadists said to be from over six countries – is the man believed to be Muthana, a 20-year-old from Cardiff. Like the other jihadists he is unmasked. John however keeps to his habit of showing only his eyes. Muthana clutches the scruff of the neck of a Syrian soldier, whose hands are bound with plastic ties. But while the other militants have expressionless faces – this young bearded man looks menacingly into the distance. Taking the lead from John and those in the line before him, he brandishes a military knife taken from a box of weapons. The chilling sound of a blade being drawn can be heard above the sound of Islamic music in the background. The prisoners are not wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits, as in previous videos, but are dressed in black trousers and shirts. John, who has leather shoulder holsters for hand guns and a balaclava-style mask, takes centre stage. His appearance would seem to confirm his seniority and status as ‘chief executioner’ of Islamic State. The man thought to be Muthana stands to his right. John delivers his message to America and Britain before an eerie silence during which the camera zooms in on the faces of the killers, who remain impassive throughout. The scene then focuses on John – who begins to cut his prisoner’s neck – quelling suspicion that he himself did not actually perform the previous beheadings. Unlike the apparent murders of Western hostages, in which the camera cuts away at the moment their throats are cut, the killings of the soldiers are shown in full. The camera zooms in on Jihadi John and his victim who, in his final agonising moments, closes his eyes. John then looks threateningly into the camera while still holding the knife. The next clip shows a knife slicing into the necks of Syrian soldiers followed by a stream of blood that turns the sand red. The image after that shows the soldiers’ heads on top of their bent-over bodies. The mass beheading is a new departure because previous mass executions have been undertaken using guns. The fact that John’s accomplices revealed their identities suggests they have no intention of returning to their home countries. A caption refers to them as ‘hungry lions whose drink is blood and play is carnage’. SITE OF FINAL BATTLE WITH ‘CRUSADERS’ As with the other clips, it is not clear when the final scene was actually filmed – though it is claimed to have been shot in Dabiq in northern Syria. John’s face is in shadow and it is hard to make out – but his mannerisms seem to be the same as in other videos. He talks with his now-familiar London accent. An image is shown of a man’s head lying on the ground next to a man wearing desert boots – before the camera jumps to Jihadi John. Mr Kassig's beheading is not shown nor does he give a statement supporting IS propaganda in the video . While his death has not been verified, John says: ‘This is Peter Edward Kassig, a US citizen of your country. ‘Peter, who fought against the Muslims in Iraq while serving as a soldier under the American army, doesn’t have much to say. His previous cellmates have already spoken on his behalf.’ Mr Kassig’s beheading is not shown – nor does he give a statement spurting IS propaganda. He may have refused to do so – or it may mark a change in tactics by the militants. A dateline on the video says it was shot in Dabiq, near Aleppo, a place cherished by Islamic State militants. According to one reading of Islamic tradition, there will be a final battle there between good and evil – in this case Muslim and Christian armies. The ‘Western Crusaders’ will eventually be destroyed, according to the reading. Analysts said the change of location may also suggest that John and the hostages were being moved more frequently than normal to avoid coalition air strikes and to thwart rescue attempts. WHAT ABOUT THE BRITON JOHN CANTLIE? Unlike previous Islamic State beheading videos of Western hostages, there was no reference to further deaths. In the earlier films John had warned of the next hostage to die, showing a clip of them on their knees and wearing an orange jumpsuit. John Cantlie, the British journalist, is currently being held by Islamic State jihadists and has featured in several propaganda videos for the terror group . He has used the prospect of another Western death as a warning to the US and Britain against using military force in Iraq and Syria. John Cantlie, the British journalist currently being held by the Islamic State, has featured in several propaganda videos but is yet to be named by his captors as the next to be killed.","Jihadists attempt to heighten disgust with horrifying new video .

"Alleged thief: David Mejias, 44, was accused of taking a bracelet and a pocket-book from his ex . A politician who once ran for Congress has been arrested after allegedly stealing a bracelet and a $3,000 Louis Vuitton pocketbook from his ex's apartment. David Mejias, 44, a Democrat, was accused of entering the 35-year-old woman's home without permission. The lawmaker is accused of swiping the book from a counter-top at her home in Garden City, New York, around 11pm Thursday, police said. When confronted by her, he allegedly refused to leave and pushed into the woman's bedroom and took her $800 bracelet as well, the Long Island Press reported. She called 911, but Mejias, a domestic violence attorney, had left by the time police arrived. He has pleaded not guilt to charges of grand larceny and possession of stolen property. Mejias was for years part of the legislature for Nassau County, New York. He tried for a seat in the House of Representatives in 2006, but missed out. He also stood for the New York state senate in 2010, but pulled out when allegations surfaced that he was stalking an ex-girlfriend. He was arrested for the alleged stalking, but the case was dismissed. It is unclear whether she was the same woman whose property he is now accused of taking. Mejias's attorney would not comment on the allegations, except to say that he had not been accused of violence. He is due to appear in court  in late November. If convicted, Mejias could face years in prison.","David Mejias, 44 year-old Democrat, allegedly stole from ex's apartment .

"Fairly dismissed: A tribunal ruled Bemrose School was right to sack Robert Cox, pictured, after he grabbed a pupil who threw a milkshake at him . A teacher who manhandled a student after the teenager hurled a banana milkshake at him along with a torrent of abuse has lost his claim for unfair dismissal. Robert Cox, 59, was sacked by governors at Bemrose School in Derby after he was caught on CCTV aggressively pinning the 16-year-old's arms to his sides in March 2011. Mr Cox claimed he'd been unfairly dismissed, but a Nottingham employment tribunal upheld the school's decision, claiming the teacher's reaction to the milkshake-throwing was over-the-top. 'The witness statements from Mr Cox's colleagues indicated that his behaviour had been inappropriate and excessive,' the tribunal chairman said. He added that it was 'reasonable' for governors to believe he had 'escalated the situation'. Headteacher Jo Ward said the school was thrilled the tribunal agreed Mr Cox's actions amounted to gross misconduct. 'We had no option but to dismiss him,' she said. 'Two different ruling panels of governors at Bemrose School, whose members included parents and trade union members, were unanimous in their belief that Mr Cox's actions went far beyond restraining the pupil. 'Mr Cox was observed on CCTV pushing the pupil down into the chair repeatedly with excessive force - enough force to move a large dining room table and chairs several feet.' But the IT teacher, who claimed he tried to commit suicide after losing his job, said he wanted the decision reviewed and was considering a further appeal. He said: 'It was impossible to walk away . from a situation where someone was threatening to throw a chair and it . would have been negligent to ignore it. School: Governors at Bemrose School, pictured, are thrilled the tribunal upheld their decision . 'There were plenty of witnesses to what happened and for some reason they weren’t called but I want to speak to them. 'I . think this judgment sends out a message to pupils that they can do what . they want to get a teacher sacked and this leaves staff in a very . vulnerable position. 'The school has completely ignored . the Government's guidelines, which start with the premise that a teacher . should be supported in these circumstances.' Milkshake mayhem: The incident began when a 16-year-old student threw a banana milkshake at Mr Cox (stock photo) During the unfair dismissal case, the teacher told the tribunal that he had feared the boy was going to throw a chair at him. After he let the teenager go, the pupil did pick up a chair and threw it, although not at Mr Cox. Neither the boy or his parents complained to the school, but the governors decided the man had to go. At a tribunal hearing in Nottingham last month, Mr Cox said he had now been left 'unemployable' and has twice attempted suicide. He also said he feared youngsters' behaviour was getting 'out of control'. Married Mr Cox's 13-year teaching career has been ended by the episode. He said during the hearing: 'It has had a huge impact on me. I can't get another job now and our financial situation is dire, to say the least. 'In all other public buildings you see posters saying abusive language and behaviour will not be tolerated. That is not the case at Bemrose. Senior management at Bemrose don't support staff in general at all.' Today, Mrs Ward said every teacher employed at her school was trained in techniques aimed at defusing situations of conflict. She said: 'Mr Cox had every right to feel aggrieved by having milkshake thrown at him but, instead of putting this training into action, defusing the situation and reporting the incident, CCTV footage shows he adopted a confrontational approach prior to the incident and allowed his anger to govern his actions. 'We are determined to uphold the highest standards of behaviour and in no way condone the pupil's behaviour towards teaching staff. 'The pupil involved was excluded for four days and a clear message was sent to other children at the school that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.' The commotion occurred last March in the school canteen when some boys were 'acting up' in front of another teacher. Mr Cox told one of them, a year 11 pupil, to sit down, at which point the teenager launched into a tirade of verbal abuse and then threw his banana milkshake over him.","Robert Cox, 59, was fired after being caught on CCTV pinning the boy's arms to his sides in March 2011 .

"With four young children underfoot, Jamie Oliver has resorted to drastic methods of enforcing discipline. The TV chef said he gives his brood hot peppers if they misbehave. He explained: ‘I give them chillies for punishment. It is not very popular beating kids any more, it’s not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper. So you need a few options.’ Jamie Oliver with Jools and from left, daughters Poppy, 12, Petal, 5, Daisy, 11, and four-year-old son Buddy . He said he once tricked his 12-year-old daughter into eating Scotch Bonnet, a particularly fiery chilli – much to the annoyance of his wife, Jools. At the BBC Good Food Show, Oliver said: ‘Poppy was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck. In my day I would have got a bit of a telling-off but you are not allowed to do that. ‘Five minutes later she thought I had forgotten and I hadn’t. She asked for an apple. I cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with Scotch Bonnet and it worked a treat. She ran up to mum and said, “This is peppery”. I was in the corner laughing. [Jools] said to me, “Don’t you ever do that again”.’ Scotch Bonnets have a rating of 100,000–350,000 on the Scoville scale, which measures heat. Most jalapenos are just 2,500 to 8,000. Given his struggle to impose order on daughters Poppy Honey Rosie, Daisy Boo Pamela, 11, and Petal Blossom Rainbow, five, and son Buddy Bear Maurice, four, perhaps it is no surprise Oliver is not keen to add to his family. He revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea, saying: ‘You know what she said last night? She is 40 in about ten days and I took her out and she goes, “OK are we going to have another kid then?” I said, “You what?”. The family pose together for the December issue of Red magazine, where the couple talk about family life . ‘The woman wants another baby. So watch this space. But with all the power in my body we are not having another baby.’ He admitted, however, that Mrs Oliver usually wins the arguments at home – even about food. He said: ‘My wife loves a destroyed steak. I have been with her since I was 18 years old, how romantic, but it is hard to keep loving someone when they want a well-done steak. I have tried to tell her but she is a very single-minded, dominant woman.’ The couple – who have a combined wealth of £240million – met when they were 17. The chef drove to a cinema, but crashed the car. He has joked she started dating him out of pity as a result. Mrs Oliver, a former model, has worked as her husband’s PA and now designs children’s clothing. Jamie Oliver, who was named as a Special Achievement Honouree at the LOVIE awards last week, said his wife Jools has asked whether they can have another child - their fifth - but the chef has said no .","Jamie Oliver said his 12-year-old daughter Poppy was being disrepectful .

"Arsenic may be something you think you last encountered in an Agatha Christie plot, but, in fact, the deadly poison can be found all around us, including on our plates. A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation has revealed that many popular rice products — including Kellogg’s Rice Krispies, Cheerios and some baby food — may contain potentially dangerous levels of the contaminant. This is because rice is grown in flooded conditions in countries such as India and Bangladesh. The water causes the arsenic that is usually locked up in the soil to be released and this is absorbed by the rice. A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation has revealed that many popular rice products — including Kellogg’s Rice Krispies, Cheerios and some baby food — may contain potentially dangerous levels of the contaminant . While there are strict regulations for levels of arsenic in drinking water, there are none for food. And though levels in rice aren’t toxic in the short term, no research on long-tern exposure has been done. The best variety of rice to choose is basmati, which absorbs less arsenic from the soil. It is also possible to remove 80 per cent of arsenic from rice in the cooking process. The key is to rinse thoroughly before cooking, to boil it in the largest volume of water possible (which allows the poison to leach out) and to rinse it again in boiling water after cooking. Scarily, however, arsenic is not the only poison being served up in our homes. Heavy metals ranging from lead to mercury can be found in many of our favourite foods. WHY VEGETARIANS ARE MOST AT RISK . Cadmium is found naturally in almost all vegetables and wholemeal grains. It builds up in the kidneys and can damage them in the long-term . Cadmium is found naturally in almost all vegetables and wholemeal grains, as they take it in from the soil. The metal is a carcinogen as well as a renal toxicant, which means it builds up in the kidneys and can damage them in the long-term, causing kidney disease in extreme cases. Shockingly, if you eat cadmium today, half of it will still be in your body 40 years from now — it lurks in the kidneys and liver. Andy Meharg, professor of biological sciences at Queen’s University Belfast, says: ‘Ironically, it’s people who are living most healthily and who have a vegetarian diet who often have higher exposures to cadmium. ‘South-West England has elevated cadmium in vegetables because of mining, and it is also a concern in industrial areas and allotments in cities.’ However, as with food containing arsenic, preparation can limit the impact. To get rid of cadmium you should peel — or at least wash — vegetables because much of the contamination comes from soil particles sticking to the outside of produce. HOW MERCURY HIDES IN TUNA . Mercury released into the ocean by industrial and mining processes can affect seafood like tuna . Mercury released into the ocean by industrial and mining processes can affect seafood. Once in the water, it is consumed by fish and accumulates as they are consumed by predators, meaning the creatures at the top of the food chain amass the highest amounts. Shark, swordfish and tuna are the main dietary sources of mercury, which can have a damaging effect on foetal and child development. In adults, it has been associated with depression, tremors, insomnia, headaches and personality changes. The metal builds up in the body, particularly in the kidneys and liver. The NHS advises that children, pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant should not eat swordfish, shark or marlin, and other adults should have no more than one portion a week. SWEETS LACED WITH ALUMINUM . Sweets can also contain aluminium (used in food colouring). Excess aluminium is deposited around the body, including the brain . Surprising research by the FSA last year said the highest level of aluminium was found in a sample of loose tea. Tea is grown in acidic soils — which contain relatively high levels of aluminium — and the metal is stored in the leaves. Sweets can also contain aluminium (used in food colouring). And it can also be found in water (purified with aluminium sulphate, which makes micro-scopic impurities clump into particles large enough to be filtered out). Every minute, 113,200 aluminium cans are recycled around the world . Christopher Exley, professor in bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, has described this century as ‘the aluminium age’. He warns that excess aluminium is deposited around the body, including the brain, and contributes towards neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis. ‘In my opinion, there is no safe level,’ he says. ‘There are levels that may not impact upon health in a lifetime, but these vary between individuals. ‘The best thing you can do is take precautions. Avoid processed food — instead, buy fresh ingredients. ‘Avoid unhealthy fizzy drinks, particularly those in aluminium cans, as well as energy drinks and iced tea. ‘And don’t buy long-life drinks in those cardboard cartons which contain a layer of aluminium foil.’ THE DOSES OF LEAD IN PHEASANTS AND GAME . Wild game, such as grouse, pheasant and rabbit, has been traditionally killed with lead shot. Tiny fragments can remain in the meat after the butcher has removed these pellets . Wild game, such as grouse, pheasant and rabbit, has been traditionally killed with lead shot, although less toxic replacements have been introduced. Tiny fragments can remain in the meat after the butcher has removed these pellets. Scientists warn that even slightly elevated levels of lead in the body can affect intelligence and behaviour; in children, it can damage the developing brain. The Food Standards Agency says: ‘There is no agreed safe level for lead intake.’ Professor Meharg says: ‘Again, it’s those who think that they’re eating the healthiest food — that hasn’t been farmed, that’s wild, that’s lean — who will be most affected. If you’re having game only once a month, that shouldn’t be a problem. When you have it a couple of times a week, I would worry about it.’","A Channel 4  investigation shows foods may contain dangerous metals .

"Britain has the most expensive airport parking in the world, costing a staggering £12 to stop at Heathrow for between one and two hours.

"A grieving father who was filmed singing 'Blackbird' to his dying newborn son just days after his wife died has said he was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support after the video went viral. Chris Picco took his guitar and sang the Beatles' hit while baby Lennon James clung to life in an incubator at an Intensive Care Unit in Loma Linda, California. The new father lost his wife Ashley, 30, just days earlier when she died unexpectedly in her sleep. Just hours after the heartbreaking performance, his newborn son also passed away. At a memorial service for the pair on Sunday he sang the hymn 'This Is My Father's World' as a photo montage showing the final days with his son played in the background. During a speech that drew both laughter and tears, he said: 'I could never articulate how much your support and your strength, and your prayers, and your emails and your Facebook messages and your text messages.

Hours after Chris tenderly serenaded his baby son at his bedside, Lennon died, aged just four days . Photos from the couple's wedding were shown in the background as family and friends paid emotional tributes to both Ashley and Lennon . 'I don't even know how any of you got my number but there's been a lot of 'thank you'.' Throughout the service, recorded by the Adventist Review, a number of friends and family paid tribute. Ashley's uncle, Jim Wood, described her as 'a serial hugger' and noted that 'never a curse escaped her lips.' Marie Reindel, a friend  for more than half her life, said she would miss how Ashley 'smiled with her whole body and her whole heart.' She asked people in the hall to smile at the person beside them. During his teary-eyed speech, Chris said: 'We have come here tonight to do the impossible. And that is to sum up someone's life in a collection of words or pictures. And we know that's not possible to do. 'There have been so many people that have reached out and shared their pain: excruciating pain, tremendous loss. And my heart just goes out.' He thanked the gathered mourners for the outpouring of love he had received since the passing of his son and wife and joked that he didn't know how so many people had his mobile number .

Picco said doctors delivered Lennon by emergency C-section after Ashley died in her sleep Saturday. Chris wrote on a memorial page for his wife: 'Ashley would often feel Lennon moving to music so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert.' The service was webcast live - a fitting continuation to a week where the song and other images Picco posted of himself with his wife and their son drew an outpouring of grief and prayers to his Facebook page, YouTube and other sites. The couple, married in 2007, met in New York when both were volunteers helping firefighters after the September 11 attacks. Picco said the story of how he and his wife met shows that something good came out of a tragic event. 'So from this unspeakable tragedy ... I want good to come out of this,' he said. Friends and family members said Ashley, a preschool teacher turned pediatric nurse, was a nurturing soul who would have been a good mother. They noted that Lennon touched many lives during his very short life. Chris (right) lost his wife Ashley (left) just days earlier after an emergency C-section while giving birth to Lennon at just 24 weeks in Loma Linda, California. She was 30 . 'If you measure a life by the power of connection, Lennon lived more than most of us have,' said Tim Gillespie, a speaker at the service. Hours after Chris tenderly serenaded his baby son, Lennon died, aged just four days. In a message to his friends, family and supporters, Chris wrote: 'My little fighter, Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy's arms late last night. 'He was surrounded by family, friends, and the best doctors, nurses and hospital staff in the world. He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him, with little guitars on it, and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend.' The message continues: 'I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him. His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him, touch him, bathe him, sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing. 'I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed, to cherish him while mommy carried him, meet him face to precious face, and hold his perfect little body while we said 'goodbye for now'. 'There are no words, but I wanted to keep you updated, as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world. All you need is love.' Chris said he was 'so thankful for the four unforgettable days' he got to spend with his newborn son . Chris wrote on a memorial page for his wife that Ashley would often 'feel Lennon moving to music so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert' The touching video was uploaded to YouTube and  posted to Reddit, where messages of support started pouring in. A memorial fund set up in honor of Ashley has already surpassed its $50,000 goal, and the total continues to rise as the touching video of Chris and Lennon is shared on the internet. A message on the memorial page reads: 'Ashley Picco was a rare light, a gracious care giver, and deeply in love with her husband Chris. 'They were looking forward to becoming parents and raising their son together. Tragically and unexpectedly her life was cut short.'

"Accused: Pregnant Marie McKinlay, 40, pictured arriving at court last week, is alleged to have run a high-class escort agency called Allure . A mother of two accused of running a ring of call girls through an online escort agency told a court: ‘My two favourite things in the world are money and sex.’ Marie McKinlay allegedly controlled a £500,000-a-year business employ-ing 25 women offering everything from ‘girlfriend experience’ to ‘porn star experience’. The 40-year-old ex-escort and alleged brothel madam is said to have used the profits to put her daughters through private school and pay the £1,500-a-month rent on her four-bedroom home. Asked why she had become an escort, McKinlay told Southwark Crown Court: ‘I’ve been asked this question many times and the way I answer it is, my two  favourite things in the world are money and sex, I absolutely love both of them, and a job that allows me to put them both together, why wouldn’t I?’ She said she had been able to meet ‘a class of gentlemen I’d never met before’ which included ‘wealthy people... not just wealthy people, people who worked in certain careers, like the City. ‘It opened me up to meeting a broader spectrum of people than I had met before. I had a couple of trips to Dubai, Paris, Geneva, staying in five star hotels, places that, had I not been doing this job, I could not afford to go to. I saw a different side of life. I saw a life I wanted to see.’ McKinlay, who denies controlling a prostitution ring, said she helped to form Agency Allure in 2002 as an escort business where ‘women were in control’ of what they did. She said she and five other women decided to set it up at a meeting in Selfridges over a bottle of Chardonnay, and she ran it from December 2008 to May last year. The prosecution claims clients were charged between £300 an hour and £1,500 for services from escorts employed by Allure, including 14-hour overnight bookings that ‘must include some sleep’. McKinlay rented a £1,500-a-month apartment in central London where clients could meet escorts from a list including girls with names like ‘Beth Angel’ and ‘Sophie Sweetness’, the jury heard. The court was told that some escorts . who worked for McKinlay were known porn stars and the business was a . front for a lucrative brothel which made her £350,000 in two and a half . years and financed an ‘expensive lifestyle’. McKinlay said she began working as a . hostess in her mid-twenties at the Stork Club in Piccadilly following a . stint as a wardrobe assistant in the West End.

"Britain would become a safe haven for rapists, murderers and child molesters if it leaves the European Arrest Warrant, senior Tories warned today. Home Secretary Theresa May claimed opting out of the pan-European extradition deal risks Britain becoming a 'honeypot' for European fugitives. Amid signs Tory rebels will seek to reject the EAW in a vote later this month, former immigration minister Damian Green who warned leaving the scheme would be 'really dangerous'. Home Secretary Theresa May and former immigration minister Damian Green warned Britain would become a honeypot for Europe's criminals if it leaves the European Arrest Warrant . Opponents of the EAW say it risks making it too easy for UK citizens to be extradited. Some Conservative backbenchers have hinted at a revolt when the proposal comes to a vote in the Commons. According to reports, Tory chief whipe Michael Gove and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling have urged David Cameron to ditch the plan in the face of a large-scale rebellion. The vote is due within days of the Rochester by-election, in which Ukip is expected to triumph over the Tories, triggering more calls for a tougher line on Europe. However, the Prime Minister has made clear that a revolt must be avoided. Mrs May told the Sunday Times: 'If we don't have these measures in place, it will be harder to keep tabs on terrorists returning from Syria and travelling around Europe and we would have more foreign criminals in our prisons. 'British criminals would be able to hop on to the Eurostar or fly to Spain, safe in the knowledge we wouldn't be able to get them back to prosecute them. 'However we change our relationship with Europe, we will still need to have in place measures that allow us to share information about criminal records, extradite people in and out of the country to face justice and transfer prisoners back to their home countries. That would be true even if we left the EU altogether.' She added that opting out would see the UK become 'a honeypot for all of Europe's criminals on the run from justice'. The EAW is one of 35 measures the Government is seeking to opt back into after having opted out of a raft of more than 100 EU policies relating to justice and home affairs. Supporters argue it has played a vital role in securing the return to the UK of suspects in significant crimes, including 21/7 bomber Osman Hussein, who fled to Italy, or teacher Jeremy Forrest, who was returned from France to face trial over the alleged abduction of a 15-year-old girl. Mr Green upped the rhetoric today, telling BBC One's Andrew Marr show that refusing to sign up to the warrant would be 'much more than a sop to Ukip, that would be really dangerous'. 'Rapists, murderers, child molesters and so on, would think 'Britain is the place to go where you've got most chance of not being convicted for crimes you committed in the rest of Europe'. It would be very, very bad for the safety of our streets not to have the European Arrest Warrant.' He added: I genuinely can't understand why my eurosceptic colleagues have chosen this as a battle to fight because, not opting back into the European Arrest Warrant would make this a less safe country. We would be the country in Europe where all Europe's criminals and terrorists would be inclined to come.' David Cameron has made clear that the vote later this month should see Britain opt back into the European Arrest Warrant . But opponents claim UK citizens could be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial. Earlier this month Graham Brady, the chairman of the influential Conservative backbench 1922 Committee - seen as the voice of rank-and-file Tory MPs - became the most senior figure in the party to speak out and urge the Prime Minister to think again. 'I feel very strongly we ought to be bringing powers back to the United Kingdom, back to British democratic control,' he said. 'We shouldn't be ceding powers to the European institutions. I think it sends a message which is really very unhelpful.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper urged Mrs May to say when the government would be opting back into the EAW, pledging Labour support in a promised Commons vote on the issue. Mrs Cooper said she was 'pleased' that Mrs May was supporting the measure.","Home Secretary Theresa May says UK would be a 'honeypot' for criminals .

"With four bedrooms and grand designs for a playroom, it would seem Euan Blair and his wife Suzanne’s new marital home will have everything they need. But nothing is ever simple when it comes to the Blair family and their properties. Because the family have also purchased a one-bedroom mews cottage immediately behind the London house. Latest acquisition: The £1.2million one-bedroom mews cottage in London bought in Cherie's name in . It expands the Blair property empire, headed by Euan’s parents Tony and Cherie, to ten homes. The small but stylish cottage cost £1.2million and was bought eight months after the Blairs paid £3.6million for the six-storey Grade-II listed Georgian townhouse. The two houses are back-to-back and have interlocking floors in a rear extension block which could in theory be knocked through to create a single five-bedroom home. Next door: The adjoining townhouse worth £3.6million which was purchased eight months ago . Euan, 30, and Suzanne, 26, married last year and have yet to move into their new home while expensive renovations are carried out. There is no mention of Suzanne’s name on the title deeds of her home. The townhouse was bought jointly by Euan and Cherie, 59, while the mews house is owned solely by Cherie. Both Euan and his mother are named as directors of a company set up in connection with the mews property. Former investment banker Euan, said to be eyeing up the safe Labour seat of Bootle, near his mother’s childhood home in Merseyside, has been granted planning permission from Westminster Council for a sumptuous refurbishment of the townhouse. The Blairs’ architect, Simon Templeton, told the council during the planning process: ‘We are keen to return the property to a beautiful condition, while being mindful of the needs of the young couple that will occupy the property, and provide for the possibility of a future family.’ He outlined plans for a playroom and two ‘family bathrooms’. A pencil sketch entitled ‘For Euan & Suzanne’ shows proposals for a £100,000 Bulthaup kitchen, as favoured by celebrities such as Robbie Williams and Kim Kardashian. The two-storey mews property at the back had been on the market for several months before the Blairs snapped it up. The Blairs would need planning permission if they wanted to knock the two properties together. Or  they could become buy-to-let landlords and rent out the mews home for an estimated £3,000 a month. Together, the two houses cost £4.8million – even more than Tony and Cherie Blair paid for their £3.65million Connaught Square house, dubbed a ‘mini No 10’. It is perhaps no surprise that they have bought the two latest houses with the help of an ever-growing mortgage from Lloyds Bank. The millionaire couple have bought homes for their three eldest children, although the ones for Nicky, 28, and Kathryn, 26, cost considerably less at £1.35 million and £975,000 respectively. Euan married Suzanne last September at South Pavilion, the Blairs’ £9million Grade-I listed mansion in Buckinghamshire.

"The president of the Oxford Union has been arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape. Ben Sullivan, a history and politics student at Christ Church, Oxford, was yesterday questioned by police over the allegations, which relate to two female students at the university. The 21-year-old was arrested yesterday morning after the two women made complaints about the alleged incidents which both happened more than a year ago. He was released on police bail until June 18. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Quizzed: Ben Sullivan, 21, was woken up by Thames Valley Police officers and arrested . Case dropped: Ben Sullivan, 21, will face no further action over allegations of rape and attempted rape . Ben Sullivan had planned to work as a researcher for former BP chief executive Lord Browne when his term ended . The banker’s son, a third year student whose final exams start next month, was elected unopposed to the illustrious post of president of the Oxford Union and took office last month. The debating society has been a breeding ground for future prime ministers and politicians since it was founded in 1823, with William Gladstone, Herbert Asquith and Edward Heath among its alumni. In more recent years, it has been a stepping stone to success for Foreign Secretary William Hague, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. Westminster-born Mr Sullivan – a former pupil at £22,000-a-year St Paul’s in central London – also appears to have political ambitions. On his LinkedIn page he claims that he is working as a project manager on a book for the controversial former BP boss Lord Browne. The rape is alleged to have happened in January 2013, while the attempted rape is alleged to have happened a few months later in April. One former student said: ‘This seems totally out of character. He seemed a really nice guy.’ The president of the Oxford Union pictured with his arm around a friend . Ben Sullivan makes a point during his speech entitled 'Socialism DOES Work'. The video was posted in December 2013 . He made his speech on behalf of the opposition in a debate with the motion: 'This House Believes Socialism Will Not Work' During his speech Ben Sullivan, pictured, suggests 'socialism in Britain was not perfect but workable' Yesterday, David Nowell, senior censor at Christ Church, sent an email to students saying: ‘We have unfortunately received information that a Junior Member of Christ Church has been arrested and that this may become the subject of interest from the press. ‘Junior Members are reminded of the guidance in the Blue Book that they should be extremely cautious about talking to representatives of the media (including the student press) and that it is easy for information to be quoted out of context in a manner which may be unhelpful to individuals or to the Christ Church community.’ The Very Reverend Christopher Lewis, Dean of Christ Church, said: ‘As this matter is in the hands of the police, all we can say is a 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape and it is a member of this college.’ President: The third-year history and politics student was elected Oxford Union President last autumn .

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: ‘A 21-year-old man from Oxford was arrested this morning on suspicion of rape and attempted rape.’ They would not confirm how many women were involved but said that the rape allegedly occurred in January 2013 and the attempted rape allegedly occurred in April. Former presidents of the Oxford Union include London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured . The Oxford Union is the world's most . famous debating society, famed for hosting all manner of speakers. Founded in 1823, its presidency has acted as the training ground for three British prime ministers - Edward Heath, WE Gladstone, and Herbert Henry Asquith. More recently, Boris Johnson, Michael . Gove, and William Hague have taken the revered post of president. Speakers have ranged from the Dalai Lama to Katie Price. Yasser Arafat, Bobby Kennedy, Michael Jackson and Shakira have also spoken. The Union controversially hosted Malcom X in the 1960s and President Richard Nixon's first speech after Watergate. In 1996, O. J. Simpson came to the union to make his only speech in Britain regarding his criminal trial. In 1933, just as Hitler came to power in Germany, the Union caused national outcry by controversially voting that they would not 'fight for King and Country'. The motion was passed by 275 votes to 153. Winston Churchill denounced the result as 'that abject, squalid, shameless avowal' and 'this ever shameful motion'.

"The couple in Buckinghamshire were investigated after a social worker spotted them holding the hands of their foster children 'too tightly' while crossing the road (picture posed by models) Social workers took two children away from their foster parents after claiming they were holding the children's hands too tightly while crossing the road. The children were immediately removed from the couple's care and handed over to new foster parents. There are currently 68,110 children in care according the most recent figures with 50,900 in stable foster homes. However, according to The Sun,  233 children were removed from their foster parents - including one couple for holding the children's hands while crossing the road crossing the road. The children were removed from the couple in Buckinghamshire while social workers investigated 'marks' on the children's wrists. Sue Imbriano, Children's director of Bucks County Councils said: 'Social workers are having to make extremely difficult decisions on a daily basis, but they are always made in the context of wanting to ensure the best outcomes for young people.' According to the Department of Education, one in every 166 children in the UK is in care.

According to their website: 'The most common reason arises out of the child’s belief that if they tell someone that they are being mistreated, they will be able to return home to their parents. 'Another cause might be low self-esteem. If a young person has had a number of foster placements, an allegation might be made in order for them to discover whether those responsible for them truly care. 'Other children might crave attention and will view even negative focus as better than nothing. 'Sadly, sometimes an allegation is made because the young person in care has been abused in the past and has kept it a secret. 'Accusing a Foster Carer of abuse is a way of bringing this out into the open. And sometimes children who have previously been in emotionally harmful environments misinterpret things which in the past have been precursors to abuse i.e. the offer of a cuddle or a kiss goodnight. 'Of course, in some rare cases the allegations against Foster Carers are found to be true.

"A little girl who had more than 1,000 seizures a day has been cured by eating lots of cream and cheese. Ella Hansen, five, From Wirral, Merseyside, sticks to a 'ketogenic' diet rich in high-fat foods such as cheese, cream, butter and oil to control her epilepsy. Since starting the plan in May she has improved dramatically and now has fewer than ten seizures each day. Ella Hansen, five, (pictured) was suffering from more than 1,000 seizures a day before she started on a diet rich in high-fat foods such as cheese, cream, butter and oil to control her epilepsy . Her mother Zara, 39, said: 'Before Ella started she was like a zombie, but after just two days she was running around and playing – like a totally different child.' She hopes that Ella will be seizure-free in six months and able to come off the diet within a few years. She said: 'Cream and cheese have been real life savers for us. 'It's strange giving your child so much fatty foods as you assume it's going to be bad for them, and I certainly get some strange glances at my shopping trolley, but it's been a miracle. Ella's mother Zara (pictured) said before she started the high-fat diet Ella was 'like a zombie' - but after just two days she was running around and playing . 'We hope that within six months Ella will be seizure free.' 'Anything she eats we will add extra fat to, so smoothies with extra cream, or humus with extra oil, and her toast will have piles and piles of butter. 'We're always told that fat is bad for you, but it's fat that is changing Ella's life.' The special diet forces the body to burn fats for fuel, rather than the glucose found in carbohydrates. This state, called ketosis, leads to a reduction in seizures, although why is still unclear. Anything Ella eats has extra fat added - so she has smoothies with extra cream and toast with piles of butter . Her mother said: 'Before Ella began her diet she was a mess, she would always be so tired, and never have the energy to do anything. 'But after two days she was running around the park until the evening - it was unheard of and just so amazing to see. 'Her seizures massively decreased instantly and now they've reduced by over 90 per cent. 'She's really chatty and can communicate well, and now even the special school that she goes to are questioning whether she should swap to a mainstream school. 'Her quality of life has just improved so much.' Ella now enjoys running around and playing in the park - something she could not do before the diet . Ella's mother first noticed her condition when Ella began falling behind other children her age - but now there is a chance she will attend a mainstream school in the future . Ella's ketogenic diet has been carefully calculated to ensure she is well nourished, whilst curbing her seizures. Zara said: 'Ella eats tons of cream, cheese, butter and oil, but there are lots of ways to make her foods really tasty. 'Her favourite snack is toast with lots of butter on it and sugar free maple syrup. 'She eats tons of keto muffins and she really likes fat bombs too - they are basically small snacks made of dark chocolate and coconut oil. 'Anything she eats we will add extra fat to, so smoothies with extra cream, or humus with extra oil, and her toast will have piles and piles of butter on. 'At the butcher's I will ask him to give me the cut of meat that has the most fat on. 'It's funny because we're always told that fat is bad for you, but it's fat that is changing Ella's life.' Her parents hope that soon Ella will be seizure free, drug free, and eventually she will be able to come off the diet in the next few years . Zara first noticed Ella's condition when they noticed she was falling behind other children her age. She said: 'Ella had been doing perfectly as a baby but then stopped hitting her milestones. 'She was very late at crawling and she didn't walk until she was almost two. 'Then I started getting very paranoid when I noticed her eyes sort of fluttering. 'Eventually she became diagnosed with global developmental delay in January 2012, so we got her extra help - she had a speech and language therapist and support at school. 'But then six months later I remember seeing her eye flutter again and it suddenly hit me that she was having a seizure - I knew she had epilepsy. 'When she had a brain scan it showed that she'd had over 20 seizures during the scan alone. 'She was put on medication straight away, but after a honeymoon period she just got worse. 'At one point last year she was having over 1,000 seizures a day. Ella's favourite snack on her high-fat diet is toast with lots of butter on it and sugar free maple syrup . 'During the seizures she would be completely absent and out of it, it was quite scary.' Luckily, a consultant suggested putting Ella on the ketogenic diet, and after funding issues at their local hospital, Zara turned to charity Matthew's Friends for help. Matthew's Friends promote and support parents using the ketogenic diet for their children. Ella's mother said: 'Matthew's Friends were amazing and really helped us out. 'They were a great support network, especially during the early stages of the diet.' Now, Zara hopes that Ella will soon be free from drugs and seizures. 'The plan is that soon Ella will be seizure free, drug free, and eventually she'll be able to come off the diet within the next few years. 'The diet has truly changed her life, and I would urge any parent considering putting their child on it to do so. 'There are some parents out there who don't even know it exists and that's a real travesty. 'It's been a miracle worker for Ella - the high fat diet has given us our daughter back.' Breakfast: Cereal with lots of emulsified full fat milk, smoothie with added full fat cream . Mid morning snack: Keto cake, cheese, small piece of apple . Lunch: Half a piece of bread with lots of butter and some ham, with a yoghurt with extra cream . Snack: Humus mixed with extra oil and some carrot sticks . Dinner: Mini roast dinner with celeriac instead of potatoes and lots of oily gravy and keto muffin for desert . Supper: Keto pancake with whipped cream . Emma Williams MBE, founder of Matthew's Friends Charity for Ketogenic Dietary Therapies said: 'We are extremely proud of Ella and her family. 'The ketogenic diet can mean a whole new way of thinking about food as we have all been brainwashed that 'fat is bad' and that in itself can be extremely difficult for families to come to terms with. 'When you embark on a medical ketogenic diet such as the one used for Ella, then we have to completely change our thinking to 'fat is good' and the more of it the better. 'To say to someone that 'butter made me better' is an incredible claim but in this case it is completely true and has been for tens of thousands of people around the globe over the years, but please always make sure that you are medically supervised and never undertake a medical ketogenic diet without consulting with an experienced ketogenic dietitian.'","Ella Hansen, five, had been experiencing more than 1,000 seizures a day .

"In the 007 spy films, James Bond’s driving passions are deadly weapons, fast cars and faster women. But according to a job advert placed by MI6 yesterday, the world of espionage is rather more mundane. The Secret Intelligence Service says it wants ‘empathetic’ recruits who are ‘able to get on with diverse groups of people’. In its advert, reproduced above, MI6 proudly displays its equality credentials by carrying a Stonewall gay rights logo. Anyone interested in ‘guns and fast cars’ need not apply. The details are included in an advert for intelligence officer posts, published yesterday in the Economist newspaper. The officers collect, analyse and report secret intelligence material from around the world. The job advert – presented as a flowchart – has questions including ‘Do you want to protect your country?’, ‘Do you have an instinctive curiosity?’ and ‘Can you be trusted?’. Applicants are also asked about their language skills and whether they want to carry out work overseas. Hopefuls must say if they are male or female before being told their gender does not matter. The same goes for sexuality and ethnicity – although candidates must have British nationality. Secrecy is a key issue naturally. Anyone answering yes to the question ‘Would you tell anyone else about your application?’ is told ‘Thank you for your time’. An identical response is given to anyone believing that MI6 is ‘all guns and fast cars’. Where Bond routinely defies his bosses and breaks the rules, the MI6 advert warns against the idea that Britain must be protected ‘by any means possible’. MI6 headquarters on the south bank of the River Thames at Vauxhall . MI6 has signed up to Stonewall’s diversity champions programme, which aims to make workplaces ‘gay friendly’ and ensure employers comply with equalities legislation. The advert states: ‘The Service strives for diversity in the workplace and is committed to the creation and maintenance of a climate in which all staff are treated fairly on the grounds of merit and ability.’ Last year MI5, the sister agency responsible for protecting Britain against foreign and domestic enemies, came 25th in the list of Stonewall’s top 100 gay-friendly employers. The scene from Skyfall where Javier Bardem's villain Raoul Silva undoes the shirt worn by James Bond, played by Daniel Craig, and touches him on his chest and thighs . Both agencies’ attitudes to gay employees have changed markedly in a short period. Until the mid-1990s, homosexuals were banned from sensitive posts in the diplomatic or security services, on the grounds that they were more vulnerable to blackmail. Two members of the Cambridge Five, the notorious ring of communist spies who worked for the Soviet Union in the 1940s and 50s, were gay. Guy Burgess, who worked for the Foreign Office and MI6, lived with a boyfriend even after he defected to Moscow in 1951. Anthony Blunt, an MI5 officer and leading art historian, also had a secret gay life. The most recent Bond film, Skyfall, raised eyebrows among critics with a highly charged gay ‘flirtation’ scene. Bond baddie Raoul Silva, played by Javier Bardem, undoes Bond’s shirt, and strokes his chest and legs while he is tied to a chair, suggestively saying ‘First time for everything?’ Daniel Craig, who stars as Bond, replies: ‘What makes you think this is my first time?’","MI6 has signed up to Stonewall’s diversity champions programme .

"Britain's first male mother has already split from his gay partner – less than a year after the birth of their daughter. 'Stupidly we always said it wouldn't change our lives,' the partner, named Jason, told the Daily Mail. 'Obviously we had no idea.' Jason had been with Paul – who was born a girl – for six months when he found out that they were expecting a child. Short-lived relationship: Jason with Paul and their daughter. Paul and the baby's faces are obscured to protect their identity . The former charity shop manager said . he was 'shocked' to learn that artist Paul, who still has female . reproductive organs, was pregnant as he had understood that he was . taking testosterone pills, which made it virtually impossible to . conceive. Their 'little angel' was born in March . last year but the strain of their unconventional set-up became too much . and  25-year-old Jason walked out. He said: 'Our relationship has ended . in a bad way. We do not really speak to each other now but we are . determined to do right by our daughter. She is one next week. She's . already started walking and is growing up so quickly.' Three months after meeting through a . mutual friend, Jason and Paul – who has had his sex legally changed by a . gender recognition certificate – moved in together in a flat in the . North of England. Recalling the moment 27-year-old Paul . showed him a positive pregnancy test, Jason said: 'I was shocked and . scared and didn't understand how it could have happened while he was . taking his testosterone tablets, which he took to aid his masculine . appearance. American transgender Thomas Beatie who has gone on to have three children with his wife Nancy . Thomas, with son Jensen, now has three children with his wife Nancy . 'He had just been on holiday to . Florida and he told me he had forgotten to take them. We were very much . in love but the consequences were enormous. It would have been nice to . have planned having a child together.' Jason was with university graduate Paul throughout the birth, but says that things had started to 'go wrong' long before this. 'Paul had stopped taking his . testosterone pills so his hormones were all over the place. He became . more and more like a woman. He grew breasts, a baby bump and even . started to smell differently. 'As a gay man, at times it felt like I . was in a relationship I shouldn't really be in. I didn't want to upset . him so I bottled up a lot of my feelings.' Thomas gives birth to Jensen with his wife Nancy at his side in the Saint Charles Medical Center . Before their daughter's birth the . couple had enjoyed an active social life, including holidays to London . and Paris, but the strain and sleepless nights started to take their . toll. 'I think our relationship changed too quickly from being new and . exciting and always out with our friends to suddenly raising a child,' said Jason. 'Just leaving the house means making . sure she's changed, warming the milk for a bottle, bringing along the . dummy. Forget one of those things and you have to go back to the house. We ended up fighting constantly.' The couple finally split after a . stressful holiday together in September last year. 'Back home we fought . badly one morning and I said I would be leaving when I got home from . work,' said Jason. 'I picked our daughter up from nursery later and took her for a  little walk to say goodbye.' Both Jason and Paul, which is not his . real name, are keen to protect their daughter. Paul has previously said . that he does not want his identity to be known as it is 'not something I . want to become famous for'. He said: 'I do not want everyone to know . that I am transgender. 'And I have to think of my daughter and I don't think it would be good for her.' Jason added: 'Society is becoming more . accepting. I am hoping that by the time our daughter has grown up, it . won't be an issue but for now I want to protect her. 'I suffered discrimination when I was . growing up because I'm gay, but times have changed. All that matters is . that she's loved. We will support her through anything.' Jason sees his daughter once a month but does not have a good relationship with Paul, who has resumed his testosterone pills. 'We are seeing a solicitor so that the . details can be sorted,' he added. A blog written by Paul charted the . early days of his pregnancy. He wrote: 'I'm not the first man to . have a baby and I won't be the last, but we're not fully accepted and . understood yet, there's still a long way to go. 'But if there's one thing I've learned on my journey from being a girl to being a man, it's patience.' Four years ago American Thomas Beatie, . 38, announced his pregnancy. He had been taking male hormones but, as . he was married to a woman, he became pregnant using donor sperm after . stopping the hormone therapy. He is now said to have given birth three . times. Latest figures show that sex-change operations on the NHS tripled . between 1999 and 2009. More than 1,000 have had surgery, at a cost to the taxpayer of £10million.

"Women will soon be able to have the morning-after pill delivered by courier to their office. A ‘pill-by-bike’ emergency contraception service is being launched in London to save women from visiting their GP or waiting for the post to arrive. This is the first time the morning-after pill will be delivered to the door like a business contract, with the service prompted by customer demand. Anyone wanting the morning after pill service would have to give their date of birth during registration and need a credit card . Women will be asked to fill out a form online and confirm they are 18 or over. The form is assessed by a doctor, with the pill delivered up to two hours later on a normal working day, although it may be possible to order online overnight and book a time for delivery the next day. The service costs £20 and is being offered by online medical practice DrEd.com, which says the pill comes in ‘discreet packaging’. Critics claim the service may encourage underage sex by making the morning-after pill easier to access. They said girls could easily lie about their age to access the pill and it should remain a prescription-only drug. Amit Khutti, co-founder and managing director of DrEd.com, said it was taking steps to ensure the morning-after pill did not fall into the hands of underage girls. Anyone wanting the service would have to give their date of birth during registration and need a credit card. He said: ‘I don’t think this service is going to appeal to minors or encourage underage sex. For a start, you need to pay for the service and if you’re young there are a number of places you can already get the morning after pill for free. ‘You also need a credit card to order our service, which is another barrier, and you’ll have to personally sign for delivery. ‘It will arrive at the office in discreet packaging so women won’t be embarrassed. Socially, some people are still put off by having to answer questions face to face about why they need emergency contraception.’ Mr Khutti added: ‘People get all sorts of things delivered to work these days because it’s more convenient than staying in at home.’ He said women would be able to book for delivery within two hours Monday to Friday, or register out of hours for a delivery the next day. A courier service for the morning after pill will soon be available in London . The courier service will begin in London this month through Shutl, which usually delivers for Argos, Oasis and Maplin electronics. It will be extended to other cities if successful, along with other services such as treatment for sexually transmitted infections and erectile dysfunction. DrEd.com, which is registered with the Care Quality Commission, the patient safety watchdog, works with pharmacy chain Day Lewis to dispense medication. Norman Wells of the Family Education Trust said the morning-after pill should stay under the control of doctors. He added: ‘There is also a danger the service could be used by the abusers of underage girls. ‘The faceless nature of the service makes it all too easy for them to register on the site giving a false name and medical history and then to order the morning-after pill on behalf of their victim in an attempt to conceal their crime.’ Mr Wells said international research had shown that making the morning-after pill ‘more readily available has not succeeded in reducing unintended pregnancy and abortion rates. ‘Instead, young people in particular have been lulled into a false sense of security, take a more casual attitude to sex, and become exposed to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.’ Pharmacies already offer the morning-after pill over the counter for around £25. In 2010/11 about 120,000 – equal to 2,300 a week – were prescribed. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service has an online service where women can request emergency contraception and stock up in advance. They speak to a nurse by phone before it is delivered free of charge to their home.",Morning after pill can be ordered online and delivered to an address in London within two hours for £20 .

The jury accepted that he knew the boy's real age. Walker was found guilty of inciting the boy to have sex with Emmanie Louise Angela Hughes, 31, of Wind Street, Llandysul and was jailed for four years. Emmanie Hughes admitted having sex with the boy but said she thought he was of legal age . The boy's mother said she blamed Walker for what happened. The mother said she wanted people to know that despite Hughes, Brian James Ecclestone, 32, of Wind Street, Llandysul, and Peter Sweetman, also 32, of Cawdor Terrace, Newcastle Emlyn, west Wales being cleared, they had all admitted that Hughes and the youngster had sex and the two other men had been present. And she added: 'To be fair to the judge, he made the point that people shouldn't think this sort of thing can just happen to girls. 'I was a bit naive about it as well, but this can happen to boys as well. Brian Ecclestone, Peter Sweetman, and Emmanie Hughes during the trial earlier this month .

"A former Olympic judo coach has been thrown out of the sport after a disciplinary panel found that he sexually abused children in his care. Yet the agency responsible for preventing sex offenders and paedophiles from having contact with young people has cleared him to work with children again. Alan Roberts, who trained Olympic double medallist Kate Howey, was banned from coaching for life and stripped of honorary awards. Alan Roberts, retired, was found to have 'manipulated his position, influence and experience for the purpose of his own sexual gratification' But the decision by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to let him still work with children has shocked his victims and angered senior figures in the sport. Roberts, who is retired, played a central role in British judo for more than 40 years. But he is in disgrace after a British Judo Association (BJA) adjudication panel chaired by a leading barrister, Matthew Ryder QC, heard evidence from five alleged victims during a week-long hearing last year. The tribunal’s unpublished report fou that Roberts carried out a series of assaults on young judo enthusiasts between the early 1970s and December 2003. Two of them were under 16. Roberts, 68, from Sheerness, Kent, denies any wrongdoing, but the 52-page report says: ‘The complaints against Mr Roberts are serious. He manipulated his position, influence and experience for the purposes of his own sexual gratification. 'He did so by taking advantage of the vulnerability of his students.’ Champion: Double gold medalist Kate Howey was trained by Roberts, who is now retired, but says she was 'totally unaware of the allegations'  and was 'shocked' Mark Costiff, of Crawley, Sussex, said Roberts assaulted him after persuading him to visit his home for coaching. Mr Costiff, now 40, was 16 at the time. He agreed to be identified by The Mail on Sunday and said: ‘I didn’t report it at the time because he suppressed  me and I was embarrassed. He made me feel that if anything wrong had happened, it was my fault. ‘It was horrendous. But he was very clever at covering it up. I was assured by the BJA that he would never be allowed to coach children again. I’m shocked by the decision not to bar him – it’s scary to think he could get involved with young people again.’ Roberts was suspended as a senior coach in 2009 after five judo players made complaints. Kent Police carried out two investigations but the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to bring charges. The tribunal report reveals that Roberts was once charged with indecent assault. He was found not guilty at Medway Magistrates Court in Kent in 1999. He told the MoS this week: ‘I categorically deny all of the allegations.’ He added that all his legal costs had been paid following his acquittal by Medway magistrates. A senior source within the sport said: ‘As far as the BJA is concerned, Roberts remains a danger to children. He will never be allowed to coach judo in this country again.’ DBS operations director Janet Gauld declined to comment. Miss Howey said: ‘I was totally unaware of the allegations against Alan Roberts. I was shocked when they emerged.’","Disgraced Alan Roberts, 68, was banned from coaching for life .

"Shocking figures: Four out of ten parents say their children have been exposed to internet porn . More than four in ten parents say that their children have been exposed to internet porn, an official survey reveals. Almost a third say their sons or daughters have received sexually explicit emails or texts and a quarter say they have been bullied online or on their phones. Many others have been exposed to websites promoting anorexia, self-harm and even suicide. The frightening insight is contained in a round-up of responses to a Department for Education consultation on parental internet controls obtained by this paper. The Daily Mail is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children, with over-18s only able to access adult material if they ‘opt in’ following a strict age verification check. The consultation reveals that 57 per cent of the 757 parents who responded to the consultation were in favour of stricter controls, including 47 per cent who wanted an opt-in system. However, in total, just one in six of the 3,509 respondents – most of whom were not parents – supported the full opt-in solution. Two-thirds of the respondents were from just one pressure group called the Open Rights Group, which is against default filters to block net porn. Children’s charities will be concerned that the consultation has been swamped by those opposed to stricter controls. Labour’s media spokesman Helen Goodman, who wants to see an opt-in system, criticised the Department for Education for still not having published the results of  the consultation two months after it ended. Harriet Harman says 'we need to see action from the Government on children's access to pornography (stock image) Two meetings of the UK Council for Child . Internet Safety (UKCCIS) to discuss the consultation responses have . been cancelled, leading to accusations that ministers are dragging their . feet. ‘It is shocking that despite the findings of the consultation being known, and the urgency of this issue, the Government has yet to respond to the consultation,’ said Miss Goodman. ‘In particular, the finding that 41 per cent of parents say their children have been exposed to pornography shows why the Government should take urgent action.’ The consultation asked parents . whether their children had been exposed to a range of online dangers. Highest on the list is pornography, with 41 per cent of parents saying . their offspring had seen it. The . second-largest danger was sexually explicit messages, with  31 per cent . of parents saying their children had received so-called ‘sexts’. Some . 27 per cent of parents said their children had been exposed to violence, . 26 per cent to gambling and 23 per cent on bullying. Another 22 per cent believe their children have been abused by text, while a similar proportion have been exposed to drink or drugs. Other online dangers reported  by parents include websites promoting self-harm (10 per cent),  anorexia (9 per cent), suicide (8 per cent) and radicalisation (8 per cent). Some 9 per cent of parents said that their children had been exposed to the risk of sexual grooming by men. The document concluded: ‘Children’s online safety is the responsibility of parents or a shared responsibility between parents  and businesses. ‘The majority of respondents were opposed to all of the three options for parental controls consulted on. ‘Parents are concerned about potentially harmful content such as pornography and violence, and behavioural issues, such as sexting and bullying. ‘Increasing the level of education and awareness among parents  will make it easier for them to use parental controls, and limit exposure to risks online.’ The document advised UKCCIS to support an industry-designed scheme under which customers choose the option that is ‘right for their family and circumstances’. ‘Providers will take measures to check that the person setting up the parental controls is over the age of 18,’ it said.","Shocking figures exposed in Department for Education consultation .

"Linda Kelsey says that  far from over-50s reconciling themselves to becoming invisible, this is when women take greater pride in their appearance . The air was heady as hundreds of women, ranging in age from 35 to 70 (and counting), wafted fragrantly into the room. But even more arresting was the fact that, without exception, it was those over 50 who’d really pulled out all the stops at the charity event I was speaking at. Each one was not just expensively perfumed, but expertly made-up and dressed to the nines. While some of the younger ones looked rather like they’d just fallen out of bed, or rushed the kids to school without brushing their hair, the loos were crowded with women of a certain age re-applying their lippy and checking for VPL in the mirror. You might, if you wished to be unkind, call this an exercise in mass vanity. And in many ways, I would be inclined to agree — only I refuse to accept being called vain as a criticism, and claim it as a compliment instead. Contrary to the notion that once past a certain age it’s hardly worth bothering, because men stop noticing you anyway, I find it immensely cheering that, far from over-50s reconciling themselves to becoming invisible, this is when women take an even greater pride in their appearance. A pride which only increases as the years go by. That’s not to say that I cared any less about my appearance in my 30s than I do now, although I certainly devoted less time to it. Going fresh-faced and natural may have given the illusion of modesty, but it was simply a viable option. Now in my 60s, the no make-up look equals drained and decrepit, rather than carefree, so no wonder it takes me a good half hour longer to leave the house. I sometimes even put on make-up when I’m not planning to go out at all, in order not to depress myself when I pass the mirror in my bathroom. Whereas once I could wash and go in 20 minutes flat, my hair has now thinned and needs washing and painstakingly blow- drying every second day. And to fill in the ever-widening parting, I have to sprinkle on Viviscal, tiny hair fibres that fill the gaps and make it look thicker. These days I don’t even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara wand. Vain as that may seem, I am not alone. Although I knew few of the women at my table at this charity brunch, I soon found myself engaged in banter about our lives and our families. One, well into her 60s, giggled as she told me that her 38-year-old daughter was finally getting married. These days Linda doesn't even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara wand. Vain as that may seem, she says she is not alone as other middle aged women feel similarly . ‘I told her a decade ago that she needed to hurry up because I wanted to wear a sleeveless dress at her wedding! But it’s taken her a whole ten years, and now I’m going to have to wear sleeves!’ Vanity, certainly, but not without self-knowledge and a sense of humour. Another sexagenarian, a breast cancer survivor with a penchant for short skirts and leopard-print ankle boots, described herself to me as ‘wayward’. ‘I like to look a bit different,’ she said. Having lost her confidence while going through chemotherapy, when her hair grew back she ditched the blonde dye she’d previously used to disguise her greys, and reverted to the auburn of her youth that speaks not of narcissism, but of renewed vitality. The town Vanity in Pilgrim’s Progress held a perpetual fair, trading in frivolous goods . As for me, who spends all day communing with my computer and doesn’t exactly need to buy myself smart daywear, I confess the minute I accepted the charity’s invitation to speak — and before I’d even given a moment’s thought to what I was going to say — my attention turned first to what I was going to wear. Only when I had splashed out on a dress, nude tights and a pair of heels that looked the biz, and hurt like hell, did I get down to writing my speech. Vain? Yes, but I’m in no doubt that feeling and looking good only aided my delivery. Why should vanity become a dirty word, when we women are praised from childhood for prettiness, and complimented on how we look? When I was little, whenever we went away on holiday, my ever-glamorous mother would clutch her vanity case to her bosom as though it housed the crown jewels. To me, it had an aura of magic: turning the tiny golden key and flipping the mirrored leather lid, I would marvel at the array of lotions and potions that make up a woman’s beauty armoury, corralled in their hand-stitched compartments. No wonder the word vanity came to have positive connotations for me. As teenagers, my girlfriends and I would spend far too long peering into mirrors, trying on clothes we couldn’t afford, encouraging each other to experiment with make-up. It was a means of bonding, a collective vanity that, ironically, paved the way to a collective sisterhood that still holds firm. There may be much to be said for the Mary Beard approach to life, whereby the sheer force of your confidence, intellect and charisma allows you to cast aside the trivial pursuits of fashion, cosmetics and regular haircuts. But what’s wrong with having surfaces, as well as depths? Why shouldn’t women break through the glass ceiling in Mac lipstick and Estee Lauder mascara? When The Apprentice star Karren Brady took ermine recently in the House of Lords, she was mocked by this paper’s own sketch writer for the height of her heels, the quantities of slap she wore and her highlighted hair: ‘groomed as though for Crufts’. Well, I wanted to yell bravo, because in my eyes her glamour only enhanced, rather than diminished, her success. I felt the same, a fortnight ago, when Helen Mirren, 69, become the new face of L’Oreal. Though I wish she weren’t the only older woman being wheeled out as proof that our generation can cut it in the beauty stakes, her appointment only affirmed my belief that, however time has withered me, rather than giving up on my looks, they’re still worth taking care of. Hold on to your vanity with hoops of steel I say. I’m not talking about an artificial attempt to hold back the years — to convince the world you’re 40 when you’re 50, or to succumb to the surgeon’s knife — but a commitment to making the most of yourself, and looking and feeling the very best of your age.","Linda Kelsey says over-50s shouldn't resign themselves to being invisible .

"The 90s were a breakthrough period for the modern man - a time when it finally became acceptable for the male sex to admit they use moisturiser. The new breed of men became so common that a new phrase was coined to describe them - the metrosexual, with stars like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the trend. But since then, young men have been become even better acquainted with bathroom products - many now think nothing of spending hours in front of the mirror or at tanning shops. Stars like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo led the trend for metrosexual men, but there are now four different breeds of super-groomed males. They are Mr Mandrogynous, Mr Mainstream Moustache, Metro-Dude and Mr Remantic . The rise of this behaviour means that the word metrosexual is almost defunct as there are now several different typologies of super-groomed men.

"Hitting out: Heather Wolfson, who has two grown-up children, believes her 35-year teaching career is now over and feels her reputation has been destroyed . A dedicated teacher last night claimed her  35-year career was in ruins after she lost her job for handing out her mobile phone number to a schoolgirl who was upset about her sick grandfather. Heather Wolfson, 56, said she had been using ‘a mother’s instinct’ when she  helped the pupil, adding that political correctness meant teachers were being punished for simply showing compassion and common sense. The mother of two was suspended from her job last year at Ysgol y Grango, in Rhos, north Wales. The school said  Mrs Wolfson had acted inappropriately by giving the girl  her number when she broke down in tears after her grandfather’s diagnosis with cancer. The food technology and textiles teacher was also reprimanded for giving her number to a 12-year-old boy and offering to take him home after dark when no-one arrived to collect him from school. Neither of the children’s parents complained to the school. Instead, a member of staff alerted the headteacher that the girl and boy had the teacher’s phone number. At a disciplinary hearing Mrs Wolfson, who had been on a fixed-term contract to cover maternity leave, was handed a written warning. Her contract expired the following day and was not renewed. The school gave her a basic dated reference, but the experience is proving a blot on an otherwise untainted career. Mrs Wolfson, from Weston Rhyn, near Oswestry, said she has been struggling to get a job ever since. Under a cloud: Mrs Wolfson was suspended from her fixed-term contract with Ysgol y Grango, in Rhos, north Wales, and has never reinstated . ‘I’ve given my life to teaching but . now I’ve been rendered unemployable,’ she said. ‘Schools have fallen . prey to political correctness and our careers are walking on a . tightrope.’ Referring to the incidents with the . pupils which triggered her suspension, she said: ‘I was just looking out . for them both, it was a mother’s instinct.’ Colin Adkins, of the . National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: . ‘Heather’s case is an absolute tragedy. ‘There are no regulations to say . teachers can’t text pupils, the communication should simply be . appropriate, and it was entirely appropriate in  this case. ‘She was providing pastoral support. There was nothing sinister or untoward going on.’ Mrs Wolfson was providing maternity cover at the school in the town of Rhos, near Wrexham, in north Wales (pictured) Amanda Harrison, deputy head of Ysgol . y Grango, said the matter had been resolved, adding: ‘It would be . inappropriate to comment further.’ Wrexham Council also declined to comment. Mrs Wolfson was suspended in January last year and her contract expired months later in July. ‘I would never have done anything to . jeopardise my job,’ she said. ‘While I agree teachers and children need . to be safeguarded, the impact often goes against your instinct which is . to care for and protect the child.’ Local councillors in Rhos have refused to comment, but Mrs Wolfson has been backed by teaching union NASUWT .","Heather Wolfson gave her number to one pupil who was 'inconsolable' over her grandfather's illness .

"Michael O'Brien pocketed funeral charity donations to help balance the books of his struggling business . An undertaker pocketed funeral charity donations to help balance the books of his struggling business. Michael O'Brien admitted keeping around £1,500 in donations while in charge at Murray's Funeral Directors in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester. He said he had 'given into temptation' and stolen some of the cash as he struggled to balance the books after taking over the the firm from his father. But the scale of his deceit . unravelled when police were called and discovered a series of diligent . notes detailing donations which hadn't been passed on. It . was found O'Brien had kept £800 intended for British Heart Foundation, . £495 for MacMillan Cancer Support and £190 for Tameside General . Hospital. Human ashes were also seized as police raided the premises in October last year. O'Brien, . 59, of Hyde, pleaded guilty to three counts . of fraud by false representation between January 2010 and February 2013 . at Tameside Magistrates Court. Defending, Steven Higgins said the fraud had been 'unsophisticated' and O'Brien had intended to replace the money. He said: ‘He hasn't benefited to that amount as a large proportion of what the charities failed to receive is in the form of cheques that were still sitting in Mr O'Brien's safe. ‘This is a question of mismanagement rather than dishonesty but he was advised to plead guilty as there was cash removed. The scale of his deceit unravelled when police were called and discovered a series of diligent notes detailing donations which hadn't been passed on in a raid on the premises in October . Police and council officials also removed documents during the investigation last year, which was triggered by a string of complaints . ‘He inherited the business from his father very much in debt. He accepts cash was available in his safe and it became a temptation in order to keep the business afloat.’ Police found a large number of financial paperwork, cheques and empty envelopes when they searched the premises. For the prosecution, Matthew Curtis said: ‘He kept a meticulous account of his paperwork and that assisted the police in detailing the donations not passed on.’ O'Brien will be sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on April 17.","Michael O'Brien admitted keeping around £1,500 in donations while in charge at Murray's Funeral Directors in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester .

"Flat pack furniture - three words that drum fear into the hearts of any women and men across the world who have ever walked the aisles of Ikea. But brace yourselves, because we could soon be buying flat-pack clothing from the Swedish furniture giant too. Fortune 500 business consultant Stefan Engeseth has predicted a new way of clothes shopping that works perfectly with Ikea's business model, where customers buy ready-to-assemble furniture. Swedish business consultant Stefan Engeseth predicts ready-to-assemble clothing is the future. He thinks Ikea has the perfect business structure to kick-start the trend . He believes that the company could sell both fully-made items of hard-wearing clothing and separate parts that people could take home and make themselves. The idea would mean that people could create clothing tailored to individual tastes by piecing together separate parts, with only basic sewing needed - the same level of skills necessary to build a bedside cabinet. On a grand scale, this would allow customers to choose from a wide range of style changes, including colour, button shape, sleeve length, pocket shape and trouser length and shape. Stefan told Lucire magazine in New Zealand: ‘Emotionally, this connects people to how life was in the beginning - customers can personalise and “hack” the designs.’ Customers would be able to choose from different colours, buttons and sleeve length and take the separate pieces home to construct . He believes the new way of buying clothing could be such a huge success that it might even be applied to shopping for wedding dresses - a notoriously difficult procedure because of the detailed wishes that brides have. He also thinks that Ikea could become a go-to place for hard-wearing garments, similar to the reputation it has built around furniture. He said: 'We’re already seeing some shoppers go to outdoor and living stores to buy longer-lasting clothing.' Customer would need only basic sewing to make the garments - the same level of skills necessary to build a bedside cabinet . He continued: 'Ikea already sells reusable Kr 4 bags that are good and cheap; their clothes could be equally practical, as strong as work clothes.' Ikea has said that it has no current plans to start a clothing line, but if they did decide to, they would be wise into account Stefan's ideas for the project. He has even come up with an extensive loyalty scheme, which would include discounts for furniture customers who are wearing the company's clothing, to make people feel as though they are part of a worldwide community.","Swede Stefan Engeseth predicts ready-to-assemble clothing is the future .

"With car sales dropping across Europe, the bicycle is becoming the preferred mode of transport for almost every member state, according to new research. News site NPR has discovered that the sales of bicycles are outselling cars in 23 European countries, with only Belgium and Luxembourg bucking the trend. More bikes were sold in Italy last year than cars, which is the first time that's happened since the Second World War. Research from U.S-based news site NPR found bikes outsold cars in almost every European countries in 2012. A selection of these sales is shown in the left-hand chart. The right-hand chart shows which countries had the biggest discrepancy between car and bike sales, with Romania coming out on top . Closer to home, a total of 3,066,000 bikes were bought in the UK in 2012, compared to just 2,045,000 passenger cars. This may be due to a number of initiatives in . the UK that promote cycling, including the government-based Cyclescheme, . that lets people buy bikes at a discount and tax-free. The Romanians were found to be the biggest bike lovers in Europe as bicycles outsold cars five to one. Researchers, including NPR’s Lauren Frayer found that the trend has even been seen in the car-loving country of Spain, where bikes pushed out sales of cars for the first time ever. Frayer compared bicycle and car sales across the 27 member states of the European Union. Cyprus and Malta were immediately discounted because new-car registration data wasn't available. The research found that more bikes were sold in Italy last year than cars, which is the first time that's happened since the Second World War. This Europe-wide trend is being blamed on the worldwide recession. Belgium and Luxembourg were the only member countries where cars outsold bikes . The only countries in which the trend wasn't seen were in Belgium and Luxembourg, where cars continued to outsell bikes. According to Krishnadev Calamur: 'The data can be explained by the slump in car sales across Europe and this decline coincided with the worldwide recession'. Research from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association found in July that new vehicle registrations dropped by 6.3 percent in June. This brought total sales for the first six months of 2013 to just 6.44 million, which was a 6.7 per cent drop year-on-year. The UK was the only country to see a rise in car sales up to that point, rising by 10 per cent, while Germany and France dropped by 4.7 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively.","Bikes outsold cars in Italy last year for the first time since World War II .

"The parents of a US Army Ranger who volunteered as an aid worker in Syria expressed their grief Sunday, saying they are 'heartbroken' over his death but proud of the legacy of compassion he leaves behind. Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis released a statement that their son 'lost lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering.' 'We will work every day to keep his legacy alive as best we can,' they said. Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, was kidnapped last year while delivering aid to refugees in eastern Syria, showing up later in the hands of militants from the Islamic State. Humanitarian: Abdul-Rahman Kassig, who changed his name after a conversion to Islam, seen here delivering supplies for Syrian refugees, was reportedly beheaded by Islamic State militants in a video released Sunday . The Indianapolis man, who formerly went by Peter, had converted to Islam while in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman. The White House confirmed Kassig's death Sunday after Islamic State militants released a video showing that Kassig had been beheaded. President Barack Obama called Kassig's killing 'an act of pure evil' and said the Islamic State group 'revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.' The Kassigs said in their statement that their hearts also go 'out to the families of the Syrians who lost their lives, along with our son.' They said they also grieve 'for the families of the other captives who did not make it home safely.' The Kassigs learned of their son's capture last year, but did not disclose his captivity while family and friends quietly worked to secure his release. Prayers: Ed and Paula Kassig prayed at a vigil for their son earlier this month, who had been named the next beheading target by Islamic State militants . Hope: In this still taken from a video posted in October, the parents of Kassig had pleaded with Islamic State militants for the safe release of their son . Legacy: Kassig stands with his maternal grandparents, his grandfather being a co-founder of Christians for Peace and Justice in the Middle East who advocated for Palestinians in their struggle for a homeland . In October, their son appeared in another video released by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of a fellow aid worker, Britain's Alan Henning. The militants vowed that Kassig would be next, leading his parents to plead publicly for mercy while stressing his humanitarian work and conversion to Islam. Kassig first went to the Middle East with the Army, which he joined in 2006, according to his military records. In the thick: Kassig stands with a truck loaded with supplies in Syria, where he volunteered as an air worker in humanitarian relief efforts . Son: The Kassigs said they were 'incredibly proud' of their son for responding to his own calling to do humanitarian work . Family: The parents of Kassig had worked to contact the Islamic State militants holding him, and pleaded with them to release their son . Relief: With training as an EMT after a deployment with the 75th Ranger Regiment, Kassig used his experience to care for victims in Syria . He ultimately served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, and served in Iraq from April until July 2007 before being medically discharged as a private first class that September. His desire to perform aid work in the region was kindled during a March 2012 spring break trip to Beirut while he was studying political science at Butler University. Kassig, a certified EMT, left school and returned two months later to Lebanon, where he worked as a medical assistant and humanitarian worker and treated people from all sides of the conflict in neighboring Syria. In September 2012, he founded Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, which suspended its relief work after his capture. Kassig, who grew up in an Indianapolis family with a long history of humanitarian work and teaching, said during a January 2013 interview with Time that he traveled heavily throughout Lebanon to assess the needs of people there. SERA, the aid organization he founded, focused on supplementing the work of larger organizations by delivering aid that could 'do the most good for the most people over the longest period of time possible.' 'It's about showing people that we care, that someone is looking out for those who might be overlooked or who have slipped through the cracks in the system for whatever reason,' he said. Kassig's friends and family say he understood the risks of working in the region, but he felt called to help. Burhan Agha, a 26-year-old Syrian, worked with Kassig in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, delivering aid to Syrian refugees before Kassig moved his operations to southern Turkey. Speaking by phone from Switzerland, where he is seeking asylum, Agha described his friend's purported killing as senseless. 'If I could apologize to each American, one by one, I would,' Agha said while weeping. 'Because Peter died in Syria, while he was helping the Syrian people.' 'And those who killed him claimed to have done it in the name of Islam. I am a Muslim, and from Syria, and he is considered a part of the Syrian revolution,' Agha added. After the Islamic State threatened to kill Kassig last month, his family pleaded for his life to be spared at rallies and in interviews in Indiana and Lebanon, and his mother took to Twitter in the hopes of contacting his captors directly. Kassig's parents repeatedly said that they were unable to meet the demands made of them by their son's captors, but they did not specify what those demands were. Kassig's purported death drew widespread condemnation on Sunday, including from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim advocacy group that described his killing as a 'barbaric murder.' CAIR said it has denounced all previous killings of civilians by Islamic State militants and repudiates 'the anti-Islamic ideology that produces such brutality.' Indiana Governor Mike Pence on Sunday ordered flags lowered at state buildings across Indiana and for a period of mourning beginning at sunrise Monday to mark what he called Kassig's 'tragic murder.'","Ed and Paula Kassig's son Abdul-Rahman, 26, was beheaded after being kidnapped and held by ISIS militants last year .

"For those debating between which seasonal ski pass to purchase, experience level and location are two major factors to consider. Scout Ski's infographic is a detailed breakdown that helps winter tourists make an informed choice when it comes to deciding between popular season pass contenders: the Vail Resorts' Epic Pass and Liftopia's Mountain Collective pass. But, as it turns out, a traveller's best option hinges on whether they're a weekend or destination skier. For those who love to travel and enjoy winter sports with a bit of international flavour, the $749 (£478) Epic Pass may just be worth the investment - even if you ski just 10 days in three different Vail resorts. This pass is valid not only at Vail's American ski hills, but also at their Japanese, Swiss and French resorts. For those sticking close to home and heading to slopes only on weekends, Mountain Collective's $389 (£248) option is likely a much better bet. But they will have to be satisfied with keeping to North American soil though, since Mountain Collective does not offer any European or Asian ski destinations. For beginners, the Mountain Collective option may be best, while five per cent more of the hills on the Epic Pass are targeted for the advanced contingent. Scout has also outlined the optimal ski road trip route - for each pass - to help skiers hit as many American resorts as possible. There is also a handy reference guide when it comes to picking family-friendly hills, local restaurants and the best apres-ski watering holes.","Vail Resorts' Epic Pass  versus Liftopia's Mountain Collective .

"Police have released CCTV footage of a suspect who is believed to have killed a man after pushing him  onto a New York subway track. Wai Kuen Kwok from the Bronx was shoved off the platform by an unidentified man at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in Highbridge. The 61-year-old was struck by a southbound D train at around 8:40 a.m. and pronounced dead at the scene. His wife was not injured. Authorities have now released images of a potential suspect walking around outside the station. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage: Police are asking the public if they can identify this man who is regarded as a person of interest in the death of a Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, who was pushed onto a Subway track in the Bronx, New York . Covered-up: He was seen wearing a black balaclava (top right) as he left 167th Street station in Highbridge . Danger: Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, of the Bronx was pushed off the platform by an unidentified man at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in Highbridge, police said . After exiting the station he is wearing a black balaclava before walking around the corner, taking if off and smoking a cigarette. Authorities told The New York Post that Kwok's 59-year-old spouse Yow Ho Lee had been transported to Bronx Lebanon Hospital, has since been released and police are interviewing her. One source told The Post 'She is not injured except for obvious trauma from seeing her husband pushed in front of a train.' There was no indication that Kwok knew the man or had had an altercation with him before he was pushed, police said. Witnesses told police they believed the man fled the subway station after shoving Kwok and jumped on a city bus. A transit source told The New York Daily News '[The subway train motorman] said the guy just flew off the platform in front of his train as he was entering the station. The guy was still in the air when he hit him.' The source also told The Daily News that by the time the subway train came to a halt Kwok had already been rolled over by three cars.

There have been three other incidents in recent years that involved a person being pushed onto the tracks. In April 2013, a train ran over a man desperately clawing at a Manhattan subway platform after being pushed onto the tracks by a homeless suspect with whom he'd been arguing. In December 2012, another homeless man was arrested for pushing a Queens straphanger in front of a Times Square train that fatally crushed him. And later the same month, a mumbling woman pushed a man to his death in front of a subway train in Queens.","Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was pushed off the platform by an unidentified man .

"Uncertain: Teacher Dean Macfarlane does not know if he can continue his job at a Doncaster school after admitting pushing a 12-year-old boy into a bush for throwing snowballs in his face . A teacher is facing the sack after he pushed a 12-year-old out of 'pure frustration' when the boy spat at him and hit him in the face with snowballs. Dean Macfarlane admitted that he had knocked the boy into a hedge but said that it came after 18 months of antisocial behaviour outside his house in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. The problems for the IT teacher started in . 2011 and since then the youths have gone into his . garden, climbed on cars and garage roofs, damaged vehicles, and . used tennis racquets to hit stones at people's property. The . situation reached boiling point in February when the 55-year-old said he . confronted two boys who had hit him in the face with snowballs. He reacted by pushing a 12-year-old boy, who spat on the ground in front of him, into a hedge. Macfarlane ended up at Barnsley Magistrates' Court last Tuesday, where he admitted assault and was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid community work. He is now waiting to hear from the regulatory body, The National College for Teaching and Leadership, as to whether he can keep his job of 34 years. But pupils and staff at the Doncaster school where he works have reacted with a flood of support for the well-respected teacher. Following the court hearing, Macfarlane said the incident had resulted from 'pure frustration' last February, when he momentarily lost his temper after confronting two boys who had been snowballing him. He said: 'For three days the house had been pelted with snowballs, covering all of the windows. 'On the day in question I was getting changed and heard ""thud, thud, thud”.  I ran to the front door and saw the car had about eight snowballs splattered on it. “I looked over the fence and saw a group of about seven lads, all aged 12 or 13m who gave me a load of verbal abuse and then set off running. 'A couple of them threw snowballs at me and I was hit in the face and body.' At the time he shrugged off the attack, but 15 minutes later he went out and saw two of the youths who had thrown the snowballs and warned them to stay away from his house. Macfarlane pleady guilty to assault at Barnsley Magistrates Court . He said: 'The smaller of . the two boys said, ""It wasn’t me, I wasn’t there” and I told him I had . just seen him as he was less than five feet away from me. 'Then . the other boy spat on the floor in front of me. It escalated from there . and pure frustration took over. I pushed the lad and he went into a . hedge. 'It was . completely out of character for me. I did not go with the intention of . hunting down these lads and I wasn’t aggressive, but did end up pushing . one of them which I am sorry about. 'It was the wrong course of action to take.' The former art and design teacher said: 'I’ve been a teacher for more than 30 years and this error of judgement has put my job under threat. 'It is all hanging up in the air and I’ve now got to wait to see if I can go back to work in September.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'The National College of Teaching and Leadership receive notice of police cautions and convictions given to teachers. 'If it is decided a case should proceed to a formal hearing before a teacher misconduct panel, our aim is to conclude all cases within 20 weeks of receiving the referral, but this can take longer in some cases.'","Dean Macfarlane says he became frustrated after being hit with snowballs .

"They gathered in the same studio to record the same song... but what a difference 30 years makes. Back in 1984, the group that sang the original Do They Know It's Christmas? included such global superstars as David Bowie, Paul McCartney and George Michael. Today? The new Band Aid features three social media celebrities with millions of fans on the internet – but no experience of professional singing. In a sign of the times, Zoe Sugg, Joe Sugg and Alfie Deyes – all made famous by YouTube – are part of the group of performers Sir Bob Geldof has gathered around him for the project, which is raising money to help alleviate the Ebola crisis.

The 'YouTubers', as they are known, are joined on the track by veteran musicians including Sir Bob and Bono, as well as rising stars of the new generation such as Ed Sheeran. And in another modern twist, some of the biggest acts in the line-up are those made famous by reality television – such as boy band One Direction, who were formed on X Factor in 2010. They have gone on to become a worldwide phenomenon and have topped the UK charts three times. Fellow X Factor star Olly Murs has had four number one hits. Elsewhere, however, the new Band Aid line-up includes 11 musicians who have never had a UK number one single – a stark contrast to the original group that included members of Bananarama, Duran Duran and Status Quo.

The new cohort does have 28 number ones between them, but half of these come from veteran stars Bono, 54, Midge Ure, 61, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, 65, and Sir Bob, 63. Members of the bands Bastille, Elbow and Underworld, as well as artists including Emeli Sande, 27, Paloma Faith, 33, and Jessie Ware, 30, are all taking part despite having never had a single top the UK charts. However, their luck might be about to change – as the power of the internet has allowed Do They Know It's Christmas? to climb the charts three weeks before it is even released. So many fans have pre-ordered a copy on Amazon that it has shot to second on the shopping website's list of most purchased singles. The line-up of performers on the track also includes two British rising stars who do not feature in the studio picture – 22-year-old Sam Smith and Rita Ora, 23. The official BBC Children In Need single has topped the UK chart. The song – a cover of Avicii's Wake Me Up – was sung by Gareth Malone's All Star Choir, featuring celebrities including Great British Bake Off host Mel Giedroyc, actress Linda Robson and ex-footballer Fabrice Muamba.

Singer Paloma Faith takes a break from the recording session for the charity single wearing a crisp white shirt and studded black cravat . But Adele refuses to take part . With Ed Sheeran and One Direction signing up to Band Aid, it can boast some of the biggest young stars in modern British music. But there is one conspicuous absence from the line-up – Adele, 26, who has reportedly not been taking Sir Bob Geldof's calls. The Skyfall singer, whose album 21 is one of the top-selling records of all-time in Britain, was said to have been asked 'hundreds' of times, but will not appear on the track. According to Sir Bob, this is because she is focusing on her family. He said: 'Adele is doing nothing. She's not answering the phone. She's not writing. She's not recording. She doesn't want to be bothered by anyone. 'She won't even pick up the phone to her manager. She's bringing up a family, you know.' The original 1984 line-up included global superstars such as David Bowie, Paul McCartney, George Michael and Status Quo . It's not only the line-up that has changed since Band Aid first released Do They Know It's Christmas? in 1984. The lyrics have also been altered to reflect the ebola crisis. The original line 'Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears' has been replaced with 'Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear'. The words 'Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you' have become 'Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you', while the chorus is a call to 'feel the world' and 'heal the world' as well as 'feed the world'. And instead of 'There won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time. The greatest gift they'll get this year is life. Where nothing ever grows. No rain or rivers flow. Do they know it's Christmas time at all?', they sing 'No peace and joy this Christmas in West Africa. The only hope they'll have is being alive. Where to comfort is to fear. Where to touch is to be scared. How can they know it's Christmas time at all?'","New Band Aid stars three social media celebrities with millions of fans on the internet, but no singing experience .

"A couple who sent a barrage of emails and letters to their children’s school have been strongly criticised by a High Court judge. The unnamed French couple were described as ‘foolish, overbearing and demanding’ after swamping independent Hall School, Wimbledon, south west London, with complaints that verged on the ridiculous. In one complaint the mother – who sent most of the communication – said she was unhappy that their six-year-old daughter had been scored an A and not an A+ in a spelling test. Claim: A judge at the High Court in London, pictured, has rejected a damages claim brought by an 'overbearing' couple against a school, after it asked their children to be taken out . In another, she wrote about her concerns over the 'unhygienic' position of her son’s water bottle in the classroom. The school was left no choice but to ask the parents to take the children out of the school, sparking the legal battle in which the parents claimed a breach of contract. However, taking the side of the school, judge Jeremy Richardson said their behaviour ‘went well beyond the realms of even the most zealous, some might say pushy, parents’. Describing the ‘enduring nightmare’ that the school suffered at their hands, Judge Richardson said: 'The focus of any school should be on the education and welfare of the children who attend it. Of course, parents need to play a full role and take a keen interest in their children. That is right and proper. 'But equally , parents must - and most do - appreciate that school is a community which needs to be permitted to get on with its principal task of educating children collectively. No school should be bombarded with unwarrantable demands by parents. 'Teaching and other staff bear a high responsibility in what they do. Looking over their shoulders for fear of litigious parents is one aspect of their professional lives they could well do without. judge Jeremy Richardson said their behaviour ¿went well beyond the realms of even the most zealous, some might say pushy, parents . 'It is also of critical importance that teachers and others of whatever rank feel able to express their views with candour.' The couple were seeking £50,000 in damages from the school, claiming teachers backtracked on a deal to give their children good references after they were withdrawn from the institution. But the businessman and his wife, who cannot be identified to protect their two sons and daughter whom the judge described as 'delightful', were the 'authors of their own misfortune', the judge said. He said the meddling parents' case was unseemly and without one shred of believable evidence to support it. Tensions between the parents and staff worsened when headteacher Tim Hobbs insisted on being present during meetings between them and teachers. But it was at a subsequent parents' evening last summer when the couples' behaviour left staff 'visibly shaken'. The couple confronted teachers, kept . one member of staff in discussion for 45 minutes and left two senior . members of staff extremely upset. The judge brushed aside the father’s insistence that the meeting had been simply 'lively', and described both the mother and father's conduct as 'appalling'. Headteacher Tim Hobbs had then asked for the children to be withdrawn - or . they would be expelled - as the relationship between the family and the . school had broken down. He said the children must leave . through no fault of their own, with the next term’s fees waived and . deposits returned, due to the irretrievable breakdown in trust. Mr Hobbs agreed to write supportive . references for the boys to the head of nearby Donhead School, Chris . McGrath, but did not, as was claimed, say he would not disclose . information about the parents if asked, as it would have been . professionally negligent to have done so. The judge rejected the couple’s . allegation that Mr Hobbs had conspired with Mr McGrath, resulting in the . boys being refused a place. The school, not pictured, was accused of back-tracking on a deal it made when three children were withdrawn (file photo), but this was rejected by the High Court . 'There was no cover-up nor conspiracy . nor anything else untoward. To suggest Mr Hobbs and Mr McGrath were . bare-faced liars was frankly outrageous. They leave this court as honest . and honourable men, as they arrived.' The judge said that most parents would have been 'absolutely delighted' with the school’s observation that the couple’s children were a 'credit to you both' and there were no concerns for their future development either academically or socially. Instead, the parents 'viewed everything in a self-centred self-contained artifice as though no-one else but them and their children mattered'. 'They interfered and meddled with the school and made unwarranted demands. Of course, all parents want the best for their children. Parents at fee-paying schools rightly demand the best but the school must be allowed to be a school. 'The conduct of the parents far exceeded the worst excesses of normal concerned parents by a considerable margin. I can well believe their domineering and demanding conduct became an enduring nightmare for the school. 'This parental misconduct - and it was misconduct - was such a shame as, whatever their failings, their children are a delight and were much liked by the staff at the school. 'If only the parents had been sensible, restrained and interested in their children’s progress, and there was progress, instead of being foolish, overbearing and demanding, events would have been, I am sure, to the advantage of all their children.' He added: 'Whichever way one looks at this case from a legal viewpoint, there is simply not a viable case against the defendant. There was no breach of contract whatever. There was a variation of an extant contract to bring it to an end.' After the ruling in London, Mr Hobbs said: 'We are very glad at the outcome. We don’t think it should ever have come to this stage and we are very glad that the children are settled in another school and are doing well.' The parents declined to comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","French couple put staff at Hall School, Wimbledon, south west London through an 'enduring nightmare' with their complaints, court heard .

"Cried rape: Recorder Shaun Smith has jailed Gaynor Cooke for two years and said her 'pack of lies' almost wrecked the life of her former lover . An unfaithful wife has been jailed for two years - almost a decade after she cried rape just to hide a one-night stand from her husband. Gaynor Cooke, 41, had told police she was violently attacked by a taxi driver to cover up her fling with him, and her former lover was due to stand trial next month. No-one was arrested in 2003 because a forensic sample taken from her at the time failed to find a similar profile on the national DNA database. But when in 2011 the man, who she claimed was a stranger, was detained for a minor offence his DNA threw up a match. The man she slept with was charged with rape and faced trial at Nottingham Crown . Court in February. However detectives received information that Cooke . had lied to conceal her infidelity. And when police went back to speak to the 41-year-old about the new evidence she told them: 'You've got me'. Cooke, of Corby, Northamptonshire, wiped away tears as recorder Shaun Smith QC jailed her for two years. The judge said her 'pack of lies' had 'for a short period of time destroyed an innocent life'. In her 18-page statement reporting the false rape she said her life had been wrecked and she wanted to kill herself. But the case was abandoned and the taxi driver was 'completely exonerated', the court heard - and 41-year-old Cooke was put in the dock instead. She was charged with perverting the course of justice between October 25, 2003, and January 20, 2012, after making up a false complaint of rape. Recorder Smith QC read extracts from statements she had given about her 'ordeal', which she said took place on the front seat of a taxi. In these she had claimed: 'Since I was raped in 2003, I feel my life has been changed for ever. I'm depressed after what happened to me and often feel suicidal.' Sentenced: Rashid admitted at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) that he had sex with a 13-year-old after she 'tempted' him . Recorder Smith told her: 'It's a complete pack of lies. It may only have been for a short period of time, but you destroyed an innocent life.' The taxi driver was arrested in January 2011, and detectives initially believed they had a prime suspect for the attack on Cooke. Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the court: 'The police contacted this defendant, who said she was pleased a suspect was identified and wanted to do justice with a prosecution.' Cooke originally kept up her lie when visited by a policewoman, saying she intended to proceed with her complaint and had nothing to add to her original statements. The taxi driver told officers he was a single man in 2003 and had consensual sex with women in his home, but had not raped anyone. However, he was charged with rape and his trial was to take place at Nottingham Crown Court in February 2012. Finally Cooke admitted she had consensual sex with a taxi driver in 2003. She said she was having problems with her partner at the time and he had been angry when she returned home. Miss Hale said: 'She told the lie and maintained the lie. She gave no explanation, when asked, why she continued to maintain her lies.' The court heard the taxi driver had been suspended from work as a result of the charge. The stress of the court case had taken a toll on his health and he had been unable to return to work. Miss Hale added: 'It was a humiliating experience for him.' Fiona Tannock, defending, said Cooke had been troubled more and more as time went on, as she was aware that someone was awaiting trial. She said: 'The defendant could hardly bear to hear the victim impact statement which was read out in the lower court.'","Gaynor Cooke, 41, told police she was suicidal after the imaginary attack in 2003 .

"When two Norwegian fishermen, Svein Aasjord and Trond Ivarjord set out on a trip last weekend, they did not expect to see what they did. Standing on the edge of their small fishing boat on 8 November, tucked between the scenic mountains of Troms, the two men were fishing for herring.

"Her six-year-old son turned his nose up at sandwiches and sticks of carrot. So Grace Hall transformed them into aliens, elephants and superheroes. Now he cannot wait to open his packed lunch every day and tuck into his favourite characters. With the help of a few cutters and moulds, former accountant Mrs Hall has turned sandwiches into Spiderman, hard-boiled eggs into sheep and melons into Easter chicks...while making hundreds of healthy lunches. Her blog, Eats Amazing, showing photographs of the culinary creations, is followed by 7,500 other mothers. Grace Hall, 32, creates works of art - such as this Angry Birds-inspired one, a current favourite - for her son's packed lunch . Grace was worried about her son's appetite and started preparing to the pretty lunches in an effort to get him to eat more . The 32-year-old, from Winchester, was inspired by the bento-style lunch boxes seen in Japan, traditionally created from sushi rice, meat and fish and sometimes turned into fun characters and cartoons. The artistic mother goes to incredible lengths to delight her six year old, turning sandwiches into Spiderman, Santa and the Very Hungry Caterpillar. Grace says she usually spends only a few minutes on each lunchbox . Grace says that she spends a little longer on lunchboxes for special occasions, such as this Easter one . Grace says she never buys specialist ingredients and just uses what's left around the house . She . fashions snails from a bread roll decorated with cheese for eyes, . carrots carved into flowers and a cheese and ham toastie that looks like . a pig. Other characters creations include Elmer . the Elephant, the Gruffalo, Thomas the Tank Engine, Goldilocks and the . Funny Bones skeletons. For Grace, the novelty lunches come to her naturally as she remembers her own mother using fruit to make faces in homemade bread when she was a child. Although this may sound like a lot of time and effort, Grace says they can suit mums in a hurry as she never spends more than 15 minutes creating the lunches. Grace insists that she enjoys the daily tasks and has turned a potential chore into something she looks forward to doing. She has even admitted to actually missing her creations during school holidays. Above all, Grace tries to make each lunch as healthy as possible . Since she started creating the lunch boxes, Grace's son has gained much more of an appetite . Grace asks her son to make special requests to give her inspiration . 'I could see years of endless lunch-packing stretching ahead of me. 'But I soon found they were a great outlet for my own creativity - as a full-time mum I get very little time for myself. 'So making lunches is a way for me to turn an everyday chore into an opportunity to get creative.' Grace, who had been worried about her son's lack of appetite, says that since she has created the bento-style lunches she has seen a real improvement in his eating. Grace was inspired by the bento boxes of Japan, which are broken up into different compartments . Her creations, posted on her blog, have gained the former accountant a loyal following of 7,500 readers . Grace's husband has even been involved in the project, helping her out after the birth of their second son . 'My son was never a big eater before. 'I . used to worry about the amount of food he ate - or rather didn't eat - . but  since I started making bento-style lunches, his appetite has grown. 'These days he is much more enthusiastic about his food and will eat pretty much everything - except celery.' She says that her artistic lunches have also helped other mums who have had trouble getting their kids to eat their lunches. 'The best comments on my blog come from mums who say their children have started eating foods they wouldn't touch before. 'To think that I am inspiring others and helping them to get their children eating healthy food makes me very happy.' Grace's son is, unsurprisingly, thrilled with his lunches and Grace  asks her son - nicknamed 'Small Child' in her blog - for ideas and requests. Grace has created more than 300 different lunches - such as this football-themed one - for her son . Grace uses leftovers from the family dinners to make sure nothing goes to waste . Grace gains inspiration from her son's story books - this one has a knight's theme, complete with sandwich cut to look like a castle and cucumber and carrot 'shields' His current favourite lunches feature Angry Birds, dinosaurs and cats and will now happily polish off veg, including striped beetroot and purple carrots. 'My son really loves the lunches. 'I make them while he is eating his breakfast and he is always peering over my shoulder, interested in what I am making for him each day. 'I know I've made a good one if he says it's cool.' A set of themed lunches, like those based on her son's favourite tales for World Book Day, St George's Day or Comic Relief, requires extra thought and may take longer than her 15-minute time limit. Grace remembers her mum making her novelty lunches when she was younger . Grace has inspired other mothers who are having trouble getting their children to eat . Staff at her son's school keep a keen eye out for the latest creations . 'Occasionally I give a lunch a little . extra time if it's a special theme or occasion but I truly believe it's . not much more than traditional lunches.' Rather than buying  special ingredients, Grace just keeps a good variety of fresh fruit and vegetables in the house, making the lunches healthy for her son. A list of food ideas stuck on the family fridge helps ensure each lunch has at least one portion of vegetable, fruit, dairy, carbohydrates and protein. Leftovers such as spare tortilla wraps or potatoes from a dinner are put to good use in the lunchboxes, and sweets and crisps are kept to a minimum. Grace's son eagerly watches his mother prepare his meals every day . Grace says she knows when she's made a good lunch when her son describes them as 'cool' Creativelu used Babybells, as above, are a regular theme in the lunchboxes . Grace's husband has even jumped aboard the project, helping to make the lunches after their second son was born. 'My husband made a brilliant lunch that was farm themed. I loved the fact he had a style of his own, despite using the same supplies and accessories as me. 'My son was very pleased, I think he was impressed by Daddy's efforts and really enjoyed the novelty.' It comes as no surprise that staff at Grace's son's school said they loved seeing what was in his daily lunch box and they have inspired parents at the school gate to follow her lead. The project has inspired Grace to study nutrition in the future.","An artistic mother creates works of art for son's lunch boxes .

"Car rental companies in Europe are adding 'winterisation charges' on their vehicles that will see standard rates soar for tourists. Winter tyres and snow chains on hire cars are compulsory in some areas and can be up to £114. iCarhireinsurance.com researched the costs of five rental companies in seven European ski gateways (Geneva, Grenoble, Innsbruck, Barcelona, Turin, Sophia and Inverness) for a week's hire from December 27 to January 3, 2015. Winter tyres are just one thing that will add cost to hiring a car in Europe this winter . It found the average 'winterisation' cost across the seven destinations was over £40, but could be up to £114 in Geneva with Avis, significantly increasing a customer's overall rental cost. Paying the winterisation charge of almost £60 in Barcelona with Budget, for instance, represents an additional 30 per cent on the original hire cost. In Austria and Germany winter tyres are mandatory, yet despite this Avis levy a 'winterisation' charge of £25 in Innsbruck. The added charges for 'winterisation' have been blasted by the founder of iCarhireinsurance.com . Snow chains must also be used, where instructed in mountainous areas, in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Andorra. (average costs to hire a medium compact car for a week) Geneva - £409.43. Winterisation - £114.45. Barcelona - £235.81. Winterisation - £52.54. Turin - £396.66. Winterisation - £40.46. Sophia - £160.18. Winterisation - £24.89. Inverness - £242.55. Winterisation - £0. Innsbruck - £254.81. Winterisation - £25. Grenoble - £287.41. Winterisation - £29.60. The 'winterisation' cost is included in the rental price in some instances but this varies greatl. For example Budget did not charge extra in Geneva or Innsbruck but charged £57 in Barcelona, £40 in Turin and £24 in Grenoble. In Barcelona all five rental companies charged a 'winterisation' fee averaging £53. 'Car hire companies are well known for surprise snowballing costs at the rental desk,' said Ernesto Suarez, CEO and founder of iCarhireinsurance.com. 'Why each individual customer should be held to account for winter tyres that have been changed once for the winter season is ludicrous and is another example of hidden costs that can make the original rental price not such a good deal.' 'It's frustrating that that the rental companies use 'winter' as yet another opportunity to make money from their car hire customer but unfortunately it's your responsibility and not the rental company's to make sure that you're driving with the correct equipment for wintery conditions. 'We advise that you shop around and make sure that you factor in the 'winterisation' cost.'","Research for seven destination show extra charges are over £40 .
But in Geneva with Avis it could be as much as £114 .
In Barcelona travellers will pay an additional 30% of original hire cost ."
"A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal. One in ten are out of work and a similar proportion are on internships, doing voluntary work or travelling. Those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning, packing or bottling and stacking shelves. Job shortage: A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal . The research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts. It shows many are emerging into a hugely competitive job market where they may wait years before securing meaningful employment. The trebling of tuition fees last year to a maximum of £9,000 has created the prospect of thousands of students leaving university in two years with debts of £40,000 or more once living costs are added - and no prospect of starting to pay it off for the foreseeable future. Details were released at the same time as a Confederation of British Industry report warned too many sixth formers were being pushed into the ‘default’ university route instead of considering vocational courses and on-the-job training. Key industries such as manufacturing, construction, IT and engineering face a recruitment crisis as a result, it said. Of the 190,000 full-time first degree leavers in 2011-2012 who took part in the HESA survey, more than 17 per cent said they had continued studying. Two-thirds said they were working - but barely more than half were on permanent contracts.Six per cent said they had taken basic, unskilled work such as manning rubbish trucks or sorting mail. Two per cent were doing internships, 1.3 per cent were involved in voluntary work and 2.7 per cent classified themselves as other/unknown, a category which includes ‘developing a portfolio’. Another five per cent had opted to travel or do ‘something else’. Opportunities for university leavers . have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by . the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month. Crisis: Opportunities for university leavers have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month . Banking and finance has seen 45 per cent of jobs evaporate, while accountancy and professional services firms have 17 per cent fewer vacancies. At the same time the pay premium gained from higher education is being eroded, creating a double whammy for graduates. Twenty years ago they earned 52 per cent more on average than workers with lower or no qualifications. Now that is down to 27 per cent. National Union of Students president Toni Pearce said: ‘Many of those entering the work-place for the first time are finding it hard to find a job that matches their skills. ‘Those taking their first step on the career ladder are willing to work hard and pay their dues but employers must stop exploiting them through things like unpaid internships.’ The CBI report called for a university admissions-style system to be set up to help more young people apply for apprenticeships and vocational courses. This is needed to prevent a chronic shortage of suitable workers as it estimated the majority of posts created between now and 2020 will be in high-skilled jobs. ‘What is now seen as the “default route” of an undergraduate degree is not suitable for all - young people have different talents and learn in different ways,’ the report said. ‘We should aim to inspire but also be realistic, setting out the costs and likely return on options open to young people, including the vocational options that have long been undersold.’ Policy director Katja Hall added: ‘We need to tackle the perception that the A-levels and three-year degree model is the only route to a good career. ‘When faced with a £27,000 debt, young people are already becoming much savvier in shopping around for routes to give them a competitive edge in a tighter job market.’","Research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints sobering picture .

"For most viewers, the last time they saw Michael Buerk on television, he was smartly dressed, calmly relaying the world’s news. So they can be forgiven their shock at seeing the 68-year-old’s return to the screen last night on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here. Face aghast and stretched by the wind, the 30-year veteran of BBC News looked anything but composed as he skydived from a helicopter. Scroll down for video . Veteran newsreader Michael Buerk entered the jungle by skydiving from a helicopter on I'm a Celeb . The BBC Radio 4 presenter looked less than composed as he came into land on an Australian beach . And unfortunately for the self-declared hater of celebrity culture, this was not the only ordeal he had to endure on the first episode of the ITV show, as he was taught to twerk like a Playboy bunny and shake hands like a rap star. He may have reported on horrors from around the world but, faced with the jump, Buerk told viewers: ‘I may cry like a child and have a nervous breakdown, this is the stuff of nightmares’. Former Playboy bunny Kendra Wilkinson, 29, went even further, becoming a quivering wreck when confronted with the prospect of skydiving. She admitted heights were here ‘number one fear’ and added: ‘I don’t know if I can do this, this is beyond anything I ever imagined doing, there is no greater dear in my life, and I’m so scared’. She could only be consoled when rapper Tinchy Stryder, 28, gave her a hug. However, the musician didn’t fare much better, trying to pull out of the challenge at the last minute as the instructor jumped. On the ground he said it would be his ‘first and last time’ skydiving. Former Playboy bunny Kendra Wilkinson also struggled with the skydive, but had time to teach Mr Buerk how to twerk later in the show . Tinchy Stryder and Mr Buerk formed an unlikely friendship in the first episode of this year's series . The jump was part of a challenge that saw them, along with the Melanie Sykes and Jimmy Bullard rescue fellow contestants – reality television star Gemma Collins, Coronation Street actor Craig Charles, motorcycle racer Carl Fogarty, model Nadia Forde and ‘Allo ‘Allo! star Vicki Michelle from the Jungle Slammer. In a twist to the show’s normal format, this series has seen the celebrities split into two groups before arriving in the jungle. One group was given a final night of luxury, while the other was thrown into a makeshift jail from which they would have to be freed by the other contestants completing challenges. When Buerk was first introduced to fellow contestants Strdyer and Miss Wilkinson, there was an immediate culture clash. The Radio 4 presenter looked lost for words as the adult model tried to get him to twerk. She said: ‘We should do some shots and get this party going. Let’s twerk or something – pick up your pants Michael to loosen them’. To which he said: ‘Oh right, it’s a bit similar to belly dancing’. In an equally cringe-worthy moment, he was talked through a complicated hip-hop handshake by the Ghanaian-born Stryder.","Former newsreader Michael Buerk parachuted into the jungle today .

Standard specification includes six airbags, ESP stability control, air conditioning, alloy wheels, DAB Radio, CD Tuner,USB and Bluetooth connectivity. The Celerio offers very low CO2 emissions of 99g/km and frugal fuel consumption of 65.7mpg . Next summer Suzuki promises even more,with a new Dual jet engine offering even greater economy and CO2 emissions that fall to just 84g/km. This will be linked to Suzuki's newly developed Auto Gear Shift (AGS) which allows the gearshift and clutch to operate automatically. A spokesman said: 'The driver can enjoy the effortless driving of an automatic, but without any loss in fuel efficiency or increase in CO2 emissions.' The AGS system also allows a low-speed 'creep' facility which lets the car move in gear without the accelerator being applied, ideal in slow traffic and when parking.

This develops a mighty 510bhp (equivalent to five Ford Fiestas), allowing it to accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 3.8 seconds. Top speed is a modest 193 mph. The 'entry level' £97,195 GT version planned to be on sale late next year will be powered by a 462 bhp V8 engine, with acceleration from rest to 62mph in four seconds and a top speed of 189mph. The cars feature 19in wheels front and rear, a switchable AMG performance exhaust, AMG sports suspension and an adjustable electronic rear wing. The GTS adds 20in rear wheels, red brake callipers clamping enlarged discs, an electronicallycontrolled rear differential, AMG ride control sports suspension with three selectable modes and an increase in power to 510 bhp. The GTS Edition 1 brings a fixed rear wing and accompanying deep front splitter, a carbon roof, black mirror surrounds with matching window surrounds and rear diffuser, black exhaust tips, red interior contrast stitching, leather and suede finish for the special AMG performance seats and the steering wheel, and a centre console in 'Black Diamond' textured finish.

"Ed Miliband is on course to record a thumping victory at the next General Election owing to a surge in popularity for the anti-Brussels UKIP party. The dramatic rise in UKIP support will cost David Cameron a staggering 51 seats at the next Election, giving Labour an overall majority of 94 seats, according to survey for The Mail on Sunday. Support for UKIP, led by maverick Nigel Farage, has soared from 3 per cent in 2010 to an all-time high of 16 per cent in the Survation poll, transforming the likely outcome of the next Election, due in 2015. Big winner: Ed Miliband (pictured left) is set to win the next General Election owing to a dramatic rise in UKIP support that would cost David Cameron (right) 51 seats . Analysis by Britain’s leading pollster, Professor John Curtice, shows the Conservatives would lose 41 MPs as a result of the UKIP boom – with all but one going to Labour. Tory victims would include Ministers Chloe Smith and Brandon Lewis, and rising star Jacob Rees-Mogg. And ten seats the Conservatives would have regained as a result of the Lib Dems’ slump will stay with Nick Clegg’s party, all because of UKIP. The poll shows Labour on 38 per cent, the Tories on 29, UKIP with 16 and the Lib Dems on 11. Had UKIP remained at 3 per cent, the figures would be enough to give Mr Miliband a wafer-thin Commons majority of ten. However, the haemorrhage of Tory votes to UKIP turns it into a landslide majority of 94. Maverick: UKIP leader Nigel Farage has seen support for the party rise to an all-time high of 16 per cent . The survey comes as Mr Cameron plans to revive the battered Coalition with a ‘mid-term review’ tomorrow. He will try to bounce back from the child benefit cuts row by accusing Labour of planning an £83 billion welfare spree. Prof Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said: ‘This poll turns an Election that would otherwise look like a reasonably close contest look like an easy walkover for Labour. Tory supporters have been unhappy with the Government ever since George Osborne’s omnishambles Budget. I would expect UKIP to fall away to some degree by the Election but the only way the Tories can put things right is by restoring their reputation for competence.’ Westminster’s first-past-the-post system means that UKIP would still fail to return a single MP – despite the backing of one in six voters – although 50 per cent of those polled said they would like to see Mr Farage in the Commons. Asked who they backed on Europe, 24 per cent chose Mr Cameron, with Mr Farage in second place on 20, ahead of Mr Miliband on 19 and Mr Clegg on seven. UKIP could even beat the Conservatives in the 2014 Euro elections. A total of 24 per cent said they would vote Tory, with UKIP on 22, Labour 31 and the Lib Dem 11. More than two in five said they would consider voting UKIP in the EU poll. Mr Farage said: ‘This is the best poll we have ever had. It shows we are now being taken seriously as a mainstream party and are attracting votes from all the three other parties.’ Survation interviewed  1,002 people online on Thursday and Friday.","Support for UKIP has soared from 3 per cent in 2010 to 16 per cent .

"More than 100,000 people have signed an e-petition asking for Sergeant Alexander Blackman to be freed . Calls to release a Royal Marine and quash his conviction for murdering an injured Afghan fighter could be debated in Parliament. More than 100,000 people have signed an e-petition asking for Sergeant Alexander Blackman to be freed and to have his murder conviction rescinded as he 'defended his country from a terrorist'. This means it has exceeded the threshold required for it to be considered by the backbench business committee, which decides the issues debated in Commons time allocated to backbench MPs. An MP must make a representation to the committee before an e-petition can be debated. Commons Leader William Hague has notified Labour MP Natascha Engel, the committee's chairman, that the petition is eligible to be considered for debate. The killing happened in Helmand Province in 2011 while Blackman was serving with Plymouth-based 42 Commando. The victim was an Afghan who had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter. Blackman shot him in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol before quoting a phrase from Shakespeare as the man convulsed and died in front of him. Blackman told him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us.' He then turned to comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.' Blackman, who was known as Marine A during legal proceedings, denied murder, saying he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse. He was given a life sentence with a minimum of 10 years by a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, following his conviction in November 2013. He was also 'dismissed with disgrace' from the Royal Marines after serving with distinction for 15 years, including tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. Blackman - known as Marine A during legal proceedings at Bulford Military Court (pictured) - shot an injured Afghan fighter in the chest at close range . Blackman's conviction challenge was rejected by the Court Martial Appeal Court although his minimum term was cut to eight years because of the combat stress disorder he was suffering from at the time of the incident. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'After a public trial in front of a court martial, at which he was legally represented, Marine A was found guilty of murder and two other Royal Marines were found not guilty of the offence. 'The identity of the victim does not change that verdict. 'It would be inappropriate for the Government to intervene in this independent judicial process.'","Sgt Alexander Blackman murdered an Afghan fighter in Helmand Province .

"The Conservatives were today accused by Labour of 'getting excuses in early' by issuing warnings about the global economy to explain grim news about the levels of government borrowing. Chancellor George Osborne said Britain is not 'immune' to a global economic slowdown while David Cameron said red warning lights' were 'flashing on the dashboard of the global economy'. But Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government needed to stop 'blaming everybody else' for failures in cutting the deficit. Labour leader Ed Miliband said David Cameron should 'stop blaming everyone else' for problems in the UK . With two weeks until Mr Osborne delivers his Autumn Statement, there are fears low tax revenues and higher borrowing will make it difficult for him to offer any respite for hard-pressed families ahead of the election. Tory MPs hoped Mr Osborne would use his statement on December 3 to offer upbeat news on the economy, and promise tax cuts after the election. But today the Chancellor told reporters: 'You have to make a realistic assessment of the global economy today. 'We've discovered that Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains vey weak, and although the British economy is perfoming well we're not immune to these things happening in the world. 'It's all the more reason why we've got to go on working through our long term economic plan and why it would be a complete disaster to divert from that plan, to borrow and spend more. That would put Britain in a place where many other countries find themselves today.' It came after Mr Cameron said that six years on from the financial crisis of 2008, it was more important than ever to maintain a firm hand on the country's finances. He wrote: 'Six years on from the financial crash that brought the world to its knees, red warning lights are once again flashing on the dashboard of the global economy. 'The eurozone is teetering on the brink of a possible third recession. Emerging markets, which were the driver of growth in the early stages of the recovery, are now slowing down.' Chancellor George Osborne warned Britain is not immune to the effects of a global slowdown as he toured a factor in Rochester today . In the Commons, Mr Miliband claimed the government had switched from the previous view that problems in the British economy were all to do with the government and not international factors. He told the PM: 'Today you tell us there are red lights flashing in the global economy. I think that is what is known as getting your excuses in early. 'You used to tell us that the problems in the British economy were all to do with the British government and nothing to do with international factors. 'Now, you want to tell us that on your watch they're all to do with international factors and nothing to do with the British government. 'You have gone from saying everything is fixed thanks to you, to everything is not fixed but is nothing to do with you. 'All along you should have been listening to the British people who see deep problems in an economy not working for them. Isn't it time you stopped blaming everybody else for an economy that's great for a few people at the top but isn't delivering for most working people?' At next May's election, voters would have a choice between the Conservatives, who would ensure the recovery continued by taking tough action, and Labour, who could see it stall by offering 'easy answers'. Mr Cameron's warning follows a claim by Bank of England governor Mark Carney that a 'spectre' of economic stagnation was haunting Europe. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has also expressed fears that a diet of high debt, low growth and unemployment may yet become 'the new normal in Europe'. In an article in the Guardian, Mr Cameron said global instability such as the continued eurozone problems and the ebola outbreak threatened Britain's recovery. He wrote: 'In six months' time, Britain will face a choice: the long-term plan that has seen it prosper, or the easy answers that would surely have seen it fail. 'By sticking to our long-term plan at home and standing up for Britain's interests abroad, we will do everything possible to protect our economy and give hardworking families a secure future in a Britain they are proud to call home.' The Prime Minister shakes hands with Russian President, Vladimir Putin, at the G20 summit in Brisbane . President Francois Hollande (left), President Barack Obama (centre) and David Cameron during a meeting at the summit. The Prime Minister warns that global instability and ebola threatened Britain's recovery . Vladimir Putin stormed out of the G20 summit in Australia yesterday after being branded a liar by a fellow leader. The Russian president was taken to task over his country's support for rebels in Ukraine by Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, when the pair met for the traditional summit photo. 'I guess I'll shake your hand, but I have only one thing to say to you: you need to get out of Ukraine,' Mr Harper told Mr Putin, according to a source in the Canadian's office. 'I'm not in Ukraine,' Mr Putin replied. To which Mr Harper countered: 'That's why I don't want a meeting with you. You'll just lie to me.' Mr Putin flew home before the summit's closing lunch. Mr Cameron's article comes as he flew back from the G20 summit in Brisbane at which the state of the international economy was the main topic. He said ebola, conflict in the Middle East and Russia's 'illegal actions' in Ukraine all added a 'dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty'. Despite this, the British economy was growing. 'But in our interconnected world, wider problems in the global economy pose a real risk to our recovery at home. We cannot insulate ourselves completely, but we must do all we can to protect ourselves from a global downturn.' Mr Cameron said that when the credit crunch happened Labour offered easy answers, 'thinking we could spend, borrow and tax our way to prosperity'. He warned: 'Those were the wrong answers then; they are the wrong answers now.' But Labour highlighted comments by former prime minister Sir John Major, who told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that people were 'concerned and worried' that 'none of the growth in the economy has yet reached wage packets or salary slips'. Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie said: 'David Cameron claims his policies are working, but as even Sir John Major admits, most people still aren't feeling the recovery. 'Working people are £1,600 a year worse off under his Government, borrowing is going up so far this year and exports have fallen behind our competitors. 'David Cameron should be trying to strengthen growth and make sure working people finally benefit from it, not making excuses for slower growth. 'Only Labour's economic plan will deliver a recovery for the many, not just a few at the top. And we'll balance the books, but do so in a fairer way by reversing David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires.'","David Cameron warned that the global economy risked another crash .

"Radio shock jock Alan Jones has hit out at Tony Abbott for signing a free-trade deal with China, saying it does not pass the 'pub test'. The Prime Minister appeared on the 2GB host's radio show on Monday morning where he was savaged by Mr Jones over the deal, projected to be worth at least $18 billion over a decade. 'To win an election – and you're not worth two bob in opposition – to win an election, you've got to pass the pub test,' Mr Jones said. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott greets China's President Xi Jinping at Parliament House  in Brisbane on Sunday . 'Prime Minister I'm telling you out there, they are on fire, in the pubs, they don't swallow this.' Trade experts say the deal is a boon for Australian consumers, who will get cheaper footwear and clothing, and to Australian exporters of dairy, beef and other food. But Mr Jones disagreed, and told Mr Abbott he did not have a mandate to implement the deal. 'I've had this out with [trade minister] Andrew Robb here, he thinks I'm a nutter,' he said. 'We're told, I'm told, that there will be billions of dollars in new markets for Australia exports. 'That the diary farmers will have tariff-free access. But hang on, the dairy farms are owned by China. 'Can Tony Abbott go and buy a farm in China? No, the answer is no Prime Minister, the answer is no he can't, nor can he buy a coal mine, nor can he buy a steel mill.' Australia and China will reportedly sign a free-trade deal  worth $18 billion over a decade . Clothing and footwear, including from Chinese fashion brand Metersbonwe (pictured), is set to become cheaper for Australian consumers . The free trade deal is a boon for farmers, with fresh Australian milk selling at up to $9 a litre in China . Trade expert Alan Oxley said the deal was a positive thing, and the main benefit for consumers in the long run would be in the fashion industry. 'But with the way the dollar is jumping around the place, we might not notice for a while,' said Mr Oxley, principal of ITS Global. Ms Oxley said Australian exporters of food – especially dairy – would be big beneficiaries of the trade deal in the near future. 'In China there is a fair degree of fear about healthy food,' he said. 'There's a rising fear of people in the middle class willing to pay more for products, and the demand for food is just stupendous. 'That's the future for our farmers.' Farmer Luke Cleary, whose milk sells to China, moves his dairy cows on his farm in Wauchope, NSW . China's President Xi Jinping and First Lady Peng Liyuan wave before departing  the G20 on Sunday . Mr Oxley said the trade deal would also enable Australian services industries to do business in China. 'Medical services, finance and insurance companies will be able operate in other markets. 'They'll be able to expand their business and do more business. 'That's the real long-term importance of this, because it's not goods that generates the growth it's services.' Under the deal, 85 per cent of all Australian exports will enter China tariff-free, NewsCorp Australia reports. Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks to the media  at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Brisbane . This is expected to rise to 93 per cent within four years and 95 per cent when the deal is fully in force in more than a decade. Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who has done much of the heavy lifting on the deal over the past year, says Australian manufacturers, farmers, miners and the service sector should be very happy with the agreement. Beef and dairy producers are set to benefit from a phase-down in Chinese tariffs, with dairy exports moving to a similar tariff reduction schedule as New Zealand, NewsCorp reports. China is Australia's number-one trading partner, with the two-way flow of goods and services exceeding $150 billion last year. Trade between the countries was worth just a quarter of that amount a decade ago.","Tony Abbott and Xi Jinping expected to sign free-trade agreement Monday .

"A 10-month-old German Shepherd puppy which was tied up by a chain had to escape by chewing through his own leg. The dog, called Rocky, was taken into the Orange County Animal Shelter in Mission Viejo, California, by his owner on Wednesday. Vets saw that the skin on his right hind leg was down to the bone and an infection had started to spread. Suffering: Rocky was taken into the Orange County Animal Shelter in Mission Viejo, California, by its owner on Wednesday after he chewed through part of his own leg to break free from a chain . Consequences: Vets saw that the skin on his right hind leg was down to the bone and an infection had started to spread. As a result they were forced to amputate . Shocking: An X-ray taken by vets at the Alicia Pet Care Center show the extent of the injuries the German Shepherd puppy inflicted on himself . As a result he was transported to the Alicia Pet Care Center where a shocking X-ray revealed the extent of his injuries. They were so sever they were forced to amputate. The animal will have to wear a cone for the next two weeks while authorities investigate what happened. Rocky's owner, who hasn't been named, insisted he had no idea why the dog chose to bite into his own limb. It is against the law in California to tie an animal to a stationary object. Veterinarian Maria Bromme who performed the surgery, told ABC 7: 'We saw exposed bone, exposed muscle, the infection that started to set in. 'He came in walking, and then we took off the bandage and it really was a pretty gruesome sight, definitely took my breath away. It was really heartbreaking to see.'

"San Jose State University has expelled three students accused of bullying their black roommate by putting a bike lock around his neck and repeatedly taunting him. A fourth student involved in the case has been put on probation for the rest of his college career. The four white students, including a juvenile who has not been named, have pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor battery and hate crime charges. They are accused of putting the bike lock on then-freshman Donald 'DJ' Williams Jr and taunting him with racial slurs, barricading him in his room and putting up a Confederate flag. Justice: Four white students at San Jose State University, pictured, are facing misdemeanor hate crime charges in connection to the racially motivated bullying . As part of their punishment, the ousted students are banned from enrolling in any California State University college. Attorney Eric Geffon, who represents one of the expelled students who is being prosecuted as a juvenile, came away disappointed with the outcome, saying school officials didn't conduct a thorough review of the case because their mind had already been made up. ‘It's a no-brainer,’ LaDoris Cordell, a retired judge who chaired a task force formed by the university to investigate the matter, told San Jose Mercury. ‘They have no business being enrolled at SJSU.’ Williams, from Santa Cruz, revealed last November said he was afraid to come home to the . four-bedroom dormitory suite he had shared with Logan Beaschler, 19, . Joseph Bomgardner, 19, and Colin Warren, 19, since late August 2013. The . teens nicknamed the then-17-year-old 'three-fifths,' referring to how . the government once counted black people as a fraction of a person, and . simply 'fraction' when he protested to the name. The roommates allegedly hung the Confederate flag and wrote . the N-word on a chalk board in their living area, and locked Williams in his room. Ousted: Colin Warren, 19, is one of three SJSU students who was expelled after being charged with hate crimes and battery . The university found that Beaschler . and Warren violated six university rules, resulting in their expulsion. Meanwhile, Bomgardner was suspended until July 31 without admitting his . guilt and ordered to undergo counseling. If he decides to return to . school in the following semester, he will remain on a permanent academic . probation. The Rev. Jethroe Moore II, head of the local chapter of the NAACP, welcomed the . university's decision to expel the three teens, but he expressed concern . that if they are sent to a county jail for a year - the maximum . sentence for a misdemeanor hate crime - 'they'd probably come back as . skinheads.' San . Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi released a statement . back in November, admitting that he and other school officials could . have done more to protect the black student. ‘By . failing to recognize the meaning of a Confederate flag, intervene . earlier to stop the abuse or impose sanctions as soon as the gravity of . the behavior became clear, we failed him. I failed him,’ Qayoumi stated. 'I'm still in shock,' Williams told the Santa Cruz Sentinel . in a phone interview at the time, adding that he'd never experienced . such horrific treatment despite being one of only a few black students . at his Santa Cruz high school. He said he didn't report the situation to campus police because he hoped it would stop. 'I tried not to dwell on this. But my family is upset and I'm upset,' he said. Williams . later told university police he always locked his door at night because . he was scared of most of the other students he lived with and said his . grades suffered because he didn't feel safe studying in his room. The young men confessed to the . relentless harassment in police interviews but denied their actions were . racist, insisting instead the incidents were good-humored 'pranks.' University police, however, . recommended District Attorney Jeff Rosen file the case as a hate crime . and prosecutor Erin West emphatically agreed. 'The . District Attorney's Office has no tolerance for those who criminally . prey on others because they are different,' West told the newspaper. Public outcry: Champagne Ellison, left, a senior at San Jose State University, marches Nov. 21, 2013 in a protest over reported racial hazing of an African-American freshman by his dormitory roommates . The students could face penalties ranging from probation to a year in jail if convicted. The . bullied student was assigned to live with seven young white men in the . house in late August. In mid-October 2013, his parents noticed a . Confederate flag draped in the living room of the suite and the 'N-word' scrawled on a surface in the living room. Concerned, they reported it to . housing officials who notified campus police and two of the roommates . were immediately transferred to a different dorm. However, . the San Jose Sentinel cited police reports as saying at least two . residential assistants were already aware a Confederate flag was being . displayed in the house. But . instead of reporting the students, they asked the young men to take it . out of a window 'so it could not be seen by the general public.' Abuse: The suspects confessed to police that they wrestled the black freshman to the ground and put a metal bike lock, similar to that pictured, around his neck . When asked about the Confederate flag, Beaschler reportedly told police it was a meant as an edgy joke to 'ruffle people's feathers' and referred to his Southern California roots, San Francisco Chronicle reported. The harassment was allegedly spurred on by a two-day orientation session that included sensitivity training. According to reports, the teens blocked Williams' bedroom door with furniture on multiple occasions to prevent him from coming out. Another time, the suspects confessed to police, they wrestled him to the ground, putting a metal bike lock around his neck. The second time they tried this, he managed to escape but came away with bruises, he told police. In another instance, they took the doorknob from inside a closet and attempted to coerce the claustrophobic freshman to step inside with a series of nasty post-it notes. Nazi symbols, including swastikas and the 'SS' symbol, were found in the apartment and also a picture of Adolf Hitler, the Sentinel reported. When the alleged victim's father talked to the roommates and reported the bullying, the freshman received a sarcastic and at times threatening apology note that cited 'the Beloved Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.' and was signed off 'The Residents.' 'The Residents have welcomed you, it is not advised to ignore the call of The Residents,' read a postscript.","San Jose University students Logan Beaschler, 18, Joseph Bomgardner, 19, and Colin Warren, 18, are facing hate-crime and battery charges .

"Sir John Major has claimed Ukip is 'profoundly un-British in every way' just days before the party looks set to beat his in a crucial by-election. The former Conservative Prime Minister blasted the 'sheer nastiness' of Nigel Farage's party and said it was 'anti-everything... anti-politics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant, anti-aid'. Several polls suggest Mark Reckless will become Ukip's second MP after Thursday's Rochester and Strood poll, which was triggered when he defected from the Tories. Scroll down for video . Attack: Former PM Sir John Major blasted Ukip for being 'anti-politics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant, anti-aid' Sir John said: 'I don't know what they are for, we know what they are against. That's not the way to get into Parliament and not the way to run a country... So they may be elected because people are frustrated' A victory would be an echo of fellow defector Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in Essex in a landslide for his new party last month. Sir John told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'I think many of the people who are voting for them are doing so out of frustration at the ongoing difficulties of the recession, the belief that they are losing out and falling behind. 'That will fade away as the economy improves, and it is materially improving.' In his strongly-worded attack he added: 'The policies of Ukip, the direction of Ukip, is, it seems to me, profoundly un-British in every way. 'They are anti-everything. They are anti-politics, they are anti-foreigner, they are anti-immigrant, they are anti-aid. Confident: Nigel Farage supporting his candidate, who looks set to win, at Rochester's Guildhall last week . 'I don't know what they are for, we know what they are against. That's the negativity of the four-ale bar, that's not the way to get into Parliament and not the way to run a country. 'So they may be elected because people are frustrated.' Sir John highlighted the Ebola appeal and Children in Need, adding: 'What a counterpoint that is to the negativity and sheer nastiness of much of what Ukip stands for.' Appeal: Grant Shapps told Sky News today the EU was 'too big, too bossy, too interfering' Today Mr Farage told The Sunday Telegraph he was 'confident but not complacent' that Mr Reckless would win, partly on the back of a collapse in the Labour vote in the seat. 'We are smashing the Labour vote to pieces,' he said. 'This is not a straight fight between Ukip and the Tories'. A Lord Ashcroft poll last week Labour in third on 17 per cent, with Ukip on 44 per cent and the Conservatives trailing far behind them on 32 per cent. David Cameron has warned that a Ukip win would put the country at greater risk of 'insecurity and instability in our economy'. The Prime Minister warned voters in the Kent constituency that they risk becoming another notch on the bedpost of Mr Farage's party, who would celebrate victory with 'a pint in the pub'. He would not represent the area as well as locally-born Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst, Mr Cameron added. Despite Sir John's comments, Tory chairman Grant Shapps made another appeal to Eurosceptic voters today as he said the EU was 'too bossy'. He acknowledged the Tories had 'a problem' with hitting their target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the parliament, partly because of EU migrants attracted by the relative strength of the British economy. He told Sky News: 'David Cameron, absolutely rightly, is saying on behalf of the British people we don't think this is an open-ended deal, we believe that we should have some control over people coming here. 'People can come here to work, yes, but not to claim benefits.' He added: 'Most people in this country think Europe is too big, too bossy, too interfering.'","Sir John blasted 'sheer nastiness' of Farage's party in BBC interview .

Second on the list of properties due to be sold this year was a property in Kensington Palace Gardens, which was on the market for about £100m. Properties in Los Angeles, Connecticut, Dallas, New York and Istanbul made up the rest of the list, with the third London home coming in at tenth place. The 15-bedroom Grade II-listed mansion in The Bishop's Avenue, Hampstead was on the market for £65million. In April last year it was reported the £250m house in Carlton House Terrace had gone on the market. The property boasts 50,000 sq ft of living space, making it one of the capital’s largest private homes. Reports at the time suggested a ‘strictly confidential’ brochure, which describes the house as ‘probably the finest residence in London’, had been circulating among the super-wealthy. Details on the interior are sketchy, but there is believed to be a magnificent double staircase and a huge ballroom. The house is registered in the British Virgin Islands and is said to be owned by a member of a Middle East royal family.","Terraced house is situated on one of the finest streets in the heart of Mayfair, London, near Hyde Park and Green Park .

"The artists behind the First World War poppy memorial in London are in line for gongs in the Queen's new years honours list, it has been revealed. Paul Cummins and Tom Piper have been nominated by ministers for their work in creating Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London, it has been reported. The pair are most likely to be appointed OBEs for services to the arts after nearly five million people flocked to view the stunning exhibit in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday. Paul Cummins (left) and Tom Piper (right) have been nominated by ministers for their work in creating Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London, it has been reported . The pair are most likely to be appointed OBEs after nearly five million people flocked to view the stunning exhibit in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday . It is understood that the award was approved by the arts and media honours committee, the Sunday Times reports. The newspaper quotes a senior Whitehall source as saying: ' They have both been recommended for honours. It will happen in the new year list.' The ceramic flowers were designed by Mr Cummins, who revealed how the project was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town. Tom Piper, a theatrical designer with the Royal Shakespeare Company, helped devise the exhibit and was instrumental in creating two of its key elements, the Weeping Willow - a cascade of poppies which spills from a window of the castle - and the Wave - which swirls out of the moat to form an arch over the entrance to the Tower. The artwork, marking the centenary of the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, captured the public imagination and was visited by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh (pictured) The team began producing the flowers - each of which took three days to make - at an 8,000ft factory in Derby in January . Each of the 888,246 poppies, which filled the moat of the Tower for Remembrance Day, represented a British or Commonwealth casualty of the First World War . Theses two features will remain at the Tower until later this month and will then go on tour around the country until 2018, when they will be gifted to the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester.

Previously, Mr Cummins has said: ‘I read through wills of First World War soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed. He wrote of “blood swept lands and seas of red, where angels dare to tread”. It read like a poem and it just seemed to fit.’ The artist, who is studying for a PhD at Derby University, added: ‘This is the biggest thing I have done.

"Pregnancy is something which is traditionally only applicable to women, however new statistics reveal it may be becoming more prevalent among males. In the past year 54 Australian men have given birth according to Medicare - who recently allowed people to elect their own gender on documents, rather than being forced to record the sex they were born. Since Thomas Beatie became the first man to give birth in 2007 after he kept his female reproductive organs when he transitioned to male, others such as American transgender man Nick Bowser have also given birth. Scroll down for video . In the past 12 months 54 Australian men have given birth. Pictured here is Thomas Beatie, the first male ever to have a baby . And it seems this occurrence has extended to Australia. In the 2013-2014 financial year 22 men in Western Australia gave birth to their own children, while in NSW 16 men had babies. Plus seven men in Victoria, six in Queensland, two in South Australia and one in Tasmania all became new dads in an unconventional way. The men were mostly aged 24-36 with 32 of the babies being born from males in that age group. One man aged 55-64 also had a child. No male births were recorded in the ACT or the Northern Territory, according to the Medicare statistics. It is likely that the men giving birth were born female but identify as male and kept their female reproductive organs after transitioning. This was the case with Thomas Beatie who gave birth to his first child in 2007, and has since has two more children. Mr Beattie, a transgender male,  was born a female and as he kept his reproductive organs he was able to give birth to three children . The Australian Health Department confirmed the statistics to News Corp, saying they were informed of such cases around the country. 'The department is aware of cases of persons identifying themselves as male having pregnancy related treatment which can be claimed under Medicare. Previously these items could not be paid to male patients,' a health department spokeswoman told the Herald Sun. In addition to men giving birth, they have also been accessing abortions, although the exact figures on this are unclear as they are tallied under the same code as a dilatation and curettage (D&C). Transgender Victoria spokeswoman Sally Goldman told Daily Mail Australia the statistics do not come as a surprise and supported the decision by Medicare to allow people to record their own gender. 'People need to be their true self in relationship to gender identity and gender expression ... I'm not really surprised.' A few years ago transgender couple Bianca and Nick Bosher had a child, with Nick - who was born Nicole - giving birth . As for whether she believes this will be something we see more often in the future, Ms Goldman predicted that we will see the number of transgender males giving birth increase. 'I think it will ... people are saying well we've got a right for life, so yes it will increase. She added that while she understands that while people's relationships with their bodies and gender identities run deep and may differ, people have the right to simply be themselves. 'We're not just two groups of three and a half billion each, we are all different people,' Ms Goldman said.","54 Australian men have given birth in the past year .
Medicare statistics show that 22 men were from WA and 16 from NSW .
Men also accessed abortions according to the figures .

"Four Iowa teens who met on Xbox and hatched a plan to run away from home were arrested today and charged with trespassing in an abandoned house 360 miles away from their homes. The girls, Skie Floyd and Jazlyn Visek, both 15, were last seen around noon Saturday at a park in Shellsburg, Iowa, before going on the run with . 13-year-old Austin Michael Boggs and 16-year-old Corey Sunderman from . Atlantic, Iowa, which is roughly 200 miles from Shellsburg. 'I hysterically started crying, just overwhelmed with joy. All floods of . emotions. Overjoyed, relief, you name it. I couldn't believe it,' said . Judy Hamilton, the mother Jazlyn Visek, upon learning her daughter had been found. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Skie Floyd, left, and Jazlyn Visek, right were last seen at noon Saturday . Police believe the girls are with two . teen runaways, 16-year-old Corey . Sunderman, pictured left, and 13-year-old Austin Michael Boggs, pictured right . The families haven't spoken directly with the children since they were found, but got word today that the teens were being held at the Woodford . County Correctional Facility. All the teens will spend the night in jail before facing a judge on trespassing charges Wednesday morning. 'We had a long conversation with the officers who were involved,' Sheriff Randall Forsyth of Iowa's Benton County told ABC News. 'They . told us they located the kids and they were responding to the complaint . of trespassing at a residence.' After facing an Illinois judge Wednesday, the teens will be allowed to return home, said Sunderman's mother, Crystal Sunderman. 'We'll probably leave tomorrow morning (for Illinois) in hopes that . maybe we can see the kids before they go to court because we haven't had . a chance to talk to them at all,' she said. Visek started dating Corey Sunderman after the pair met on Xbox. ""This was her first serious boyfriend. He gave her a lot of attention she's never got from any guys,"" Hamilton said. The boys vanished Saturday after police brought them to the Sunderman . home Friday night for violating the town's curfew. 'This is going to sound really stupid, . but I took all the shoes downstairs and put them in a bag and took them . up to my room, thinking if I had the boys' shoes, they couldn't go out . and go skateboarding again,' Crystal Sunderman told ABC. Police are searching for four teens from Iowa, two girls and two boys, who have been missing since Saturday and are believed to be runaways . The teens are believed to be traveling in a 1997 gold Jeep Grand Cherokee with no license plates (stock image) The boys found extra boots in the . garage and left home later that night, taking $400 from Corey's father's . paycheck, his mother's laptop, and the family's 1997 gold Jeep . Cherokee. The Cherokee, which did not have license plates when the boys took it, had been marked with stolen license plates from Atlantic. Hamilton said she thinks the teens  plotted the escape in advance. '[Visek] had been planning for a couple weeks at least, and I had no idea,' she said. 'I've learned a valuable lesson on media devices and what you allow your . children to do on Xbox or Facebook. I admit I was pretty . free with Jazlyn and I trusted her, and I think I gave her too much . freedom.' The two girls and two boys are thought . to have run away together after the boys took one of their parent's . cars and then allegedly drove across the state for four hours to pick up . the girls. Corey has run away from home twice before but he has returned both times and has no criminal history. A local storeowner reported that he had seen the boys driving . that car early Saturday morning. The owner said that he allowed the boys to use the shop phone but only if they did so on speakerphone. 'The conversation was something to the . effect of, 'Don't pick us up at our house. Pick us up at the Quick . Stop,' said sheriff Randall Forsyth. Vanished: Skie Floyd, left, and Jazlyn Visek were last seen around on Saturday in Benton County, Iowa . Though the parents are happy to know their children are safe, they're still wondering what they could have done to prevent the situation. ""I'm starting to worry about what am I going to do to keep Corey, to . keep him safe... We've got to fix whatever it was that made him leave. He's had some problems at school with bullying but honestly, I don't . know,"" Sunderman said.","Skie Floyd and Jazlyn Visek, both 15, missing since Saturday in Iowa .

"It's been almost three years since Gordon Wood was acquitted of murdering girlfriend Caroline Byrne but a jury will again be asked to decide whether he's guilty or innocent - this time in a defamation trial. The body of 24-year-old Ms Byrne, a Sydney model, was found at the bottom of The Gap, in Sydney's east, a notorious suicide spot, on June 8, 1995. Mr Wood, a former chauffeur to stockbroker Rene Rivkin, was arrested for his girlfriend's murder in 2006. He was convicted of her murder in November 2008 and spent more than three years in jail before being acquitted in 2012. Gordon Wood, who was acquitted for his girlfriend Caroline Byrne's murder, has launched a defamation trial against Nationwide News for alleging he did kill Ms Byrne . The body of 24 year old Ms Byrne, a Sydney model, was found at the bottom of The Gap, in Sydney's east, a notorious suicide spot, on June 8, 1995 . While Mr Wood's acquittal seemed to be the closure in a long running case, it will be opened once again, possibly next year. Mr Wood had launched defamation suits in the NSW Supreme Court against a number of Australian media organisations, including Channel Seven, 2GB and 2UE for alleging he did kill Ms Byrne. While it's believed those cases have been settled, the defamation matter against Nationwide News - now News Corp Australia - remains and Fairfax News reports the corporation intends to defend the defamation claim itself on the basis that the allegation of murder is true. On Friday, NSW Supreme Court Justice Lucy McCallum said the case would, in effect, involve the publisher 're-running the Crown case in the criminal trial', but with a lower standard of proof. In September, Justice McCallum ordered a larger jury panel of 12, rather than four, to decide the case. Gordon Wood (pictured) in 2008, was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend, model Caroline Byrne, at a notorious Sydney suicide spot in 1995 . Gordon Wood, who was acquitted for the murder of Caroline Byrne, will go back to court to reopen the case through a defamation trial . The Gap at Watsons Bay in Sydney's east, where the body of  Ms Byrne was found on June 8, 1995 . A preliminary judgement by Justice McCallum said that Mr Wood was seeking to pursue his claims in defamation. 'The action will involve a retrial of the issue whether he murdered his girlfriend, the difference being that the standard of proof that applies in civil proceedings will apply,' Justice McCallum said. 'The determination of an allegation of murder is one which weighs heavily on those who have to determine it.' Justice McCallum also said that the original trial received 'a great deal of media attention' and a larger jury might help 'dilute the influence of any single juror whose passions or antipathies may be aroused for or against one of the parties'. In court on Friday it was ruled that Mr Wood would have to provide written answers under oath to questions served to him by Nationwide News. The trial date is expected to be set next year. The length of the trial is estimated to be about eight weeks.

"It was a turning point in the war, when only the bravery of The Few who took to the skies to defend their country stood between Britain and the might of Nazi Germany’s Luftwaffe. But less than half of today’s secondary school pupils know the Battle of Britain was fought in the air, a poll has revealed. Only 62 per cent could correctly identify a photograph of Sir Winston Churchill, it found – but 92 per cent recognised a picture of Churchill the insurance dog. 'Oh yes'? More like 'Oh no': Over 90 per cent recognised the dog from the Churchill Insurance advertisements yet only a measly 62 per cent of the students polled could identify Sir Winston Churchill . More could identify Jedward, Wayne Rooney and Katie Price than their country’s wartime leader. Only a third of 11 to 18-year-olds know the Second World War began in 1939, according to a poll by former Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, while only one in five knows what happened on D-Day. The survey of 1,000 children at secondary schools across Britain was commissioned to mark the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial in London later this week. Its results will heighten concern about the quality of history teaching in our schools. It found that only 34 per cent of pupils – including 45 per cent of those aged 17 and 18 – knew the Second World War began in 1939. Only 39 per cent knew it ended in 1945, again including only 45 per cent of 17 and 18-year-olds. The RAF Bomber Command Memorial which will be unveiled in a ceremony attended by the Royal Family, including The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh  in London's Green Park on Thursday . Forty-three per cent knew the Battle of Britain was fought in the air, 29 per cent believed it was fought on land, and 8 per cent at sea. Twenty per cent admitted they did not know. Just 34 per cent correctly said the Battle of Britain took place in the 1940s, and only 11 per cent of these – about one in 27 of the whole sample – knew it happened in 1940. Only a fifth of children had any idea of what happened on D-Day, with the most frequent answer being the day the war ended. Eighty-six per cent correctly said there had been two world wars – but one in 20 thought there had been three. Nearly a third were unable to give any unprompted explanation of why Britain fought in the Second World War . And while 89 per cent identified Germany as an adversary during the conflict, only 15 per cent could name Japan unprompted. Nearly a quarter thought Britain’s enemies had included Russia, France, China, the USA, Australia or New Zealand. Only 61 per cent correctly named the USA as an ally of Britain’s in the . Second World War. One in ten thought our allies had included Italy, . Germany or Japan. More people could identify Jedward and Katie Price than Sir Winston Churchill . When the children were offered four different explanations for what Bomber Command is or was, only 36 per cent correctly said it had been part of the RAF. There was some encouraging news, however - 95 per cent correctly identified the Royal British Legion’s poppy, and 84 per cent knew what it signified. Lord Ashcroft, who made a £1 million donation towards the new Bomber Command Memorial, which is being unveiled on Thursday, said: 'It is sobering to find that so many children of secondary school age simply do not know important facts about crucial events in Britain’s recent history. 'My own father fought in D-Day, and I was keen to discover how much today’s young people know of what happened just 70 years ago. 'I don’t mean to criticise the children. We must all take responsibility for ensuring that what we know is passed to the next generation. These findings show we can never be complacent about our duty to remember. 'One of the ways we can do this is to build lasting memorials to those who have sacrificed so much to serve our country. That is the purpose of the Bomber Command Memorial, which I am proud to support. 'The Memorial is long overdue. Those who flew on countless missions over Nazi Germany and occupied Europe, many of whom were barely out of their teenage years, knew the odds were stacked against them, and many did not return. 'All of us should be thankful for the sacrifice they made to ensure that we can all live in a free society.'","30 per cent more students recognised the dog from Churchill Insurance's advertisements than war leader Sir Winston Churchill .

"Facebook is in talks with a London-based satellite technology firm about a ground-breaking bid to prove free internet access in large parts of Africa. The project, under the social network's Internet.org initiative, is part of founder Mark Zuckerberg's plan to put the developing world online. It has been reported the deal with satellite operator Avanti is expected to be announced soon. Mr Zuckerberg turned to the company after plans to bring the Internet to Africa with mobile operators, including Vodafone, were rejected. The ground-breaking bid is part of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's aim to connect developing world . A commercial deal with Avanti would mean Facebook could cover swathes of Africa at a relatively low cost, reported The Telegraph. The company already owns two broadband satellites positioned over the continent and plans to increase coverage by launching a further three in the next few years. Facebook's Internet.org is aimed to 'bring the Internet to the two thirds of the world's population that doesn't have it'. Its mission statement says: 'No one should have to choose between access to the Internet and food or medicine. 'Internet.org partners will join forces to develop technology that decreases the cost of delivering data to people worldwide, and helps expand Internet access in underserved communities.' Internet.org believes if developing economies had the same levels of internet access as in the first world, global productivity would be boosted by 25% and 160million people would be lifted out of poverty. In an interview with CNN, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted 'to put the whole world online'. Recently, Facebook launched a tool to make it easier for users to donate to organizations working to fight Ebola . He said: 'I mean, here, we use things like Facebook to share news and catch up with out friends, but there, they're going to use it to decide what kind of government they want, get access to healthcare for the first time ever, connect with family hundreds of miles away that they haven't seen for decades. 'Getting access to the Internet is a really big deal'. Recently, Mr Zuckerberg showed his concern for the plight of Africans by provided a tool on his social network allowing users to donate to organizations working to fight Ebola. He also provided internet connectivity in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to help medical and aid workers track cases and co-ordinate their response. Avanti declined to give a comment. Facebook has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.","Proposal is part of Mark Zuckerberg's plan to connect developing world .

"TLC has announced it will air a full series about a progressive polygamous family from Utah that starred in a one-hour pilot earlier this year. The cable TV network said Thursday it will produce nine, one-hour episodes about Brady Williams and his five wives and 24 children. The first episode is set to debut March 9. The September pilot episode drew good ratings. Scroll down for video . Reality stars! TLC will produce nine, one-hour episodes about Brady Williams (center) and his five wives, pictured, from left, Paulie, Robyn, Rosemary, Nonie and Rhonda . Members of the Williams family are among an estimated 15,000 independent polygamists in the West who don't belong to an organized, fundamentalist Mormon church. Williams and his wives withdrew from the Apostolic United Brethren during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. The family no longer teaches the tenets of fundamental Mormonism to their children at home, opting instead to take from other teachings such as Buddhism to instill good, morale values in their two dozen children, who range in age from 2-20. Their move into the national spotlight comes with much less risk than it would have just a month ago. A federal judge in Utah last week struck down key parts of the state's polygamy laws, saying a provision that forbids cohabitation violates the First Amendment. Large family: Mr Williams' five wives have had 24 children between them . The ruling decriminalizes polygamy, making only bigamy — holding marriage licenses with multiple partners - illegal. The lawsuit was brought by Kody Brown and his four wives, the stars of TLC's show 'Sister Wives,' and the trailblazers for polygamous families on reality TV. The Browns sued in July 2011 and fled Utah for Las Vegas last year under the threat of prosecution. Brady Williams told The Associated Press earlier this week that the ruling was a momentous for him and others with multiple wives. 'There is no threat over our heads now,' Williams said. 'It's a first step in the right direction toward the de-marginalization of polygamists.' The real story: Mr Williams poses with Robyn (left) and Rosemary (right) outside of their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City . Family time: Mr Williams with his wives, from left, Robyn, Paulie, Rosemary, Nonie, and Rhonda, at their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City . In addition to the Browns and now the . Williams family, TLC also has done a special featuring the Darger family . of Utah. HBO's fictional show about a polygamous family, 'Big Love,' ran for five seasons. Following the recent court ruling, Williams said now is the time for polygamists to show they are deserving of the recognition by putting an end to the misogyny rampant among the culture and putting women on equal footing as men. 'Women are not a commodity and they shouldn't be treated as such,' said Williams, 43, a project manager in his brother's construction business. 'There needs to be complete symmetry within a marriage.' Sister Wives: Kody Brown and his four wives, (from left) Janelle, Christine, Meri and Robyn, were previously the polygamous stars of TLC's reality show schedule . He said that should include strictly prohibiting any man from having child wives. One of the most infamous polygamists, Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting two underage girls he considered his brides. Jeffs still rules a sect of fundamentalist Mormons on the Utah-Arizona border from jail. 'We need to call it for what it is: evil,' Williams said. The practice of polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the mainstream church and its 15 million members worldwide abandoned polygamy in 1890 and strictly prohibit it today.","A pilot episode featuring Brady Williams and his family drew good ratings on the network in September .

"A businessman who built his own £325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks is to close the shortcut after the local council invested £660,000 to finish repairs five weeks early. Mike Watts, 63, claims he will now not make a penny and will lose out on a profit of several thousand pounds after Bath and North East Somerset completed the work ahead of schedule. He became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century when a crucial road in Kelston, Somerset, was closed by a landslip, leaving locals with a 14-mile diversion. Mike Watts, 63, who built his own £325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks is to close the shortcut . The roadworks were scheduled to last until Christmas, which would have given Mr Watts and his wife Wendy, 52, a healthy profit on their £325,000 investment. But instead the A431 Kelston Road between Bristol and Bath will re-open tomorrow, meaning he couple will just break even after spending £150,000 to build the road and £150,000 on upkeep. Mr Watts said he has received constant opposition from the local authority, which bombarded him with red tape and forced him to spend £25,000 gaining retrospective planning permission. He also revealed that officials at Bath and North East Somerset Council had sent him a £3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official. 'It feels like they may have raised the money to take me out of the equation.' he said. The businessman claims he will now not make a penny and will lose out on a profit of several thousand pounds after Bath and North East Somerset council suddenly found extra money to repair roadworks . 'It's quite astonishing that they found this extra cash in September. It's sped up the process to get the road open early. 'It's a catch 22, I want the road back open but we had budgeted for the road to be closed till Christmas. 'Now myself and the farmer who let me use his land probably won't see a penny. 'I'm disappointed in the overall support from the council. If they had supported me things would have been so much better. 'People would have gotten everywhere quicker and the farmer and I would have made some money.' His wife Wendy, 52, accused Bath and North East Somerset Council of deliberately trying to bankrupt them. She said: 'The Kelston Toll Road is and always was a community initiative to help with the dreadful situation we found ourselves in. 'We thought, stupidly with hindsight, that the council would be supportive. After all, we didn't want them to cough up any dosh for it - we wanted it to pay for itself. The roadworks were scheduled to last until Christmas, which would have given Mr Watts and his wife Wendy, 52, a healthy profit on their £325,000 investment . 'We have used our home as a guarantee for the costs of the temporary road, which was a decision we came to with our eyes wide open.' The A431 Kelston Road was closed in February after a landslip caused huge cracks to appear in the road. So the couple asked their friend John Dinham if they could rent the field until Christmas and hired three workmen to help build the road in just ten days. The toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit, which the couple thought was easily possible by Christmas. More than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month. He charged motorists £2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings. But in September the council suddenly found a further £660,000 to complete the roadworks early and open the main road, meaning the toll road will be shut. Mr Watts has been hailed a hero for his entrepreneurial spirit and said the public have really taken the toll road into their hearts. 'People are coming over the road with beaming faces and I have had letters of support from all over the country,' he said. But instead the A431 Kelston Road between Bristol and Bath will re-open tomorrow, meaning he couple will just break even after spending £150,000 to build the road and £150,000 on upkeep . He charged motorists £2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings . 'Well, I say all over the country, but it is actually all over the world, from Latvia and Germany, it has just really captured people's imaginations.' But his wife said the whole experience has been a 'nightmare' because of the 'obstructive' behaviour of the council. 'My husband and I have done lots of interesting things in our working lives, but I have to say that the Toll Road experience has been the single most stressful project we have ever been involved in,' said Mrs Watts. 'Kelston Toll Road Ltd has received a bill from the B&NES council for business rates to the tune of £3,500 and yet they do not recognise the temporary toll road as a community initiative. 'I just cannot believe how blatantly obstructive the council has been during this whole saga. They have done everything they can to hinder us.' Bath and North East Somerset Council denies trying to block the couple, saying the extra cash was necessary to speed up the works. It said in a statement: 'The council has made a considerable effort to work with Mr Watts and various officers and members have met with him several times. 'The Council has provided expertise, advice and our ground investigation results free of charge. 'This road is open to the public and therefore, in the public interest, must comply with the normal safety standards for public roads. 'Councillors made an emergency decision to approve an extra £660,000 (for the A431 repairs) following further investigation works at the site, which discovered that below the land which had already moved, there was another layer of 'soft' rock, which was also at risk of sliding. 'The additional funding was needed for the necessary revised scheme which required two rows of deep piling to ensure that future land-slips are prevented.'

"She became the biggest star on TV at just 18 months old, but today, 'Baby' Jessica McClure is a stay-at-home mom of two. Now Jessica Morales, the 26-year-old is married and still lives near the site of her dramatic rescue on October 16, 1987 - 25 years ago today. Millions around the world were glued to their televisions and praying for her safety as dozens of rescuers worked night and day to save Jessica McClure from inside an abandoned well. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Jessica McClure is held by paramedic Robert O'Donnell, who killed himself in 1995. Now a mother-of-two, Jessica, right, says she is proud of her scars and can't remember the ordeal . During her 58-hour ordeal, . kind-hearted viewers even donated money to help the little girl recover, . which was placed into a trust fund. She collected the fund's $800,000 on her 25th birthday last year. Jessica intended to put the money towards a college fund for her two children - Simon and Sheyenne. She is now married to Daniel Morales and is a contented stay-at-home mother of two, looking after her kids and living less than two miles from the site that made her famous. The mother has no memory of being wedged in the pipe or the 15 operations that followed her ordeal, according to her father. A scar from her hairline to the bridge of her nose is still visible where her head rubbed against the wall of the well. Rescue: Scores of rescuers gather at the eight-inch opening to a well shaft in this October 15, 1987 photo, in Midland, Texas. Trapped, injured and alone, was 18-month-old Jessica McClure . Escape: rescuers encouraged Jessica to sing songs during the October 16, 1987 rescue . She also lost a toe to gangrene because one leg was pinned above her head in the underground shaft. These days, she and her husband run a mobile car- and truck-washing business out of their home. In October 1987, her father Lewis 'Chip' McClure and his wife, Reba 'Cissy' McClure, were poor teenagers struggling to make ends meet during the depths of the oil bust. While visiting her sister, Jessica's mother left her in the yard while she went to answer the phone. Moments later, Jessica came upon the 8-inch well opening and fell inside. Her plight captivated an immense television audience. Alone and 22 feet below ground, Baby Jessica sang about Winnie the Pooh. It was 'a nightmare that got worse and worse,' her father recalled in an interview last year. When rescuers finally brought her to the surface, her head was bandaged. She was covered with dirt and bruises, and her right palm was stuck to her face. Recovery: Jessica was helped along the way by her parents Reba 'Cissy' Porter,  and her father Lewis 'Chip' McClure, left, and became a national star . A . 1997 poll taken by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press . found that coverage of Princess Diana's death earlier that year was . rivalled only by Jessica's rescue in worldwide attention over the . previous decade. At the time of the accident, sympathetic strangers showered the family with teddy bears, home-made gifts, cards and cash. Bank documents show the couple's home was purchased with help from the trust. Carroll Thomas, Midland's mayor in . 1987, said the city's reputation benefited from the rescue. Most people . around the world had not heard of Midland back then. ‘They . had a good feeling about Midland because they read about it and saw how . hard we were working,’ he said. ‘It went on so long.’ About . three years after the TV cameras left, Chip and Cissy divorced. Both . have since remarried. Present day: Jessica is now happily married to Daniel Morales, right, and is a stay-at-home mother to Simon and Sheyenne. At left, she receives her high school diploma . In 2002, she told Ladies Home Journal that talk of her 'incident' bored her, and she took pride in her scars. 'I'm proud of them,' she said. 'I have them because I survived.' In the same interview, she disclosed . that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, which was diagnosed just . before she entered the 10th grade. The ordeal 'couldn't cage me then, why should it cage me now?’ she told NBC in June 2007. Even the family doesn't talk about it when they're together, McClure said. 'It seems a little surreal,' he said. 'In some ways, it seems familiar and recent. Other times, it seems like . someone else a long time ago.' Friends in high places: Despite the international fame she could have embraced, Jessica - seen here with then president George Bush in 1989 - has only spoken publically about the accident three times . Jessica's low-key personality has helped her adjust over the years, her father said. Others could never recover. In 1995, Robert O'Donnell, the paramedic clutching Jessica as they emerged from the well in a famous 1987 photo, killed himself while battling post-traumatic stress. Andy Glasscock, the police officer who was one of the first to the scene after Jessica fell down the well, pleaded guilty in 2004 to raping a woman he had drugged, as well as child pornography charges, according to the Houston Chronicle. Throughout Jessica's childhood, both parents worked to give her a normal life, her father has said. In . her later years of high school, she lived briefly with her father in . Tyler. In 2004, she graduated from Greenwood High School, near Midland. Mr . McClure said he and his ex-wife allowed their daughter to decide . whether to talk to the media once she became old enough. She has spoken . publicly just three times since the accident. Watch the video of Jessica's rescue in 1987 here .","Jessica McClure was 18 months old when she fell in the well in Midland, Texas .

"Teachers allowed two young sisters to get so badly sunburned that they needed hospital treatment because of a little-known law that bans students from applying sunscreen at school. Fair-skinned Violet Michener, 11, and her nine-year-old sister Zoe were left seared from head to toe after spending an afternoon in the sun during an outdoor field day in Tacoma Washington. Their mother, Jesse Michener, who didn't put cream on the girls in the morning because of a rain forecast, was horrified to learn that teachers refused to allow the children . to apply any cream. Scroll down for video . Burned: Sisters Violet, 11, (left) and Zoe, 9, (right) received sunburns strong enough to bring them to a hospital for blisters and chills after a school field day prohibited their use of sunscreen due to school policy . Public schools in all states except California are not allowed to apply or carry the product to school because - despite being freely available in supermarkets - it is deemed a prescription medication. Yet the girls say they were . forced to watch one teacher put on her own sunscreen and then explain to . the burning students that it was  'just for . her' when they begged her for some. 'While I can sort of wrap my brain . around this in theory, the practice of a blanket policy which clearly . allows for students to be put in harm’s way is deeply flawed,' Mrs . Michener wrote in a blog post. Making . matters worse, the mother claims that one of her daughters has a form of . Albinism - a skin condition that leads to easy burning - that her school was aware of. Prescription: Sunscreen, like this product shown, is considered an over-the-counter medication and not allowed in most schools across the country without a prescription . 'Violet is . starting to blister on her face. Both children have headaches, chills . and pain,' Mrs Michener wrote last Wednesday after taking the children to Tacoma General . hospital. 'Two are home today as a direct result of how terrible they . feel. My children indicated that several adults commented on their burns at school, including staff and other parents.' For liability reasons, most states consider sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication requiring a prescription. 'Because so many additives in lotions and sunscreens cause an allergic reaction in some children, we have to really monitor that,' said Dan Voelpel, a Tacoma school district spokesman speaking to ABC. Since raising awareness in her area of the SPF policy, Mrs Michener began to see some success late last week. Receiving a call from the director of Elementary Education in Tacoma Public Schools last Thursday according to her blog, the director informed her of a new law passed allowing districts to decide for themselves what's allowed and what's not. 'He stated that how the law will actually shake-out for districts is still to be seen (the devil is always in the details), but that he hoped a policy revision could be achieved by October,' the mother wrote. Asked by the Huffington Post on Friday the condition of the two girls, the mother replied: ‘They will heal this week, but long term effects are yet to be seen.’ Watch the video here: . video platform . video management . video solutions . video player .","Fairskinned Violet Michener, 11, and sister Zoe, nine, seared from head to toe .

"A gentler side of Billy the Kid can be seen in a rare new picture to emerge of the legendary Western outlaw. Respected forensic artist Louis Gibson, who previously identified the sailor kissing the nurse in the famous V-J Day picture taken in Times Square, has studied the latest image and says it is indeed the Kid, born Henry McCarty. Gibson bases her opinion on several striking similarities between this photo and the only authenticated picture of the Kid, and says the head shape and hair are the same, as well as his signature pinky ring and crooked teeth. Put together: A new photo purporting to show Billy the Kid (left) has emerged. The only verified picture of the Western outlaw was sold to billionaire William Koch in 2011 for $2.3million . Owner: The latest picture is owned by Billy the Kid collector Ray John de Aragon, whose grandmother allegedly treated the outlaw as a medicine woman . The only verified picture of Billy the Kid was sold in 2011 to billionaire William Koch, and shows the gunslinger leaning against his rifle in a cocky stance. 'I think he went out, had some booze, partied with some saloon girls and just got wild,' Gibson told the Houston Chronicle, of the original image. The latest picture shows 'progression of his personality, he looks really shy in this (new) photo, he looks like he had a transformation'. If the picture goes to auction, it could fetch several thousand dollars. However, some experts are suspicious about the picture's origins, since it is currently owned by Kid-collector Ray John de Aragon, a man who routinely brings out pictures claiming they show the outlaw. De Aragon says his grandmother was a medicine woman who knew and treated Billy the Kid, and that he came upon the picture through a friend of his father's who was once close with the subject. He says it's an  'old family picture of Billy the Kid'. Gibson will get no share of the profits if the photo is sold at auction. She was paid just $750 for her work analyzing the photo. While there is only one authenticated picture of Billy the Kid, this isn't the first time someone has come forward with a photo of the gunslinger. Last year, historian Frank Parrish claimed to have found a picture of Billy with friend  Dan Dedrick. Billy the Kid was a wanted outlaw in the American frontier of the late 1800s. He was born to Irish immigrants in Manhattan, but eventually found his way West to New Mexico where he descended into criminality and killed his first man at the age of 18. According to popular legend, Billy the Kid killed 21 men, one for each year of his short life. But the reality is probably somewhere between four and nine. He was shot dead in 1881, after New Mexico's governor put a price of $5,000 on his head. Another picture of the Kid surfaced last year, showing him (right) with friend Dan Dedrick (left)","New image reportedly shows Billy the Kid, real name Henry McCarty, as a younger man .

"Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said that faint-hearted heads are failing to impose their authority on schools, resulting in low standards of  education and poor discipline . Faint-hearted heads are failing to impose their authority on schools, resulting in low standards of  education and poor discipline among pupils, according to the chief inspector of schools. Sir Michael Wilshaw said school leaders are too worried about offending their teaching staff, many of whom have a ‘pervasive resentment of all things managerial’, and refuse to accept their place lower down the hierarchy. In a hard-hitting speech in central London yesterday, the head of Ofsted said teachers were also failing to make it clear to children that adults are in charge. He said there was nothing wrong with telling children ‘Do as I ask, because I am the adult’. But he suggested the problem stemmed from weak heads who lack the will and experience to lead from the top. Sir Michael said: ‘Too many teachers still think that school leaders do not have the right to tell them how to teach or what to do. ‘The staff room, in their minds, is just as capable of deciding the direction a school should take as the Senior Leadership Team. ‘I’ve come to the conclusion that many of their efforts are undermined by a pervasive resentment of all things managerial. ‘Some teachers simply will not accept that a school isn’t a collective but an organisation with clear hierarchies and separate duties. ‘What’s worse, far too many school leaders seem to believe that they don’t have a right to manage either. They worry constantly about staff reaction. They hold endless meetings to curry favour. They seem to think they cannot act without their employees’ approval. ‘Yes, you should consult with staff. But never confuse consultation with negotiation.’ Sir Michael also said teachers were also failing to make it clear to children that adults are in charge (file picture) Children cannot ‘thrive in a chaotic school where there is little authority’, Sir Michael said, adding: ‘Indeed, children who come from homes where there are few boundaries need more structure at school, not less. ‘Raising attainment is predicated on a culture in which heads do everything they can to reinforce not only their authority but the authority of all the staff in the school. ‘If youngsters feel that they are in a more powerful position than the teacher, the teaching assistant or the dinner lady, that they can defy authority and do so with impunity, no amount of theorising about raising attainment will make much difference. ‘There is absolutely nothing wrong in my view in saying to youngsters “Do as I ask, because I am the adult, I am older than you, I know more than you and, by the way, I am in authority over you”.’ In 2011, Education Secretary Michael . Gove announced new measures to give disruptive pupils an ‘unambiguous . lesson in who’s boss’, including loosening rules on the use of physical . force by teachers, the right to search children for items, such as . mobile phones, and increased financial penalties for parents who allow . their children to play truant. But Sir Michael’s comments suggest school . staff still do not have the confidence to exert their authority after . years of seeing their powers eroded. In 2011 Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, announced new measures to give disruptive pupils an 'unambiguous lesson in who's boss', while Schools Minister David Laws, right, yesterday announced £10m would be spent on doubling the number of specially trained teachers in challenging schools . He also warned too many headteachers lack vision for their school beyond a ‘natty slogan’, and don’t pay attention to detail. ‘It’s pointless concocting grand plans if the school playground is a mess, uniforms are slovenly, staff are too casual, children pay more attention to their mobile phones than to the teachers and the school reception has all the charm of the check-in desk at Ryanair,’ he said. ‘The best leaders get the details right because they know that these underpin the big issues of student achievement and progress.’ Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said teachers needed extra training to help them understand their greater powers of discipline. He said: ‘The Government should make the guidelines even clearer.’ Meanwhile Schools Minister David Laws yesterday announced £10million was being released to more than double the number of specially trained teachers in challenging schools.","Sir Michael Wilshaw said heads are too worried about offending staff .

"For years it was a no-go zone, locked in diplomatic disputes with the United States, which it famously decried as 'The Great Satan'. But now Iran, which sparked one of the 20th Century's tensest diplomatic stand-off by taking 52 Americans hostage, is once more a popular tourist spot. Tehran, the vibrant capital, is the final destination of a new luxury train trip from Europe to the Middle East, which also takes in Persian ruin sites like Isfahan and Persepolis. And, according to the Golden Eagle Luxury Trains company, which has just launched its Jewels of Persia service, a substantial chunk of its customers are from the U.S. The train journey, which costs around $40,000 per passenger, takes a 14-day journey from Budapest, Hungary, through eastern Europe, Turkey and into Iran. Speaking to NBC News, one customer from Kansas said her family think she is 'absolutely nuts'. She said: 'There is no reason not to come to Iran, don't let what is perceived to keep you home.'

The nation - full name the Islamic Republic of Iran - is run by a council of clerics, and has long been subject to crippling economic sanctions from the United States. In 1979 relations between the two nations hit an all-time low when a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 Americans captive for 44 days. The rescue of group of U.S. citizens was recently made into the Hollywood blockbuster Argo, which starred Ben Affleck as a CIA agent who helped smuggle the Americans out of Iran and back to the United States. As a result many may still believe Iran to be a perilous place to visit, but not so, says Tim Littler, the founder of tour operator Golden Eagle. 'We had more problems in Russia when we started 25 years ago,' Little said. 'We went into areas where people were literally starving and we arrived in an opulent train full of caviar and sturgeon and fine wines.'

In an attempt to make tourists feel safer, the Iranian government, which has announced it would spend heavily to develop its tourism industry, said it would put military marshals on the train. The tickets for the first Golden Eagle train voyage sold out in 10 days. Of the 109 passengers who traveled on the east or westbound legs of the two-week journey, 26 were American citizens. Bahman Zenhari, a marketing executive with Iranian tour operator Pasargad Tours, told NBC there had been a 350 percent increase for tour demands in Iran since last year's election, in which President Hassan Rouhani replaced the outspoken Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who consistently outraged the Jewish community by repeatedly calling the Holocaust a lie. 'When American tourists first came to Iran they would tell locals that they were Canadian, but not today,' Bahrain told the network. Among the major must-sees is the holy city of Mashdad, Iran's second-biggest city after Tehran, and the central city of Isfahan, considered one of the most beautiful places in the world for its hand-painted tiling and magnifcant public square. Breathtaking: A boy rides a bicycle through the main square of Isfahan, which considered one of the most beautiful places in the world . Faith: Worshippers pray at the Aramgah-e Shah-e Cheragh shrine in Shiraz . However, while Iran may have become safer and more popular, the cultural differences are still very exacting. As per Muslim faith, all women are expected to wear headscarves, which can easily deter - and sometimes frighten - tourists. Houston man Joseph Cheavens and his wife were not so worried, though, taking the Golden Eagle Danube Express train for a vacation together, much to the shock of their friends at home. 'I just had an email before I left from a business colleague saying, ''You are going to a dangerous part of the world'',' he told NBC. 'Well, it's not dangerous.'

"The number of children being educated in primary schools of at least 800 pupils has risen almost fourfold in three years. About 52,000 youngsters are currently taught in these ‘titan’ primaries, compared with 13,700 in 2010. And 5,350 are squeezed into primary schools with more than 1,000 pupils, according to data released by the Department for Education under the Freedom of Information Act. It is claimed primary schools had to expand after a lack of forward planning under Labour (file photo) Not a single primary school across England housed so many children in 2010. The rise in super-size primaries comes amid a school place crisis which this September left councils struggling to cope with the huge influx of pupils. Eager: But more and more pupils are being crammed into the same schools (posed by model) The Daily Mail revealed how youngsters were packed ‘like sardines’ into oversized classes, with former police stations and even factory car parks used for lessons. A baby boom that began more than a decade ago, rising immigration and hard-up parents opting out of the private sector have been blamed for the problem. DfE data shows ‘titan’ primary schools have become a common way to cope with spiralling pupil numbers following a lack of forward planning under Labour. This is despite the fact that parents and education experts fear children as young as four become ‘lost’ in these extra large schools. Between January 2012 and January this year, numbers of pupils in 800-plus primaries rose by 48 per cent. The number in schools of more than 1,000 children more than doubled, from 2,100 to 5,350 over the same period. There are 58 primary schools currently educating 800 or more pupils, including five that have more than 1,000. There were just 16 with 800 or more in 2010. Other data released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed Labour repeatedly ignored warnings about the looming primary school crisis. In 2007, councils were told to slash surplus places and close schools despite the Labour government’s pupil estimates indicating a rapidly increasing primary population. A Daily Mail survey found that one in three councils launched extra reception classes this September – part of a raft of emergency measures. Barking and Dagenham council, East London, even admitted it was considering three-day weeks. Professor Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University, said ‘titan’ schools may make economic sense but do not pay ‘sufficient regard to the development of our children’, adding that they can be ‘overwhelming’. The Local Government Association found some parts of England could see nearly twice as many pupils as places in two years.","Data released by education chiefs under Freedom of Information Act .

"Angry runners have lashed out at organisers of Edinburgh's Marathon for not allowing them to see a complete list of winners and losers - because they are being 'respectful'. The race organisers for one of the major events in Britain's sporting calendar have only announced times and placings for the top three in an event that featured almost 10,000 runners. But other entrants have been told by GSi Events, a company that specialises in fundraising projects, that their achievement will be 'exclusively available' to them and published only if they give permission. Unlisted: Runners take part during the Edinburgh Marathon in 2014 - but runners have threatened to boycott future events after not being allowed to see their running times . Top three: The official Edinburgh marathon Festival webpage shows only the first three runners in an event . Scotland's official athletics body has begun talks with GSi. This comes as furious runners threaten to boycott future events amid questions that hard-earned times and placings would not count if they were not officially published. Simon Hart, a 50-year-old from Brentwood in Essex, ran the race in 2 hours 38 minutes and finished fourteenth. He said: 'To find out that my result would not be published is disappointing in the extreme. Unless the policy changes, I will not be participating in events run by GSi Events again, and would advise other club runners to avoid as well.' A Scottish Athletics spokesman said: 'It is a matter of concern. We're acutely aware of it and in discussions with the company, trying to get to the bottom of it.' Wining time: Marathon winner David Toniok 30, from Kenya crosses finishing line but this year organisers only announced times and placings for the top three in an event that featured almost 10,000 runners . GSi Events, have not given a comment or responded to online criticisms on the marathon's own Facebook page. But the marathon's website says: 'All your personal data and information, including your running times, are treated with great respect. Your result information is exclusively available to you. 'We will only openly publish the top three finishers of each race. You will need to log in to get your times, splits and finishing position within the race. You can then choose to share this information as you see fit.' Ian Kiltie, a veteran runner from Derby, was amazed he could not access a friend's result. He . said: 'What next - no one is allowed to watch in case they see how . people did? Stop televising the London Marathon, Great North Run, etc.?' Such a policy is virtually unheard of - and runners yesterday were claiming it breaches International Amateur Athletics Association rules and could endanger Edinburgh's status as a recognised event. The IAAF rules state clearly: 'Official results for all participants should be made available on the race's website within the shortest possible time.' It is unclear who wanted the policy of not publishing results, but the supposed confidentiality is undermined by the event's own photographs section, where runners can enter anyone's name and see a selection of pictures of them in various amounts of distress, along with their finishing time. Edinburgh runner Hector Haines said: 'Not having results after the race devalues the whole event.'","Race organisers only announced times and placings .

"A powerful group of Islamist fighters in Syria have released a professionally made video showing the training programme their fighters are going through at a 'Black War Training Camp.' The Youtube video includes fighters abseiling down rock faces, descending on zip wires, and masked men clearing buildings in the style of Western-trained special forces. The video, initially released by Arabic speakers, suggests that the rebels are receiving training from an established military power – probably Saudi Arabia – and have built what they call a 'Black War Training Camp.' Scroll down for video . A training video released by Islamic State militants shows recruits taking part in exercises at a 'Black War Training Camp' which suggests they are being supported by established military power .

In the video one man can be seen practicing with nunchucks while others sit around and watch him . The clip also shows of the group's vehicles, featuring soldiers exiting the back of an armoured truck and crawling underneath a tank . The fighters are shown marching in drill-like exercises, dragging tyres in fitness tests and crossing scramble nets, climbing walls and using monkey bars on an assault course. The men can be seen on marksmanship exercises, launching assaults from the back of an armoured personnel carrier and in a wood in full camouflage. They show off using nunchucks – a wooden handled weapon from the Far East - and demonstrate unarmed combat skills, and crawl along the ground as tanks pass over them. The video finishes with a shot of a bearded cameraman in a baseball cap, equipped with the latest digital camera, as he follows fighters on an exercise and words on the screen promise 'Part 2 coming soon.' Soldiers are seen rehearsing how to destroy a tank as it drives over the top of them (tank pictured right) Recruits are seen taking part in Western-style training exercises, such as abseiling down cliffs . The video ends with the ominous message that 'part 2' will be coming soon . The film is designed as a recruitment aid to show that the forces of a grouping called the Islamic Front are better trained and equipped that their rivals in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). According to Charles Lister of the analysts IHS Janes, the Islamic Front could have as many as 45,000 fighters under its command. It was formed last November as an umbrella group for a number of Islamist factions fighting in various cities in Syria including the Al-Tawhid Brigade, based in Aleppo, and a fundamentalist group called Ahrar ash-Sham. The video goes to great pains to show off the professional recording equipment being used by IS, including Hollywood-style camera rigs . The final shot of the video shows troops moving through the woods, before the shot comes to rest on a bearded man with a high-tech camera filming them . IS have made use of high quality footage before, such as the execution videos of James Foley and Steven Sotloff which drew international media attention . Initially the group pledged to work with the mainstream group the Free Syrian Army, but they raided warehouses run by the FSA in Atmeh weeks after they were formed, seizing equipment supplied by the West and leading to a suspension of supplies to the FSA by Britain and others. They have since reconciled with the FSA and are considered by Middle Eastern powers to be an essential bulwark against the rise of the more fanatical group, ISIS. However, demonstrating the complex nature of the opposition groups, they seek to establish a state ruled by shariah law and at least one senior member has professed to links with al-Qaeda.","Video shows extremists training at so-called 'Black War Training Camp'

"Norman Lamb, care minister, said the case of 'Lisa', who was locked in a room and fed through a hatch in a secure hospital for 9 years was 'intolerable' A woman with severe mental health difficulties was kept locked in a room and was fed through a hatch for nine years. Care minister Norman Lamb, who wants to improve care for the mentally disabled, branded the case of the woman - who never went out - as 'intolerable.' She was only discovered during an official inspection of the hospital and was found to be sleeping on a bean bag. Her only interaction with staff appeared to be when they used a hatch to deliver food to her and brush her hair through a hatch in the door. She had lived like this, in a locked room at the end of an all-male ward, for nine years. The woman, known only as Lisa, was discovered by a worker from the Challenging Behaviour Foundation (CBF) who went along on the inspection and referred the issue of her care to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in 2011, the Sunday Times reported. The CBF has described the case as deeply concerning and shocking. Law firm Irwin Mitchell is also understood to be considering whether her human rights have been breached. In a report of the two day inspection, during which no one saw Lisa, the CQC said: 'The CBF expert...was concerned because she was told that Lisa lived in a locked area at the end of a male ward. 'She did not come out and no one went in.' The watchdog said Lisa had been sectioned under the mental health act and did not receive any therapy. This was the first time anyone had raised any issues about her care, which cost £12,600 a week. She has now been moved to a new facility . Irwin Mitchell said it is preparing to see whether the case is a breach of human rights. Nancy Collins, of the firm, said: 'We are deeply concerned that someone has lived in a room for nine years and communicated through a small hatch. It defies belief.' Lawyers are also looking into the case of Stephanie Bincliffe, who died after seven years in a secure hospital. During this time she put on 10 stone in weight and died from obesity and sleep apnea. Lisa was left locked in a hospital room for nine years, isolated and with her hair being brushed through a hatch (posed by model) Norman Lamb, care and support minister, is to introduce a new green paper calling for the mentally disabled to be given more rights.  The care minister has also called for better care for the mentally ill, many of whom are living in institutions but are capable of independently. He said: 'Cases such as this are unacceptable and intolerable. 'There is a deeply embedded and rotten culture where people with learning disabilities are treated as second class citizens. Millions are being spent on completely inappropriate care of people in institutions, many of whom are capable of living independently. “I expect the Care Quality Commission to be uncompromising in their response to any situations of this sort. The Government has legislated for strengthened enforcement powers - including prosecution - where providers fail to meet new fundamental standards which come into force next April. Ultimately, services can be closed down where standards of care are unacceptable.' He has previously spoken about plans to allow families to seek a second opinion if a relative is left in a institution that they believe is unsuitable. There are about 16,000 mental health beds in the NHS and the number of patients with learning disabilities who have been admitted to hospitals has increased since June.","Woman, known as Lisa, was left in room in secure hospital for nine years .

It was revealed that the company promised to remove the sexist and misogynistic marketing from all of the vans within the next six months, and also issued an apology to the mother.

"A six-year-old transgender child is fighting alongside her parents for the right to be recognized as a girl at school. Coy Mathis, who was born male but has identified as female since the age of four, was barred from using the girls' restroom at Eagleside Elementary School in Fountain, Colorado in December. On a special edition of the Katie show, her parents Jeremy and Kathryn Mathis revealed that they are now pursuing legal action over the the school district's decision to force Coy to only use the boys' bathroom, gender-neutral faculty bathrooms or the nurse's bathroom. Scroll down for video . Growing pains: Coy Mathis, pictured with her mother Kathryn, was born male but identifies as female - her school recently banned her from using the girl's bathroom but now her parents are fighting the decision . Prior to the complaint, the . first-grader, who dresses as a girl and is recognized as female on her . passport and state-issued ID, had experienced no issue using the girls' bathrooms. 'She would use the girl's restrooms, . she would be called a girl, she would go in the girl's lines,' Mrs . Mathis told host Katie Couric. But a year after making the transition at school, the . Fountain-Fort Carson School District informed Coy's parents that she . would be barred from using the girl's restrooms after the winter break. Explaining the chain of events, Mr Mathis said: 'We got a call one evening, it was the principal and . he said he wanted to set up a meeting with us to discuss options for . Coy's future use of the restroom. Trapped inside the wrong body: Coy Mathis made the transition from boy to girl aged four . Uncomfortable: Coy's parents said before she made the transition from boy to girl she refused to go outside and play with her friends because she didn't want to wear boys' clothing . 'It came out the Coy was no longer . going to be able to use the girl's restroom and they were going to . require her to be using the boy's room or the staff bathroom or the . bathroom for the sick children. 'We didn't know why... we had no idea where this was coming from.' After receiving the news, the couple, who have five children under eight, took all of their children out of Eagleside Elementary School and filed a complaint with the state's civil rights division. 'By forcing Coy to use a different . bathroom than all the other girls, the school is targeting her for . stigma, bullying and harassment' Michael Silverman of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, who is representing the Mathis family said: 'By forcing Coy to use a different . bathroom than all the other girls, Coy’s school is targeting her for . stigma, bullying and harassment. 'Coy's school has the opportunity to turn this around and teach Coy's . classmates a valuable lesson about friendship, respect and basic . fairness.' But W Kelly Dude, the lawyer for Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, told CNN that the school 'took into account not only Coy but . other students in the building, their parents, and the future impact a . boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew . older... Fighting for her rights: Coy, left, plays with her sister Auri, two, at home in Fountain, Colorado . Early signs: Kathryn and Jeremy Mathis started to realize that their son was drawn towards 'everything girl' when he was just 18-months old . 'I'm certain you can appreciate that as Coy grows older and his . male genitals develop along with the rest of his body, at least some . parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his . continued use of the girls' restroom,' he added. The Mathis' case is the first to . challenge restrictions on a transgender person’s bathroom use under . Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. 'He wanted to know when we were going to take him to the doctor so that they would give him girl parts' Mrs Mathis said that Coy was just 18-months-old when she started being drawn towards 'everything girl'. Some of her favorite items included a fairy flower dress with a matching tutu and a Dora the Explorer bathing suit. 'It was starting to be obvious to us that Coy was really uncomfortable being a boy,' Mrs Mathis recalled. 'He wanted to know when we were going . to take him to the doctor so that they would give him girl parts so . that his body would be a girl.' It reached breaking-point when Coy refused to leave the house because she didn't want to change into boys' clothes. Happy family; The Mathis' have five children under the age of eight . Life of a little girl: Coy's bedroom is filled with dolls, stuffed toys and lots of pink . A psychologist confirmed that Coy was . transgender and when she was four-years old her parents let her 'be who . she was' and she made the transition from boy to girl. Today she looks like any other girl her . age, dressed in cute dresses with her blonde hair styled in a shoulder-length cut. She describes . her favorite color as pink and her bedroom is littered with dolls and stuffed toys. Mrs . Mathis said the change in Coy after she transitioned 'was just . amazing... The anxiety went away, the depression went away... all of a . sudden she wanted to go play at parks.' Coy will be home-schooled until the issue is resolved. Mrs Mathis told the Denver Post: 'It's important for us to talk about this, because a lot of people have been so afraid to be their true selves for so long. 'We want to help create a society where it's OK to be who you are.'","First-grader Coy Mathis, from Fountain, Colorado, made the transition from boy to girl when she was four years old ."
"The President of Afghanistan has personally pardoned a rape victim later jailed for 'adultery by force' - sparking fears she may now marry her attacker to restore her family's honour. President Hamid Karzai took the highly unusual step of freeing the 21-year-old woman, known as Gulnaz, from Kabul's Badam Bagh jail last night, with no pre-conditions. She was brutally raped by her husband's cousin in 2008 - who himself was jailed for seven years for the crime - in an assault that left her pregnant. Rape victim: Gulnaz, who was pardoned by the Afghan president earlier this month, with her daughter in a Kabul jail. She was today released . She was initially sentenced to two years in jail, but which was incredibly increased to 12 on appeal. A first release offer, which she eventually agreed to, staggeringly stipulated she must marry her attacker. But her lawyer, Kimberley Motley, today said her new found freedom did not actually depend on her going through with the ceremony. It is now not known whether she intents to proceed with the ritual, which may also see her rapist freed, to restore the honour of her family. Her lawyer confirmed to the BBC today, however, that she did have a 'safe place' to go, which suggests she may not. Gulnaz's case attracted international attention after she took part in a documentary film commissioned by the European Union. Its release was later halted. Hidden: It is not known whether Gulnaz, who was found guilty of adultery, will now actually marry her attacker to restore her family's honour . Motley said she hoped her client would be released shortly, and that there was a place for her in a women's shelter. The palace statement said Justice Minister Habibullah Ghalib asked a panel of top legal officials to order her release. The film in which Gulnaz featured, a documentary on women in prison, was blocked from release by the EU mission in Afghanistan. They feared it might compromise the safety of the women involved because it showed their identity. The film-makers have been pushing for the film to be released, and say Gulnaz wanted her story to be told. Film . director Clementine Malpas said: 'I made a promise to these women that I . would get their stories out. I am glad that I've been able to honour . that promise to Gulnaz. 'I . still hope that our film can be released, so people can hear the . stories of the other women, and perhaps increase their chance of getting . justice as well.' EU . spokeswoman Lynne O'Donnell welcomed news Gulnaz would be freed but . declined to comment on whether the film would be . released. Gulnaz's . case had been condemned widely by human rights groups. An online . petition started by Motley has been signed by more than 6,000 people. Motley said she is still trying to ascertain whether the attacker will also be released if they agree to marry. 'After assessing Gulnaz's case, (they) decided that her remaining sentence in jail should be pardoned under the current rules and regulations of the country and she should be released,' the palace statement said. Gulnaz was initially sentenced to two years in jail, which was later increased to 12 years on appeal. She was given the choice of marriage or serving a jail sentence. Her sentence was then cut to three years after a third appeal, and the requirement for her to marry was dropped. Gulnaz became pregnant as a result of the attack and gave birth to a daughter in the Badam Bagh women's prison in Kabul almost a year ago. Earlier this week, she spoke of her ordeal and the day that started her long nightmare. She said her assailant arrived at the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital. She told CNN: 'He had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work. He closed doors and windows. I started screaming, but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth.' And the network also tracked down Gulnaz's rapist, who denied attacking her, but said she would be a likely target if she got out of jail. He insisted that it would be her family, not his, that may kill her because of the dishonour. Motley also welcomed what she said was a decision to review the cases of other women in the same jail. She said: 'The judiciary has effectively supported the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act by allowing for her to be released, for allowing for her to be pardoned. 'Precedent definitely has been set. As I understand it, the judiciary today was also reviewing the files of other women in Badam Bagh.' The presidential palace declined to comment on whether other cases were under review.","Gulnaz's lawyer says not legally bound to marriage .

Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young told reporters that 'credible information' led authorities to the 27-acre island that separates the city from the Piscataqua River. Though marine patrol officials have sonar and underwater imaging systems, the river's currents and eddies have slowed their . efforts. 'The search in that area may last several more days,' Young said. 'We have . not discussed an end date. We have discussed continuing this until we . find her.' Authorities in Maine and Massachusetts have also been asked to watch their shorelines in case  Marriott's body washes up.

Officials announced charges against him on Saturday, after family and friends spent several days searching for her. Mazzaglia was arraigned by video feed and did not speak. His next hearing is set for October 29. Authorities will not say what led to the arrest but simply it was due to evidence collected. On Saturday night, hundreds of friends and family members attended an emotional candlelit vigil for Lizzi at the Bay State Commons. Her devastated father Robert Marriott and best friend Meghan Hoyt were among those pictured at the solemn evening held in tribute to the young student.

In a phone interview with Foster's Daily Democrat, Tyning called the announcement of her niece's death 'surreal'. Marriott was a marine biology major who lived with her aunt in Chester. She was a 2011 graduate of Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She had attended a class at the university on Tuesday night and made plans to visit a friend in Dover. Police tracked down the friends, who said Lizzi never arrived that evening. Hunt: New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jane Young holds a 'missing' flyer of Lizzi on Friday . Authorities have also analyzed her cell phone records - and those of her friends - and discovered she texted a friend at 10.11pm on Tuesday, saying she was on her way to Dover. But that was the last activity on her phone and her bank accounts have not been accessed since. The suspect, Seth J. Mazzaglia is listed as living at apartment 341 in the complex of 1 Mill Street in Dover.

'He's been with me, training with me, since he was probably 10 or 12 years old,' Modee said. Indeed, just before his arrest, Mazzaglia had been giving martial arts lessons to children at the Kittery Community Center said Modee. 'I don't understand what's going on right now,' Modee said.

"Actor Paul Walker was laid to rest Saturday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park following a brief non-denominational ceremony attended by his family and close friends. The Fast & The Furious star, 40, whose remains were cremated Thursday, was interred at the iconic Hollywood cemetery, . According to the website, the ceremony took place at the Court Of Liberty, one of the cemetery's historical sites. Scroll down for video . Final farewell: Several dozen mourners clad in black arrived at Hollywood's Forest Lawn Cemetery to say goodbye . Paul Walker Sr was seen leaving his house with a woman and heading to the Forest Lawn Memorial Park for his son Paul Jr's burial . An American flag was allegedly folded in a triangle and displayed during the ceremony, and then given to the star's family. Laid to rest: Paul Walker's ashes will be buried at the famed Forest Memorial Park in Hollywood on Saturday . More than three dozen people dressed in black and grey arrived at the landmark cemetery, where Walker's framed portrait has been set on an easel. A pair of guards in white short-sleeve shirts, black berets and white cloves stood watch during the ceremony. A green tent has been set up to shield the guests from the afternoon sun - and from the eyes of curious passersby. The family reportedly were hoping to keep the event private and is said to have asked those in attendance to arrive and leave together so they can be accompanied by a security escort. Ahead of the somber ceremony, Paul Walker's father, Walker Sr., was photographed driving his white KIA SUV towards the site of the burial. A slew of celebrities are buried at the iconic Hollywood Hills cemetery, most notably Michael Jackson's tomb at Forest Lawn's Great Mausoleum. Other stars laid to rest there include Liberace, Lucille Ball, John Ritter and Brittany Murphy. According to RadarOnline, . the Fast & The Furious star was transferred from the mortuary at . Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in . Glendale, California on Thursday. Famed spot: A slew of celebrities are buried at the iconic Hollywood Hills cemetery, including Liberace, Lucille Ball, John Ritter and Brittany Murphy . A source told the website the family 'intends on dividing Paul's ashes between an urn and keepsakes.' Walker was killed last month when the Porsche he was traveling in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita. On Wednesday, Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., brother, Cody Walker, 25, and other family members finalised plans for the actor's funeral service. They also walked around the grounds of the cemetery, choosing a grave site plot. His family will mourn the star in a very private service, though TMZ reported certain cast and crew from the 'Fast & Furious' movies will be invited because he considered them kin. The . Walkers are keen, however, to avoid throngs of media and fans, to . protect the actor's daughter Meadow, 15, who is 'broken up' over her . dad's death. Funeral plans: Paul Walker Sr., right, and Cody Walker, center, were at Forest Lawn Cemetery on Wednesday arranging last details for Paul Walker's Funeral . Earlier . this week, the family claimed plastic road markers may have been . responsible for the crash that killed the star after stunt experts . claimed the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by Walker's friend hit the . markers, called Bott's Dots, and careered out of control. According to TMZ, . sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the . experts claimed the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, . resulting in the driver losing control. Happier times: Paul Walker pictured enjoying a day off filming for Brick Mansions in Montreal with his daughter, Meadow . Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb. The . experts told the family that the car could have lost traction after . hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and . skidded off the road. The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash. The Porsche was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Rodas. It . has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about . the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light . carbon-fiber frame and 5.7 liter race-derived V10 engine. It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models. Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity . when they launched the model in 2004. According to TMZ, a memo . circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot . drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.' 'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.) 'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar. His final moments: The heartthrob is pictured in the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT just moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree and a pole, killing him and driver Roger Rodas in a fiery explosion . Police have revealed that a second man . has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche . that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed. Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges. Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site. The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offense. Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram. The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed. The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police. The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft. A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof. Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intentions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many. The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.","Ceremony involved just the actor's family and close friends .

"A Mercedes that has been abandoned in a multi-storey car park for three years has racked up thousands of pounds in parking charges. The owner of the car could be asked to foot a bill of £14,235 after leaving the vehicle at Broadway Plaza, Birmingham, where parking costs £13-a-day. But all attempts to contact the driver, understood someone from Coventry, have failed and police have warned that the car will be towed  if the owner is not found. Abandoned: The Mercedes S-Class has been left in a multi-storey car park near Birmingham city centre . Questions: The doors were discovered to be unlocked, and the vehicle manual was found inside the car . Missing: The owner of the car, left at Broadway Plaza car park, has yet to be traced by police officers . Car park staff discovered that the black Mercedes S-Class, which has a personalised licence plate, is unlocked but damage to the black axle means it cannot be driven away. Police said they are still looking for the person who owns the car but warned that the council will be able to remove the vehicle if no one comes forward. If local authorities do remove the vehicle from the car park, which has 1,400 spaces, the owner will face further charges. There are no records of the Mercedes ever being stolen, or involved in any illegal activity. The saloon car has gathered a lot of dust and staff at the parking lot have placed a bright orange barrier in front of the bay. A spokesman from APCOA, the company that owns the car park said: 'The car in question has been in situ for a couple of years. Cordoned off: Car park staff have been forced to place a bright orange barrier in front of the parking bay . Filthy: The black saloon, which has a personalised licence plate, is now covered in a thick layer of dust . Outstanding charges: It costs £13-a-day to park in one of the 1,400 bays in the car park, owned by APCOA . 'The reason why the vehicle is effectively cordoned-off is because one of the back wheel axles is loose, and the car is propped up on one side for reasons of safety. 'West Midlands Police were made aware of the vehicle in the event that it may have been stolen. However, police records confirmed otherwise. 'The police recommended APCOA write to Birmingham City Council to request the removal of the abandoned vehicle.' He said that the company had requested the removal of the vehicle approximately four months ago but nothing has been done. Clean record: There are no reports of the Mercedes ever being stolen, or involved in any illegal activity . Long stay: The owner will face further charges if the car is removed from the car park by local authorities . He added: 'We will follow-up the abandoned vehicle request in the coming days.' A spokeswoman for the West Midlands Police said that officers will endeavour to find the owner of the abandoned vehicle. But if that is not possible, the local authority will put a notice on the car warning that it will be towed away seven days later. A spokesman for the Birmingham City Council stated that the car park was not owned by them, and that the car owner could face a bill for having the car removed.","Mercedes S-Class was left in  Broadway Plaza car park in Birmingham .

"A race row has erupted in one of Britain's wealthiest villages after offensive graffiti was plastered on the site of a proposed Sikh school. If the Khalsa Secondary Academy is built it would see more than 1,000 people flock into Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, from as far afield as West London. Tension in the village has grown over the past fortnight with angry locals venting their anger online and at parish council meetings. Now one racist hooligan has daubed 'NO P*** SCHOOL' and 'DON'T SELL TO P*** SCHOOL' on a sign at the proposed site. Race row: Someone has daubed this sign on the site of a proposed school with racist language in a village that opposes it . Up for sale: Pioneer House (pictured) is the site in Stoke Poges where developers are hoping to build a 850 place Sikh faith school . Residents in Stoke Poges have condemned the thugs responsible for the graffiti, claiming their objections to the school have nothing to do with race. But they feel the Slough Sikh Education Trust (SSET), which is behind the proposed faith school, could be fuelling rumours it is a race issue by circulating images of the graffiti. Saera Carter, vice chairman of the Stoke Poges Parish Council, said: 'It was discovered at 8:30am in the morning and seven villagers scrubbed it off within the hour. 'As a village we were offended by it. We don't want to offend our Asian neighbours or the SSET as we are a peaceful village. 'Sikhism is a peaceful religion but this is immature and inflammatory behaviour and it wouldn't surprise me if the SSET is turning this into a race issue.' Upset: Campaigners Avtar Singh Brar and Saera Carter from Stoke Poges, who are fighting the plans . Stoke Poges is known for the exclusive Stoke Park estate which featured in the James Bond classic Goldfinger. Recent figures ranked Stoke Poges as having the eighth highest concentration of £1 million properties sold in Britain. It is understood Mr Kandola has also sent the image to Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who represents Stoke Poges as part of the Beaconsfield Ward. In touch: Local MP Dominic Grieve is said to have been sent the image of the graffiti . Locals have said their opposition to the school is based on the proposed site - the current UK headquarters for Pioneer - being on greenbelt land. They say Stoke Poges doesn't have the infrastructure to deal with 1,000 people entering the village each day and also fear children will lose their right to free bus travel if the multi-million pound taxpayer-funded school opens on the site. When 222 parents at the village's primary school were asked if they would send their child to the Khalsa Academy, 93.25 per cent said no.

US President Barack Obama waves from his car as he leaves the Marriott Hotel in Brisbane, at the same time the young man was detained just metres away . Various items were photographed, which appeared to include paper and cardboard. Police were also seen holding up a plastic bag which contained foreign currency. There are reports that a second man was also reportedly detained at the scene and his belongings were searched. It's claimed they were both allowed to leave at around 11am. Mr Obama is staying at the hotel during the G20 Summit and had left on Sunday morning for a trilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

"Bring him back: Parents are demanding headteacher James Gallogly stays at the school . A dedicated head accused of manhandling a disruptive pupil has been forced to resign, despite a parents’ protest and the staunch support of the mother and father of the ‘victim’. James Gallogly, 45, was suspended from his £60,000 post at a primary school after it was alleged he pinned the autistic boy against a wall. However, the parents of Ryan Johns have given Mr Gallogly their full support and admitted their eight-year-old son is difficult to control. Mr Gallogly was accused by a fellow teacher of using unnecessary force to control the pupil. But he was backed with a petition signed by 100 parents, who pleaded with governors to reinstate him for the good of the school and pupils. When the governors refused, around 20 children were removed from the 160-pupil school by their angry parents. Now, after a seven-month investigation into Mr Gallogly’s ‘discipline methods’, he has resigned. Last night Ryan’s parents, Adele Johns and David Deakin, condemned education chiefs for carrying out a ‘vindictive’ witch-hunt against a well-respected head. Keeping it in the family: As part of their protest at Mr Gallogly's departure, Adele Johns and David Deakin are refusing to send Ryan, centre, and his sisters Charlie, left and Afton to the school . ‘This situation is a disgrace and the treatment of Mr Gallogly is appalling,’ said Miss Johns, 28. Mr . Deakin, 45, a carer, said: ‘We know Ryan is difficult. We were called . in to school to be told Ryan was involved in the allegations against Mr . Gallogly, but the communication we’ve had since has been terrible. ‘We don’t even know when this alleged incident is supposed to have taken place.’ Since . Mr Gallogly’s suspension last December, five acting head teachers have . been put in charge of the school at different times. Support: Autistic Ryan, with his mother Adele, refused to make a complaint and with his family have called for the popular teacher to be given his job back . Miss . Johns said her son’s education had suffered and his behaviour had . deteriorated. Since the incident, he has been excluded for spitting and . biting a teacher and throwing a chair at a member of staff. The . couple wrote a letter in support of Mr Gallogly and demanded his . reinstatement at St Benedict’s Catholic Primary School in Wilmslow, . Cheshire. They helped organise the petition and have withdrawn their . other children, Emily, ten, and Afton, seven, from the school in . protest. ‘The treatment of . Mr Gallogly has been diabolical,’ said Cath Massey, another parent. ‘The . governors of St Benedict’s need to be brought to task over this sorry . episode.’ Uproar: Parents at St Benedict's Catholic Primary School in Wilmslow, Cheshire want the popular headmaster back . Parent Jack . Fletcher added: ‘Mr Gallogly is a well-respected head teacher who has . worked hard to bring the school up to the standard it is today. He spent . numerous extra hours looking after the poorer and socially deprived . children and always had time to speak to parents.’ After . 12 years at the school, Mr Gallogly will officially finish at the end . of August. Three other teachers are also set to leave the school. Mr . Gallogly, who serves on the  finance board of the Diocese of . Shrewsbury, declined to comment at his home in Hazel Grove, Stockport. But Cheshire East Council said he had been suspended after ‘other issues around his discipline methods’ came to light. A . spokesman said: ‘Issues have been raised and they have been . investigated properly, according to agreed procedures, with the full . involvement of the school governors, who are the head teacher’s . employers, and the Diocese of Shrewsbury. ‘Pupil . turnover is slightly higher than normal, but it cannot be assumed that . children leaving is as a result of the head teacher.’","Governors acted on accusation from member of staff .

"Oxford has lost out to Cambridge for the fourth year running in a new league table of universities. The prestigious institutions took the top two places in the latest annual Complete University Guide. In third place, the same as last year, was the London School of Economics and Political Science, followed by St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, which moved up two places to fourth, and Durham, which holds on to fifth place. The table uses available data to rank universities on nine areas - student satisfaction, research, entry standards, student to staff ratios, spending in academic services, spending facilities, the numbers of good honours degrees achieved, graduate prospects and completion rates. Top marks: The University of Cambridge has once again beaten Oxford to be crowned the country's finest higher education institution . The authors said that at many universities, student to staff ratios had improved this year due to institutions taking on more staff and falling student numbers, whilst more money is also being spent on student facilities and there has been a rise in entry standards. David Jobbins, a spokesman for the Guide, said there had been a 6.4 per cent year-on-year fall in undergraduate numbers in 2012/13 according to their analysis. 'It is that fall in some institutions and programme areas, coupled with the opportunity taken by some institutions, of which the University for the Creative Arts and the Arts University Bournemouth are good examples, to reclassify technical staff as academic staff, thus improving the student: staff ratio,' he said. Cambridge takes the second spot for the fourth year in a row . Rounding out this year's top 10 were Imperial College London, Warwick, Bath, University College London and Exeter. The biggest climbers in this year's table were the University for the Creative Arts which has moved up 24 places to 62nd, Abertay in Dundee which has risen 20 places to joint 91st, the Arts University, Bournemouth, up 18 to 57th, Derby, up 16 to joint 87th and Manchester Metropolitan, up 15 places to joint 73rd. Ten universities fell at least 10 places. These were: Royal Agricultural University, down 32 places, Aberystwyth, down 17, Birmingham City, down 16, St George's, University of London, down 12, Hull, Northampton, Buckinghamshire New University and Anglia Ruskin, all down 11 places and Bedfordshire and Ulster, down 10. Durham University held on on to fifth place  in the latest annual Complete University Guide . In total, 123 universities were included in this year's guide, which is published online. Principal author Dr Bernard Kingston said: 'Many of the changes this year are attributable to changes in definitions and weighting. 'There was an official and fundamental review of the staff record data between the two years, while the old distinction between graduate and non-graduate employment has been replaced by one between professional and non-professional employment.' He added that the rankings give would-be students 'an accurate and independent guide to the UK university system'.","University guide ranks institutions based on grades, spending and more .

"Teachers who under-perform will have their salaries frozen under plans to end the system of national pay deals for classroom staff. Annual rises for teachers will be scrapped and heads given almost complete freedom to dictate salary increases in the shake-up outlined in the Autumn Statement. National pay scales which virtually guaranteed teachers annual £2,000 rises will be axed from next September. Instead heads will award increases based on annual appraisals of performance in the classroom, allowing them to reward the best teachers and limit the pay of the least effective. Collision course: Mr Osborne faces a backlash from unions, who branded the proposals 'unfair' (file image) The reforms also mean that heads will . be able to withhold the 1 per cent pay rise due for public sector . workers in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Only those on the lowest salaries in . three broad pay bands will be guaranteed the increase. The move – which will be put out to . consultation – strikes at the heart of national pay bargaining and . severely weakens the power of teaching unions. Ministers hope it will boost . standards in the classroom. Education Secretary Michael Gove said: . ‘These recommendations will make teaching a more attractive career and a . more rewarding job. They will give schools greater flexibility to respond to specific conditions and reward their best teachers.’ Chancellor George Osborne tells MPs in his Autumn Statement today that headteachers will be given the power to pay teachers more if they perform better in the job than colleagues . But union barons declared war over . the ‘disastrous’ and ‘cynical’ proposals, raising the prospect of a . fresh wave of strike action in schools. Currently, teachers move up the main . pay scale according to length of service in the classroom. The system . has meant that long-serving but under-performing teachers are paid the . same as more capable colleagues. Under proposed reforms, heads would be able to promote a teacher from a £21,000-a-year salary to £51,000 in just six months. The plans were unveiled by George Osborne following recommendations from the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB). Boost classroom standards: Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured with Lia Thomas (left) and Chloe Teggart, says the recommendations 'will make teaching a more attractive career and a more rewarding job' The Chancellor said national pay . arrangements for civil servants, prison officers and NHS staff will . continue, but told MPs there would be greater flexibility for schools. ‘The School Teachers’ Review Body . does recommend much greater freedom for individual schools to set pay in . line with performance,’ he said. National pay negotiations will remain . but agreed rises will no longer be guaranteed for the vast majority of . staff. Heads will instead have discretion over whether to pass the . increases on. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, said the independent STRB may have been 'leant on' - a claim denied by the Government . However the Chancellor appears to . have abandoned plans for regional pay bargaining for schools, which . could have meant that a teacher in the north-east was paid less than one . in the south-east. Under yesterday’s proposals, detailed . national pay scales for teachers will be ripped up and replaced with . three broad pay bands – starting at £21,804, £34,523 and £37,836 for . teachers outside London. While teachers will be protected from . pay cuts, heads will have wide discretion to dictate salaries within . each band based on classroom performance – including pupil results – and . accelerate staff through the three levels. There is already an element of performance-related pay for more senior teachers, which will be strengthened and extended to all. The changes apply only to teachers, . with pay arrangements for heads and deputies remaining largely . unchanged. Heads of state-funded academies and free schools already have . the freedom to dictate teachers’ pay. Yesterday’s proposals apply to . the majority of schools which operate under the auspices of local . authorities. Chris Keates, general secretary of . the NASUWT union, said the independent STRB may have been ‘leant on’ – a . claim denied by the Government. ‘The war on teachers waged by the . Coalition Government continues,’ she said. ‘If implemented, the STRB’s . recommendations would leave behind the wreckage of a national pay . framework which will be incapable of delivering consistent, fair and . transparent approaches to pay.’ Teacher Emma Taylor says the reforms . announced by the Chancellor yesterday were already in operation in many . academy schools in England. Miss . Taylor, 40, right, is a primary school teacher in Stroud, . Gloucestershire, and has taught children of varying ages during a . 15-year career. Miss . Taylor, who is on the upper pay scale two, said the effectiveness of . George Osborne’s reforms will depend on the ability of the head teacher . at each school. She said: . ‘This could work but only if there are good head teachers to implement . it. In some schools there certainly are those who are fair. ‘But in others it could be used to get rid of teachers who the head would like to replace. ‘It really does depend on the head teacher. I do not think that would necessarily be fair. ‘It is already commonplace in academy schools but not in those run by the local education authority.’ Miss Taylor added: ‘I have already proved that I am a very good teacher by reaching the upper pay scale. It would not be right for me to be paid less at a different school if I have already been judged to be worth that amount.’","Chancellor gives heads power to reward teachers if they perform better than their colleagues .

"An undersea earthquake off the East Cape of New Zealand, measuring 6.5, has been widely felt around the North Island. Damage was reported at Ohope, in the eastern Bay of Plenty, when the quake struck about 150 kilometres off the coast about 10.37am local time on Monday. The Pacific tsunami warning centre said based on the data, there is no tsunami threat from the earthquake but threat will continue to be monitored as aftershocks continue. GeoNet said the severe quake was about 31 kilometres underground and has received more than 1600 reports of the quake some being felt from as far away as Whangarei in the Far North to one person down in Dunedin. Geonet Siesmologist Bill Fry said the depth of the quake was below interface and since the 6.5 magnitude shock there has been quite a few aftershocks. 'There was a magnitude 4 quake that happened about 30 to 40 minutes after the 6.5 shake,' he said. Scroll down to video . The earthquake measuring 6.5 hit New Zealand's North Island and some felt it as far Dunedin . Geonet image of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake shock . 'We are still getting aftershocks but the typical sequence is that it has slowed down, the frequency has slowed down.' 'Now watching and monitoring aftershocks to see if anything further will happen,' said Mr Fry. He said the 6.5 quake was less than 2 per cent force of gravity, with very small exceleration. Mr Fry said there was no tsunami threat but that would have happened quite quickly from the time the earthquake struck, taking only about 15 minutes for it to take effect. 'The area has been prone to earthquakes in the past and the biggest dangers is assessing whether a tsunami will follow a shock.' 'In 1947 an earthquake caused a tsunami, it moved very slowly and there was a very large tsunami, so any time we have an earthquake we immediately need assess the potential for a tsunami,' he said. Twenty-two people reported it as moderate with just one person at Ohope reporting damage. 'It was just really a long rolling one and then quite a strong jolt, and it carried on rolling and that was it,' said Ohope Beach Primary School's Jenny McKenzie. However, she did not think it was bad enough to cause any damage, she told NZ Newswire. The earthquake on Monday morning in New Zealand also hit social media quickly . Liz Koia told stuff.co.nz, the shelves rocked and lights swung inside the Eastern Four Square at Te Araroa. 'It just kept rolling. The shelves were rocking, the fluorescent lights that hang down were swinging from side to side,' she said. A staff member at East Cape Manuka Company told Daily Mail Australia they did hear it in the cafe and at first it was just shock. 'Customers got up and ran under the door,' she said, 'but nothing fell off the shelves, nothing was broken we just got a bit of a fright.' 'There was a tsunami warning from the local school which evacuated, as well as businesses but we have all just come back to work and the panic is over.'

"A teacher who claimed £1.2 million after winning a racial discrimination claim has been jailed for two years for hiding her criminal record when applying for a post at a school. Samantha Burmis, of Bellman Avenue in Gravesend, was sentenced in her absence at Maidstone Crown Court today. The mother-of-four had denied obtaining a pecuniary advantage by . deception and perverting the course of justice, but was convicted of . both charges last month. Guilty: Samantha Burmis spun a tangled web of lies, including getting her daughter to pose as her to avoid finger print detection . She was not able to attend her sentencing as she had taken an overdose of pills and alcohol shortly before she was due to appear and was admitted to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford. Judge David Griffith-Jones QC branded the 44-year-old 'devious, manipulative and thoroughly dishonest', adding she was prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to serve her own selfish interests. Burmis' criminal past dated . back to January 1995, when she was jailed for a year at Harrow Crown . Court for a £90,000 mortgage fraud. At her latest trial, Burmis denied she had either served a prison sentence or had a criminal record, but police had her finger prints . from when she was originally arrested. Lies: Samantha Burmis had denied having a criminal record, despite police having finger print evidence . After her release, she studied . law at the University of Kent in Canterbury, and later trained to be a teacher at the University of Greenwich. She then applied for a teaching post at Aylesford School in Maidstone, but crucially failed to reveal her conviction for fraud. The court heard Burmis made similar . applications to Homewood School in Tenterden and Swadelands School in . Lenham, Maidstone, again failing to declare her conviction. At her latest trial, Prosector Ed Connell said: 'The . decision by her not to disclose previous convictions was deliberate . because she feared if she did disclose them she would jeopardise her . chances of being employed by the school.' She was employed by the school from May 2001 to February 2005, when she was sacked for gross misconduct. In 2007 she sued Aylesford School for £1.2million for unfair dismissal, claiming racial and sexual discrimination. Burmis won her case after a 42-day . hearing, but during the case it emerged she may have had a criminal conviction, an accusation she flatly denied. Mr Connell said: 'Having . lied on her application form to Aylesford School she was no doubt aware . if her previous convictions came to light she would have committed an . offence. 'In all likelihood she would have been dismissed from her job and prosecuted for that. 'She knew if her lie about her . background was found out before the tribunal concluded her award damages . might be significantly reduced,' he added. 'In order to maintain the lie about . her background and clear the way for future employment she and her . daughter conspired to pervert the course of justice.' Sentencing: Samantha Burmis was handed two years behind bars after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice and gaining a pecuniary advantage through deception . In the end she was awarded damages totaling £28,500, although it is not clear if she ever received the money. In an attempt to distance herself . from her past, during her tribunal she had offered to have her finger prints taken again and hatched a plan for her daughter Nina Burmis to pose as her. When a fingerprint expert went to Nina's home in 2009, Nina had answered the door with her face covered and handed over her mother's driving . licence as proof of identity. Nina had denied this at the trial, saying: 'I would not pretend to be my . mother. That is ridiculous. I would not have given my . mother's licence and covered my face.' She now admits she lied on oath. The plan . unraveled because 24-year-old's prints were already on the . police file - Nina had herself been convicted of forging a . cheque to pay for a £3,200 breast enlargement, for which she was handed a . suspended sentence and unpaid work at Hull Crown Court earlier that year. She also had previous convictions for shoplifting in 2009, and theft in 2004. Nina Burmis, of Empire Way, Wembley, was also sentenced today for her part in the scheme. She was handed18 months imprisonment suspended for two years with supervision and curfew for four months. Confident: Samantha Burmis was upbeat at the start of her trial, but failed to make an appearance at today's sentencing after taking an overdose of pills and alcohol .","Teacher found guilty of deception and perverting the course of justice .

"Children are being ‘infantalised’ by teachers who encourage them to learn history through Mr Men characters and Disney films, Michael Gove said yesterday. In a blistering attack on school teaching, the Education Secretary claimed pupils were being told to compare Hitler and his henchmen to Mr Men characters and to learn about the Middle Ages by watching Disney’s Robin Hood. Mr Gove also criticised the debasement of English lessons, saying some schools were telling pupils to read ‘transient vampire books’ like the Twilight series instead of ‘transcendent Victorian novels’ such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. Students were told to imagine Adolf Hitler as a Mr Men character, Michael Gove said in a damning critique on the way history has been taught in some schools . He said teaching was being ‘crushed . under the weight of play-based pedagogy which infantilises children, . teachers and our culture’. In his speech to an education . conference in Brighton Mr Gove referred to a website which suggests . teenagers should translate the story of Nazi Germany into a tale in the . style of Roger Hargreaves’ Mr Men books. The website, www.activehistory.co.uk, . written by a teacher working in France, tells students they should . ‘discuss which characters are the best match’. ‘The activity is a great way of . rounding off or revising the rise of Hitler,’ it says, adding the . exercise could also help primary pupils learn about the period. Mr Gove said history teaching is being 'crushed under the weight of play-based pedagogy' The Twilight vampire series by Stephanie Meyer was not a patch on George Eliot, Mr Gove said as he warned  young people should dream of taking part in the Olympics, not finding fame in the Big Brother house . Mr Gove . said: ‘I may be unfamiliar with all of Roger Hargreaves’ work but I am . not sure he ever got round to producing Mr Anti-Semitic Dictator, Mr . Junker General or Mr Dutch Communist Scapegoat.’ Author Jacqueline Wilson was praised for speaking out against the 'scandal' of British children unable to use good grammar in fan letters . He also referred to a 2012 issue of . Primary History, produced by the Historical Association, which suggests . students learn about the Middle Ages through Disney’s portrayal of King . John as a cowardly lion. ‘If that proves too taxing then they are asked to organise a fashion parade or make plasticine models,’ he said. Mr Gove’s comments come amid criticism of his proposed changes to the national curriculum from teachers and education academics. His plans for history teaching, in . particular, have come under fire from critics who claim the new focus on . key dates and characters is too narrow and will impede children’s . ability to think for themselves. English lessons were also being dumbed . down, Mr Gove warned, with the ‘overwhelming majority’ of GCSE pupils . studying 20th century texts, rather than books from an earlier period. Mr Gove added: ‘Under this Government...the Department for Education is . setting higher expectations for every child. Because that is what . parents want.’ Russell Tarr, who is responsible for . the activehistory website, said: ‘The purpose of the activity is a . further challenge to get them (students) to think about it in a . different way and to take a complex story which they have written an . in-depth essay about and turn it into something that can be used for . other students.’ Mr Tarr studied modern history at Lady . Margaret Hall, Oxford, and worked at Wolverhampton Grammar School . before becoming head of history at the International School of Toulouse.","Education Secretary tears into the way teenagers are treated like infants .

"A few thousand of Britain’s top earners contribute more to the taxman than the bottom nine million, official figures revealed yesterday. The top 3,000 income tax payers will between them provide around 4.2 per cent of the total government revenue from income tax in this financial year. That compares to less than four per cent from the lowest-earning nine million workers. Tax returns: The very highest earners - just under 3,000 people with a declared income above £2.7million - will contribute 4.2 per cent of the total Government revenue from income tax in this financial year . Each of the top 3,000 earners declares an income above £2.7million, the figures from HM Revenue and Customs show. Some 30million people pay income tax – meaning the contribution from the top 3,000 is the same as the total from around a third of the lowest earners. The figures were released by HMRC to the journalist Fraser Nelson under the Freedom of Information Act as part of his investigation into wealth inequality in Britain. They form part of a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary entitled How The Rich Get Richer, which is broadcast tonight. The Tories said the revelations undermined Labour leader Ed Miliband’s claim that Britain was now a ‘zero-zero’ country where the richest pay zero tax and the poorest work on zero hours contracts. They pointed out the Government had increased the tax threshold for low earners so many more pay no tax at all. A Treasury source said: ‘The rich pay more under this Government than under Labour. The people who pay zero tax are the millions of low earners who have been taken out of paying income tax altogether due to Chancellor George Osborne increasing the tax-free personal allowance. ‘This is yet more evidence that because he has no economic plan, Ed Miliband is not up to the job.’ Journalist Fraser Nelson (left), who obtained the figures, said they 'blow apart' the claim by Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) that Britain is a 'zero zero' country of 'zero-hours contracts, and zero tax for those at the top' A Labour source said Mr Miliband was talking about the few people and corporations who avoid paying tax. The source said: ‘These figures relate to income tax only, not other taxes like VAT which are less progressive. 'They also reflect how a few at the very top earn many times more than ordinary working people. ‘The fact is the Tories have given the top 1 per cent of earners a £3billion-a-year income tax cut, while ordinary families are paying more in higher VAT.’ Mr Nelson, editor of The Spectator, said that last year the richest were ‘shouldering a greater share of the burden than at any time in history’. He added: ‘This was achieved after the top rate of income tax was reduced from 50p to 45p in April 2013. It is now harder than ever for Ed Miliband to justify bringing back the 50p tax.’ The figures show the top 3,000 taxpayers earn around 1.4 per cent of all the income received in the UK but pay three times that proportion of the income tax receipts. Last year some £154billion was collected in income tax. The statistics show the top 30,000 earners collect around five per cent of all pay but account for more than 11 per cent of the income tax take. Research commissioned for the Centre for Social Justice as part of the programme compared the 1million people living in the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in Britain. It found the million poorest were 12 times more likely to be victims of violent crime, and three times more likely to live in fatherless households. Children attending state schools in the most deprived areas were three times more likely to fail to get five GCSE grades at A to C level compared with the richest.","Just under 3,000 people with a declared income above £2.7million .

"A primary school has been criticised after they ditched the traditional Christmas nativity, opting to stage a 'cops and robbers' themed play. Parents have been left fuming by the school's decision to choose the modernised play, in which their children sing Away in a Manger with a completely different set of lyrics. The play, which will be performed by 11-year-olds at Canvey Junior School in Essex, gets rid of traditional characters Mary and Joseph, instead focusing on the tale of two violent robbers. Criticism: Parents have been left furious by the decision of Canvey Junior School, Essex, pictured, to dump the traditional nativity in favour of a cops and robbers themed play. One parent has withdrawn their child from the production . But parents have described the school's decision a 'tasteless' in light of a number of armed robberies in Canvey Island, where the school is based. Parents have also complained that the themes of theft and violence are inappropriate for young children - with one parent reported to have withdrawn their child from the production and complained about the play's content. One parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'I can't see that this gangster story is going to be better than something from the Bible. 'What are they going to have our children saying? 'Sorry Mary and Joseph, but there is no room in the cells?' They added: 'I think it is a little tasteless to stage the play with all the recent reports of armed robberies on the island. 'I don't understand why the politically correct brigade has had to get rid of the traditional story anyway?' The school has defended the decision not to stage the traditional nativity play - a staple in  schools across the UK. Headteacher Janet Vaughan said the play, which has been previously published and was downloaded from the internet, is 'fun' and 'lighthearted'. Tradition: Canvey Junior School, Essex, has ditched the traditional nativity play that features Joseph, Mary, the Three Wise Men and range of other recognisable characters in favour of a tale about robbers and the police (stock image) She said: 'The outcome is the robbers are caught . and banged to rights and the true meaning of Christmas comes across very . strongly with a nativity at the end.' 'It is nice to have a fun element to any sort of Christmas production and we always have a religious basis to it as well. 'It is very, very funny and nothing more than a light-hearted version of events.' Referring to the updated lyrics to Away in a Manger, she said: 'It's nonsense to say the words are anything other than tongue-in-cheek and the children understand that.' After receiving a parent's complaint, Mrs Vaughan wrote to all parents saying if they had similar concerns their child could be withdrawn from the play. However, she said despite one child not taking part, other parents have been supportive of the production. She added: 'Our productions are always absolutely excellent, the kids get such a lot out of it.'","Essex school criticised by parents for dumping traditional nativity play .

"A Texas hunting club that auctioned off a permit to kill an endangered black rhinoceros says it will cancel the winner's hunt if a federal agency denies his request to bring the dead rhino back to the U.S. as a trophy. Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 at a January auction held by the Dallas Safari Club for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in Namibia -- a species listed as critically endangered, according to CBS News. Knowlton applied for a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last Spring that would allow him to import the body of the endangered animal from Namibia after his hunt. The agency has yet to give him an answer. Scroll down for video . Active: Corey Knowlton is an active hunter who takes hunting trips around the globe and posts updates and photos from his hunts on his Facebook page . Opportunity: A Club official said that Knowlton bid on the opportunity for the experience, not to parade a dead animal around . Many opposed the auction. Knowlton and the Club even received death threats from activists wanting the hunt called off. Now the opposition may get their wish. The Club plans to refund Knowlton's money if the agency denies his request. The Club billed the auction as a fundraising effort to to save the endangered species but the agency is applying extra scrutiny to Knowlton's request because of the rise in poaching CBS reports, and the agency is evaluating whether the hunt will result in enhancement of the species's survival. 'Most people that have an animal mounted, it's their memory of their experience,' Ben Carter, the Club's executive director, told CBS. 'It's not always, 'Look at what I've shot.' When they look at it, they remember everything. That's what he bid the money on, that opportunity.' Knowlton told WFAA in January that he simply wants to experience a black rhino. 'I'm a hunter,' Knowlton said. 'I want to experience a black rhino. I want to be intimately involved with a black rhino.' Cancel: The Dallas Safari Club plans to cancel the hunt of the winner of a black rhinoceros hunting permit if an agency denies his request to bring the rhino's body to the U.S. as a trophy . Black Rhino: Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 at a January auction held by the Dallas Safari Club for a permit to hunt an older, male, non-breeding black rhino in Namibia . The opposition doesn't see it that way. Many are fervently protesting the hunt and, protester Susan Oakley told CBS that claims that the hunt is ultimately to save the species 'don't hold water.' The agency is holding public comment until Dec. 8 and plans to make its decision afterward. The agency is taking into account the condition of the critically endangered species and the fact that more than 1/3 of the world's black rhino population live in the Namibian herd where Knowlton is to hunt. Knowlton, an active hunter who goes on hunting trips around the globe, received the permit to kill an older, male, non-breeding rhino that has been responsible for the death of other rhinos, CBS reports. And proceeds of the auction reportedly went to the Namibia Wildlife Products trust, a fund run by the Namibian government in an effort to boost the specie's population. Protesters: Many are fervently protesting the hunt saying the 'kill it to save it' logic is cruel and not conservation at all . Wrong: Many protesters hold that the Club's claims that the hunt is an effort to preserve species 'holds no water' but the culling of old, sick, or problematic animals is a common practice in wildlife management . It is a common practice in wildlife management, conservationists say, to kill herds of old, sick, or problematic animals, according to CBS. Each year, Namibia grants up to five permits to hunt the rhinos and this, in turn, funds efforts that protect the species. But activists say the 'kill it to save it' logic is cruel and not conservation at all. Arguments surrounding the situation have even grown to involve the FBI, CBS reports. The Club received death threats like: 'For every rhino you shoot, we'll kill ten of your members' and 'The winner of this hunt will find himself in the crosshairs.' The Club has turned the threats over to the FBI . The agency must take all arguments into account, and said it will examine how the auctioned funds will be administered. But for now, Knowlton's hunt hangs in the balance as both he, and the Club, await the agency's decision.","The Dallas Safari Club says it will cancel, the winner, Corey Knowlton's hunt if a federal agency denies his request to bring the dead rhino back to the U.S. as a trophy .

"Efficient: Rob Rhinehart developed the all-in-one meal drink after becoming fed up with the amount of time and money he spent cooking . A man who tired of wasting time and energy cooking and eating claims to have come up with a novel solution - a cocktail that contains all the nutrients he needs to survive. Rob Rhinehart – a 24-year-old software engineer from Atlanta - says he became fed up with the inordinate amount of time and money he spent cooking. Determined to spend his time - and money - more effectively, he developed an 'all-in-one' drink to give him his complete fill of vitamins and minerals, according to the website vice.com. He claims the beige concoction - which bears a striking resemblance to pancake batter - 'tastes great' and he has yet to tire of it after six weeks. Called  Soylent, he believes it contains all the vital elements of a balanced diet, but with just a third of the calories. Mr Rhinehart says his inspiration for the cocktail came from seeing an elderly family friend fall ill. He told Vice.com: 'I was home for Christmas and saw an elderly family friend get admitted to the hospital after losing an unhealthy amount of weight. He was losing strength in one of his arms and found it very difficult to cook.' 'I started wondering why something as simple and important as food was still so inefficient, given how streamlined and optimised other modern things are. 'I also had an incentive to live as cheaply as possible, and I yearned for the productivity benefit of being healthy. I'd been reading a lot of books on biology and I started to think that it's probably all the same to our cells whether it gets nutrients from a powder or a carrot.' He maintains that Soylent contains everything the body needs in terms of vitamins, minerals and nutrients such as essential amino acids, carbohydrates and fat. His stance is that it's the minerals fruit and vegetables contain that are important, rather than the actual produce. He . explained: 'We need carbs, not bread. Amino acids, not milk. It's still . fine to eat these whenever you want, but not everyone can afford them . or has the desire to eat them.' Complete package: He maintains that his meal replacement, Soylent, contains everything the body needs in terms of vitamins, minerals and nutrients such as essential amino acids, carbohydrates and fat . When it comes to fat, he uses olive oil and fish oil, but it's more complex in terms of carbohydrates. He uses an oligosaccharide, which he claims takes the body longer to metabolise than fructose or table sugar, therefore giving a steady flow of energy for a longer period of time. Other 'non-essential' additions are antioxidants and probiotics. While it sounds like a food-lover's worst nightmare, Mr Rhinehart maintains not having to worry about food a welcome relief. He said: 'No groceries, dishes, deciding what to eat, no endless conversations weighing the relative merits of gluten-free, keto, paleo or vegan. 'Power and water bills are lower. I save hours a day and hundreds of dollars a month. I feel liberated from a crushing amount of repetitive drudgery. 'It's a very ""complete"" sensation, more . sweet than anything. Eating to me is a leisure activity, like going to . the movies, but I don't want to go to the movies three times a day. 'If I had any money or a girlfriend I would probably eat out more often,' he concedes. He claims the beige concoction - which bears a striking resemblance to pancake batter - 'tastes great' and he has yet to tire of it after six weeks . He estimates he was spending $220 on groceries, and another $250 eating out for lunch and the occasional dinner. Now, consuming only Soylent costs him around $50 month. He adds that because he has such control over his diet, he finds it easy to lose weight by changing the proportions of nutrients in his drink. Of his sceptics, he says he understands it, adding that many nutrition experts and academics have expressed an interest in his work. But he added: 'Bad scepticism is stuff like, ""This is stupid. You . can't live on powders and chemicals, you need healthy, fresh food!""' Going forward, he hopes his findings could help with world hunger. But Zoe Harcombe, a nutritionist and . author of several books, including 'The Obesity Epidemic: What caused . it? How can we stop it?' is sceptical about Mr Rhinehart's approach. She told MailOnline: 'Food is not . only vital, but enjoyable. It really doesn't take that long to fry egg . and bacon or warm porridge for breakfast or sizzle a steak for dinner.

'There is also no guarantee that his micro nutrients (vitamins and minerals) are in the form that the body needs. 'As for the product itself, contrary to what Rob says, we do not need carbohydrate - and certainly not 200g of the stuff. Soylent is 50 per cent carb, 13 per cent protein and 37 per cent fat - better than the 55/15/30 guidelines from our governments, but still not as good as just eating real food (meat, eggs and dairy, fish, nuts,  fruit and vegetables) and letting the macro nutrients (carbs, fat and protein) being what they will be (naturally high in protein and fat and low in carbohydrate).' She added that the measures detailed . for a daily intake are also way too low in calories. 'His product . details 200g of carb, 50g protein and 65g fat daily. That approximates . to 1,585 calories.

"Leading historians yesterday backed calls for schools to stop showing Blackadder to children learning about the First World War. They sided with Michael Gove after he said the comedy Blackadder Goes Forth and shows such as the Monocled Mutineer and Oh! What a Lovely War wrongly depicted Britain’s military efforts as a ‘misbegotten shambles’. Cambridge historian Professor Richard Evans and fellow Great War expert Professor Gary Sheffield said the Education Secretary was right to criticise shows like Blackadder – although they differed sharply on his broader point that the conflict had been a ‘just war’. Historians have backed claims that programmes such as Blackadder Goes Forth (pictured) depict British military efforts as 'misbegotten shambles' Professor Evans said: ‘I don’t think teachers should be showing Blackadder in history lessons – and I think some of them are. There is plenty of excellent material on the First World War they can use.’ Professor Sheffield added: ‘I am glad Michael Gove has put this into the public domain. ‘People do pick up their views on the First World War from shows like Blackadder and Oh! What a Lovely War. I’m a fan of both, but they should not be taken as being documentaries.’ Writing for the Daily Mail yesterday as Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War, Mr Gove said only ‘undergraduate cynics’ would say soldiers had fought in vain. He said the war was necessary to curb Germany’s ‘aggressively expansionist’ aims. He also hit out at Professor Evans’s claims that troops were wrong to believe the war was about defending freedom. But the academic, speaking on Radio Four’s World at One   yesterday, attacked Mr Gove’s interpretation of the war, saying he was ‘peddling his own political myths’. Professor Evans said: ‘He wants to argue Britain was fighting for democracy but he has obviously forgotten that Britain’s main ally was Tsarist Russia – a despotism far greater than anything in the Kaiser’s Germany. Speaking ahead of the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War Mr Gove said only 'undergraduate cynics' would say soldiers had fought in vain . 'You also have to remember that only 40 per cent of adult men had the vote in Britain. ‘The war was a very complex set of circumstances and it is wrong of Mr Gove to reduce it to patriotic tub-thumping that we should support the soldiers. 'Of course no one wants to belittle their heroism and self-sacrifice, but we have to look at the war in the round and the long term.’ Professor Sheffield was praised by Mr Gove for helping to rehabilitate the reputation of controversial Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and said he was ‘surprised’ to receive the politician’s accolade. The self-confessed Left-winger agreed with Mr Gove that the war was ‘ultimately about ideologies – that is democracy against an autocratic, aggressive state’. ‘It’s a war we should be very glad the Allies ended up winning,’ he added. Blackadder Goes Forth, which starred Rowan Atkinson in the title role as a captain in 1917 Flanders, chronicles his increasingly gutless efforts to dodge the action and is shown in some schools to help children learn about the war. Mr Gove said it wrongly portrayed the war as ‘a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite’.","Historians agreed with Education Secretary's criticisms of programmes .

"More than 2,000 bright children from poor homes are missing out on places at top universities because they get lost in a ‘secondary school maze’, according to new research. These disadvantaged students are being overtaken by less able but more well-off pupils despite their early promise. Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, which published the findings, warned Britain is wasting talent on ‘an industrial scale’. More than 2,000 bright children from poor homes are missing out on places at top universities because they get lost in a 'secondary school maze' (file picture) Researchers tracked the progress of high achieving pupils from poor backgrounds throughout the education system and compared it to that of their more advantaged counterparts. They examined a sample of more than 520,000 children born in 1991-2 and looked at the proportion attending elite universities as well as prior attainment at ages seven, 11, 16 and 18. Measures of the children’s socio-economic background such as the proportion claiming Free School Meals - an indicator of poverty - during secondary school were also analysed. Children from poorer backgrounds who were high achievers in tests age seven were more likely ‘to fall off a high attainment trajectory than children from richer backgrounds’, the study found. They performed worse than lower-achieving students from the least deprived families by Key Stage Four (age 14-16) at secondary school. Lower-achieving affluent children caught up with the poor high achievers between Key Stage Two (ages seven to 11) and Key Stage Four. This suggested that ‘substantial’ numbers of children from poorer backgrounds are being allowed to fall behind, with their chances of attending university damaged. Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn, pictured, warned Britain is wasting talent on 'an industrial scale' Of the 7,853 children from the most deprived homes who achieved ‘level five’ in English and maths aged 11 - above the standard expected of their age - only 906 went on to an elite university. Researchers calculated that if they had the same trajectory as a child from one of the least deprived families, then 3,066 of these children would have been likely to go to a top institution. This means that 2,160 poor children are falling behind and not fulfilling their potential displayed in primary school tests. The report, compiled for the commission by the Centre for Analysis of Youth Transitions, said: ‘The period between Key Stage Two and Key Stage Four appears to be a crucial time to ensure that higher-achieving pupils from poor backgrounds remain on a high achievement trajectory.’ Universities and policymakers should provide poor students with advice to ‘encourage greater numbers of applications to elite institutions, as those with the top grades stand a good chance of getting in if they do apply’. Mr Milburn said: ‘Each year, 2,000 of the brightest poor children who have done well at primary school seem to lose direction in a secondary school maze and so miss out on a top university place. ‘The early promise of top-performing poor children is being squandered. No doubt there are many reasons for why that might be the case. ‘But for secondary schools the research is a wake-up call for them to do more to realise the potential of each of these students.’ He added: ’It is vital that secondary schools focus harder on helping disadvantaged children convert high results at age 11 to excellent GCSE and A-level results in academic subjects and that all high attainers are given appropriate advice, access to opportunities and support to progress to elite universities. ‘If Britain’s sluggish rates of social mobility are to improve the poorest bright children must be helped to navigate the secondary school maze.’ Conor Ryan, director of research at the Sutton Trust, said: ‘It is vital we do more to support highly able children from low and middle income backgrounds in state schools. ‘With the demise of the gifted and talented programmes, too many schools are not doing enough to stretch and encourage students with the potential to succeed.’","Ex-Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn warns Britain is wasting talent on 'industrial scale'

"Two of fiction’s most famous detectives were inspired by a black private eye, it has been claimed. Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe - portrayed by actor Humphrey Bogart in classic films The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep - were inspired and named after Samuel Marlowe, a historian believes. Samuel Marlowe was a black detective who investigated society murders and runaway celebrities in Los Angeles in the 1930s - around the time that the two detectives were created in crime novels. Portrayal: Humphrey Bogart (right) plays Philip Marlowe in 1946 film The Big Sleep, with actress Lauren Bacall (left). It has been claimed the character was named after Samuel Marlowe, a black private eye . Historian Louise Ransil, a former studio executive, believes Jamaican Samuel Marlowe was the inspiration for the characters created by writers Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. According to reports in The Sunday Times and Los Angeles Times, the 61-year-old has made the deduction after examining a box of letters between Samuel Marlowe and the two authors. Miss Ransil, who has worked on a book and film script about Samuel Marlowe, was transcribing files and letters following his death in 1991 at the age of 100 - but these have since gone missing. The bizarre twist has left Miss Ransil desperate to find the letters, with the search focused at the moment on a warehouse in southern Los Angeles where they are thought to have been left. Classic movie: Actor Humphrey Bogart played private eye Sam Spade (left and right, with actress Mary Astor) in John Huston's 1941 film The Maltese Falcon, based on Dashiell Hammett's 1929 novel of the same name . Neither Mr Hammett nor Mr Chandler have ever revealed the origins of their characters’ names. But it has been claimed in the past that Philip Marlowe’s name came from Marlowe House at Dulwich College in south London, where Mr Chandler was educated. Samuel Marlowe, a veteran of the First World War, carried out six private investigations in the 1920s which were seen as too dirty or dangerous for white detectives. At the time Mr Hammett and Mr Chandler were writing short stories for pulp fiction magazine Black Mask - and Samuel Marlowe wrote to them to correct procedural details in these. He then became friends with Mr Chandler - who hired him as a guide and bodyguard to research areas which were seen as 'off-limits' to white middle-class authors, according to Miss Ransil. Authors: A historian believes Jamaican Samuel Marlowe was the inspiration for the characters created by writers Dashiell Hammett (left) and Raymond Chandler (right) Speaking to The Sunday Times reporter John Harlow, Miss Ransil claimed that Mr Hammett and Samuel Marlowe got on well together. She said: ‘They were friends who loved laughing together. Hammett calling his detective Sam Spade, a rude but common word for a black person at the time, was a joke between them.’ But Miss Ransil remains annoyed that the papers have been lost - after Samuel Marlowe's house was cleared out by a crew hired by a real estate agent in 2006 following his death 15 years earlier. Speaking to journalist Daniel Miller for the Los Angeles Times earlier this month, she said: 'It's a long and twisted tale that didn't turn out the way I’d hoped. I'm kicking myself in a lot of ways.'","Spade and Marlowe featured in The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep .

"Children's play is at risk from adults whio 'over-supervise' and 'over-schedule' a reports says . Children's play is under threat from adults who ‘over-supervise’ and ‘over-schedule’, a report says. It says youngsters cannot develop normally and are ‘play deprived’ because of our risk-averse, regimented lifestyles. This means many lack vital skills such as resourcefulness, independence or self-regulation. The research, discussed on EU ‘play day’ at the European Parliament yesterday, is the work of Dr David Whitebread, a senior lecturer in psychology of education at Cambridge University. He consulted researchers from across Europe and found children’s leisure time is cut down by too much school work, safety fears, and lack of understanding of the impact of free play. His report, The Importance of Play, warns ‘play provision is under threat in Europe’ and adult intervention is often ‘counter-productive’. It says the UK in particular is ‘quite risk-averse’, with children ‘heavily supervised’ and forced to play indoors or in a garden or specially designed soft play area. This compares with the more rural Scandinavian countries where children play independently in natural surroundings. Just a generation ago, British children did the same, it adds. Children have ‘increasingly limited opportunities for the free play and association with their peers which were so commonly available . . . to their parents and grandparents,’ the report says. Life in big cities adds to the problem, making children ‘much more heavily scheduled’. Living in big cities means children's lives are more 'heavily scheduled' and parents are reluctant to let them out to play . Poor children in cities can suffer from . ‘stressed parenting’ and lack of access to the outdoors, while wealthier . families may be overly cautious about dangers. The report states: ‘Children brought up in relatively affluent households may be over-scheduled and over-supervised as a consequence of perceptions of urban environments as dangerous for children, and a growing culture of risk-averse parenting.’ If lack of play becomes severe it can lead to ‘abnormalities in neurological development’. Dr Whitebread writes that  over-supervision is growing, with more and more parents worried about children playing outside due to traffic, crime, harassment and violence, abduction, and germs. There are also problems at school, with pressure to learn the curriculum and meet standards. Children are not being allowed the freedom to play outside in natural environments, researchers said . Combined with curbs on free play at home, this leads to a  ‘worrying picture’ across Europe, with ‘a growing tendency to reduce play time in children’s lives, both at school and  home, in order to increase time  for “learning”’. The report recommends cities be organised ‘with children in mind’, to enable them to play in the street and walk to school. Informal outdoor activities should be encouraged at school, with longer breaks to encourage more physical activity. The European Parliament event was planned by the Toy Industries of Europe, whose members include the LEGO Group.","Adults are 'over-supervising' and 'over-scheduling' children .

"Home Secretary Theresa May wants universities and colleges to ensure foreign students return to their countries after their studies are completed . Theresa May is pushing for new rules that will force colleges to ensure foreign students go home after completing their courses, it was reported yesterday. The Home Secretary’s call follows fresh evidence, revealed by the Daily Mail last week, which shows that around 100,000 foreign students each year fail to return to their home countries once their studies are over. A letter from Mrs May called for ‘decisive action to protect the integrity of the system and the reputation of our education sector’. However, her attempt to make universities and colleges responsible is understood to have met fierce opposition from vice-chancellors and Coalition colleagues. Universities Minister David Willetts is said to be sympathetic to the colleges’ pleas that they cannot be held responsible for the behaviour of students over whom they have no powers. Migrants who come to study here from outside Europe are a lucrative source of earnings for universities, which can charge them up to triple the £9,000 fees charged to those from Britain and the EU. Although the number of visas issued to non-EU foreign students has fallen since 2011 – when regulations were tightened up – government surveys suggest that a large number continue to come to Britain and not leave. According to the Office for National Statistics, 145,000 non-EU students arrived here in 2012. Yet last year, only 50,000 non-EU students returned to their home countries. Mrs May told Cabinet colleagues in March that she wanted new pressure on foreign students to obey the rules, following evidence of bogus courses and of students working for five-figure salaries and claiming benefits. Universities Minister David Willetts is said to be sympathetic to the colleges¿ pleas that they cannot be held responsible for the behaviour of students . Ideas put forward included curbs on students bringing in dependants, sanctions against institutions which allow students to break the rules, and a requirement for universities to co-operate with immigration officers to ensure students return home. Among open Tory opponents is former Foreign Office minister Lord Howell of Guildford, who is also the father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne. He said earlier this year that ‘being open for business means we’ve got to welcome the right people, including a lot of students and brilliant skilled people who add to our power in the world’.","Proposals are understood to have met fierce resistance from universities .

"The scene is all too familiar. Semi-clad teenagers tanked up on cheap booze, staggering around the streets wild-eyed and delirious, or draped over a bench, surrounded by empty alcohol bottles and fast-food cartons. But maybe not so much this year. Party time! They're not all volunteering - these happy chappies look like they're enjoying the fruits of Indonesia . So last year? New figures shows 2014 schoolies are turning their back on traditional locations and behaviour . Holiday company Student Flights has announced that this year's schoolies are looking to venture further afield, with many shunning the usual locations for more exotic destnations. The most popular locations have traditionally been the Gold Coast, Byron Bay and Airlie Beach. But competitive rates means they can have now enjoy a richer cultural experience overseas at a fraction of the cost. Battered: Workers from St Johns Ambulance attend to schoolies in Surfers Paradise, Gold Coast . As well as exclusive small-group  holidays like sailing, bookings to Bali and Thailand are higher than ever. Schoolies-only resorts in places like Vanuatu and Fiji are also up, between 40 and 50 per cent on last year. And it appears some of the estimated 60,000 school-leavers are budding philanthropists, with bookings to volunteer in places such as Africa, Cambodia and Sri Lanka up 120 per cent. The budget holiday company's General Manager, Darren Lloyd, says the reason the record number of schoolies are heading overseas this year is purely financial. School's out for summer: This teenage trio were living it up at a nightclub in Kuta, Indonesia . He told The Australian Asia is seen as cheap, easy and convenient and that, 'parents are more invested and happy to pay for their school leaver to go on a group tour as their end of school present.' On its Facebook page Student Flight quips, 'Bali may be cheap but it doesn't have to be nasty. Read how not to be a bogan in Bali.' Schoolies.com is another popular tour operator and has been the central booking site for Schoolies Week for more than 26 years,  arranging holidays for approximately 30,000 teens each year. Play time! Are our schoolies really budding philanthropists? New research says yes. Here a young volunteer plays with a Thai boy in the village of Ben Lion on Thailand's Koh Phra Island . Its CEO Matt Lloyd also claims about 80 per cent of school-leavers around Australia now organise a special trip or memorable holiday for their graduation compared to around 35 per cent 20 years ago. He says students are more organised than ever and they sometimes book their trips a year or two in advance so they make sure they get exactly what and where they want. Schoolies Week is a three week graduation festival celebrated by Year 12 school leavers all over Australia and celebrations take place during the first 3 weeks following graduation in mid November. We're going global! Bookings to volunteer in countries like Africa and Sri Lanka are up 120 per cent . The Daily Mail Australia revealed on Thursday that Queensland police, fed up with the annual carnage, are cracking down on drunk and disorderly revellers this year. As well as banning them from the Gold Coast they are set to slap them with fines of up to $8,000 in a bid to try and stamp out drunken behaviour.","Student Flights General Manager Darren Lloyd claims students are shunning traditional Australian locations to head overseas .

"Graduate Liza Fitzpatrick, 36, says she was told to take her degree off her CV as it might help her get a job . After years of hard work, Liza Fitzpatrick was proud to put her degree on her CV. So she was understandably devastated when, she claims, a job centre adviser told her to take it off – because it made her ‘overqualified’ for some roles. Miss Fitzpatrick, 36, graduated from the University of Hull in July last year, and has since been unable to find a job despite applying for more than 200 positions. She says she was reduced to tears after one of the Government’s welfare-to-work advisers ‘bullied’ her into changing her CV, claiming she needed to make it more basic. The adviser, who she sees as a condition of claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, ‘threatened to sanction’ her if she did not remove her 2:2 BA Honours degree in social and community care work within three days. Miss Fitzpatrick claims the employment adviser, who she describes as in his mid-50s, told her that he used to be an employer and he would not have taken her on because she was too qualified. ‘They’ve told me I have to dumb down my CV but I’ve studied hard for this,’ she said. ‘I’d take any job to be able to stop signing on. He bullied me into changing something I was really proud of and threatened that my benefits could be taken away if I did not do as he told me.’ She added: ‘By removing my degree, I would leave a five-year gap on my CV [she studied part of her degree part-time], which I thought would cause me more problems.’ The former care assistant, from Hull, would like to find a job in support work, for example as a probation officer or social worker. But she has also been applying for jobs at supermarkets and high street shops. Miss Fitzpatrick, pictured job-hunting at home in Hull, has applied for more than 200 posts since she graduated . The graduate was advised about her CV in her local job centre, thought to be this one in Hull's Market Place . She also volunteers at  a Fair Trade shop to gain retail experience and helps out at North Hull Women’s Centre, a charity that gives women counselling and support. But she claims her employment adviser said her volunteering was ‘irrelevant’ in terms of finding work. Her long-term partner, 39-year-old Sean Hardy, later telephoned the Work Solutions job centre. Mr Hardy, who works in the building trade, said the manager insisted it was not the centre’s policy to advise job-seekers to remove qualifications. But Work Solutions said that the career aspirations of its customers are not always ‘realistic’ in the current labour market. In a statement, it said: ‘If customers are struggling to gain employment in their chosen field, we would help them look at other realistic opportunities. 'This can mean re-looking at the make-up of a CV and the labour market it’s aimed at.’ It insisted, however, that this would only be a suggestion, adding: ‘Qualifications and degrees are achievements to be very proud of and we would never request their removal from a CV but would recommend that a CV is focused clearly towards the vacancy or industry sector that a candidate is applying for.’ Labour’s Karl Turner, MP for Hull East, said: ‘It is very worrying that unemployed graduates in Hull are being advised to remove qualifications in an attempt to secure any type of employment. ‘It is clear that the bigger issue here is the lack of suitable graduate jobs in the city.’","Liza Fitzpatrick has University of Hull degree in social & community care .

"A Canadian military veteran who was dutifully escorting the body of a dead soldier during a funeral procession was outraged after police pulled her over and gave her a ticket. Debbi Ferguson was stopped by an officer from Victoria Police during the somber procession to lay Private Steven Allen to rest on Remembrance Day in Victoria, Canada. The 20-year military veteran said that her first thought when the officer pulled in behind her and flashed his lights was that he was going to help the motorcade. Laid to rest: Debbi Ferguson was part of a procession to lay Private Steven Allen, pictured here, to rest . But she was stunned when he issued her with a ticket for $230. She said: ‘We were already in an emotional state and it was Remembrance Day. 'It was hard on all of us veterans and soldiers that a fellow man at arms would pull me over and pull me out of this escort.’ She said that her car had a flag at half mast on it and her four-way flashers were on, so there was no way that police officer did not realize that her car was a part of the procession. She said: ‘He shouted out on his microphone to pull over immediately. We were just in shock.’ Ferguson told the officer that they were taking part in a funeral procession. But he shot back that he didn't care, went to his car, and came back with the ticket. She said: ‘I looked at him and I'm like I am sorry this is most disrespectful thing I have seen anyone do.’ Victoria police said Ferguson was given the ticket because her 'license plate was obstructed.' Ticket: Victoria police said that she was given the ticket because her 'license plate was obstructed' The dead soldier, Allen, died during a military training exercise in Alberta, Canada. The military procession was taking his body from the airport to a funeral home. Meanwhile, Ferguson said that she was only trying to follow strict military codes which state that  no soldier is left behind. She told CBC Victoria: ‘We never leave anyone behind and we never let a soldier come home alone.’ A spokesperson for Victoria Police said in a statement that the action of its officer was ‘regrettable.’ ‘We recognize that this report of a ticket being issued to fellow community members volunteering their time to see a compatriot home is regrettable. 'This is especially true on a day when many members of our community, including many VicPD officers, were paying our own respects to the fallen.’","Debbi Ferguson was pulled over by Victoria Police during the procession .

"A quarter of a million extra school places are needed by next year, the National Audit Office warns. The biggest baby boom since the 1950s combined with high levels of immigration have been blamed for the huge shortfall. The squeeze on household incomes has also seen large numbers of  families turn their backs on private schooling. Inadequate: There will be 250,000 fewer places than needed next year, some say down to immigration and the baby boom . An estimated 240,000 of the places expected to be needed in the 2014-2015 academic year are in primaries. More children than ever could be forced to travel large distances to school, be taught in makeshift classrooms or in oversized classes. Amyas Morse, who is head of the NAO, said yesterday: ‘Despite increases in places and funding over the last two years, the Department for Education faces a real challenge, with 256,000 places still required by 2014-2015. ‘There are indications of real strain on school places.’ The number of pupils in state schools is expected to soar by nearly a million to 7,950,000 by the end of the decade. Last year alone the primary school population went up by 78,000, the fastest rise in a decade. Sire Andrew Green, from MigrantWatch UK, believes that the problem has been caused by the policies of the last Labour government . At least a fifth of schools were full or overflowing last May and the number of infant classes with more than 31 children has doubled since 2007. Last September, hundreds of primary children were left waiting for a confirmed place as the term began. And around 23,000 began their education at schools their parents didn’t want them to attend. The rising demand has had a significant impact on the average time a child spends travelling to school. Areas under the greatest strain include Hampshire, where 122 primary schools are educating children who are ‘in excess of school capacity’. Kent has 733 too many children in 114 primaries and 1,351 ‘excess’ pupils in 33 secondary schools. Were migration reduced to zero, 106,000 fewer places would be needed, DfE figures suggest. But it is feared that the arrival of an estimated 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians when an immigration cap expires at the end of this year will heighten the problem. Councils have been concreting over parks and other open spaces to build extra classrooms. Children are also having lessons in former warehouses, police stations, offices and retail outlets. Some education chiefs have considered ‘radical’ solutions such as split-shift schooling, with school days staggered to have different year groups taught at different times of day. Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘This is yet another example of Labour’s failure to plan for the inevitable effects of mass immigration which they stimulated.’ The Office of the Schools Adjudicator warned in November that a shortage of capacity for four- and five-year-olds is one of the biggest problems facing councils. Failing: Labour claim that Education Secretary Michael Gove is not performing the most basic tasks of his job . The Government has pumped more than £5billion into creating more spaces. But this did not include costs such as acquiring land – because the Department for Education assumed most places would be in existing schools, the NAO said. The shortage increases the likelihood of more ‘super’ primaries being opened that can accommodate up to 1,000 children. Kevin Brennan, Labour’s schools spokesman, accused the Government of cutting funding for school buildings by 60 per cent. ‘Michael Gove’s first job as Education Secretary is to provide enough school places for children – he is failing in that duty,’ he added. But schools minister David Laws said the NAO report confirmed the Government was ‘dramatically’ increasing funding for school places. He added: ‘Labour reduced the number of places available even though there was a baby boom. ‘We have already created 80,000 new places to deal with the shortage left by the last government and there will be more places to come.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘We will have spent around £5billion by 2015 on creating new school places, which is more than double the amount spent in the previous parliament. ‘We are confident that this will meet the local demand that local authorities face.’ David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said councils  faced ‘unprecedented pressures’. ‘If the Government wants to rapidly increase the number of school places it should release money from the grip of Whitehall mandarins and let councils, who have both the legal duty and the local knowledge to deliver new places.’","The National Audit Office warns that there will be problems next year .

"Michael Gove accused teaching unions of adopting a ‘twisted, militant logic’ to justify strikes that closed nearly 3,000 schools yesterday. The Education Secretary said it was bizarre that the NUT and NASUWT were striking over plans for performance-related pay that will see the best teachers paid more. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Gove angrily hit out at the unions as the  ‘enemies of promise’, saying they had selfishly ‘put their ideology before pupils’ interests’. Schools out: A rally in Sheffield yesterday over proposed changes to teachers' pension schemes and pay . He added: ‘While we gather here today, the leaders of the militant teaching unions have gone out on strike. 'And the reason that they have gone out on strike, in a new example of a twisted militant logic, is that they want to stop good teachers being paid more money. ‘They are striking against... the growth and potential of poor children.’ His comments came as 2,703 schools were closed as a result of industrial action. Tens of thousands of children missed classes after 49 local authorities in the east of England, the East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside, were affected. Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, criticised teachers for striking . Mr Gove savaged claims by union leaders that they were implementing ‘child-friendly industrial action’, saying: ‘There is nothing child-friendly about industrial action. ‘Children lose a day of education, parents have to scrabble to pay more for expensive child care and the prestige of the teaching profession, which we all want to see reinforced and built up, takes a knock. ‘I have a simple message for the . leaders of the teaching unions: Please, please, please don’t put your . ideology before our children’s interests.’ The . Department for Education said only 29 per cent of schools in the . affected regions were closed. Figures for partially closed schools were . not available. A spokesman said: ‘The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. ‘In . spite of this, thanks to many hard-working teachers and heads, only a . third of schools in the targeted regions were closed today.’ Thousands . of chanting members of the NUT and NASUWT took to the streets of . Sheffield, Birmingham and Cambridge to voice their anger over changes to . pay, pensions and work conditions.Among them were children carrying banners with slogans, including ‘Save my future’, ‘Protect my teachers’ and ‘Gove out’. But . angry parents said they had been forced to alter plans or pay for child . care. Lisa Chambers, a councillor in charge of education at Tory-led . Suffolk County Council, said she had to take her 13-year-old son Alex to . meetings. Strike action: More than 2,700 schools closed yesterday as teachers held strikes over plans to introduce performance-related pay . ‘Unfortunately we don’t have any . grandparents close to us and friends have got to make arrangements for . their own children,’ she said. ‘I have a diary of commitments to people . and I really don’t feel I can let people down because of this strike.’ The . strike was the third of four one-day regional walk-outs, which will be . followed by nationwide industrial action before Christmas. The next will . affect London, the North East, South East and South West on October 17. Christine . Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said she was sorry for the . disruption but added: ‘The Government’s refusal to engage in meaningful . talks has led to the NUT and NASUWT taking strike action.’ Low turn-out meant that less than a quarter of the unions’ members originally voted for industrial action. March: Members of NUT and NASUWT, pictured in Birmingham yesterday, were accused by Michael Gove of putting their ideology before the interests of pupils . It came as a former American teachers’ union leader from Washington DC urged his British counterparts to think again about opposing reforms. George Parker said unions spent too much time trying to defend bad teachers and opposing reforms that would help children. Mr Parker, who received a standing ovation at the Tory conference yesterday, said: ‘Performance pay can work. It’s working in Washington DC.’ Praising the free schools and academies programmes, he said: ‘The concept of removing the bureaucracy that schools have to go through is an excellent idea. I am going to go back to America and get into trouble with my union buddies by talking about these things.’ Firebrand: NUT General Secretary Christine Blower said Gove left teachers with no choice but to strike . By RICHARD PENDLEBURY . Christine Blower doesn’t like grammar schools, free schools, academy status, streaming, Ofsted or league tables. It goes without saying that public schools give her apoplexy. But what really makes her red flag fly high is Education Secretary Michael Gove. Yesterday morning, as Mr Gove prepared to deliver his speech – she doesn’t like the Conservatives either – the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers made a defiant statement of rebellion which led to thousands of schools in  England staying shut for the day. For the strike was orchestrated by the self-styled ‘miner’s daughter’ from that hard-graft, clogs and whippets pit town of Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey. ‘No teacher takes strike action lightly, but the intransigence of this Education Secretary has left teachers with no choice,’ Ms Blower huffed. And yet industrial action has been a hallmark of her leadership of the NUT. One of her predecessors even said she was someone ‘for whom strike action is the only solution to problems’. As if to prove this, Ms Blower’s first task on assuming the top job in 2008 was to lead the membership on their own first national walk-out for two decades. Yesterday’s was simply part of the latest series of school stoppages which will continue until Christmas holidays, as she battles Mr Gove’s plans to introduce performance-related pay, and increase pension contributions and workload. If her own salary was the result of a performance-related calculation then she would surely be doing a brilliant job. At a reported £154,000 a year including pension top-ups, the Blower pay packet compares very favourably with the Prime Minister’s £142,000 per annum. Poor Mr Gove’s salary is a good £20,000 less than Ms Blower’s, but then she would no doubt argue that he is doing a useless job. Her considerable renumeration package sits a little uneasily with her own far-left political views which had made her a controversial figure within teaching, even before becoming NUT leader. While she would later decry the two-tier system, Ms Blower was educated in the grammar rather than secondary modern stream of a local state school. Comparison: With a reported £154,000 a year pay packet, Christine Blower's annual salary is more than Prime Minister David Cameron £142,000 per annum . Having considered a career in the probation service, she decided on teaching. Her first post was teaching French at Holland Park comprehensive school, dubbed the ‘socialist Eton’. It had just done away with streaming, which was just fine by the new mistress, who recalled: ‘Any class has a range of abilities but, in streaming or setting, there’s a risk you don’t realise that and treat them all as though they’re exactly the same. In mixed ability, you know you need the teaching style and the materials to hit the whole range.’ Her subsequent career took her to other west London schools and she ultimately became a full-time official of the NUT. Her membership dates back to her entry into the profession. By the 1980s she was a local official before being elected to the National Executive in 1992. But what were her own politics? Her Labour Party membership lapsed some two decades ago, and by 1999 she was telling the Guardian newspaper she was ‘to the left of Old Labour’ That was the year she first stood for general secretary, against the incumbent Doug McAvoy, who warned members that she had ‘a political and revolutionary platform’ that she ‘seeks to impose on members’. He even took out an advertisement claiming his opponent was ‘controlled by a group of extreme Left organisations including Militant’. Ms Blower lost heavily. In 2005 she was elected as NUT deputy general secretary and, three years later, stepped up when the then leader Steve  Sinnott, died. Since then she has been ‘militating’ as she puts it, rather than Militant. Her private actions in terms of how her own children are educated have not always been consistent. She stopped one of her two daughters from sitting SATs at the ages of  seven and 11 in protest, but  allowed the other to take them because the girl did not want to be ‘singled out’. It was also reported in a newspaper blog that one of her daughters was sent to a high-performing state school outside her home borough. Ms Blower appears to have neither confirmed or denied the report. ‘You have to make different decisions about different children, regardless of your politics,’ she has argued, referring to her decision about the SATs. That might sound a little  hollow to the parents of the children at the schools she closed yesterday.","Teachers' unions held strikes over plans for performance-related pay .

"English teenagers are among the best in Europe at solving practical problems, a league table revealed yesterday. The nation’s 15-year-olds came 11th in the world in a new test – ahead of their peers in the United States and all other European countries except Finland. The results are welcome news following England’s demotion from the top 20 nations in maths and reading. However Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, which all have strong academic records, did better. The rankings, based on a test taken by 85,000 pupils across 44 jurisdictions, show that English teenagers are better at solving real-life problems – such as adjusting a thermostat or selecting the cheapest rail tickets – than they are at tackling academic subjects. England is one of only a handful of countries where teenagers are better at problem-solving than maths, reading and science. Boys did slightly better than girls in the test - a reversal of the picture seen in national GCSE exams taken a year later . Boys did slightly better than girls, in a reversal of the picture seen in national GCSE exams taken a year later. Experts said the finding suggested GCSEs may be ‘unfair’ to boys. The OECD, which produced the league table, insisted the difference in performance between boys and girls was not statistically significant. The computer-based 40-minute test was the first of its kind run by the OECD, which regularly examines pupils’ performance in richer nations. Pupils in England scored 517, against an OECD average of 500. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland didn’t take part. The highest score was achieved by Singapore, with 562. Outside East Asia, the highest marks were achieved by Canada, Australia and Finland, with England coming 11th. ‘In England, students perform significantly better, on average, in problem solving than students in other countries who show similar performance in mathematics, reading and science,’ the OECD report said. ‘This is particularly true among strong performers in mathematics, which suggests that these students, in particular, have access to learning opportunities that prepare them well for handling complex, real-life problems.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Our young people are strong in problem-solving. This is a skill we should build on.’","Results based on a test taken by 85,000 pupils across 44 jurisdictions .

"An old Benghazi flame flared back up this week after an email . surfaced linking the White House to the formation of faulty talking . points it previously denied any involvement in, exasperating current and . former Obama administration officials who had hoped the pandemonium . over Benghazi was in the rear view mirror. 'Dude, this was like two years ago,' Former National Security Council . spokesman Tommy Vietor told Fox News' Bret Baier on Thursday night . after proclaiming that he doesn't 'really remember' what changes he did . or didn't make to the talking points. 'Dude, this was like two years ago,' Former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said when asked about Benghazi on Fox News on Thursday night . The White House has long said it did not knowingly send U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice on national television to say the . attack was in retaliation for an anti-Muslim film when it knew it was an . independent act of terrorism. Rice's original talking points, created by the CIA, named al-Qaeda as . perpetrators of the attack. At some point in the editing process, that . context was taken out, and inaccurate information about the video was inserted in. The White House and State Department have maintained that they made only . minor changes to the talking points such as changing  the word . 'consulate' to 'diplomatic facility.' But a recently declassified email from Deputy National Security . Adviser Ben Rhodes proves that White House communications staff was told . that Rice would 'underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.' That email was 'was explicitly not about Benghazi. It . was about the overall situation in the region, the Muslim world,' White . House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Wednesday. Carney again claimed that Rice's talking points originated with the . CIA, not the White House. That the White House originally classified the . email has raised eyebrows and caused concern that the White House . changed the talking points for political gain and subsequently tried to . bury its tracks.

"Police have questioned a British expat over his movements on the night Madeleine McCann vanished seven years ago, it has been reported. The self-employed gardener still lives in the Algarve region of Portugal and had worked near the resort where Madeleine's parents were staying in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. He said he was re-interviewed by British and Portuguese officers in Faro, Portugal, on Wednesday after originally giving a statement and a mouth swab in 2007. Development: Police have reportedly interviewed an expat gardener over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (above). It comes 16 months after Scotland Yard opened a fresh investigation over the 2007 mystery . Claim: According to the report, the man visited a bar in the Ocean Club resort on the same night (pictured) Speaking to the Sunday People, he strongly denied any involvement in the three-year-old's disappearance. The questioning is said to have focused around his movements between the crucial hours of 7pm and 9.30pm on the night Madeleine vanished. Her parents had left her sleeping while they had dinner a short distance away and raised the alarm at 10pm when they realised she was missing. According to the People, he told the original Portuguese probe he had been at a bar in the McCanns' resort and left at 7pm to have a shower, before returning at 9.30pm and staying for two hours. Last week it was reported that a British man and woman are among seven people due to be questioned over the girl's disappearance. Scotland Yard declined to comment on the latest claim. Distraught: Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry, both 46, have been kept updated on the investigation . Case: The couple pictured in July in Portugal, where they attended their libel hearing against a police officer . The development comes 16 months after Scotland Yard opened a fresh investigation into the three-year-old's disappearance from her parents' holiday apartment in the Ocean Club resort. Despite dozens of leads and suspects, which saw both British and Portuguese police reopen their investigations last year, detectives have still not found Madeleine's captor. In July Scotland Yard officers searched land around the tourist resort using ground-penetrating radar and sniffer dogs to search for signs of disturbed earth. At one stage they pinpointed an overgrown hole in the ground, which had been covered with wood, an iron sheet and mounds of earth, and hacked away at it with chainsaws and spades.

Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry, both 46, were kept informed throughout the excavation work and were said to be bracing themselves for ‘significant news’. Last year Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he wanted to 'try and end the torture that they are going through'. He told the LBC radio station: 'We’ve got some definite lines of inquiry, we hope we can make some good progress, and we’ve got our best chance by working together with the Portuguese.'

"The family of former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke has spoken out about his clandestine relationship with now-wife Blanche D'Alpuget, saying that in its early stages it almost destroyed their family. Breaking their long-held silence, the children and grandchildren of Mr Hawke spoke to Australian Story about the rift that divided them when the former Prime Minister announced that he was leaving his wife of 39 years, Hazel Hawke, to be with Ms D'Alpuget. Mr Hawke's grandson David Dillon said that his grandparent's divorce really rocked the family, especially when it was announced he planned to marry Ms D'Alpuget. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke with ex-wife Hazel Hawke, to whom he was married for 39 years . Mr Hawke's grandson David Dillon said that his grandparent's divorce really rocked the family, especially when it was announced he planned to marry Ms D'Alpuget . Mr Hawke, who turns 85 this year, sparked public and private backlash when it was revealed that he had been having an affair for nearly 20 years with Ms D'Alpuget, who was also his biographer, reported The ABC. While Mr Hawke famously swore off alcohol for his time in office in recognition of his need to be accountable to the Australian public and reliable as their leader, he continued his affair with Ms D'Alpuget in a continuous act of infidelity which shocked the nation. 'I think initially when our grandparents split and Bob moved on with Blanche it really tore our family apart,' said Mr Dillon in the second of a two-part special with the program, which goes behind the scenes in The Lodge. Mr Hawke's children have reportedly been estranged since his marriage to Ms D'Alpuget in 1995, speaking to Australian Story about the open hostility she experienced from them .

However, the relationship between the Hawke generations has eased recently, especially since the death of Mr Hawke's ex-wife in 2012 after a long battle with Alzheimer's. Mr Hawke's daughter Sue Pieter-Hawke said that her father had shown genuine sorrow for some of the pain he caused his ex-wife. 'Dad gave a very touching speech at the private reception we had after the very public memorial for Mum nearly two years ago at the Opera House,' said Ms Pieter-Hawke. 'And he was quite emotional and genuinely distressed and conceded some of the distress he caused her and I think it was very moving that he did that,' she said.

'I think he’s a man who has made amends where amends need to be made.' Mr Dillon said that Ms D'Alpuget played a large role in creating paths for relationships within the family to be mended. 'Blanche expressed a lot of love in times of adversity,' said Mr Dillon. 'She is a really strong woman and she’s played a really important role in allowing our family to reconnect and get over that initial big hurdle that we experienced through the divorce,' he said. Mr Dillon said that the family had worked hard to get to a place of healing and friendship with his grandfather's wife.

"Record numbers of young people are choosing to study in the U.S. as American universities ramp up UK recruitment in the wake of tuition fee rises. Jumping on the opportunity to attract the UK's brightest youngsters, U.S. institutions are increasingly targetting British sixth formers via recruitment fairs. In the last four years, there has been an 84 per cent rise in the number of US universities exhibiting at 'USA College Day' - the largest American university fair in the UK. Brain drain? Record numbers of young people are being lured to study in the US as American institutions focus recruitment efforts in the UK after tuition fee rises . And last year, 9,000 students jetted off to the United States to embark on higher education courses; it is believed that figure is set to be even higher this year, according to The Telegraph. Experts claim students are considering U.S. courses since UK university tuition fees have dramatically risen. Many of the country's leading institutions are now charging students £9,000-a year for to courses - three times the previous cost. Launching tomorrow, the USA College Day fair, at Kensington Town Hall, London, will host a record number of exhibitors, including eight of the top 10 U.S. institutions and 42 first-timers. The event, held in partnership with University of South Florida (USF) is free and now in its 36th year. Dr Roger Brindley, vice provost and USF system associate vice president said: 'Given the changes in UK university tuition recently, the University of South Florida represents a tremendous value proposition for UK students.' Top ranked institutions: Eight out the top 10 ranked US universities will be recruiting British youngsters this weekend in London, including Harvard University, pictured . This academic year (2012-13) was the first where UK institutions had the freedom to impose far higher fees, and according to the government's Office for Fair Access, prices are set to rise still next year. Data shows that 64 out of 122 UK institutions plan to increase fees next year. The maximum annual fee for any course is £9,000. Commenting on the interest in College Day, Lauren Welch, director advising and marketing at the U.S.-UK Fulbright Commission, which organises the event said: 'After several years of rising interest in US study amongst British students, American universities are eager to connect with UK pupils. 'What’s more, it is not just the usual suspects attending this year. We are seeing universities of all shapes and sizes come over the pond this autumn, including many newcomers.' Ms Welch said that many institutions go above and beyond simply attending the exhibition, and schedule talks at schools 'to fully take advantage of their visit'.","Record number of U.S. institutions join UK's biggest recruitment fair .

"Upper lips don’t come any stiffer. Sir William Dugdale — libidinous, boozing former jockey, racing driver, soccer boss and David Cameron’s belovedly wayward uncle — earned the Military Cross during World War II for extraordinary courage under fire. But to the end of his life, he refused to brag about it. ‘When the Germans appeared, one defended oneself, and eventually a gong appeared,’ he shrugged. Sir William Dugdale earned the Military Cross during World War II for extraordinary courage under fire . The reality was more dramatic. As a captain in the Grenadier Guards, Dugdale, who has died aged 92, had gone from being a staff junior to commanding officer in the space of three days in 1943. Britain’s Eighth Army, the Desert Rats, were being battered under waves of attack from Rommel’s Afrika Korps. With a unit of hand-picked men one night, Dugdale fought his way into Nazi-occupied ground — to retrieve the body of a fellow officer, and ensure the man got the burial he deserved. It was an act of loyal friendship and defiance that typified his character. The Eton-educated son of a baronet could be a roistering, womanising hellraiser. But he was also a man to be trusted, as Margaret Thatcher was to discover 40 years later when he helped her to defeat the unions. He was a household name in the Seventies, as chairman of Aston Villa when the club won the First Division and the European Cup. He famously banned Scottish supporters from the club’s terraces, after a riot during a friendly match against Rangers. Sir William Dugdale (pictured), uncle of Prime Minister David Cameron, has died aged 92 . But he’s best known now as the incorrigible uncle who helped mould the character of the Prime Minister — teaching a young David Cameron how to shoot rabbits in the Warwickshire fields on a misty Saturday morning and then wolf down a meat pie watching Villa play in the afternoon. After Dugdale married their aunt Cylla in 1967, the future PM and his older brother, Alexander, began to spend weekends at the family seat, the 350-year-old Blyth Hall, east of Birmingham. ‘They were both very bright cookies,’ the Camerons’ uncle recalled proudly. ‘And they were both into shooting and football, which I could provide. 'When we went to the Villa, they did it in style. We sat up in the gods in the VIP bit, and went down to the dressing-room afterwards.’ It was not a typical boys’ match day. But then, Sir William was not a typical uncle. He was born William Stratford Dugdale in 1922 at Blyth, a Restoration-era country mansion. As a pupil at Eton he was frequently ‘whacked’. ‘And it hasn’t done me any harm, but then I’ve always had a well-upholstered rear end,’ he joked years later. Despite his rebellious streak, he could knuckle down at exam time and earned a place at Balliol College, Oxford. The incentive was not so much academic as alcoholic: his great ambition was to don the sky-blue bow tie and navy tailcoat of the Bullingdon Club. Cameron claims his own involvement with the all-male drinking society is a source of embarrassment. His uncle, on the other hand, was proud of it, and said every night at Oxford was a party, with black-market sherry and claret to fuel their antics. Away from the Bullingdon, he ended up ‘paralytically drunk’ with contemporaries including future Tory PM Ted Heath and Labour Chancellor Denis Healey. But he had strong political views, and despised the pro-communist attitude of fellow students such as Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland, both future Labour Cabinet ministers. When Jenkins and Crosland joined a march in support of Stalin’s invasion of Finland in 1940, Dugdale and his pals sabotaged it by hurling soot bombs and buckets of water. Unfortunately, their aim was wayward, and a police sergeant was coated. They spent the night in the cells, and were released only when they agreed to pay for a replacement uniform. Cameron claims his involvement with the all-male drinking society the Bullingdon Club is a source of embarrassment - but his beloved uncle was proud of it and said every night at Oxford was a party . In 1943, aged 21, he had a brusque phone call from his mother Margaret — ‘a rather gung-ho sort of lady’. She suggested his time would be better employed fighting Germans, and so he enlisted. His service with the Guards took him across North Africa and into Italy, landing during the bitter fighting in Anzio in 1944. As the Allies advanced, he discovered the excitement of wartime liaisons. ‘Danger enhances the libido,’ he would declare with a raffish grin. ‘So the more frightened you are, the randier you get.’ In Florence, he would go to 8am mass on Sundays — it was the best ‘hunting ground’ to meet lonely Italian women whose husbands had been killed or captured. His autobiography Settling The Bill, published in 2011, describes how at the end of the war he drove north and saw the bodies of deposed dictator Benito Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, strung up from the roof of a petrol station. Weeks later, he was standing guard over war criminals at the Nuremberg trials, before returning to Britain and studying to be a solicitor. The legal life could not satisfy his need for adventure, though, and he decided instead to train as a jockey — and compete in the Grand National. Though he was 6ft 1in, he pared down his weight to just over 10st, with relentless dieting and a regime of Harley Street laxatives. He achieved his ambition, riding in the 1952 National, though he was thrown just before Becher’s Brook. After that he took to motor racing. But his obsession with speed wasn’t confined to the track: in his Jensen sports car, he would try to beat his record time driving between London and Birmingham — 101 miles in an hour and ten minutes. As a child, his ambition had been to run the country, and he was picked as a Tory candidate for the 1959 general election. But his wife Belinda, with whom he had four children, became ill with an ovarian cyst and died aged just 36. He abandoned his political dreams, and became lost in grief, drinking hard and relying on the children’s nanny to hold the household together. ‘Being a man,’ he said, ‘whisky helped.’ It was a sexual fling that snapped him out of it. Filling up his car on the Bayswater Road, he chatted up the petrol pump attendant. ‘We went back to her bedsit and she was brisk. She told me to stop moaning and get on with it.’ He didn’t leave her flat for two days. When he got home, the nanny was furious — but the crisis was over. After several wild years in the Sixties, with aviation his new obsession, he met and married Cylla Mount, a distant cousin of the Queen and the aunt of the Cameron boys. He gradually became a pillar of the Establishment — chairman of Warwickshire County Council, high sheriff of the county and chief disciplinary steward of the Jockey Club. After several wild years in the Sixties Sir William met and married Cylla Mount (pictured right) a distant cousin of the Queen and the aunt of the Cameron boys . But it was on the board of Aston Villa that he really made his mark. In 1974, he backed the appointment of manager Ron Saunders who went on to win a shelf of silverware, including the First Division trophy in 1981. The team went on to win a shelf of silverware, including victory over Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final. But the following year Ellis fought his way back in, and Dugdale was dismissed. His old rival sent him a silk tie emblazoned with the initials SBE: ‘Sacked By Ellis’. Instead of dwelling on traumas, his golden rule was to treat life like a ritzy but unreliable hotel: ‘If your breakfast doesn’t arrive, instead of walking out in a flounce, you should look around for a chicken leg.’ His chicken leg this time was served up by Mrs Thatcher. With the unions rampant, demanding a 15 per cent pay rise and threatening a national strike, he became chairman of Severn Trent Water Board and used all his charm and doggedness to settle the dispute. Plenty of whisky on the negotiating table helped keep the talks flowing, he noted. And his humour helped: at one meeting, he wore a plastic carnation in his buttonhole, with a silk-stockinged leg in the centre that did the can-can every ten minutes. To the end of his life, he invited controversy. At the launch of his book, he set out his political philosophy: however much the Labour Party sought to deny it, the working classes wanted to be led by an aristocrat...preferably a duke. If that wasn’t exactly what David Cameron wanted to hear from his wayward uncle, Sir William didn’t care. He never cared who he offended.","Sir William Dugdale was awarded the Military Cross during World War II .

"Military-style cadet forces are to be introduced in every secondary school in Britain, it emerged today. Education Secretary Michael Gove believes the Combined Cadet Force could bring a major improvement in standards of classroom discipline. Today more than 200 independent schools, but only around 60 state, have CCF units, according to the Ministry of Defence, which sponsors the organisation. Inspection: Prince Philip visits a school near Norwich after the CCF was created in 1948 . Teenagers, aged 13 to 18, learn drill and are trained to fire weapons. Among its famous former members is Prince Harry, who was the most senior cadet in Eton's 140-strong volunteer force. Mr Gove told the Sunday Express that the CCF would 'build patriotism' in the country’s troubled youngsters, giving them skills to succeed later in life. March past: Prince Harry was the most senior cadet at Eton . He recently attended a cadet awards ceremony at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, where he met a 17-year-old Afro-Caribbean who had joined the CCF. He said:'I met this amazing guy who told me how it had transformed his life. He was just the perfect advertisement for what it can do. Mr Gove has asked the Childrens Minister Tim Loughton and the MoD to 'roll it out' at all schools . More than 300,000 pupils are suspended each year for violence and bad behaviour and police are called to violent incidents more than 40 times each day. Mr Gove's move was backed by one of his senior advisers, Schools Commissioner Dr Elizabeth Sidwell, who is leading the expansion of the Government’s academy schools programme. She said that many extra-curricular activities like the CCF, debating societies and music tuition should no longer be the 'province of the middle classes'. Dr Sidwell told the Sunday Telegraph: 'These wonderful extra-curriculum elements did originate in the independent sector but for a number of years they have been there in City Technology Colleges, strong comprehensives and grammars. Soldier boys: Cadets in Brandon, Suffolk cheering the winner of a school race . 'Good state schools have these things. We must not say we can’t afford it, we find a way.' In other proposals, she signalled schools could face much tougher academic targets, with 80 per cent of . children in state primaries and secondaries expected to reach . required scores in exams and tests. It would mean far more . schools being classed as inadequate and subject to intervention from the . Department of Education. Meanwhile, Mr Gove wants children to learn history in class and be fluent in English. He said: 'It’s important that the sorts of activities that build the sense of togetherness, whether it be sport or the combined cadet force or orchestras and choirs, are encouraged in schools and help people feel part of one country.' The CCF was created in 1948 but its antecedents date back to 1859 when public schools and universities were asked to form volunteer corps. It includes wings linked to the Army, Navy and RAF, and is made . up of 13- to 18-year-olds. It uses military- orientated training to . build self-reliance, resourcefulness, endurance and a sense of service . to the community. In 2008, the then-prime minister Gordon Brown backed a government-commissioned report which said more state schools should sign up to CCF. Although there has been no major rise, it is increasingly offered in academies.","CCF could 'build patriotism' in troubled youngsters .

"The NFL is springing into action in the wake of two highly publicized incidents of abuse last week involving star players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, and has appointed three domestic violence experts to serve as senior advisers to the league. In a memo to teams on Monday, commissioner Roger Goodell announced that Lisa Friel, Jane Randel and Rita Smith had been brought on to 'help lead and shape the NFL's policies and programs relating to domestic violence and sexual assault.' The memo also informed teams that Anna Isaacson, currently the NFL's vice president of community affairs and philanthropy, will become its vice president of social responsibility. Scroll down for video . Taking action: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (above) announced today that he had appointed three domestic violence experts to advise the NFL . New appointees: Jane Randel (left), co-founder of the No More campaign, and former head of the NYC Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit Lisa Friel (middle) are two of the women Goodell has hired to advise the NFL, while Anna Isaacson (right) has been made vice president of social responsibility . This comes after video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, will return to team play this weekend. These three new, and much needed, appointees bring years of experience to their positions. Friel was the head of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit in the New York County District Attorney's Office for more than a decade. Randel is the co-founder of No More, a campaign against domestic violence and sexual assault. Smith is the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. And according to Goodell's memo, Isaacson's  role in the newly created social responsibility department will require her to 'oversee the development of the full range of education, training and support programs relating to domestic violence, sexual assault and matters of respect.' Isaacson has been with the NFL since 2006. Problem players: Adrian Peterson (left, with son Adrian Peterson Jr.) has been indicted on charges of negligent injury for hitting one of his children with a switch, while Ray Rice (right, with wife Janay and Daughter Rayven) has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL after video of him punching his now-wife went public . Some have been calling for Goodells's resignation following what they believe to be the league's botched job of dealing with the Rice scandal.

"Executed: Lisa Ann Coleman was put to death this evening in Texas, for starving to deahth her girlfriend's son . A Texas woman was executed this evening, after spending the last eight years on death row for the murder of her girlfriend's son a decade ago. Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, of Arlington, Texas, was found guilty of capital murder in the death of 9-year-old Davontae Williams, who had been beaten and bound, and whose body bore more than 250 scars when officials discovered him on July 26, 2004. He had also been starved, weighing a mere 35 pounds at the time of his death. Coleman was given a lethal injection sometime after 6pm and was pronounced dead at 6:23pm, according to KDFW reporter Richard Ray who acted as a media witness to the execution. Ray said the execution was 'very peaceful' and that he only heard a 'short gasp' before Coleman passed. Her last words were directed at her fellow inmate, Darlie Routier. 'Tell them I finished strong,' she said. She then smiled and blew kisses at the supporters gathered and added: 'God bless you all.' Ahead of her death, Coleman told jailers she was at peace with the execution. ''I'm ready, I know where I am going. I'm not bitter, just ready,' Coleman said Wednesday. She spent Monday playing word games with her friends, Routier, before being transferred to Huntsville for the lethal injection. On Wednesday  she was given the opportunity to see family and spiritual advisers and make phone calls. Five family members and friends bore witness to Coleman's execution. No one showed up to represent the victim, Davontae. Davontae's mother, and Coleman's former girlfriend, Marcella Williams, is currently serving a life sentence for his death, after reaching a plea deal. Life in prison: Davontae's (left) mother, Marcella Williams (right) is serving life in prison after reaching a plea deal in the death of her son, who weighed just 35 pounds when he succumbed to malnutrition . Prosecutor's in Coleman's case used the charge of kidnapping to justify asking for the death penalty. According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, they argued that Coleman 'did not allow Davontae to have visitors, kept him from visiting others by restraining him and told people he was not at the apartment when he was there.' The young boy's ultimate cause of death was malnutrition. Paramedics who arrived on the scene after it was reported the child was having trouble breathing found him dressed in nothing but bandages and a diaper, and reported that the boy had clearly been dead for several hours. A jury deliberated for just three hours in June 2006 before recommending the death penalty. Williams, who was just 14-years-old when she gave birth to Davontae, had been investigated by Child Protective Services seven times between 1995 and 2002. In 2002, they lost track of  the family. Death row: Coleman's mugshot at the time of her initial arrest back in 2004 . Coleman’s appellate attorney, John Stickels, filed a clemency application in August asking that Texas governor Rick Perry commute her sentence to life in prison, but a board voted unanimously earlier this week to not recommend commutation. 'What she’s really guilty of is being a black lesbian,' Stickels said. 'Her sexual orientation played a role in the state choosing to seek the death penalty and in her getting the death penalty.' The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a last minute stay of execution. According to The Austin Chronicle, four witnesses who lived in the same apartment complex as Williams and Coleman report seeing Davontae around the neighborhood unrestrained and in good spirits just days before his death. These witnesses all submitted affidavits on Coleman's behalf to help her attorneys as they attempted to appeal her case by questioning the legitimacy of the kidnapping charges. Coleman is the sixth woman put to death in Texas since 1982, and the ninth person this year. The last woman to be executed in Texas was Suzanne Basso, who received a lethal injection on February 5, 2014.","Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, was executed after 6pm today for the death of her girlfriend's son, 9-year-old Davonte Williams .

"Unravelling: While being interviewed about the robbery, Alesha Ahmed revealed to detectives she had witnessed the murder of her sister Shafilea (pictured) The father who murdered his teenage daughter Shafilea Ahmed was prepared to flee the country with a briefcase of gold bars in order to escape justice, it was claimed today. Iftikar Ahmed, 51, and his wife Farzana, 49, were jailed for life last week after they were found guilty of killing the 17-year-old. They were ordered to serve at least 25 years after a court heard they’d suffocated their Muslim daughter because they objected to her Westernised lifestyle. Shafilea disappeared from the family home in Warrington in 2003 and her body was later found in the River Kent, in Cumbria. She’d become known to social workers shortly before she vanished after being abused by her parents. Solicitor Patricia Jervis, who worked as head of law at Warrington Council at the time, revealed that when officials visited the home Iftika had prepared a briefcase so he and his family could leave the country at the 'drop of a hat'. She told the Liverpool Echo: 'When she disappeared, we had a child protection conference with the various agencies, like the police and social services. 'A social worker had been round to the house and we knew there was a briefcase in the hall which had gold bars and his children’s passports in it, just in case he had to leave the country at the drop of a hat. He was ready to flee the country if it came to it.' Ms Jervis, now an expert in honour violence and forced marriages, said the couple had shown little concern about Shafilea’s disappearance. She said: 'The parents didn’t report her missing and they refused to cooperate. All the information we had came from social services. 'There was no remorse or regret. There was no urgency or panic that their daughter had vanished. 'There was no ‘Oh God, where is she?’, or ‘We’re really worried about her’, ‘Where is she sleeping tonight?’ She added that officials had known Shafilea 'wasn’t coming back' and the 'gut feeling' was her parents were responsible. Honour killing: Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his wife Farzana, 49, of Warrington, Cheshire, suffocated their 17-year-old daughter Shafilea with a plastic bag because she refused an arranged marriage . Inside the courtroom: Iftikhar Ahmed stood impassively as the verdicts were given while his spouse wiped tears from her eyes with a tissue . Crucial evidence: The arrest of Alesha Ahmed ultimately led to the conviction of her parents Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed (pictured) As Mr and Mrs Ahmed were jailed for life, social services were accused of missing several key warning signs in the run-up to Shafilea's death. The killers were exposed only after Shafilea's younger sister plucked . up the courage to tell how she and her siblings watched them suffocate . her in 2003. Mr Justice . Roderick Evans said 'Westernised' Shafilea simply wanted a normal life . but found herself 'squeezed between two cultures'. He then made a . thunderous attack on the morals of the parents standing in front of him . at Chester Crown Court. 'What was it that brought you two, her parents, the people who had given her life, to the point of killing her?' he asked them. 'You chose to bring up your family in Warrington but your social and cultural attitudes were those of rural Pakistan. Victim: Shafilea as a child with her mother at the family's UK home . 'Shafilea . was a determined, able and ambitious girl who wanted to live a life . which was normal in the country in which you had chosen to live and . bring up your children. However, you could not tolerate the life that . Shafilea wanted to live. 'You wanted your family to live in Pakistan in Warrington. 'Although . she went to local schools, you objected to her socialising with girls . from what has been referred to as the white community. You objected to . her wearing Western clothes and you objected to her having contact with . boys. 'She was being squeezed between two cultures, the culture and way of life that she saw around her and wanted to embrace, and the culture and way of life you wanted to impose on her.' He said the fact her siblings witnessed the murder was 'a truly horrifying feature' of the case which had 'blighted' their lives too. He ordered both Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his 49-year-old wife to serve a minimum of 25 years in prison. Shafilea's efforts to escape her parents' iron grip were thwarted by what criminologist Dr Aisha Gill called a 'catastrophic' communication breakdown as social workers took her reluctance to make allegations of abuse at face value. Dr Gill, an expert in 'honour killings' who appeared for the prosecution, said that but for that Shafilea may still have been alive today. Born and raised in Britain, Shafilea's aspirations forced her to lead a 'secret life', spending money from her evening job on buying 'Western' clothes and a mobile phone and enjoying flirtatious chats with young Muslim men. Those aspirations clashed with her parents, who expected a compliant, demure future bride fit to marry a cousin she had never met in Pakistan. Shafilea was subjected to regular beatings. In her own words, found in an application for housing help, she wrote: 'Regular incidents since I was 15-16 years. One parent would hold me while the other hit me.' As the eldest daughter, her fate had already been determined 4,000 miles away in the village of Uttam in Pakistan's north-eastern frontier. Suspected family figurehead Abdul Razaq had proposed marriage on behalf of his son, whom Shafilea had never met. The siblings: Mevish, left, and Junyad, right, . and the youngest sister, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all . broke down in tears as the verdict was read out . Led away: Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed were two . traditionalist disciplinarians who had very fixed ideas about how their . children, particularly their daughters, should behave . Several times she fled the family home, but aged 16 she was packed off to Pakistan. In desperation she drank bleach, known locally as 'scrub', causing horrific injuries. Her aunt Rukhsana Imtiaz said: 'I still believe it was a mistake she took scrub and did not intend to kill herself, but what happened was very bad… . 'She was in great, great pain and we rushed her to hospital where they washed her stomach and saved her. She was kept under treatment for three days but her throat was badly damaged – she struggled to swallow even liquid.' Astonishingly, the family recalls, the incident merely served to fuel Mrs Ahmed's anger because Shafilea had 'made a scene'. After months in hospital back home in Britain, Shafilea set about resuming a Westernised lifestyle. Crucially, however, she had now lost her 'value' as a potential bride, her body ravaged by the effects of poor medical treatment in Pakistan. On September 11, 2003, another – fatal – row began after Shafilea was picked up from her evening job wearing a short-sleeved top and white stiletto boots. Her body was found beside a river in Cumbria in February 2004 but the breakthrough in the case did not come until 2010 when Shafilea's sister Alesha – only 15 at the time of the murder – was arrested over a mysterious robbery at the family home and finally told police she had witnessed the killing. Now 24, she said their mother began the attack with the words 'Just finish it here', before her father stuffed a plastic bag in Shafilea's mouth, holding it there until she stopped breathing. Their brother Junyad, then 13, later told his sisters 'She deserved it', Alesha said, telling of watching her parents wrap Shafilea's body in bin bags before her father carried it to a car. Yesterday, at the end of the ten-week trial, Mrs Ahmed wept as she was found guilty, while her taxi driver husband grimaced then uttered an obscenity at detectives. Police suspect someone helped dispose of Shafilea's body, and further prosecutions could follow. Scouring for clues: Forensic officers comb the riverbank next to the River Kent in in Sedgwick, near Kendal, Cumbria, where where Shafilea's body was found .

"Victim: Jewellery designer Michael Griffiths was hog-tied before being tortured and burned alive . Three gang members who tortured a jewellery designer in an attempt to gain access to his safe before setting him on fire and leaving him to die inside his burning home have been jailed for a total of 90 years. Harvey Mumford, Zac Cowdrey and Simon Penton went to 'extraordinary lengths' to target Michael Griffiths, 59, tracking him down on the internet before conducting reconnaissance on his house in Fernhurst, Surrey. They first attempted to con their way into his property by pretending to be police officers wearing hi-vis jackets and after that failed they broke into his home while he was out and lay in wait for him to return. When Mr Griffiths, who was described as a 'wonderful, fun-loving person', arrived he was stunned and 'hog-tied' with his hands and ankles bound together before being brutally tortured in the hope he'd give up the key to his safe, thought to contain diamonds worth £40,000. The gang then poured petrol onto him and onto the surrounding ground and set him on fire before callously leaving him to burn to death. Cowdrey, 24, and Mumford, 23, both of Staines, Surrey, were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 32 years. Penton, 43, of Sunbury, Surrey, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 26 years in Prison. After passing sentence, Judge Michael Lawson said: 'There was a complete plan to cause some harm to Mr Griffiths. This plan was exceeded by Cowdrey and Mumford. 'Mr Griffiths was overpowered to get to the valuable property you thought was in his safe. 'The use of green hi-visibility jackets and identifying yourselves as policemen were deliberate acts to gain access to the house. It only failed because Mr Griffiths never answered the door. 'The project was not called off on the 22nd. It was far too valuable. On the 23rd you went back to check if Mr Griffiths was in. When he wasn’t, you called the team and sent them to come down and await his return. 'When Mr Griffiths entered he was stunned and hog-tied in most unpleasant fashion and then force was exerted on him in the hope he would give up the location of the key. 'Mr Penton, you knew some force was to be used including strangulation, probably with his own neck-tie. 'We have not heard any genuine expression of remorse and no time was wasted in returning to the house and destroying evidence. 'Mr Mumford poured petrol on the ground floor and on Mr Griffiths himself and you then lit it and there was unsurprisingly a fast and terrifying fire.' Guilty: Zac Cowdery, left, and Harvey Mumford, right, broke into Mr Griffiths home and lay in wait for him to return. They were found guilty of murder and each sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 32 years . Simon Penton, 27, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 26 years in prison . Prosecutor Christine Laing told the six-week trial Mr Griffiths had a jewellery workshop and also worked at auction houses where it was common knowledge he had two diamonds at home worth about £40,000. The court was told firefighters who discovered his body in January 2013 first thought Mr Griffiths was disabled and had been unable to escape the blaze after he was found lying against the front door with his legs and hands tied together with cables. The diamonds were found by police stored in picnic flasks which had removable compartments. Detective Chief Inspector Jeff Riley, who led the hunt for the killers, said he had rarely witnessed such callous . disregard for life and that during the trial absolutely no remorse was . shown by any members of the group for their shocking behaviour and . actions. He said: 'Michael was not easy to fool so they then had to adapt their plan by targeting his home whilst he was out and laying in wait for his return. 'He was then subjected to a prolonged and serious assault that ended in him losing his life. 'He was callously left tied up by those responsible, not caring if he was still alive or dead. 'The group then left Fernhurst and over the next 24 hours set about disposing and destroying any items that could link them to the scene, including clothing, mobile phones and even a motor vehicle used to transport them. 'They then plotted to return and destroy any remaining evidence by pouring petrol over the crime scene including Michael’s body before setting fire to it.' In a statement Mr Griffiths’ family said no sentence would ever be enough for the people involved in his death. 'Unfortunately we now live in a world of greed and violence,' they said. 'Perhaps they could imagine the pain if it were to happen to one of their own family? 'Michael loved life in his own way, working with jewellery and antiques and he was extremely talented in producing one-off designs for people. 'He was very happy socialising with the local community in Fernhurst. Michael we miss you, God Bless.' Target: The safe at jewellery designer Michael Griffiths home. The court heard it was it was common knowledge he had two diamonds at worth about £40,000 . Aftermath: The burnt out home of jewellery designer Michael Griffiths. The court heard the gang poured petrol over him before setting him on fire and leaving him to die . Scene: Firefighters who discovered the body in January 2013 thought Mr Griffiths was disabled and had been unable to escape the blaze after he was found lying against the front door with his legs and hands tied together with cables . Munford and Penton, also admitted four counts of conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Cowdrey also admitted one count of conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Loved: Mr Griffiths's family described him  as a 'wonderful, fun-loving person' John Bartholomew, aged 72 years, from Portsmouth, Hants., Damien Krafft, aged 27 years, from Shepperton, Middlesex and Kerry Rudder, 43, from Sunbury-on-Thames, were all cleared of the murder. Rudder was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to burgle, but was cleared on two other counts and also cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. She was jailed for three years. Krafft admitted one count of conspiracy to burgle and was cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He received a three year prison sentence. Bartholomew was found not guilty of three counts of conspiracy to burgle. Rebecca Rogers, aged 39 years, from Shepperton, who had faced one charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, was cleared. Mr Griffiths brother, Martin said: 'There are no words to describe the effect that night had on Michael’s family. 'The first thing in the morning we think of is him and the last thing at night. 'Eventually we will get to cope with it but at the moment it is unreal. 'Michael never had a fight with anyone in his life. He was a wonderful, fun-loving person who nursed both his parents in their later years. 'Not a day goes by when we don’t think of Michael and the terrible injuries that were inflicted on him. 'We now live in a world of greed and violence and no sentence can begin to make up for the offence.'","Harvey Mumford, 23 and Zac Cowdrey, 24, jailed for 32 years each for murder .

"Cleared: Russell Woolwright leaving Bournemouth Crown Court today. He was found not guilty of two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as as an adult in a position of trust . A PUBLIC school teacher accused of engaging in sexual activity with a ‘flirty’ female pupil spoke of his frustration yesterday after he was cleared of any wrongdoing. Russell Woolwright, 30, said the false allegations had forced him to resign from his job as an economics teacher at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset, where he had worked for five years. The girl, who was 17 at the time, sent Mr Woolwright a series of inappropriate emails – but he insisted there had  been no sexual contact. After having to endure a four-day trial in which he was charged with making the teenager perform a sex act on him  during an encounter in an alleyway,  he said the system leaves all the  ‘power with the pupils and not with  the teachers’. Mr Woolwright met up with the girl after she pestered him with a string of lewd emails including one she titled ‘party in my pants’. He said he told the girl to stop contacting him and twice backed away when she tried to kiss him. After the police later learnt of the  email exchange between the pair,  the girl ‘embellished’ her version of events and claimed she carried out  the sex act. But a jury took just 90 minutes  to find him not guilty of two  counts of causing or inciting  sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust. After the verdict at Bournemouth Crown Court, Mr Woolwright said: ‘It’s a huge relief. ‘I now feel I can go out again without being judged and I can get on with my life which I am having to rebuild from scratch.’ He went on to say: ‘This trial has not only affected me but also my friends and family. ‘It has made me realise the power is with the pupils and not with the teachers. An allegation can be made at any time.’ Mr . Woolwright also revealed that he would like to get back into teaching . again, but said he would be ‘more wary’ of situations involving students . in the future. The girl, . who cannot be named for legal reasons, started emailing the teacher . after they bumped into each other in Wimborne, Dorset. 'I love my job': Mr Woolwright was forced to resign from his role as an economics teacher at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset, pictured, where he had worked for five years in the wake of the allegations . On October 25 last year he was sent an email from a friend of the complainant which he received on his mobile phone. The first message said ‘[she] wants you’ and another one read: ‘Hurry up Wussy Russy.’ The . girl, described in court as ‘flirtatious’, then sent an email which was . titled ‘party in my  pants’ and boasted of her sexual prowess in a . follow-up message. Mr . Woolwright insisted that he was angry and shocked by the nature of the . messages, and claimed he had only decided to meet up with the girl so . that he could tell her to stop. He . told the court: ‘I saw it as an opportunity to say “look these emails . really have to stop. It’s inappropriate in the language that’s been . used.”’ He emailed both the girls in the days following the encounter to urge them to delete the emails they had swapped. When . he was questioned by the police he acknowledged he had been wrong to . put himself anywhere near the girl at the time and admitted that he . should instead have taken up the matter with the school’s headmaster. He told officers: ‘I don’t want this allegation to ruin my job at Canford and also my teaching career because I love it.’ Mr . Woolwright, from Bristol, flatly denied the girl’s version of events . when they were put to him by prosecutor David Bartlett during the trial. He is currently not teaching but working for a company which manufactures audio devices. l.salkeld@dailymail.co.uk .","Russell Woolwright taught at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset .

"Michael Gove's exams watchdog has been accused of wasting public money by assessing whether the  new tests to replace GCSEs will  discriminate against Muslims, pregnant schoolgirls or teenagers having sex changes. The ‘equality analysis’, commissioned by Ofqual at a cost of £2,400, has warned that a number of pupils in these categories could be affected by the Education Secretary’s controversial overhaul of the exams. Mr Gove announced plans earlier this year to replace most of the course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertake as part of their GCSEs with more rigorous end-of-course exams, to be known as ‘I-levels’. Mr Gove announced plans earlier this year to replace most of the course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertake as part of their GCSEs with more rigorous end-of-course exams . Last year Prime Minister David Cameron declared that equality assessments were ‘bureaucratic nonsense’ and civil servants should employ common sense. But exam regulator Ofqual said it carried out the exercise to comply with the Equality Act 2010. It has spent over £5,000 on such assessments in the past year. Last night critics condemned the new report as a waste of time and money, only highlighting hypothetical effects on a tiny minority of the 600,000 pupils who will sit the new papers. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign For Real Education, said: ‘This is misplaced political correctness. We need common sense. We have been coping with exams from time immemorial. There are always going to be exceptions, and you can’t avoid them.’ Mr Gove said he was introducing his exam reforms to push up standards . Mr Gove said he was introducing his exam reforms to push up standards because the current ‘dumbed-down’ GCSEs had become discredited. But the Ofqual equality analysis, drawn up by a company called Equality Research and Consulting Ltd and published this month, warns that introducing a single, final exam worth 100 per cent of the marks could have an impact on teenagers who get pregnant while studying for GCSEs. It said schoolgirls who are expecting babies could struggle if the examination  season ‘coincides with any problems in pregnancy or is near the due date’. Concern was also raised in the  25-page report that pupils undergoing ‘gender reassignment’ may be disproportionately affected. The youngest person to have a sex-change operation in Britain is reported to have been 17, and fewer than 90 children and adolescents nationally are thought to be referred annually to the specialised gender identity services. However, the report says that reassigning a person’s sex by ‘changing physiological or other attributes of sex can be a prolonged process, rendering the pupil unavailable at crucial times not only for lessons but for exams unless alternative arrangements are made’. The third group, Muslim pupils, who make up less than ten per cent  of those taking GCSEs, could also be disadvantaged if they happen to  be fasting for religious reasons during the exams. Ofqual admitted in its main consultation document that the numbers involved were often small, but said it wanted to take all potential discrimination into account to see if alternative arrangements could be made. Ofqual said it was important to understand ‘the potential implications of any significant proposals we make for different groups. ‘Doing an equality analysis like this allows us to make decisions in a fully informed way, and also to meet our legal duties under the Equality Act.’","Course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertaken as part of GCSEs will be replaced with more rigorous end-of-course exams .

"Guilty: Asha Khan has been convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice . A judge allowed two Muslim solicitors accused of trying to cheat the legal system to hide behind a cloak of secrecy for  ‘cultural reasons’, the Daily Mail can disclose. He banned reporting of the case of Asha Khan, 30, and her brother Kashif, 34, to prevent them allegedly being shamed in the eyes of their community. In the latest farce involving secret justice, the pair were told they could enjoy the court’s protection because members of their family would pass judgment if the case was reported. It is a privilege rarely bestowed on defendants in the justice system, which has operated on the principle of transparency for centuries. However, following a challenge by the Daily Mail, the restriction was lifted – enabling the case to be reported. Judge Peter Hughes reversed his original ban after deciding that the principle of open justice was more important than saving the embarrassment of a defendant. After almost a year of court appearances and legal argument, Miss Khan has been convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice, while her brother was acquitted of the charge. They were on trial accused of helping their father, Mohammed, dodge a speeding fine by pretending he was not driving at the time of the offence. In a saga with echoes of the Chris Huhne scandal, he allowed a man who worked for the family to take the blame instead. At the beginning of the hearings, Miss Khan’s barrister, Glenn Gatland, argued  she would not give evidence properly in the presence of the Press because she was afraid of family repercussions. He said she did not want to criticise her father in public – though she was quite happy to have her mother sit in the public gallery. ‘Miss Khan is quite upset that if matters are reported she doesn’t feel she would be able to give her evidence as freely as she would have done otherwise,’ said Mr Gatland. ‘Culturally, it’s very difficult for them to say things in public. The evidence would be impacted on by the cultural background of Miss Khan.’ Cleared: Kashif Khan successfully argued he did not know what was going on . Judge Hughes accepted the argument and banned reporting of the case but then changed his mind after a two-day legal battle with the Mail. ‘We are dealing with members of the legal profession charged with perverting the course of justice,’ he said. ‘People of all faiths or no faiths should be treated in precisely the same way. We’re not dealing with discrimination against. We’re dealing with discrimination for.’ York Crown Court heard that in August 2010 Mohammed Khan was caught by a speed camera in Newcastle while driving daughter Asha’s silver BMW. When Miss Khan received the speeding notice, she claimed that the driver was David Moat, who worked for the family. Some months later, the day before Moat was due before magistrates, her brother faxed the court a letter on Moat’s behalf, saying he wanted to plead guilty by post. Moat was fined £100 with £30 costs and six penalty points for the speeding offence. Prosecutor Jacob Dyer said: ‘There is no dispute in this case that the man actually driving the car was Kashif Khan’s father. ‘It was hoped by supplying the false details that the trail would be lost and the fixed penalty unit would eventually take no further action. But the suspicions of the unit were aroused.’ Kashif Khan successfully argued he did not realise what was going on and had only been trying to help Moat by filling in the form using information provided by him. ‘It was horrible,’ he said. ‘All my life I have worked so hard and told the truth.’ The Khans work for KK Solicitors in Newcastle and live in the city. Asha Khan, a trainee at the firm, will be sentenced in the New Year, with her father and Moat, who both admitted their part in the plot.","Reporting the case of Asha Khan, 30, and Kashif Khan, 34, was banned .

At the moment, I am in my ‘house’ alone but I could get a ‘cellie’ or cellmate in the morning. Oh yes, I am now down with the jailhouse slang. So how did I get here? Let’s rewind a few hours. I am happily chuffing along Santa Monica Boulevard, singing along to my  iPod, when I hear the dreaded sound of a police siren. I had been travelling at 20mph, so I was not worried. The policeman (cute) appears at my window. Licence and registration: the usual drill. He saunters off back to his car to run my driver’s licence through his computer. I am in a rush, so I am feeling  irritated. Eventually, he strolls back to my window. Officer Handsome invites me to sit in the back of his police cruiser. Clearly, he has me confused with someone else. He then wanders off, muttering into his shoulder walkie-talkie thing. Royal connection: Emma Parker Bowles (left) with her aunt Camilla The Duchess of Cornwall (centre), and her cousin Laura Lopes (right) Camilla's daughter . One of his cop buddies arrives and they chat for a while, staring at me. He saunters back. ‘Step out the car, Madam.’ Finally, I am on my way. Umm, perhaps not. ‘Turn round and face the car. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . . . ’ he says as he snaps handcuffs around my wrists. I’m outraged. What am I being taken into custody for? Apparently, there is a $40,000 (about £26,000) warrant out for my arrest. I was pulled over because my registration had expired and the warrant was issued because I forgot to go to court for a traffic violation. It seems excessive for a traffic violation. During the ride to the police station, I go from furious (‘I want your badge number. I am going to sue everyone’) to panicked (‘Am I going to have a criminal record?’) to crying because I am frightened they are going to make me bend over and cough. The car and bike enthusiast, pictured at a secret location for a private viewing of the Jaguar XKR, was 'outraged' at the ordeal in police cells . The cop says I will be in front of the judge tomorrow and then I’ll be able to go home. We drive into the back area of the jail, where I am marched in and ‘processed’. This includes an extremely intimate pat-down by  a cross female officer. I don’t know how Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton look pretty in their mugshots; I look like serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Whereas they can afford to bail themselves out immediately, I don’t have a spare $5,000 (about £3,200). It is then I am told that there is  no court the next day because of budget cuts. So I will be held until Friday morning, 48 hours away. I have one phone call but it can only be to a landline number. How many landline numbers do you know? I can call my mum, but  waking her in the middle of the night from the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department would not look good. I spend one long, lonely,  soul-cold night curled up on a thin mattress with no pillow. I cry myself to sleep and at some point am woken by a scary-looking man in an orange jumpsuit (on ‘work release’ from jail) who brings me  a plastic bag with some bread,  peanut butter and an apple. Hours later, a very nice female officer tells me there is court after all, handcuffs me again and escorts me to the big yellow jailhouse bus, which is stuffed with people from county jail (real criminals). It is just like you see in films. There is even rap music playing, and there is a cage situation at the back with all of the male prisoners, who shout lewd remarks. The next eight hours are spent in a shared cell underneath the courthouse. Even worse than people using the loo – plonked in the corner in a tiny, windowless cell –  (I daren’t gag in case I get beaten up) is feeling so cold. Zero tolerance: A police officer on patrol in Los Angeles . Remembering that you lose a  high percentage of body heat from your head, I am so desperate I wrap mine up in loo roll, like a mummy, with a small slit for my eyes. Another prisoner I’ve become friendly with does the same, except for some reason she only leaves a slit for her mouth. We both laugh our heads off for the next five minutes, rolling around on the concrete bench. A moment of light relief. Finally, eight hours later, I get to speak to the public defender. When she looks at my charge sheet, she seems surprised that I have been locked up. And, after another hour handcuffed in the corner of the courtroom, so does the judge. He dismisses the charges and I don’t even have to pay court costs because of ‘time served’. I am escorted back into a cell in the basement and endure another long wait until I am ‘processed out’ and given a plastic bag with my personal items. My new friend is going back to the county jail because she really is a criminal. ‘I am going to laugh if I see  you back here again,’ is a female officer’s parting shot before I am released from the bowels of the courthouse into the evening sunshine. Charming. Next time you are pulled over for a minor traffic violation, thank your lucky stars you live in Britain. Don’t get me wrong, I love living in the US – I just don’t love its  legal system. Even though I can now look back on the experience and laugh, I  have definitely been traumatised by it. Nowadays, if I even see a police car, I feel as if I am going to have a panic attack. It makes me long for British bobbies.","Emma Parker Bowles was 'outraged' she had to spend a night in a U.S. jail .

"This is the horrifying moment a wealthy legal highs seller wheeled a drugged 22-year-old to a hotel room to rape her. Lloyd Phillips had told the woman he would take her to a pop concert at Wembley Stadium. Instead, he plied her with a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, leaving her barely conscious. Scroll down for video . Moment the abuse began: Lloyd Phillips, 48, drugged the 22-year-old and put her into a wheelchair before raping her at a hotel near Wembley Stadium - he is now beginning an 11-year jail term . The married 48-year-old then took her to a hotel, telling staff he needed a wheelchair for his ‘drunk and disabled girlfriend’. CCTV . images show him pushing his helpless victim through the building. Once . inside the hotel room, he raped her for nine hours – leaving her with . horrific injuries. Phillips, . who made £10,000 a week selling legal highs, drug paraphernalia and . event tickets at his shop, Lucid, in Southampton, was jailed for 11 . years. Depraved attack: Phillips, from Southampton, had told his victim they were going to a concert . Police described . him as a ‘sexual predator’ who tried to impress women by ‘flashing . cash’ and bragging of his luxury Sunseeker yacht. And . they fear it is ‘highly likely’ he attacked many others in a similar . manner, luring them with the promise of concert tickets. After his sentencing, his victim said: ‘He is a vile human being. I hope he dies in prison so he cannot hurt anyone else.’ A . court heard how Phillips, who lived in a luxury £250,000 Southampton . apartment with his wife, had picked the young woman up from her home in . the city to travel to a concert given by The Saturdays band. Once in the car he gave her a capsule and a can of ‘Crunk juce’ – an American, high-alcohol energy drink – to wash it down. The capsule was later found to be the class C substance BZP, a stimulant that can trigger epileptic seizures and fits. The drugs left the woman with little memory of the car journey to the hotel near Wembley Stadium. They caused her to suffer seizures and she had no sense of her surroundings as Phillips pulled up at the hotel. The CCTV footage shows Phillips wheeling her towards a lift and then to the room where he carried out the nine-hour assault. Many . of the details of what he did to her while she was incapacitated – and . the injuries she suffered – are too horrific to report. Phillips told staff at the hotel that his 'girlfriend' was drunk and disabled before he borrowed a wheelchair . Aside . from a brief memory of a clock that read ‘3.48’ and a feeling that she . was ‘contorted’ the woman, who had regarded Phillips as a friend, had no . memory of what happened, Harrow Crown Court heard. She woke confused, with Phillips telling her they had engaged in a night of consensual sex, the jury was told. On the way home, he told her he was glad she did not ‘feel weird’ about it, adding that some girls ‘might cry rape’. Speaking after the case, she said: ‘I started to come round the following morning and had no idea what had happened.’ She recalled how she felt ‘sick and confused’ as she sat in the passenger seat of his car on the way home. Sick: The businessman is seen wheeling the empty wheelchair towards his car in the hotel car park . Phillips is seen in this CCTV still wheeling his unconscious victim towards the hotel reception . Later she went to hospital where doctors called police. ‘I just felt like it was my fault, that I was stupid to have let myself get into that situation. I blamed myself,’ she said. Phillips was convicted of two counts of rape and four sexual assault charges. His . victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, collapsed in court while . giving her evidence and still suffers from nightmares . She said: ‘I would urge anyone in my situation to be brave, come forward and speak out.’ Superintendent Stuart Murray said the crime was a ‘cruel and cynical abuse’ of the victim’s trust. He . added: ‘[Phillips] used his shop and concert ticket business to . befriend young people, often at vulnerable times in their lives … The . level of planning involved, his behaviour towards his victim and his . casual demeanour afterwards lead us to believe he has done this before.’ Jailed: Phillips is now serving 11 years, while his Southampton 'head' shop is under new management . The shop owned by rapist Lloyd Phillips was one of hundreds of similar outlets which have sprung up on high streets in recent years. And there are around 690 online sellers of legal high drugs based in in Britain. They package the drugs as research chemicals, plant food or bath salts – and label them as ‘not for human consumption’ – leaving councils and the police powerless to stop them selling the often harmful substances. When Phillips was questioned by local press in 2010 about the potentially lethal drugs he said: ‘Do I feel bad about selling legal products to adults? ‘No, no more than I would selling cream cakes or pies to a fat person, selling alcohol to an alcoholic, selling cigs to someone with cancer.’","Lloyd Phillips, 48, of Southampton, assaulted his 22-year-old victim in hotel .

"Predator: Shane Webber was jailed for preying on two girls just days after his release from prison for a harassment campaign against his ex-girlfriend . An internet stalker jailed for harassing his girlfriend was behind bars again yesterday after preying on two schoolgirls within days of his release. Shane Webber had subjected his childhood sweetheart Ruth Jeffery to a humiliating three-year trolling campaign, using social networking sites to send naked pictures  of her to her friends and family, including her horrified parents. The twisted 23-year-old consoled his girlfriend in person while torturing her online, which included assuming her identity on adult websites and inviting men to knock on her front door and ask for sex. He was jailed for four months last November when his ‘vile and malicious’ hate campaign was eventually exposed. But within days of his release in January, Webber committed a series of online sexual offences against two 15-year-old girls. Miss Jeffery, who became suicidal during her ordeal, was in court yesterday to hear how her former boyfriend tried to entice the girls to strip and perform sexual acts for him, and sent one of them a video of him and Miss Jeffery having sex. After he persuaded one of the girls to run away to meet him, Webber was arrested, although he claimed they had not been intimate. Nottingham Crown Court heard how Webber contacted the girls using MSN Messenger in January, only eight days after being released from prison, and performed depraved acts while they watched. Yesterday, unemployed Webber, from Nottingham, admitted causing or inciting a female under 16 to engage in sexual activity, one count of making indecent photos and two counts of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child. After Webber was jailed for three . years, Miss Jeffery, 23, said she was ‘revolted’ to hear he still had a . video of her. She added: ‘He was asked to get rid of all images of me. I . was revolted when I discovered he hadn’t. I felt physically sick.’ 'Manipulation and deceit': Jailing Webber at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Michael Stokes, QC, told him that the courts have a duty to protect vulnerable youngsters from exploitation . Sickened: Ruth Jeffery, Webber's ex-girlfriend, leaves court after his sentencing. She was driven to the brink of suicide after he posted sexually explicit pictures of her online and impersonated her on dating websites . Sentencing Webber, Judge Michael Stokes QC said he had used ‘a high degree of manipulation and deceit’. Miss Jeffery met Webber when they . were 11 at school together in Nottingham. He began his campaign of abuse . by setting up fake email addresses to pose as former school friends, . which he used to send sexually explicit photos and videos to Miss . Jeffery. He then began distributing photos of . her – some of which were taken after bursting in on her while she was in . the shower – on adult websites and to family and friends using social . networking websites. Betrayal: After his original conviction, Webber was supposed to have deleted all the sexual photos of Miss Jeffery he had in his possession, but he kept some on an external hard drive . 'I don't forgive him': Miss Jeffery said she had attended court to see Webber's trial because she wanted to her for herself just what he had done just days after his release for harassing her . Outside court, Miss Jeffery said: ‘I . could not believe that he had offended again. I was shaking. The fact it . happened almost as soon as he came out of prison made it even worse. ‘It was not nice seeing him again and I did not think I would ever have to. But I wanted to hear for myself what had happened.’ Miss Jeffery, a student, said that . she was pleased with the sentence. ‘I don’t feel anything towards him, . but I don’t forgive him,’ she added. The grandfather of one of  Webber’s . latest victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said:  ‘He is . proof that a leopard cannot change its spots. ‘When he comes out of prison for . these offences, I would not expect anything different. He is very . devious and has blown our family apart.’ Sweethearts: Webber and Miss Jeffery met when . they were just 11 and at school together in Nottingham. Their relationship turned sour after she became . pregnant by him and decided to have an abortion .","Shane Webber had been out of prison just 10 days before he struck again .

"Battered: Ian McCann, 83, who was repeatedly hit with a hammer by the intruder who burst into his home in Northampton . An 83-year-old army veteran was repeatedly hit in the face with a hammer by a masked robber who broke into his home. Ian McCann was also tied up with telephone cord by the intruder who threatened to murder his pet chihuahua dog Double if it did not stop barking. The grandfather-of-two was preparing breakfast when the robber, wearing a balaclava, burst in through the back door of his home in Northampton. When Mr McCann went to investigate he was confronted by the man who pushed him onto the sofa before ripping the telephone off the wall and using the cord to bind his hands together. He then demanded money for drugs - and hit him over the head repeatedly with a hammer when he refused. Mr McCann was struck dozens of times in the face during the attack on Sunday morning which lasted up to an hour. The robber stole £60 in cash from the pensioner's wallet, took his debit card and demanded the pin number. He put two cushions over the old man's face and ran out of the terraced house through the back door. Despite being battered Mr McCann, a divorcee who has two grown-up daughters, managed to get his hands free and knocked on his neighbour’s door. The retired laboratory assistant, who is secretary of his local residents’ association, suffered severe bruising which covers half his face and neck. Today he allowed pictures of his horrific injuries to be released in a bid to catch the vicious attacker. The grandfather, who served in Hong Kong in 1949 and 1950 as part of his National Service, said: 'I heard a crash and went I went into the kitchen he was standing there. Raider: The intruder threatened to murder Mr McCann's pet dog Double during the attack. The pensioner has gone public in the hope that the attacker will be caught as a result . Break in: The intruder smashed the back door of Mr McCann's home last Sunday morning . 'He wanted money for drugs but when I didn’t give it to him he grabbed me and dragged me into the living room and threw me onto the sofa. 'He kept shouting at me ""give me the money, give me the money"". I told him ""no I will not"". I was angry someone had broken into my home and I was prepared to put up a fight. 'Then he went really mad and ripped out the telephone so I couldn’t use it and tied my hands up behind my back. 'He wanted the pin number for the debit card and I gave him the wrong one, he kept hitting me over the head, he gave me a real shiner. 'He could have easily killed me with the hammer. I lost count of how many times he hit me. It was dozens. 'The whole thing lasted between 40 minutes to an hour. 'I was taken to Northampton General Hospital and had an X-ray to check for any broken bones but I didn’t have any. 'I am not going to let this get to me, he needs to be caught and put away for the maximum 14 years. 'The neighbours have been really shocked as this doesn’t happen around here. 'If this maniac is not caught soon he will do it again and the next time his victim might not be as lucky as me.'

"A three-year-old was caught shoplifting Christmas presents with two children aged 10, police have revealed. They were with two other children, both under 10, who were caught stealing from Boots in Wallington, south west London. They were all too young to be prosecuted. Shocking: The three-year-old was caught shoplifting with two other 10-year-olds and two adults (file image) Statistics, revealed in response to a Freedom of Information request, show in the last three years there have been more than 60 crimes in the London borough of Sutton where a child under 10-years-old is believed to have been responsible. One incident involved three children, including a three-year-old, who were caught stealing Christmas gifts in Boots in Wallington in 2012. The children entered the shop with a man and woman and were spotted loading items into a bag before leaving the shop and getting into a car. No one was prosecuted. Children under 10-years-old are below the age of criminal responsibility meaning they cannot be charged with crimes. Campaigners have said they now want children to be educated about the consequences of crime in primary school. Theft: The children were caught stealing Christmas presents from Boots in Wallington, south London . In another incident, in a park near . Wrythe Lane, Carshalton, last year, a gang including a 10-year-old boy . attacked a man and stole his phone. Three of the group, one aged 14 and . two 17-year-olds were charged with actual bodily harm (ABH) but the . 10-year-old could not be prosecuted. Other . incidents include a child aged five vandalising a car, a seven-year-old . and a nine-year-old being involved in a burglary , a nine-year-old . being accused of racially aggravated harassment and an eight year old . being accused of ABH. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the age of criminal responsibility is 10 years old. This is the age when the legal system believes a child is responsible for the consequences of a crime. At 10-years-old the age is the lowest in the EU, and well below the international average. This has caused controversy as some argue that a 10-year-old cannot be responsible for his or her own actions. Some also say that it does not make sense related to other legislation. For example, the age of sexual consent is 16, and children cannot even buy a pet until they are 12. Other countries opt for a more lenient age of responsibility. Under Scotland’s legal system children below the age of 12 cannot be prosecuted. In Nordic countries crimes committed by under 15s are considered t be a symptom of the child’s development. The murder of two-year-old James Bulger caused outrage as his murderers were just ten years old. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson had missed school and actively planned to abduct a child and kill him. Because of the nature of their crime, the decision was made that they should be tried in the adult court, in the full glare of the media and public. The incident shocked the public, and is often used as an example of why the English age of responsibility is low. Police are unable to charge under-10s with crimes but can impose a curfew or put the child under the supervision of a youth offending team. Children who break the law regularly can be placed into care through the council. Sutton parents Ray and Vi Donovan founded the Chris Donovan Trust after their son, Chris, was killed by a gang of teens in 2001. Now they travel the country working with young offenders. Mr Donovan said: 'We want to get victim awareness put on the school curriculum. 'It’s about explaining to children that their actions have consequences - we call it the ripple effect where the consequences of their actions ripple out and affect the whole community. 'There is also a problem with parents. In some cases parents are trying too hard to be their children’s mates and going out drinking with them and things like that. 'They aren’t our friends, they’re our children - there’s more to being a parent than being their friend.' He also warned sometimes children were forced into offending by teenagers or adults because they could not be prosecuted. A police spokesman said: 'We were the first borough in London to run Police Academies - after school clubs where primary school pupils can work with police to understand how officers work in local communities. 'Officers also give regular talks in schools to pupils of different ages about personal safety. These talks and presentations range from stranger danger and dialling 999 through to drugs advice and about keeping safe on the internet.' David Tucker, Associate head of policy at the NSPCC said: 'Children who are suspected of behaviour that would be criminal may be showing signs that raise concerns about their welfare and this may need to be investigated so that appropriate support can be put into place.'","Three-year-old was caught stealing Christmas gifts from Boots .

"Ice cool Tory MP Sajid Javid does not seem the romantic type. Number crunching is his skill. When his comprehensive school head tried to ban him from taking O-level maths, he kicked up a fuss – and passed with flying colours. It paid off. Javid made a pile in the City, quit by the time he was 40 and last year – just three years after entering the Commons – became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the most senior Minister outside the Cabinet. Sajid Javid, Tory's first British-Pakistani MP with his wife Laura, the childhood sweetheart who became his wife . His meteoric rise includes: . Ambitious Javid seems certain to win Cabinet promotion in the next reshuffle – with some tipping the  Conservatives’ first British-Pakistani MP as a future leader. But scratch the steely surface and there is a softer side to Bromsgrove MP Javid, 44, as he showed when he wooed wife and childhood sweetheart Laura as teenagers in Bristol. ‘I got a summer job at the local Commercial Union insurance company and she sat opposite. We shared a stapler. Love over a stapler!’ he laughs. ‘I was besotted. Every time I went to get the stapler I’d touch a finger, then another finger – and there was no objection – eventually I managed to ask her if she would come to the sandwich shop with me. I’ve never looked back.’ He travelled the globe, made his fortune and returned to marry his English rose Laura, his only serious girlfriend. There is an Old World courtliness about it. Javid worked for Chase Manhattan Bank in the US in the 1990s, the era of The Wolf Of Wall Street excesses, but there any resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio’s licentious Jordan Belfort ends – hardly surprising when Javid recalled his upbringing as we met at his Treasury office overlooking London’s St James’s Park. His dad, Abdul, came to Britain from Pakistan in 1961 with just £1 in his pocket and settled in Rochdale, where Javid, one of five brothers, was born. Abdul’s readiness to work all hours as a bus driver earned him the nickname ‘Mr Night and Day’. When Sajid was four, his dad took over a ladieswear shop in inner-city Bristol and the family moved into a two-bedroom flat above it. ‘Three brothers were in one bedroom and myself and a younger brother were with my parents in the other.’ Sajid David in his office alongside a picture of his political heroine Margaret Thatcher . They lived in Stapleton Road, described recently as ‘Britain’s worst street, a lawless hellhole where murder, rape, shootings, drug-pushing, prostitution, knifings and violent robbery are commonplace’. Javid remembers the 1980s riots in Bristol’s nearby St Paul’s district when he was ten. But decades later, as a newboy MP, he gave short shrift to an official from the homeless charity, Shelter, who complained about housing benefit cuts. ‘I said: “By your definition you’ve just told me I was homeless as a child. That wasn’t my experience.” It was a small home but we had a great family life with lots of love and affection.’ His comprehensive, Downend School on the outskirts of Bristol, was tough.  ‘I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework.’ Javid got into a fight with a racist pupil who called him ‘Paki’. The boy was expelled, but it had a happy ending ten years later. ‘I bumped into him in a shopping centre lift. He said: “Sajid isn’t it? I’m sorry for what I did,” and we shook hands.’ Javid’s naughtiness ended abruptly when his dad read the riot act. ‘He said: “This is what I went through, don’t let me down.” I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed.’ Meanwhile, mum took her sons to the library and forced them to read. Javid left with Maths O-level, but had to fight for that, too. ‘Hardly anyone did Maths  O-level. The school said they would only pay for me to sit CSE [lower than O-level]. But I argued – and my dad paid £32 for me to do it – a lot in those days.’ He went on to get a degree in economics and politics. Unlike guilt-ridden Old Etonian David Cameron, who sends his children to state schools, ex comp boy Javid has no such hang ups. His four children, girls of five, ten and 14 and a boy of 12, go to private schools. ‘We do what’s best for them,’ he says, matter of factly. In pride of place in his office is a portrait of his heroine, Margaret Thatcher. He has been a fan since the precocious age of 11. ‘I instinctively thought, “I really admire this woman”. My dad lived through the winter of discontent and used to vote Labour, but switched to Thatcher, saying, “look how she’s sorting out the country”. I agreed.’ He sounds like a multi-cultural William Hague. ‘I’ve got the hair style!’ says Javid, who lost his hair in his 20s and wet shaves it, adding to his City slicker image. While other lads threw paper pellets at each other on the school bus, he grabbed a discarded copy of The Times, sat on his own and devoured news of Maggie’s latest triumph in the Falklands War or miners’ strike. He suffered more discrimination at his first interview for a City job, with venerable British merchant bank, Rothschild. ‘They were so stuck up. They invited me into a hotel room, six men in pinstripe suits up on a stage with me standing below. It was obvious I wouldn’t get the job. I didn’t fit.’ But he was perfect for Chase Manhattan who were ‘more interested in the hunger in my belly’. He was later head-hunted by Deutsche Bank, but refuses to comment on claims he made £20million in 15 years. He has the confidence – and prudence – of a self-made man. He drives a £35,000 Range Rover Evoque, though the West Midlands MP quickly adds it is to support the local Land Rover car company, and buys his suits ‘cheaply in Hong Kong or Birmingham’ not Jermyn Street. Javid and his wife live in a £4million home in Fulham, own a £2million house which is rented out in Chelsea, another in Bristol and a constituency residence. ‘I worked hard for 20 years, and was paid well and achieved things for me and my family,’ he says defiantly. He slammed the door in the face of Vince Cable’s proposed mansion tax with gusto. ‘We already have a tax on people’s properties called council tax and I don’t see a case for another one.’ Javid is proud of his Muslim background, but regards himself as British. Asked if he will observe Ramadan he hesitates before replying: ‘I’m not practising.’ Does he read the Koran? ‘No, but how many people call themselves Christian and visit a church? God and Allah are the same thing.’ He refuses to say if he has his eyes on No10, but does not see his Anglo-Asian roots as a bar. ‘Britain is the world’s most tolerant country.

"Ministers have been accused of risking child safety after leaked documents showed they are ‘scaling back’ efforts to fight pornography and poor parenting. Michael Gove’s Education Department spends £2.5 billion a year supporting young people and troubled families. But The Mail on Sunday has seen a top-level internal memo saying work on the internet safety initiative ‘can be scaled back’  just when it is developing plans championed by David Cameron. 'Scaling back': Ministers have been accused of risking child safety after leaked documents showed they were reducing efforts to fight pornography and poor parenting . Sources fear Ministers would halve the number of civil servants supporting the United Kingdom Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), the body set up to protect children from online pornography, bullying, grooming and violent video games. In December, Mr Cameron backed plans to protect children from harmful online content. Now UKCCIS insiders say cuts would send a ‘poor message’. One said: ‘There is no doubt this could impact child safety.The plans are costly, so internet providers will resist. Without staff we will no longer have the muscle to follow them through.’ Championed it: David Cameron (right) backed plans to protect children from harmful online content and Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg (left) said the leaked document exposed the truth . The leaked memo also suggests ‘radical’ reductions in parenting support programmes to help counter poor discipline, an issue linked to 2011’s riots. Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg said: ‘Mr Cameron promised robust child protection online and support for families but this document exposes the truth – Ministers are planning to scale back this work, despite all the Prime Minister’s promises.’ Department for Education sources said UKCCIS was still working on internet safety, but parts of the project had come to a natural conclusion. The Department refused to comment on the leak.","A leaked internal memo said the internet safety initiative could be 'scaled back'

"A mother of two was found beheaded at her home today after an apparent row with her estranged husband. The headless body of Judith Nibbs – who cared for the elderly and vulnerable – was discovered at their marital home after neighbours told police they were concerned for her welfare. Detectives who went to the property were greeted by horrific scenes in the blood-spattered flat, situated near the million-pound homes of the trendy Shoreditch area of London. Scroll down for video . Victim: The headless body of Judith Nibbs was today discovered at her home near Old Street, in Shoreditch, London . They found the 60-year-old victim had been decapitated, while her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs, 67, had apparently turned the knife on himself causing serious injuries. He is in a critical condition after being taken to hospital at 5am. Police are waiting to quiz him over the death. Mrs Nibbs, who lived on the Charles Square Estate in Shoreditch, had worked for Hackney Borough Council for six years providing meals on wheels for the elderly, in addition to caring for her disabled daughter. Neighbours today paid tribute to the devoted carer. Dean Cummings, 28, who has lived on the estate since he was born, said: ‘I’ve known her all my life. She was a nice lady and didn’t have a bad word to say about anybody. ‘She was always happy with a smile on her face. She had a disabled daughter and an older son who’s about 25. ‘She worked for her kids. The daughter’s in a home. Who’s going to bankroll that now? It’s just so sad. I’ve never seen her with a partner.’ Crime scene: Detectives who were called to the flat were confronted with horrific scenes, with blood splattered across the property . Horror: Ms Nibbs, 60, was found decapitated inside the home she once shared with her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs. He was found to have turned the knife on himself causing himself serious injuries . Suspect: Mr Nibbs, 67, is in a critical condition in hospital. Police officers are waiting to question him in connection with the horrific murder . Andrew Pemberton, 42, who lives in the same block as the low rise apartment block, said: ‘I think she worked for Hackney Council meals on wheels. I used to see her going to work in a high-visibility vest. ‘It’s just terrible on your own doorstep. She has a son and a daughter but didn’t have a partner as far as I knew.’ Detectives were today seen searching bins surrounding her ground floor flat looking for the weapon. Investigation: A police spokesman said detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident . One man, who lives next door to the woman and her 29-year-old son, said he was woken at about 4.30am by police shouting. The 27-year-old man who wanted only to be known as Cihan, said: ‘They were banging on my door and jumping on the bins to get over the back garden. ‘They just said a “serious incident” was going on. She kept herself to herself and hardly seemed to go out.’ No arrests have been made, but police said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation. Next of kin have been informed, but the woman has not been formally identified. A post-mortem examination is expected to take place early next week. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A murder investigation has been launched in Hackney. ‘Police were called by paramedics at around 5am to Charles Square Estate following concerns for the welfare of a resident. ‘Officers attended and found a 60-year-old woman deceased at the location. ‘Formal identification is yet to take place. Next of kin have been informed. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. ‘A 67-year-old man was taken by ambulance to an east London hospital where he remains in a critical condition. ‘There have been no arrests. Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.’ Cordon: Police officers erected a cordon around Vince Court in Brunswick Place, Old Street where the headless body of Judith Nibbs was discovered. Forensic officers scoured the scene for evidence .

"British teenagers are falling behind those in high-performing East Asian countries because too many parents in the UK believe that ability is inherited rather than the result of hard work, an expert warned yesterday. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to publishing giant Pearson, suggested that higher expectations from ‘tiger parents’ in the UK could boost school performance. ‘In the Pacific Asian cultures, there is a strong belief that effort will be rewarded,’ said Sir Michael, who advised Tony Blair on education and policy delivery. Sir Michael Barber has warned British teenagers are falling behind in class and believes higher expectations from parents could boost performance in UK schools (picture posed by model) ‘If you try harder, work harder, you’ll achieve higher standards, whereas in Britain and America, particularly, there is a perception that you are born either bright and the education system pulls that through, or doesn’t. That has a big impact on attitudes.’ His remarks raise the prospect of a rise in ‘tiger mothers’ such as Amy Chua, who described how she chivvied her two daughters to academic success Chinese-style in a best-selling book which provoked fierce debate in Britain. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, published in 2011, was described by the US law professor, whose  parents were ‘very strict, Chinese immigrant parents’ as ‘the story  of my family’s journey in  two cultures’. Sir Michael made his remarks as the UK came sixth in an international league table of education systems, behind South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. He said parental expectation in those Asian countries was ‘very high’, with mothers and fathers spending ‘long evenings’ helping their children with homework. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to publishing giant Pearson, suggested that higher expectations from 'tiger parents' in the UK could boost school performance . ‘There is a contrast between those attitudes and here, where some parents don’t exert that kind of pressure for achievement, don’t expect effort to be rewarded and do think that either their child is really clever or isn’t – and sometimes reinforce that in a way that is unhelpful,’ he added. ‘Overall, there is a contrast that is deeply embedded in cultures. ‘The rise of Pacific Asian countries, which combine effective  education systems with a culture that prizes effort above inherited “smartness”, is a phenomenon  that other countries can no  longer ignore.’ Britain’s position in the latest Global Index of Cognitive Skills and Attainment, published by Pearson and compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, remains unchanged since the rankings were last produced, in 2012. East Asian countries tightened their grip at the top of the table featuring 39 nations, while Finland slipped to fifth. A report accompanying the index found that ‘parental expectations have a measurable impact on student motivation’. Sir Michael said the message needed to be ‘spelled out’ that there were risks associated with failing to gain a good education. He added: ‘Changing culture is  an extremely difficult thing  to attempt. ‘It is something that everybody involved in education needs to  contribute to – it’s not a job just  for government. ‘The way schools relate to  parents about their individual child is really important. That’s an area where you can significantly change culture. ‘But in the end, it is about  communicating with people about how different the 21st century  is going to be from when they went to school.’","Sir Michael Barber has warned British teenagers are falling behind in class .

"Michael Matthews was left unconscious, had a caved-in eye socket and had a bruised eyeball following the terrifying assault . A man was beaten so badly he needed four metal plates to hold his face together - and all because he asked his neighbours to stop their dog from barking. Michael Matthews, 48, from Gloucester, was left unconscious with a caved-in eye socket and a bruised eyeball following the terrifying assault. He was repeatedly kicked in the head by three teenage yobs after he had visited his neighbours to ask them to keep a noisy dog quiet, which had barked relentlessly for 12 hours. But this week, the trio were jailed for a year each for the assault after a hearing at Gloucester Crown Court. Mr Matthews said: 'The dog had been barking for hours, and we were desperate for a bit of peace. 'I went round to ask them nicely if they could stop the dog from barking. 'From out of nowhere, they were next to me. My girlfriend said they kicked me when I was on the floor at least 30 times. 'I’m just glad it’s all over now, it’s been a long two years. They never showed any remorse, contrition or shame - it was a pack mentality. 'The lads tried to claim that the damage they’d done to me was from one punch, which is just ludicrous. If that’s the case then they must be related to Mike Tyson.' He was greeted at the door by Rhys Roberts, 20, Lewis Knight, 19 and Scott Fry, 21, who were visiting a friend. The three, all in their teens when the . attack happened, then crept up on Michael as he returned to his house . and furiously assaulted him, throwing him to the ground and kicking him . in the head. The victim needed four metal plates in . his face to help rebuild a caved-in eye socket, had a bruised eyeball . and suffered two broken fingers. Michael was repeatedly kicked in the head by three teens after he had visited his neighbours to ask them to keep a noisy dog quiet . The assault happened in April 2011 and . Michael and partner of nine years, Julie Tripcony, have lived in fear . over the past two years. Mr Matthews, a carpenter, had . delivered a note the week before after the noise of a dog barking had . kept him and Julie awake for weeks. He said: 'It still hurts like hell now, especially when it’s cold. It’s like someone pushing on my face all day. 'I could never have imagined that going to their house could have ended up with something like this. 'I’d popped a note through their door a few weeks before as this dog was barking 12 hours, day and night - we couldn’t sleep. 'But when I went to the house and . three men who didn’t live there answered the door, I suddenly felt . pretty scared. But I asked could they please keep the noise down and . then left. 'I knew going round wouldn’t make much difference, but what happened next will stay with me for a good few years. Jailed: Scott Fry . Thug: Rhys Roberts . Guilty: Lewis Knight . 'Next thing I knew I was on the . ground, covered in blood. I didn’t think I was unconscious, but I . must’ve been knocked out. I staggered back to my house after people . helped pick me up. 'I’m a big bloke and I played rugby . for years, so I’ve had my fair share of cuts and bruises. But they . knocked me down and just kicked away from what I’ve been told. 'The surgeon was convinced that I was hit with something, a weapon or a ring or something - that’s why there was so much blood. 'My cheekbone and eye socket were compressed down into my face. My nosed had to be wired to my cheekbone there was so little left there and the four metal plates hold it together. 'It was two weeks before the surgeons could even start on my face, but the job they did - I’m so grateful.' Partner Julie, a nanny, saw the whole attack and had to put aside her terror to help Michael. Michael and Julie have been left traumatised by the horrific beating, which happened in their street . Ms Tripcony said: 'It was horrendous what I saw - I honestly thought Michael was going to die as they kicked away at him. 'I still look at Michael and I’m stunned that a human being can take that sort of beating. 'When I grabbed one of them to try and make them stop, I thought he was going to go for me. But he went back and just kept on kicking away. 'It’s been a nightmare. I don’t think it’s all over and I hoped they would be out our lives for longer. 'Just from the sheer amount of blood that Michael was covered in, and lost, it covered our house. We had to redecorate our hall and throw out the sofa. 'It’s almost as if it still haunts us - it’s like a horror film. I’ve had counselling and thank God Michael has fully recovered. 'But you can’t behave like this and get away with it - and it feels like that’s happened a little bit. 'People need to know that a punishment fits a crime. And I want them to see what they’ve done.' Mr Matthews has been forced to take a lot of time off work since the assault. Gloucester Crown Court was shown graphic pictures of blood on the doorstep and spattered up a window where the attack happened during the case. Roberts was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm at trial earlier this year. Both Knight and Fry admitted the same charge after three trials in total.","Michael Matthews was left unconscious with a caved-in eye socket and a bruised eyeball .

"Nick Griffin: The BNP leader has said people have the 'right to discriminate' after he put the address of a gay couple who won a landmark court ruling onTwitter . BNP leader Nick Griffin faced calls for his arrest yesterday after he urged a mob to protest outside the home of a gay couple who had won a landmark court case. The far-Right politician called for his followers to descend on the home of Michael Black and John Morgan after they won damages from a Christian B&B owner for discrimination. Mr Griffin took to Twitter to ask for the address of the ‘two bullying “gay” activists’ so he could arrange a demonstration about homeowners being able to ‘rent rooms to whomsoever they wish’. After he was given their address, Mr . Griffin threatened the couple that a ‘British Justice team’ would be . coming to ‘give you a... bit of a drama’. The tweets provoked widespread criticism and gay rights campaigners called for police to look into the matter. Mr Black and Mr Morgan, who won their . civil case against Susanne Wilkinson on Thursday, also revealed that . they had contacted the police. Officers are now investigating their . complaints and keeping watch on the couple’s home. Police are checking whether Mr Griffin’s comments breached the Communications Act or were an incitement to hatred. Mr Black, 64, and Mr Morgan, 59, who . live near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, were awarded £1,800 each at . Reading County Court for injury to their feelings after they had booked a . double room at a B&B in Cookham, Berkshire, but were not allowed to . use it by Christian Mrs Wilkinson. Probe: The police are investigating British National Party leader Nick Griffin after tweets were posted about a gay couple who yesterday won a case against a Berkshire B&B who refused to let them share a room . Case: Gay couple Michael Black, 62 and John Morgan, 56, from Brampton, Cambridgeshire, pictured after their court victory yesterday, had their address posted online . Recorder Claire Moulder ruled that by . turning away the couple, she had ‘treated them less favourably than she . would treat unmarried heterosexual couples’. Mrs Wilkinson, who had previously stopped unmarried couples from sharing a bed, is considering an appeal. Shortly afterwards, Mr Griffin . tweeted: ‘We’ll hold a demo – for rights of all home owners, gays . included, to rent or not rent rooms to whomsoever they wish.’ Controversial: The series of tweets led to the police being called - pictured in ascending order . A later tweet threatened: ‘So Messrs . Black & Morgan, at [address] a British Justice team will come up to . Huntington [sic] & give you a ... bit of a drama by way of reminding . you that an English couple’s home is their castle. Say No to . heterophobia!’ Mr Griffin, an MEP for the North West region, yesterday claimed it was the public’s ‘right to discriminate’. He told BBC Radio Five Live: ‘I was elected to speak up for the silent majority and that is what I am doing.’ Disagreement: Christians Susanne and Mike . Wilkinson refused to let gay couple Michael Black and John Morgan share a . room at their B&B . He added: ‘I didn’t tweet their full address, I tweeted a part of it. People have the right to discriminate.’ The use of the word ‘drama’ referred to the fact the men are involved in amateur dramatics, said Mr Griffin. Mr Morgan, a computer consultant, . described the tweets as ‘astonishing’. He said: ‘We are talking to . police about prosecuting Mr Griffin. ‘Uncomfortable is probably the best word to describe how we feel about Mr Griffin’s threats.’ Scene: The Swiss Bed & Breakfast property in Cookham, owned by Mr & Mrs Wilkinson, that was caught up in the discrimination row .

"International gran of mystery: Doris Payne has had an international criminal career spanning six decades, but now faces two years jail for her latest scam . When the sweet octogenarian African American lady walked into El Paseo Jewellers in Palm Desert, California, last October, staff were delighted. White-haired and petite, not in the best of health but articulate and elegantly turned out, she told them she had just had a $25,000 insurance payout and wanted to spend the cash on a present for herself. Salespeople fussed around her with typical Californian courtesy, helping her try on gem-encrusted necklaces and rings and, when her hip began playing up, finding her a chair to rest her legs. After making arrangements to complete her purchase of a diamond and white gold pinkie ring the next day, they helped her hobble to the door. What staff did not realise was that the $22,500 the ring was still on her finger. 'Diamond' Doris Payne, the world's most unlikely international jewel thief, had struck again. Within minutes she had sold on the ring for a mere $800 at a nearby pawnshop. Unfortunately for Doris, authorities are now so familiar with her history that they were quick to catch her. The 83-year-old has gained infamy for a six-decade criminal career during which she has travelled the world to swipe millions of dollars worth of jewels by making staff 'forget' she was carrying them. Over time, she has been connected to 20 aliases, nine dates of birth, and five Social Security numbers, but is nevertheless so brazen about her crimes that she once gave her occupation as 'jewel thief' in court papers. But the international lifestyle has come at a heavy price for the cunning coal-miner's daughter: she has an Interpol file dating back to the 1970s, a U.S. criminal record 20 pages long and has served a string of jail terms. She had been free for only three months before pulling off her latest scam. El Paseo Jewelry in Palm Desert, California: Doris had told staff at the shop she had a $25,000 dollar insurance payout to spend and got them to help her try on a range of rings and necklaces . So notorious is Doris, she has even been the subject of a documentary, The Life And Crimes Of Doris Payne, and it is rumoured that a biopic is in the works with Academy Award winner Halle Berry cast in the starring role. Born to a coal mining father and a seamstress mother in the remote and impoverished town of Slab Fork, West Virginia, in 1930, Doris Marie Payne was the youngest of six children. A ring like the one Doris stole from El Paseo: So caught up were workers in making sure she was properly looked after, they didn't realise she had it on . Although a family move to Cleveland, Ohio, when broadened her horizons somewhat as a teenager, she still faced the injustice and suppression that was the lot of many black women in those days of American history. Kirk Marcolina, producer of The Life And Crimes Of Doris Payne, told the Daily Mirror's Rachael Bletchly: 'She always wanted to become a ballerina but one day somebody told her she couldn't - there were no black ballerinas. 'She realised she had to find another way of getting out of that small town and seeing the world. Stealing jewels eventually became the way she did it.' In the documentary, Doris revealed how . she first learned her trademark distraction trick as a teenager when a . store clerk eagerly ditched her when a white customer came in. She . walked to the door, a small gold watch still clasped around her wrist. Although she gave it back that time, she realised how easy it would have . been to walk away with the prize. From . there, she worked her way up from bargain jewellery to some of the most . expensive stores across the globe, hitting targets as far afield as . Britain, France, Italy, Monaco and even Japan. Well known to police: So notorious is Doris she has even been the subject of a documentary, The Life And Crimes Of Doris Payne, and it is rumoured a biopic is in the works starring Oscar-winner Halle Berry . 'There’s never been a day that I went to steal that I did not get what I went to do,' she said in the documentary. 'I don’t have any regrets about stealing jewelry. I regret getting caught.' That sentiment proves problematic for judges faced with the elderly offender. In 2010, she asked one to be lenient because she was 'truly sorry that this went on as long as it did,' but that wasn't enough. 'You . won't stop,' Judge Frank Brown said at the time, explaining his . decision to sentence her to five years which was at the high end of the . possible verdicts. 'That’s the problem here... She’s a thief. She’s charming. Santa Claus’s wife, that’s who she is.' All a ruse: Over time, she has been connected to 20 aliases, nine dates of birth, and five Social Security numbers (Payne pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom in 2005) After . that punitive sentence, Doris vowed to leave her life of crime. But . today she is back behind bars, facing two years inside and a further two . years probation. 'The . judge tempered punishment with compassion about her age,' her attorney . attorney Gretchen von Helms told the LA Times last week. 'He . took into account the taxpayers' pocketbook. And do we really need to . incarcerate a non-violent offender - yes, a repeat offender, that's true . - who's ill, who has emphysema, who's elderly?'","Doris Payne is infamous for a six-decade career swiping precious gems .

"To his 'parishioners' George Gordon appeared a genuine man of the cloth. Calling himself 'The Reverend', he wore a dog collar and boasted of Cambridge University degrees. The 52-year-old claimed he suffered from manic depression and cancer, and volunteered to help charities for victims of mental health problems. In reality, he was a serial conman and . convicted fraudster, who bought his clerical title online and was only . dedicated to helping himself. Fake vicar George Gordon was sentenced to five years jail after . being found guilty of nine counts of obtaining money by deception and 11 counts of fraud . Over a period of almost three years, . he used the name of genuine charities and set up several bogus groups to . apply for £90,000 in European grants, meant for some of the most . vulnerable people on Merseyside. He falsified signatures, set up bank accounts and sent bogus emails, before siphoning off the cash into his own account. The jobless conman, who lived on . benefits, blew the money on high living and buying his own apartment, . before his scam was uncovered in June 2008. After being interviewed by police, he went on the run for almost three years until he was tracked down. Police discovered he had never . studied at university or qualified as a vicar. Instead he had acquired . his clerical title for free on an internet site based in the America, . called the Universal Life Church Monastery. Yesterday Gordon, from Liverpool, was . jailed for five years after pleading guilty to nine counts of obtaining . money by deception and 11 counts of fraud. Six other charges were . ordered to lie on file. George Gordon arrives at Liverpool Crown Court accused of pocketing thousands of pounds by accessing European grant funding meant to help victims of mental illness, depression and sexual abuse . Judge Stephen Everett told him his 'disgusting behaviour' undermined the good work of genuine charities. He added: 'The counts relate to a callous set of offences of dishonesty, the audacity of which genuinely takes the breath away.' Liverpool Crown Court heard Gordon, whose previous convictions for theft and fraud date as far as 1988, started his latest scam less than four years after being released from a four year jail term for an almost identical offence. The court heard he applied for grants from the Merseyside Disability Federation, which supports the development of organisations for the disabled. From February 2005 to October 2007 he applied for 18 grants of £5,000 from the MDF. He became so adept at his deception that he even talked his way onto the board of the MDF, allowing him to authorise grants. In total £67,000 of the cash was transferred to his own bank account or used to pay his mortgage. Rowena Goode, prosecuting, said: 'Although the prime loser was the MDF, most of the people duped into assisting the defendant themselves suffered from mental health problems.'","George Gordon called himself 'The Reverend' and wore a dog collar .

"A village primary school with just 13 pupils was put into special measures after an Ofsted inspection found too many incidents of racist or homophobic bullying and serious acts of violence. But the chairman of governors at Ravenstonedale Endowed School in rural Cumbria has fought back, claiming the report was based on a single incident of children using the word ‘gay’ as a throwaway comment and not knowing what it meant. Liz Morgan said it had been ‘blown out of proportion’ and also denied there had been any racism at the remote school, where all of the children are white. Ravenstonedale Endowed School, pictured, in rural Cumbria was put into special measures after an Ofsted inspection found too many incidents of racist or homophobic bullying and serious acts of violence . She said she believed Ofsted had an agenda against small schools and suspected they’d been unfairly labelled racist because racism and homophobia were treated as one category by Ofsted. Parents of pupils said the report was ‘ludicrous’. Ravenstonedale Endowed School, near Kirkby Stephen, was labelled ‘inadequate’ – the lowest rating out of four grades. Inspectors visited the school in April, where pupils range from ages five to 11 and travel in from nearby hamlets and farms. Their report condemned the behaviour of pupils and highlighted ‘too many incidents of racist or homophobic bullying’, and ‘serious instances of violence’. Staff were warned they urgently needed to improve pupils’ behaviour as parents had already pulled out 12 children, out of just 25, in a six-week period this year. Ofsted claimed this was because parents were ‘concerned’ about behaviour. However the chairman of governors insisted that pupils had been taken out of the school mainly because of parents being anxious about the need for them to engage with larger numbers of children. She said: ‘Parents have taken children out for a variety of reasons – racism and homophobic bullying have never been a reason. ‘As the school is getting below a certain size, parents have been worried about the social side of education they think their children need.’ She said she believed Ofsted’s criticisms had been based on a single report in the school’s own discipline record about children using the word ‘gay’. She said the school did not tolerate it and spoke to the child and their parents – and had since challenged the report with Ofsted but received no response. Ravenstonedale Endowed School in Cumbria has no pupils but six members of staff . Helen Buckler, 43, who has three children at the school, said: ‘It is  all absolute rubbish and upsettingly inaccurate. ‘It is totally ludicrous. I’ve never heard of any racism, homophobia or serious violence. There aren’t even any ethnic minorities at the school – every kid is white.’ A statement from the school said Ofsted was not ‘sensitive to the particular challenges faced by small rural schools’. It added: ‘We were particularly upset by the allegations of racist and homophobic bullying as we do not believe there have been any such incidents in the school.’ Ofsted stood by its report, insisting that both racist and homophobic comments had been made by pupils.","Ravenstonedale Endowed School in Cumbria was put in special measures .

"A furious dad has slammed a school after his six-year-old son was banned from wearing a Christian band in class on health and safety grounds. Peter Thompson's son Eddie had been wearing the band, decorated with the Christian symbol of a fish, out of sight for six months. But when a teacher spotted Eddie scratching his ankle she noticed the band, covered by his sock, and ordered him to hand it over. Now he is being kept at home after he was banned from wearing the band at school on health and safety grounds. Banned: Six-year-old Eddie Thompson (left) was told he was not allowed to wear the Christian band around his ankle at school. His father Peter Thompson (right), 39, is now keeping him at home until the situation is resolved . Mr Thompson, 39, is demanding an apology from the head at Estfeld Primary in Tickhill, near Doncaster, and is keeping Eddie at home until the situation is resolved. He has made a series of complaints and says he believes the school is discriminating against him because he is a Christian, after Eddie was told he could not wear the band at school. Mr Thompson, from Tickhill, said : 'I couldn’t believe it when Eddie told me what had happened. He was so upset. 'He wears the band because he wants to feel that God is always with him. He has had it on for the past six months and makes sure it is covered by his sock, so it’s not on display or posing any kind of risk. 'No one has said a thing about it for all this time but when one of the teachers spotted it when Eddie had an itchy ankle and was scratching it she took it off him. 'When I complained about this to the school they were very blunt and said bands like this were banned. I think they’re discriminating against him because he’s a Christian. This is a symbol of his faith. Headteacher Diane Risley has said the school 'has a clear uniform policy in place to help families understand what pupils can and cannot wear whilst at school' 'I’m particularly angry and upset at the school because during the summer they were actually selling rubber charity bands to raise money. 'It doesn’t make sense to me that now they say they are banned yet in the summer they were selling them on school property. Ruling: The incident follows the recent victory by airline worker Nadia Eweida who won a court battle after being banned from wearing a Christian cross while working at a check-in counter . 'I don’t want his education to suffer but I don’t want to send him back at this stage and when he does go back I’m worried about how he will be treated.' Head teacher Diane Risley said: 'At Tickhill Estfeld the safety and well being of all pupils is taken extremely seriously and the school has a clear uniform policy in place to help families understand what pupils can and cannot wear whilst at school. 'Whilst we do not comment on individual cases any parent who has concerns is entitled to raise these with us directly.' Mr Thompson, a lorry driver, said Eddie picked out the band himself at a Christian bookshop six months ago. He said: 'We are telling Eddie that he's now off school because of the weather. He keeps praying for snow.' Mr Thompson, who regularly attends Bentley Baptist Church in Doncaster with his son, believes the school are discriminating against Eddie because he is a Christian. He said: 'We are a Christian family and Eddie's band was a reflection of this.' The news follows a recent victory by airline worker Nadia Eweida who won a court battle after being banned from wearing a Christian cross while working at a check-in counter. Her case was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights who ruled that she was allowed to wear it as an expression of her faith.","Eddie Thompson, six, was banned from wearing Christian band by school .

"Record numbers of British students are choosing American universities amid concerns over rising fees and the quality of degree courses. More than 10,000 young people attended institutions in the United States - which offer generous scholarship schemes - during the 2013-14 academic year. This was an eight per cent rise on 2012-13 - the largest year-on-year increase in a decade, according to a report released by the Institute for International Education (IIE) today. Record numbers of British students are choosing American universities such as Harvard (pictured) amid concerns over rising fees and the quality of degree courses . UK undergraduates are particularly interested in studying for degrees overseas, with an 11 per cent increase in numbers in the US between 2012-13 and 2013-14. These students - around 5,000 - applied in Autumn 2012, just as the first cohort of undergraduates were affected by tuition fees of up to £9,000-a-year. There has been a 15 per cent rise in UK undergraduates heading to the US between 2008-9 and 2013-14. The top five US universities hosting UK students in 2013-14 were Harvard, Columbia, New York, University of California Berkeley and Yale. The findings will renew fears of a ‘brain drain’, with the tripling in tuition charges pushing some of the country’s brightest minds abroad. Fees at top American institutions including Harvard, Princeton and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) can be around £40,000 per year, but they offer generous financial aid. US universities also provide sports scholarships, which can cut fees by as much as 75 per cent. Experts believe that students are also attracted to the breadth of the liberal arts curriculum. They can take a range of subjects before specialising in their third year. Meanwhile the US-UK Fulbright Commission, which promotes links between universities in both countries, saw a record 4,700 visitors to its annual US university undergraduate fair this autumn. It has described a ‘tidal wave of increased interest in US study’ over recent years and said there was evidence this trend ‘is only gaining momentum’. Jamie Dunn, spokeswoman for the US-UK Fulbright Commission, said: ‘Each year, we survey students as they apply for visas at the US Embassy, and year on year, some of the top reasons they cite are: the quality and number of US universities - there are over 4,000 to choose from, the chance to experience the vibrant American campus life and the more flexible liberal arts curriculum.’ UK undergraduates are particularly interested in studying for degrees overseas, with an 11 per cent increase in numbers in the US between 2012-13 and 2013-14 . She added: ‘The rise in tuition fees seems to have sparked this trend in British students crossing the pond for their studies. ‘Further fuelling the increased student interest has been the strong reputation of American universities and students wanting to set themselves apart in an increasingly competitive job market.’ Penny Egan, executive director of the US-UK Fulbright Commission, added: ‘As the globe shrinks it is wonderful to see young British students taking advantage of the opportunities to study abroad. ‘Outward mobility is high on the agenda and where better to head to than some of the best universities in the world?’ In April, a study by the British Council showed that rising numbers of students were considering studying overseas amid the hike in tuition fees. More than a third (37 per cent) of 2,630 young people surveyed said they were thinking about heading overseas - up from 20 per cent who stated the same last year. Meanwhile earlier this year, an analysis of figures on Government website Unistats, found that some students get fewer than half the hours of lectures, seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at different universities in Britain. In 2012, Anthony Seldon, Master of Wellington College, Berkshire, warned that students were being forced to seek courses on the other side of the Atlantic because institutions in this country were stuck in a ‘malaise’. He said British universities provided less contact time with lecturers and displayed only a ‘perfunctory interest’ in sport and the arts.","10,000 people attended institutions in U.S. in 2013-14 academic year .

"What some have called the worst video game ever made has fetched thousands of dollars for a New Mexico city. An old 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' game cartridge drew the highest bid among 100 Atari games auctioned on eBay by Alamogordo officials. The games were part of a cache of some 800 Atari video games buried more than 30 years ago in a landfill and dug up in April. Dumpsite: In April, a cache of some 800 Atari video games buried more than 30 years ago in a landfill in Alamogordo, N.M. were uncovered, and now those games are being sold. So far, 100 of them have sold for a total of $37,000 . Dig: After months of planning with state and local regulators, crews discovered numerous game cartridges on April 26. The dig cost more than $50,000 . Found: City documents show that Atari consoles and more than 1,300 games were found, including 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.' Some of the other discovered titles include 'Centipedes,' 'Warlords' and 'Asteroids.' Joe Lewandowski, a consultant for the film companies that documented the dig, says the online auction, which ended Thursday, generated $37,000. 'It's really gratifying to see that happening because again to everybody it was a bunch of garbage in the landfill. You're kind of nutty to go dig it up,' Lewandowski told KRQE-TV. The 'E.T.' game, still in its original box, sold for $1,537 to a buyer in Canada. The interest in the games has gone global. According to Lewandowski, online bidders from other countries including Germany and Sweden snapped up items. Owns: Alamogordo owns the cartridges because they came from the city's landfill.

'I keep getting messages from people around the world asking me if there's any more left, it's crazy,' Lewandowski told the Alamogordo Daily News. 'The people that lost the bids are demanding more but I keep telling them they have to keep checking.' Reports that truckloads of the game were buried in the landfill have been urban legend since the early '80s. The 'E.T.' game's poor reception when it came out in 1982 was seen as a factor in Atari's demise. City documents show that Atari consoles and more than 1,300 games were found, including 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.'

"John Walker has won a landmark case against his employer, chemical company Innospec, who refused to pay his partner of 19 years a widow's pension in the event of his death . A gay couple have won a landmark legal battle over pension rights that could see businesses landed with a £90 million bill. Former cavalry officer John Walker took chemical company Innospec to court after it refused to pay his partner of 19 years the equivalent of a widow’s pension in the event of his death because of a Government loophole. But in a test case, an employment tribunal ruled that Old Harrovian Mr Walker – who had worked for the firm for 20 years – had been discriminated against under European law because of his sexual orientation, and that his partner should receive a full payout. The ruling could lead to scores of other gay couples demanding pension rights are upheld and lead to an embarrassing U-turn by the Government when it introduces controversial gay marriage legislation next year. Ministers have made it clear they plan to keep the same loophole, which states firms can disregard pension contributions built up before the law on civil partnerships was introduced in 2005. Mr Walker, 61, met his partner, a 48-year-old former computer executive who does not wish to be named, in Singapore 19 years ago, and the couple were one of the first to enter into a civil partnership. In heterosexual marriages, spouses are . normally entitled to between half and two-thirds of their partners’ pensions if they  die before them.

"An investigation has been launched following claims a private primary school in the United Arab Emirates held 15 of its pupils hostage until their parents paid their fees. The children, who are pupils at Nibras Al Iman School, in Sharjah and are seven and eight years old, will give evidence to a three member committee next Monday at a hearing which is expected to take two days. The school's principal will be interviewed as well as the teacher who was with the pupils in the classroom at the time and an administrative member of staff who called the parents to tell them their children were being kept, an official at the Sharjah Educational Zone said. A screen grab taken from the Sharjah Education Zone's website. An investigation is to be carried out following claims the school held 15 pupils hostage because they had not paid their fees . The alleged incident came to light after the mother of a girl being held called a radio station in Sharjah and told them what had happened. She said she was not allowed to take her daughter home until she had paid the school fees which were late. The committee investigating the allegations will be made up of two education zone officials and one person from the legal affairs section. This is not the first time allegations have been made about a school punishing children whose parents have not their paid fees. A Palestinian mother accused a school in  Sharjah of banning her son from getting the school bus unless his fees were paid. 'It’s embarrassing to the child. I know some parents can’t care less sometimes but this is no excuse for scarring a child’s emotions' Jordanian mother Mariama Saleem, whose son was banned from using a school bus . Meanwhile a Jordanian mother Mariama Saleem told The National that her son, 10, said a member of staff goes into each class and reads the names aloud of all the children who parents have not paid. She said: 'It’s embarrassing to the child. I know some parents can’t care less sometimes but this is no excuse for scarring a child’s emotions.' This week a government school in Ajman withheld exam results of 10 of its pupils and sent text messages to parents to pay the late fees if they wanted to see their children's results. Schools are allowed to withhold results, keep official documents needed for pupils to move schools or temporarily suspend the child if parents have been warned three or more times, according to article 52 of the federal law. Lawyer Salem Sahoh has said that parents of the 15 children could report the school to the police for 'limiting one's freedom' and 'endangering another's life' If the school was found guilty a fine could be imposed and each parent could claim compensation in a civil court. Sheikha Deemas, the principal of Sharjah British International School, said the value of bounced cheques received by her school from parents amounts to half a million dirhams.","Children are pupils at Sharjah Education Zone and aged seven and eight .

"The devastated mother of four western Sydney brother who fled Australia to fight with the Islamic State (IS) is begging her boys to come home. The four brothers made their way to Syria last week after they told their parents they were going on a trip to Thailand, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Their distraught mother, who drove them to the airport, has made a public plea begging her boys to come home by promising 'you have done nothing wrong, so please come back.' 'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart,' their mother said, according to the Sunday Telegraph. 'We want you back. I can't stop crying day and night. We love you all.' The four boys, one of whom still attended school, lived at home with their teenage sister. As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists  from leaving the country, the latest recruits from Western Sydney have been labelled 'cleanskins' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence. The family home has been searched by police. Authorities are also reported to be looking for the four boys in Turkey, in they can be stopped before they cross the border, if they have not already . Scroll down for video . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. 1 . Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, the Daily Telegraph reports. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late. 'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph. It follows after 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video. According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports. This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph. Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere. 'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head . Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan speaking at the investigation into new legislation in Canberra on Thursday . Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism. He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months. Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to travel to Syria .

"Motorists are likely to get an early Christmas present with petrol prices set to drop to a four-year low this festive season. The average price for a litre of fuel will fall to £1.20 next month - 10p cheaper than this time last year - experts have predicted. Prices could be lower still, around £1.15, at supermarket such as Asda and Tesco. Motorists are likely to get an early Christmas present with petrol prices set to drop to a four-year low this festive season; experts have predicted fuel to fall to £1.20 next month - 10p cheaper than last Christmas . RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told The Sun: 'If oil continues to be pumped way above global demand and the Pound remains strong against the dollar, we should have the chest forecourt prices since early December 2010.' At £1.20 a litre, filling the tank of an average-sized family car would cost motorists £6 less. Filling up with diesel, expected to sell for £1.24 a litre, would cost £8 less. A spokesman for comparison website Petrolprices.com said it wasn't 'beyond the realms of possibility' that petrol would fall below the £1 mark. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, last week urged petrol companies to pass on savings 'as quickly as possible'. He said: ‘When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather’. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, last week urged petrol companies to pass on savings 'as quickly as possible', and said prices should 'fall like a stone, not a feather' But petrol prices can only fall so far as tax accounts for 58p of the per-litre price and VAT is around 20p. Brian Madderson, of the Petrol Retailers’ Association, said earlier this month that it had tried for weeks to discuss the issue with the Treasury adding that ‘to criticise the industry without speaking to us is grossly unfair’. Luke Bosdet of the AA said while supermarkets were leading the price cuts, ‘fuel prices … are not moving fast enough’. Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said Mr Alexander was ‘passing the buck’ and the Government was ‘the biggest driver of pump prices’.","Average fuel price is expected to be 10p cheaper than last Christmas .

"Growing up as a teenager is difficult but imagine doing it without a mother. This was the reality that faced Aiesha Saunders when she lost her mother to liver cancer in 2010. The Bankstown girl was 12 years old and was sent to live with her aunt. After losing her mother when she was 12, Aiesha Saunders (left) signed up for the SISTER2sister program and was paired with 'big sister' Kristen Young (right) 'I love my dad but he's not around a lot. My mum was my entire family besides my aunty and I didn't really have anyone else,' the now 17-year-old told Daily Mail Australia. 'She was a mother, best friend, sister and everything rolled into one. 'When I lost her I kind of lost everything.' Luckily for Aiesha this was when she was introduced to Life Changing Experience Foundation's SISTER2sister program that aims to help the 48,000-plus Australian children who are abused or neglected, with young girls two or three times more likely to be abused than boys. Aiesha's mother (left pictured with her daughter) died from liver cancer in 2010 . Ms Young (left) became a great supporter in Aiesha's (right) life and gave her career advice . From Monday to Friday Step Up for Sisterhood Week is taking place, and people will get the chance to help these children by donating to the program. It assists girls aged between 12 and 18 who are 'at risk' due to extreme suffering as a direct result of trauma, bereavement, poverty, sexual abuse, mental abuse, physical abuse, neglect, homelessness, sickness or disability, and destitution. Aiesha is one of these children who benefit from the program and was set her up with 'big sister' Kristen Young. 'When my mother passed away... I was quite young and still figuring out who I was and it was important that I had another strong role model in my life,' she said. 'Kristen has been a big part of my life. Even if it's something small or I've had a bad day at school, it's nice to meet up with someone and have a coffee. It's nice to know someone who's there for. 'I don't know where I would be without not just Kristen, but Marnie who organises everything and Jess who is the founder of program. They also have fun together, including going white water rafting together (pictured above, back left and right) Aiesha, now 17, is an aspiring journalist with an interest in music and had her first article published recently . 'Family is important but it's nice to have someone else to have that extra support.' Not only has Ms Young helped Aiesha cope with her mother's death but doled out career advice. 'She's a rock for me to chase my career goals and she's in PR [public relations] and I've always been wanted to be a journalist. 'She's sat me down and said we can talk to this person or that person. 'My aunt is busy and it's nice for us to have that common interest. 'Kristen spent ages knitting me this blanket. It's just a blanket but it's nice to see someone put that much effort in.' Aiesha said the program also brought her in to contact with other fantastic young women who understood her struggles. 'When you're down in the dumps, I found out there were others who going through it as well,' she said. 'It makes you feel less alone when you have a group of people around you.' The SISTER2sister program, which brought Ms Young and Aiesha together, is looking for donations this week during Step Up for Sisterhood Week. And since her introduction to the program she has already reached a significant milestone with the help of her 'big sister'. 'Recently I just had the first article published. Music was for me and [Kristen] pushed me in that direction and I was doing things I didn't know I was going to be doing from a young age,' Aiesha said. 'These sisters have their own lives and give their time up for young girls and bringing out some amazing women. 'I went to a reunion and saw [other 'little sisters] and to see where they were five to 10 years ago and where they are now is amazing.' The program is not only rewarding to those who receive help but for those who voluntarily give up their time to mentor young girls. Aiesha's 'big sister' Kristen Young joined three years ago and has never looked back, saying she wanted to give back to the community. 'I'm one of those people who thinks if I can't change the world by myself, at least I can change one person’s life,' she said. '[The program is] such a fantastic way to change a girl's life and give experiences what I had in my childhood.' Despite an unconventional upbringing where she moved around a lot, attending seven schools in three countries by the time she graduated high school, Ms Young said she knew what it was like trying to fit in as a teenager. 'I was the master of being the new kid. I used to go to a school every four years,' she said. 'I looked back on the time and say it was fantastic but then I felt like a fish out of water when I was a teenager, struggling with confidence.' But Ms Young said it was not only her 'little sister' who was learning new things. 'She was hell lot more mature than I was at that age, and I've learned a lot from her,' she said.

"Russia has refused to take part in a public inquiry into the death of poisoned former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko. The investigative committee of the Russian Federation (ICRF), a law-enforcement agency which answers directly to President Vladimir Putin, has told inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen it will not be a 'core participant' in the process. Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a meeting, allegedly with two Russians - former KGB contacts Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun - at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. Scroll down for video . Alexander Litvinenko (left) was a former KGB spy who spent weeks in hospital (right) before his death in November 2006. He died after drinking tea laced with polonium-210 after allegedly meeting with contacts . His family believes he was working for MI6 at the time and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin. Former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun have been identified as the prime suspects in the killing, but both deny any involvement and remain in Russia. Sir Robert formally opened the inquiry in July after Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina led a successful challenge against holding an inquest into his death. In a letter read to a directions hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, the ICRF, sometimes dubbed the 'Russian FBI', said it would not take part as it did not agree with powers granted in public inquiries that allow evidence to be held in closed session. The letter from solicitors Harbottle and Lewis on behalf of the authorities said: 'This is a decision that the ICRF has reached after very careful consideration and with much regret. 'However the ICRF is not willing to participate in a process where it appears that a considerable amount of evidence will be heard in closed session..' They added the ICRF intended 'no disrespect' towards Sir Robert or the proceedings. The inquiry will be authorised to examine claims of Russian responsibility for the incident which has been described as 'a miniature nuclear attack on the streets of London'. Mrs Litvinenko fought for the probe into her husband's murder after Sir Robert said he could not hold a 'fair and fearless' investigation as part of an inquest, and a public inquiry should take place instead. Marina Litvinenko tirelessly fought for the probe into her husband's murder, which resulted in the public inquiry being opened by Sir Robert Owen in July. The Government previously resisted launching an inquiry . The Government had previously resisted launching an inquiry, instead saying it would 'wait and see' what a judge-led inquest found, but the High Court ruled the Home Secretary should reconsider the decision. Although Mrs Litvinenko and her lawyers will not be able to see secret material, the chairman can take it into account, unlike in an inquest. But it is unclear whether the right to broadcast the inquiry live will be granted by Sir Robert. Alex Bailin, QC, who represents eleven media organisations at the inquiry including the BBC, ITN and BSkyB, said broadcasting the inquiry would give the public 'faith' in the hearing. 'The media's only agenda is its sincere desire that the inquiry is as transparent and accessible as possible,' he said. 'The Secretary of State says there is no good reason for broadcasting any part of this inquiry, even the opening and closing submissions... also there is no good reason for broadcasting the evidence of witnesses. 'We say as a bald assertion that is untenable. There is worldwide interest in this case, a man was murdered on the streets of London by radioactive poisoning.' Mr Litvinenko, 43, died after being poisoned while drinking tea at a meeting, allegedly with two Russian contacts - Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun - at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square (pictured) Counsel for the inquiry, representatives from the Home Office, and the Met police oppose live coverage. Richard Horwell, QC, for the Met police said: 'The public interest is best served by a public inquiry which encourages witnesses to come forwards which encourages witnesses to assist and which encourages and permits witnesses to give evidence without unnecessary pressure, alarm, intimidation or strain. 'It is the quality of the evidence which is paramount, not the broadcasting of it throughout the world.' Mrs Litvinenko attended today's proceedings which also touched the topic of special advocates for closed sessions. Sir Robert will announce his decisions on broadcasting and special advocates at a future date. The chairman said the substantive hearings would start on January 27 and an additional preparatory hearing would be held on October 16. Sir Robert previously said that alleged Russian state responsibility in the 43-year-old's death was of 'central importance to my investigation'. However, Britain's responsibility for protecting the former KGB officer will not be investigated as part of the inquiry as there is no evidence to suggest any failings on the state's part.","Former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London hotel in 2006 .

"For decades, knitting has been the preserve of pensioners - a calming activity that can be undertaken in front of Coronation Street or on the bus home. But now the woolly hobby has been taken over by 18-25 year olds in nightclubs and concert halls up and down the country. The movement is all down to one woman -  Kelley D, 35, from London. Kelley D from London came up with the idea of Rave Knitting at a friend's house party in June. Since then, she has performed at Glastonbury and joined 2 Bears on tour . The TV producer has just got back from a UK tour with the dance music duo 2 Bears, who signed her up as their support act after witnessing her rave knitting a friend's party. There is also talk of her starring in their next music video. The concept is simple - Kelley starts off the knitting onstage with a pair of needles and several balls of neon yarn. Gradually, the crowd takes the ends of the wool and wrap themselves in it as part of the 'human knitting.' The concept is simple - Kelley starts off the knitting onstage with a pair of needles and several balls of neon yarn. Gradually, the crowd take the ends of the wool and wrap themselves in it as part of the 'human knitting' Soon, the whole dance floor, glitter ball and speakers included, is an enormous giggling and dancing mass of UV-lit wool. Kelly told MailOnline: 'The wool is there to connect people, because  in dance music people have forgotten what the dance floor is about. 'It isn't about superstar DJ's - it's about the people. 'With this there is a community spirit, like those old Northern Soul nights - it's about bringing fun back to the dance floor.' Rave Knitting is already establishing itself as a genre of its own in the UK dance scene, but Kelley came up with the idea completely by accident during a late night at a friend's house last June. She said: 'I was back at a friend's house after my partner's birthday party and she had just got a new flatmate.' 'I went into their room and found this big old school knitting bag - there was all these needles in it and crochet.' Kelley has just back from a UK tour with the dance music duo 2 Bears, who signed her up as their support act after witnessing Rave Knitting a friend's party . She continued: 'I wrapped myself in the wool for a laugh, then came back into the room and put on this eastern European voice - calling myself the crazy rave knitter from Yugoslavia.' Kelley then took the character to a friend's birthday party, where she was spotted by the 2 Bears, who advised her to make it into a professional performance act and invited her on tour. Two days later she was contacted by someone at Glastonbury, who asked if the Rave Knitter could host a tent at the festival. She said: 'It has been like a dream come true for me, it has been quite overwhelming how it has taken off. 'It's just a ball of wool.' The dance floor becomes an art instillation, as all of the dancers connected with UV-lit neon wool . She continued: 'I've had Zoe Ball interviewing me in Brighton and Norman Cook absolutely loves it, he asked me how I could scale it up for 20,000 people. 'I can't explain what it does, people have to come to the gig to see what it does for people. 'It's like the dance floor becomes an art instillation because it is all floodlit with neon light - it's all of these colours binding people together. 'I am then only one with knitting needles, but the idea is we are knitting each other together, one person at a time - it's people knitting. 'They all start attaching each other, it starts at the front and moves towards the back and the sides, it takes on a life of its own.'","Kelley D from London came up with the idea at a friend's party in June .

"Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond has reportedly ended a neighbourly dispute by buying the house next door for £1.2million. The 44-year-old bought his six-bedroom castle near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, in 2008, shelling out around £2million for the property, which also boasts a number of garages for his collection of classic cars. However, the star has reportedly paid a further £1.2million for the six-bedroom house next door, following claims of a row with former neighbour Mark O'Connor. Sale:Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond has reportedly paid £1.2million for this house, which is next door to his six-bedroom castle home . 'Dispute': The star has reportedly bought the house next door after claims of a row with former neighbour Mark O'Connor . Original house: The 44-year-old bought his six-bedroom castle near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, in 2008, shelling out around £2million for the property . According to The Sun's Michael Hamilton, Hammond's PA paid cash for the property, which is set in 14.5 acres of gardens and grounds. The house, which estate agents described as 'charming' had been listed for sale at £1.25million. Parts of the house are said to date back to the 17th century, with many of the home's historical features having been retained, including window seats and ornate moulded architraving. Family: Hammond and his wife Mindy, who have two daughters, moved into the mock castle, set in 20 acres of grounds, in 2008 . Home: The oldest part of Hammond's first home dates from the 15th century, but the castle facade - designed to look as if it was from that period - was added around 300 years later . There are also several outbuildings, including a billiards room, garage and an old stable block. It is claimed that there had been arguments over animals, including ponies, and that Hammond had flown over Mr O'Connor's property in his helicopter after sending representatives to view the house and its grounds. 'It's been traumatic,' Mr O'Connor told The Sun. Hammond and his wife Mindy, who have two daughters, moved into the mock castle, set in 20 acres of grounds, in 2008 - the same year that he and co-star James May were awarded a pay rise for their work on Top Gear, bringing their salaries more in line with that earned by Jeremy Clarkson. He now reportedly earns around £175,000 for a series of Top Gear, which he joined 12 years ago. Popular: Hammond, pictured with Top Gear co-hosts James May and Jeremy Clarkson, has been part of the BBC programme for the last 12 years . The oldest part of the building dates from the 15th century, but the castle facade - designed to look as if it was from that period - was added around 300 years later. The owner at the time is said to have added the castle elements because he was in love with a Spanish woman who had been reluctant to live in England, and had wanted to  live in a castle - spurning him in spite of his building work. An unnamed source close to Hammond told the newspaper: 'It was an unfortunate neighbourly dispute. But they've worked things through and are happy it's all been resolved.'","Presenter, 44, has reportedly bought his neighbour's six-bedroom home .

"A shameless thief sneaked out of her grandmother's funeral so she could burgle her own mother. Marla Everett, 33, who earlier this year was jailed for allowing her three young sons to live in squalor, raided her mother's house in Immingham, Lincolnshire, and stole a laptop, two cameras and a television pay-per-view box containing money. When her mother Susan Everett returned home she realised her neighbour's description of the thief was her own daughter. Shameless: Marla Everett, 33, who earlier this year was jailed for allowing her three young sons to live in squalor, sneaked out of her grandmother's funeral so she could burgle her own mother . Grimsby Crown Court was told that that both Everett and her mother had been at the funeral, but the younger woman had left early. 'Susan left home in the morning and the property was secure. She was going to the funeral at 11.30am,' said Martin Haworth, prosecuting. 'The defendant was present at the funeral and it was noted that they (Everett and an accomplice) left saying that they were going into Grimsby.' Theft: Everett (pictured) raided her mother's house in Immingham, Lincolnshire, and stole a laptop, two cameras and a television pay-per-view box containing money . He said the mother returned home at about 2.30pm and discovered 'items appeared to have been moved suggesting someone had been in her house'. 'The wooden cover of the catflap had been moved,' Mr Haworth said. 'She discovered that the laptop and two cameras were missing. A black pay-per-view box was missing from the main room.' Family gathering: Grimsby Crown Court was told that that both Everett and her mother had been at the funeral, but the younger woman (pictured) had left early . '[After getting information from a neighbour] She made a call to her daughter asking that the goods be returned. She said she had spent the money from the TV box. 'It seems that all the goods were recovered except the TV box, money and one camera charger. 'She said in interview ""last night I robbed my mum's house while she was at a funeral"". Police went to the defendant's home in Duke Street and she was arrested. Vicky Lee, mitigating said: 'It's maintained that there was £100 in the TV box. 'She hasn't been before a court for anything like this previously and has made full admissions. She has already returned most of the property back to her mother.' Ms Lee asked Deputy District Judge Andrew Pascoe for Everett to be released on bail before she is sentenced, adding: 'She is desperate not to be in custody pending sentence for this.' However, Judge Pascoe determined the matter would go to Crown Court for sentence as Everett was still on licence for her previous offence and remanded her in custody until her sentencing later this month. In February she was jailed after  police found her three young boys living in appalling scenes of 'squalor' in a filthy and cluttered flat. Squalor: Earlier this year Everett was jailed for allowing her three young sons to live in this squalid flat . Mess: When an officer gained entry to the property in Grimsby, he was hit by a swarm of flies and a stench of urine, excrement and stale alcohol . Tip: The flat was full of rotting food, empty beer cans and discarded fast food wrappers . When an officer gained entry to the property in Grimsby, he was hit by a swarm of flies and a stench of urine, excrement and stale alcohol, with the flat full of rotting food, empty beer cans and discarded fast food wrappers. Police were called to the home after a passerby spotted a two-year-old child on the balcony of the third-floor flat, swinging his legs through the railings. When police arrived, Everett's partner Matthew Cartwright was drunk, was possibly under the influence of drugs and was in no fit state to look after children, Grimsby Crown Court heard in February. He had drunk eight to ten pints of lager. Discarded: Two images show the mess around the television and children's play equipment left abandoned . Bathroom:There was barely any room to move in the bathroom, with toys and a pram filling the space . Bedroom: One of the children's bedrooms - which is virtually full with old toys, dirty washing and rubbish . Kitchen: The kitchen surface is filled with old food cans, discarded wrappers and empty pans . Eating habits: Food waste can be seen in the sink while the kitchen cupboards are left bare . A very drowsy Everett then appeared, apparently under the influence of something. She had smeared excrement on her neck and bra strap. She and Cartwright, 39, each admitted three offences of cruelty to the boys, who were all aged under three and were taken into foster care. She was jailed for a year by Judge David Tremberg, who allowed the couple's names to be published so that the case could be reported, and was on licence for those offences when she committed this latest crime. Rotting: Old food left rotting in pans is left under the boiler, while a baby bottle sits in the dirty sink . Filled with rubbish: A wide shot of the kitchen shows rubbish on the floor and the work surfaces . Cruel: Food and pans are left in the sink while a chair and a bike wheel is left by the rubbish bin . Barricade: A stack of childrens' toys and other debris fills the hallway of the Grimsby flat .

"A team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find 'the loneliest whale in the world' next autumn by tracking its route across the North Pacific Ocean. The researchers have been listening to the animal's abnormally high song for over 20 years but have never seen what it looks like. The unknown whale is called 'lonely' because it appears to communicate at a frequency not used by any other whale in the North Pacific, and so far, it is not thought to have ever got a response to its plaintive cries. A team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find 'the loneliest whale in the world' next autumn. The creature has been calling out at a frequency not used by any other whales in the North Pacific Ocean for the last 20 years . Experts believe the huge mammal is most likely a fin whale, but could be a blue whale, or a hybrid of the two species, Discovery News reported. The US Navy began passing recordings of whale song to scientists in the late 1980s. It picked up the haunting noises when trying to listen for submarines in the North Pacific. In 1989, Dr William Watkins of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution began to sort through the recordings and noticed that one whale's song was much higher in pitch than the others. Most male fin and blue whales sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz. When more recordings were released in the nineties, Dr Watkins studied the 52 hertz whale more closely. Scientists have been listening to the whale for two decades but no-one has seen it, so they are not sure exactly what species they are looking for. Experts believe the huge mammal is is most likely that it is a fin whale (pictured) but could be a hybrid of a blue and a fin whale . Dr Watkins' team was able to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season, when whales are at their most vocal and published a paper on his findings in 2004. Mary-Ann Daher, who was involved with the research said that it is usually incredibly difficult to track a whale across the ocean without seeing it as the animals make noises at the same frequency, making it almost impossible to pick out individuals. The study attracted much media attention and the 52 hertz animal was dubbed 'the loneliest whale in the world' as its high-pitched song did not seem to get a response from other whales. As Dr Watkins sadly died from cancer before his research captured the imagination of the public, his research assistant  Ms Daher has carried on his scientific legacy. Most male blue and fin whales (pictured) sing at around 17 to 18 hertz, which is too deep for humans to hear, but the 'lonely' whale communicates at 52 hertz. Dr Watkins' team has used its song to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season . She said that the team has never seen the whale they have been studying and do not know what species it is. They do not know if it is medically unusual but she said it is obviously healthy as it has been living for at least two decades. However, when it came to musing about the creature's loneliness, Ms Daher said: 'Is he alone? I don’t know. 'People like to imagine this creature out there swimming by his lonesome, just singing away and nobody’s listening. But I can’t say that.' Scientists may find out more about the mysterious whale when they search for it next Autumn. While the whale has been dubbed the 'loneliest in the world' as its calls seem to be going unanswered, scientists are not so sure. They cannot say for sure that the creature is completely alone. A blue whale is pictured .","A team of scientists will attempt to find the 'loneliest whale in the world' next Autumn and are able to track its route across the North Pacific Ocean .

The . gas dispute comes after Russia strongly condemned Ukraine's handling of . a separatist insurgency in its east, which broke out in the wake of the . overthrow of the country's pro-Russian president in February. The . pipeline to Ukraine also carries gas meant for the rest of Europe, but . Mr Kupriyanov said that the supply to Europe will continue as planned.

Tim Ash at Standard Bank told the Associated Press that Ukraine could . in theory simply take whatever gas it wants, since it all travels . through the same pipelines. That . would lead to a shortage of deliveries to Europe, slowing the build up . of gas stored for winter, when demand rockets.

Gazprom has notified the European Commission of 'a possible disruption' in case Ukraine decides to siphon off gas meant for Europe . Russia has previously used its dominance of the gas market to exert influence on Ukraine's politics. In . December, Gazprom offered Mr Yanukovych a . discounted price of $268.50 per thousand cubic meters after he backed . out of an economic and political agreement with the EU. That . price was cancelled April 1 and raised to $485 per thousand cubic . meters. Russia has now offered $385, the price that Ukraine was paying . until December, but Kiev is insisting on a lower price. Gazprom . had up to now tolerated Ukraine's late payments but now says Kiev owes a . total of £2.5billion for gas from last year and this year. It . wanted a payment of $1.95 billion for past-due bills by 9am this . morning, Kiev time.

"The Cleveland Cavaliers are polishing up a determined bid to bring LeBron James back, finally removing from their website the scathing letter written by the team's owner to fans after their star player chose Miami as a free agent four years ago. Now with the Cavs intent on luring the Akron, Ohio, native back to Cleveland as a member of the 2014 free agent class, the NBA team removed an old link to Dan Gilbert's impassioned letter that was active as recently as Sunday. Hours after James went on a nationally televised special to reveal his controversial decision to join the star-studded Miami Heat rather than re-sign with his home-state Cavaliers, Gilbert lashed out in anger. Many happy returns? LeBron James could move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat . The angry letter described the move by James as 'selfish,' 'heartless,' 'callous,' and a 'cowardly betrayal' - and vowed that a curse would deny him the championships he craved in Miami and that the Cavaliers would win a title without him. The NBA fined Gilbert $100,000 for the comments. James went on to lead Miami to four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals and two titles while Cleveland finished last in their five-team division three years in a row before a third-place finish last season. Cleveland's struggles, however, may have set the Cavaliers up as an attractive team for a James homecoming as the high draft picks they garnered as a result allowed them to amass a core of talented young players. Scathing attack: Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert was not impressed when LeBron James decided to leave . Dumped: A poster of LeBron James ends up in the bin after hearing that he was leaving . Cleveland recently reached agreement with premier point guard Kyrie Irving, the 2011 number one overall draft pick, to a five-year extension worth about $90 million, and they used the top pick last month on high-leaping forward Andrew Wiggins. With James retaining a home in the Akron area and strong family ties in the area, the Heat have been hard-pressed under the tight NBA salary cap to retool a team that were humbled in last month's NBA Finals by the San Antonio Spurs. His ultimate decision could put the NBA's balance of power at stake and make whatever team he chooses an instant contender. Hot picks: Cleveland Cavaliers have built a team of talented youngsters including Kyrie Irving (C) Heat president Pat Riley, who is expected to meet soon with James, said on Monday that agreements are in place to sign free agent power forward Josh McRoberts and small forward Danny Granger as part of their push for the four-time league most valuable player. The slick passing McRoberts, 27, averaged 8.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game last season with the Charlotte Hornets. Granger, a former All-Star who has a career scoring average of 17.4 points over nine seasons, split last season between the Indiana Pacers and the Los Angeles Clippers and averaged 8.2 points and 3.2 rebounds.","Cleveland Cavaliers have stepped up their bid for LeBron James to return .

"Property guru Sarah Beeny has called for the Government to give tax breaks to three-generation families living under one roof. The television presenter said ‘multi-generation living’ would help to avert a social care ‘disaster’ because family members could more easily care for elderly relatives at home. It would also ease Britain’s housing shortage by freeing up more homes – pushing down prices and bursting the property ‘bubble’. Scroll down for video . Property guru Sarah Beeny (pictured) has called for the Government to give tax breaks to three-generation families living under one roof . By caring for older relative ourselves, we would reduce the huge financial pressure on the State caused by an ageing population, she said. It would also reduce our reliance on childcare and after-school clubs because grandparents could care for their grandchildren while their children went out to work. The married mother-of-four relies on a nanny to help with childcare and admitted she would ‘love it’ if her own father or parents’-in-law moved in with her. As the owner of Rise Hall – a 28-bedroom mansion in Yorkshire – and a Victorian cottage in Streatham, south London, she would not be a typical example for multi-generational living. But yesterday, she called for Britain to learn from Mediterranean countries, where three generations more commonly lived together. The presenter of shows such as Property Ladder and How to Sell your House criticised planning restrictions which bowed too much to nimbys (not in my back yard) and prevented people from turning their homes into ones big enough for several generations. Miss Beeny says the plans would also ease Britain’s housing shortage by freeing up more homes – pushing down prices and bursting the property bubble . She said: ‘I would really like to see encouragement of three-generational living. ‘It should be incentivised in terms of tax and in terms of planning. ‘Instead of saying, ‘we have got a housing problem but we won’t let anyone extend their home by three inches’, why don’t we just let the person do their loft conversion. ‘I think nimbyism is still a problem, massively. I mean, we are nimbys in this country aren’t we?’. ‘I would have tax incentives, as well, for three generations living together, maybe council tax breaks.’ She said that, ‘at the moment we have got a disaster waiting to happen with the cost of looking after older people’, but there is little planning to deal with this ‘cost around the corner’. She added: ‘Meanwhile we are encouraging parents to go to work but then you give it all back in tax and pay a load more for childcare. You are busting a gut the kids don’t see you. ‘We have got parents who are too busy to help their children with their homework so we are paying for extra homework clubs. ‘The burden on the taxpayer of trying to pay for all these services is huge. It is much more efficient to take out the layers of bureaucracy.’ She added that it would ‘loosen up housing problems in this country because there would be a lot more properties available’. ‘It also encourages generations to look out for each other. It should be our mantra going forwards – let’s try to fix the whole concept of family responsibility’, she said. But even with two large homes, she admits she has not yet managed to convince her own family to live with her. Miss Beeny and her artist husband Graham Swift bought Grade II listed 97-room Rise Hall in 2001 for £435,000 when it was in complete disrepair and made a programme, Beeny’s Restoration Nightmare, about the long, painful renovation to its former glory. But her father Richard, a retired architect, is reluctant to move in with his daughter and son-in-law and their four energetic young sons Billy, Charlie, Rafferty and Laurie. She said: ‘I would love it but the funny thing is that my dad isn’t that keen. He just went ""are you mad?"". ‘Rise Hall is full of weddings and London he wouldn’t want to live in because it’s busy and it’s manic and everyone ignores each other. ‘And we have a million children. I think they are lovely, but they are four boys. It’s like having a litter of kittens around or puppies. ‘It is something I would really love to do – and with my mother-in-law and father-in-law too. ‘Graham and I talk endlessly about if we should leave London because I can see how it would work if we had a house and a separate annex, so they could have their own kitchen and their own bit of garden that they could go in and have a cup of tea without the kids going in. ‘My theory is that we would get somewhere with an annex and make it so nice and invite them to stay. Eventually, they will say ""I might as well stay"" and I will say ""well, why not hey.""' Miss Beeny, who runs an online estate agents called Tepilo, called for urgent reform of the stamp duty land tax system, which she said was ‘blocking the market’, claiming that the incremental system was ‘madness’. She argued the scheme would also reduce our reliance on childcare and after-school clubs because grandparents could care for their grandchildren while their children went out to work . Stamp duty jumps up rather than rising gradually and costs buyers at least £7,000 for a home over £250,000 and £20,000 for a house above £500,000. She said: ‘There is no possible logic behind it. It is ridiculous, we have to get rid of the incremental system’. Stamp duty thresholds have also failed to rise with house prices, meaning more middle-class families are now caught by the tax once intended for the wealthy. Miss Beeny, 42, said: ‘In London, people with half a million pound properties are not wandering around with houses in the Caribbean and gold Rolls Royces. ‘They are people who work their butts off, both of them working full-time busting a gut, both working 15-hours a day so these are not loaded people with million pound bonuses.’ Miss Beeny also criticised Ed Miliband’s plans for a mansion tax on all homes over £2 million. Labour has pledged to introduce the additional tax if they win the general election. She added: ‘I think it’s too low in my opinion, it sounds awful to say £2 million isn’t that much, but it sort of isn’t in some areas. ‘A long time ago, if you had a £2 million house, you would have staff and several cars. ‘But these are normal people who do their own washing and I slightly think it seems as if the threshold is slightly low.’","Television presenter said 'multi-generational' living would help avert social care 'disaster' because families could care for elderly relatives at home .

"An HIV-positive music teacher used gay hookup app Grindr to meet a 15-year-old boy who he used for unprotected sex. Roger 'Joe' Kessler, 43, was charged with sexual assault after he was caught sneaking out of the home of the teenager in McKinney, Texas. Kessler, who teaches at Richardson ISD Academy, admitted to having sex with the underage boy at least four times, including unprotected sex once, WFAA reported. HIV-positive music teacher Roger 'Joe' Kessler, 43, was charged with sexual assault after he was caught sneaking out of the home of the teenager in McKinney, Texas . The teenager's mom called police on Wednesday to report a burglary when she spotted Kessler trying to leave her home through the backyard, . She detained him until McKinney Police arrived and arrested Kessler on the felony charge, and he was booked into Collin County Jail on a $250,000 bond. Grindr bills itself as 'the largest and most popular all-male location-based social network out there . 'The homeowner saw a male suspect fleeing the residence and the homeowner was able to detain the suspect until police arrived,' said Sabrina Boston, of McKinney police. It was determined that Kessler was not a burglar and was at the home to have sexual relations with a 15-year-old resident who lived there. 'We feel very confident the victim was never a student of Mr Kessler's,' Ms Boston added. Police said used he used the popular male-only hookup app Grindr to meet the boy on at least four occasions for sexual relations, without let the teenager know that he was HIV-positive. The smartphone apps bills itself as 'the largest and most popular all-male location-based social network out there', but has earned a reputation as a place for men who are looking for sex to connect with others. Court documents reveal that Kessler even logged on to Grindr and showed police officers at the scene a series of text messages he had exchanged with the boy since meeting on the app. 'I am totally shocked,' said Joanne Jordan, one of Kessler's neighbors, who described him as a 'very nice guy'. The principal at RISD Academy posted a letter on their website saying Kessler has been a teacher there for 14 years with no history of complaints of this nature. The statement added that the music teacher has been placed on administrative leave, pending the resolution of the situation.","Roger 'Joe' Kessler, 43, was charged with sexual assault on the teenager .

"'Just be yourself' is what so many children and adults alike are told every day. But for some this is much more of a challenge than for others. 'If you don't be yourself, you're going to be miserable for your whole life,' is the advice that comes from 11-year-old Isabelle. Isabelle was born as a boy called Campbell, but told her parents last year just weeks after she turned ten she felt as though she was stuck in the wrong body. In a documentary set to air on ABC's Four Corners on Monday evening, she and her family have chosen to share their story to encourage others to speak out. Scroll down for video . Isabelle, 11, was born as a boy called Campbell but told her parents last year she felt like she was trapped in the wrong body . Research shows that children dealing with their gender identity are the most vulnerable between the time they come out and before they get treatment. Because of this Isabelle's parents Naomi, a social worker, and Andrew, who runs their bed and breakfast, knew they had to act fast for the sake of their eldest daughter. 'There was probably a couple of months where she’d start a conversation with me saying I’m just feeling weird, I don’t feel right. She said... I don’t like my body, and I said well... what do you you mean? 'And she said.. I feel like I’m a girl, I’m in the wrong body,' Isabelle's mother Naomi told Four Corners. 'I just said to my mum that I didn't wanna be boy, I felt like a girl and that I’m sick of living in this body,' said Isabelle. Isabelle (right), with dad Andrew, mum Naomi and younger sister Hattie, 8, recently came out at school but says people treat her differently . Isabelle is working with Dr Michelle Telfer, Paediatrician at RCH, who says the support of a child's family is critical to their wellbeing during such a difficult time . 'It took three or four weeks to go through it but just see how upset she was, she would come home miserable (and say) ""I don't want to live"",' her father Andrew revealed, speaking of the many appointments and processes Isabelle had to go through. 'She... just whispered, I just can’t see what the future looks like for me. And that was awful... I think for me that was the point where the confusion kind of melted away a little bit and you just sort of think well god, we’ve only got one job here and this is to help her create a future that she can live with, that she can thrive in,' mum Naomi revealed. The other staggering statistics show that 30 percent of young children who don;t get adequate treatment attempt suicide while 50 percent self-harm. More and more transgender children are presenting at clinics around Australia but experts put this down to children coming out earlier rather than hiding. Currently there are two stages of medical treatments for children who are transgender, the first of which is puberty blockers. These are used so children are able to figure out what they would like to do in the future, giving them time to make a long term decision without any consequences. The 11-year-old says people treat her differently when they find out she's transgender but she just wants to feel like herself . Her dad Andrew revealed how one day Isabelle came home and said 'I don't want to live' like this . Once they stop taking the blockers their body continues to develop as it would have, but if they choose to go ahead they are given cross changing hormones. However in what is already a trying time for these young people, they also need to be assessed by at least five doctors before they can begin any treatment. Plus until recently families in Australia would have to go through court to get permission and access to these treatments. Although puberty blockers can now be obtained without court consent, teenagers still have to get permission to commence the second part of treatment. However families are upset that these young people must still go to court to consent to the treatment. Chief Justice Diana Bryant shares this view, and is keen to see a test case go to the full bench of the Family Court and then the High Court so that court need not be involved in the decision. Currently teenagers have to go through court to access the second part of treatment, but families are fighting against this . 'Well look I'd like to see the High Court have the opportunity to examine these kinds of cases, these gender identity cases and to decide whether or not the court has to be involved at all,' she told Four Corners. Since coming out to her parents Isabelle has also come out at school, but said she has faced a lot of criticism and harsh words from her schoolmates. 'Sometimes people treat me differently when they find out I'm transgender ... People being cruel to me it kind of tells you what not to do,' she revealed in a preview of the program. Isabelle's doctor, Dr Michelle Telfer, Paediatrician and Clinical Lead of Adolescent Medicine at RCH, said that the parent's role supporting their children during such a difficult time is essential to their wellbeing. 'I often hear stories of young people who are not supported by their family, or even outwardly rejected,' Dr Telfer said. Watch the full program Monday evening on Four Corners, 8.30pm ABC.","At 11 years old Isabelle, born as a boy called Campbell, identifies as transgender .

"MP Eric Joyce stocked up on expensive computers and charged them to the taxpayer before quitting his Commons post, it has been claimed. The politician, who was convicted of assault in 2012 after headbutting a fellow MP in a bar, claimed an astonishing £185,635 in expenses last year, new figures have revealed.

"A teacher at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, whose notable alumni include Amy Winehouse, has been arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children. Sylvia Young OBE, 76, confirmed that a male teacher at the school had been arrested about a month ago and had left the premises with police officers. She told the Mail that the man had worked at the school for a number of years and taught on the academic side, rather than at the stage school. A teacher at the Sylvia Young Theatre School (pictured) has been arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children . Police arrested the teacher and seized his personal computer from the fee-paying school for 10-16-year-olds, which has day pupils and boarders. Notable alumni of the central London school include actor Billie Piper, Spice Girl Emma Bunton, presenter Denise van Outen and X Factor star Leona Lewis. The teacher is now on police bail and can have no contact with the school or any child under 16. He has also been suspended from the premises in Marylebone. The incident happened during term time and came during an unrelated assessment by the Independent Schools Inspectorate. Sylvia Young OBE (pictured) confirmed that a male teacher at the school had been arrested about a month ago and had left the premises with police officers . Miss Young added that an email would be sent out to parents at the school tomorrow to ‘allay their fears’ and said that the teacher had been fully vetted. Miss Young told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s true that a teacher has been arrested after allegations that he had inappropriate material on his computer. It’s not linked to the school or our pupils. ‘At the moment, these are still allegations. The person may not even be charged. He might well be innocent. ‘Police came to the office and asked to speak to the person and then he left with them. We had no idea. 'This person, who has worked here a good few years, was fully vetted. ‘It was very quietly done. There was no big police raid. They just asked to see the gentleman and he left with them. ‘We want to assure parents. We’ll send an email to parents tomorrow to allay their fears.’ When asked the age of the children he taught, she said ‘across the range’. She would not confirm what the man taught and what his access to the children at the school was, but said that he was on the academic side. An education source told the Sun on Sunday that it looked like the police were acting on a tip-off. The Sylvia Young Theatre School is the most famous in Britain and has produced many of today’s leading celebrities, singers and actrors. Miss Young is married to Norman Ruffell and the pair have two children, former actresses Frances Ruffelle and Alison Ruffelle. Her granddaughter is pop singer Eliza Doolittle. Sylvia Young opened the school in 1981 and was appointed OBE in 2005.

"A juror in the George Zimmerman trial claims the case ruined her life and says she's had death threats made against her children, lost friends, her job and will soon lose her home as a result of it. The juror, a 36-year-old mother of eight who only identified herself as Maddy during an interview on Inside Edition Thursday, was the only juror who showed her face when she appeared on Good Morning America in July.Since then, Maddy says, she's lost her job as an aide at a nursing home and she and her husband have had to sell most of their possessions. Ruined: The juror known only as Maddy says her life has been ruined as a result of being part of the jury that found George Zimmerman not guilty . Maddy, who is of Puerto Rican descent, was the only minority juror on the all-female panel that found George Zimmerman not guilty. On the July episode of Good Morning America, she told host Robin Roberts that she believed Zimmerman was guilty of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin. 'My first vote was secondary murder,' she said. 'I was the juror who was going to give them the hung jury. Oh, I was. I fought to the end.' Poverty line: Maddy says she lost her job since going public as juror B-29 and has had to sell her possessions, including the family's dining table . Homeless: Maddy and her husband may soon lose her house; she says it's because she was a juror on the Zimmerman trial . She said that she and the rest of the jury were unable to prove Zimmerman intentionally killed Martin, and that under law they had to acquit. 'George Zimmerman got away with murder. But you can't get away from God,' she said. Now, Maddy says that going public as a juror on the divisive case has resulted in ruin. 'My whole life has fallen apart,' she told Inside Edition's Les Trent. First appearance: When Maddy went on Good Morning America she said, 'George Zimmerman got away with murder' She and her husband have slowly sold off their possessions, including their bedroom suite and the family's dining room table. They now sit on the floor of the kitchen to eat their meals.'As we sold one thing, we paid one bill, another bill came,' she said. The Florida mom, who was a full-time nurse's aide, says she kept calling for weeks but wasn't given any work. Divisive case: Slain teen Trayvon Martin's death and the subsequent trial of George Zimmerman made news around the world . Her friends began to shun her and strangers even threatened her children. 'On Facebook, someone wrote I'm gonna the feel same pain as Travon Martin's mom. Which means I'm gonna lose my son. All this blame was put on me. No one is looking at George Zimmerman. He's the one who killed the child,' she said. When asked whether she regrets serving as juror B-29 in the George Zimmerman trial, Maddy's response was unequivocal. 'Yes, I do.'","Juror B-29, identified only as Maddy, says her life has been ruined since she went public as a member of the jury .

"Five teenagers died after they were involved in a crash on Saturday night which left others injured and a road closed for more than five hours. Three males and two females, all aged between 16 and 18, died after the crash which took place at about 9.40pm in foggy conditions on the A630 in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, approximately 650 yards from Archer Way. The five were all travelling in the same Toyota and a man in the other car, a Seat, involved in the crash was taken to hospital with a broken leg. A 21-year-old man from Doncaster, who police believe may have been driving a third vehicle which could have been involved, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail. Scroll down for video . Five teenagers died after a crash on the A630 in Conisbrough near Doncaster on Saturday night. A man was taken to hospital with a broken leg and another arrested and bailed for causing death by dangerous driving . The road in South Yorkshire re-opened at about 3am today - more than five hours after the crash took place. The five teenagers who died were all travelling in a Toyota which collided with a Seat. South Yorkshire Police confirmed two males and a female died last night, and a third male in the early hours of this morning. The second female was taken to hospital with critical injuries and died this morning. A spokeswoman said formal identification of the teenagers had not yet taken place, but they are all aged between 16 and 18 and are from the Doncaster area. Sergeant Pete Serhatlic told BBC Radio Sheffield: 'It's absolutely horrific, it's an extremely sad situation. 'To a certain degree it's pretty unbelievable that five young people have lost their lives in an incident like this.' The crash took place in Conisbrough, about 100 yards from a crash which killed three teenagers in 2011 . A man driving the Seat was taken to hospital last night with a broken leg. The long straight road has a 40mph speed limit on the edge of the village that is flanked by woodland and countryside. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service was called to the accident last night and posted on Twitter: 'We send our deepest condolences to the families affected by the fatal RTC we attended last night.' This morning the only evidence of the crash was a South Yorkshire Police witness appeal board placed by the side of the road..

"There were calls today to shut down the BlackBerry Messenger service which is thought to have played a key role in helping mobilise looters involved in the riots across London. Mike Butcher, a technology journalist and digital adviser to Boris Johnson, said it was 'unbelievable' that the BBM service had not been disabled. Messages on the service, along with posts on Twitter, helped spread the locations of riots like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers together to attack neighbourhoods throughout the weekend. Hackney: Smash and grab - A man jump kicks a store front window to get in and loot . Hackney: Looters queue to get in to a convenience store to get hold of its goods . Hackney: Hooded thieves take what they can from inside the store . The messenger service on BlackBerry . handsets, an instant, cheap and safe form of communication, helped . galvanise looters across London and nationwide over the weekend. The . BlackBerry itself is now the smartphone favoured by young people in . this country, and is used by a massive 37 per cent of British teens. Unlike social networks like Facebook and Twitter, messages sent through BBM cannot be traced back to the sender's phone. For the majority of teens with BlackBerrys, BBMS has replaced regular SMS messages which still cost around 10p each to send. BlackBerry UK were forced to deny weekend reports that they planned to disable the service. Research . in Motion, the firm behind BlackBerry and BBM, instead said they would . ‘engage with the authorities’ following the riots. Today, Mr Butcher described the BBM . service as 'text messaging with steroids', as Blackberry itself denied . reports it had planned to disable the messenging service. Mr Butcher had tweeted last night: 'It is unbelievable that @UK_BlackBerry is not shutting down BBM right now.' He told the BBC Today programme this . morning: 'Mobile phones have become weaponised in their capability of . spreading information about where to target next. 'There is evidence that BBM is an . encrypted, very secure, safe, fast, cheap, easy way for disaffected . urban youths to spread messages for their next target. 'It's like text messaging with . steroids - you can send messages to hundreds of people and once it's . gone from your phone it cannot be traced back to you.' BlackBerry UK had to deny reports over the weekend that it planned to shut down the messenging service. The firm instead tweeted that it would help the authorities with their investigation. Mr Butcher said police need to communicate with phone firms like BlackBerry to help anticipate future disturbances. He added: 'BlackBerry itself has said these messages are very hard to trace. Obviously there is going to have to be some kind of communication between the police and companies like BlackBerry to try to get the information befre the riots happen'. Mr Butcher has since removed the tweet from his Twitter feed and qualified his comments on the Today programme by adding that 'you could not shut down BBM because information would still be rooted around'. Young looters were accused of an opportunistic ‘Supermarket Sweep’ motivated by nothing other than greed. Dozens were filmed as they disappeared into the night with their arms laden with plasma TVs, laptops and sports clothes. Claims that rampant lawlessness was motivated by the death of Mark Duggan at the hands of police was quickly exposed as a lie. Some of those involved in attacks on stores in Enfield, Tottenham and Oxford Circus were barely old enough to be arrested. Messages on social networking sites and mobile phones spread like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers, many covering their faces with masks and hoods, to shops and high streets. In some areas they were left to roam freely, forming queues outside smashed stores and pausing to try on footwear. Pictures of the young thieves posing with their loot were soon posted on the internet accompanied by gloating messages. Last night on Rye Lane in Peckham, a mob of 30 black youths wearing bandanas forced open the metal grill of a jewellers before smashing their way into the shop. Croydon: An Argos store was smashed into and looted on Monday night . [caption . Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Now share your opinion . Children, who bystanders say could . have been as young as seven, rushed inside to grab what they could. Scotland Yard revealed that an 11-year-old boy is the youngest of more . than 215 people who have been arrested over the rioting. He has since . been charged with burglary. The vast majority of those arrested . for offences including burglary, violent disorder and theft were aged in . their teens or early 20s. Many . of those involved were rallied by calls spread through mobile phone . messages and social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One BlackBerry message urged people to arm themselves with hammers and to bring cars, vans and even trollies to help them cart off stolen goods. It added: ‘What ever ends [area] your from put your ballys [balaclavas] on link up and cause havoc, just rob everything. Police can’t stop it.’ Another message referred to Oxford Circus where a mob of about 50 youths attacked several businesses. A policeman said last night that children involved in the rioting and stealing were inspired by video game Grand Theft Auto. The 18-rated computer game is popular among teenagers, with many having the game given to them by their parents. In riot-hit Tottenham a police officer said: ‘These are bad people who did this. Kids are out of control. When I was young it was all Pacman and board games. Now they’re playing Grand Theft Auto and want to live it for themselves.’ The game, which is made by  Edinburgh-based firm Rockstar North, has been criticised for depicting carjackings, drive-by shootings and prostitution. It has also been accused of encouraging juvenile crime in Britain. Players are expected to commit crimes and build up their power in a fictional city by selling drugs and killing rival gangsters. There have been fears that some gamers may try to recreate scenes from the games for real. It called on ‘everyone from all sides of London’ to meet up, smash up shops and get some ‘free stuff’, adding: ‘if you see a fed [police] ... SHOOT!’ Lambeth Council leader Steve Reed condemned the ‘opportunistic looting’ as ‘thieving on a mass scale’. He added: ‘Somebody described it as gangs of kids doing Supermarket Sweep’. This is a reference to the 1990s gameshow in which contestants raced round a store to get as many items in a trolley as they could in a limited time. ‘It was Curry’s where they were after plasma screen TVs and H&M and Foot Locker where it was clothes and trainers,’ said Mr Reed. ‘It was thieving on a mass scale. I’ve heard stories of people actually trying on clothes and using wheelie bins to fill with goods. It wasn’t about social issues, it was an opportunity to go on the rob.’ Police warned that those who used the internet and mobile phones to issue inflammatory rallying calls could face prosecution. Intelligence experts are scouring public messages for evidence of those behind the mayhem. But . they could be impeded by the increased use of encrypted BlackBerry . devices to spread calls to arms among networks of friends. It . has emerged that the ‘shadow social network’ played a key role in . co-ordinated violence in Enfield, Tottenham and Oxford Circus. Police . are trawling through a mass of evidence that some of the worst scenes . were co-ordinated by rioters using mobile phones and the internet. They fear incendiary messages urging thugs to arm themselves with knives and hammers were circulated via BlackBerry devices. Brixton: A pawnbroker is hit by a gang of hooded thieves as a photographer watches on . Brixton: A WHSmith shop on Brixton Road is one of several looted by hundreds of rioters . Dalston: Youths are seen running with boxes near near the area's Kingsland shopping centre . Further updates boasted that police were powerless to stop the carnage as lawlessness spread quickly across London. Looter: Pictures put on Twitter showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including TVs and mobile phones . Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh said those caught using Twitter, BlackBerry messaging and other sites to stir up violence could be prosecuted. Asked whether those responsible for ‘inflammatory postings’ could be arrested, he replied: ‘Absolutely. Whether it be verbal communication, a placard or Twitter. This is the emerging way that we do policing.’ The use of BlackBerry smartphones is a worrying development for police because they are very difficult to monitor. They were once the preserve of business people looking to check their emails on the move but the messenger application, known as BBM, has proved irresistible to teenagers. It offers a text message-style service which is instant, free and private where users can exchange updates with individuals or large groups. The application has also been seized on by criminals, and security conscious businesses, because it is very difficult to intercept. Several countries, including the United Arab Emirates and India, have complained that BlackBerry messages are too secure and may be used by terrorists. In Enfield, 17-year-old witness Alice said she received a message on her phone telling people to come armed with knives and hammers. She said: ‘It was all planned. On BBM . there was a broadcast to everyone, which goes to everyone on someone’s . contact list, telling us to meet up with weapons.’ Mark Duggan, whose fatal shooting sparked some of the violence, sent his last message via BlackBerry messenger. He . told his girlfriend that the ‘Feds are following me’ from the back of a . minicab just minutes before the deadly confrontation in Tottenham last . Thursday. A BlackBerry spokesman suggested that the company may help police trace those responsible for stirring up violence. He said: ‘We feel for those impacted by the riots in London. We have engaged with the authorities to assist in any way we can.’","Technology adviser to Boris Johnson likens BBM service to 'text-messaging with steroids'.

"The parents of a young aristocrat who claim their son was killed by police in Kenya have called a report into his death paid for with British foreign aid 'a shameful whitewash'. Former Marlborough schoolboy Alexander Monson, 28, died in May 2012, hours after being detained on suspicion of smoking cannabis in the coastal resort of Diani. Last week his mother, Hilary, 60, was told by the country's Independent Policing Oversight Authority – set up with money from the UK's £125 million annual aid to Kenya – that her son died from a drugs overdose. Alexander Monson, 28, died hours after being detained by Kenyan police in the coastal resort of Diani . However, his father, Nicholas, the 12th Lord Monson, said autopsy reports show his son had no drugs in his body and had suffered 'blunt force trauma' to his head and self-defence injuries. He said: 'The report is a shameful whitewash. I have been given the names of my son's killers, who are Kenyan police officers.' Alexander's sister, Isabella, 28, said: 'My mother sat open-mouthed as she was read this report. She told them: 'You should be ashamed of yourselves.' We just want answers.' Alexander died of a massive blood clot on his brain after being taken to hospital for treatment. His mother Hilary Monson, 60, (centre) was told her son died from a drugs overdose, pictured as she was prevented from entering the Ukunda police station . According to local police, he was about to be interviewed in custody when he complained of feeling sick and was taken to hospital. His mother, who was with him when he died, says he was handcuffed to the hospital bed. A family spokesman said he was told by hospital doctors that police brought him in claiming he had overdosed. The damage to his skull was revealed only during the autopsy, which also found he had not overdosed. Described by his father as a ‘golden boy’, Alexander had a degree in psychology from London’s City University and went on to study at Chelsea Art College where he gained a scholarship. Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother and sister, who run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian Ocean resort of Diani. His father, Nicholas, (right) the 12th Lord Monson, said autopsy reports show his son had no drugs in his body and had suffered 'blunt force trauma' to his head and self-defence injuries .","Alexander Monson, 28, died hours after being detained by Kenyan police .

"Australia's Attorney General George Brandis was left red faced after he got sunburnt at the G20 summit this weekend after forgetting to slip, slop, slap. Mr Brandis, who is one of the country's most high profile politicians, got a very red head as he waited for US President Barack Obama in the 40 degree heat at RAAF Base Amberley ahead of the meeting.

Another user @jonkudelka posted: 'George Brandis' sunburn just another example of the dangers of solar power'. Mr Brandis was one of the high ranking Australian officials that apparently snubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin, reported Channel 9. But when German Chancellor Angela Merkel's plane arrived on the tarmac five minutes a smiling Mr Brandis and Queensland Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney rushed out to meet her. Daily Mail Australia approached Mr Brandis' office for comment and they are yet to respond.

The news comes as new figures show Australian teenagers are turning their backs on sunbathing as the figures have dropped from 38 per cent compared to 60 per cent ten years ago. Professor Ian Olver, the Cancer Council's chief executive officer, said this figure had not shown 'significant' change since 2003-04, with the number of teenagers reporting getting sunburnt in 2013-14 dropping only one per cent compared to 10 years ago. He added that although two in three Australians would be diagnosed with skin cancer by age 70, adolescents underestimated their skin cancer risk, with one in two rating their chances of developing skin cancer as 'low'. 'It's wonderful to see teens understanding that a tan isn't the hallmark of health it was once made out to be,' he said. 'However, while most don't actively seek a tan, we do want them to actively protect themselves. 'Skin cancer doesn't have to be an inevitability. Take the recommended sun protection measures and the odds of preventing it are in your favour.'","Australia's Attorney General George Brandis got caught out on at the G20 .

"A furious single mother has spoken of her anger after council workers highlighted racist abuse scrawled on to her front door by covering the still-visible word with black paint. Leona Jarvis, from Selly Oak, Birmingham, called the police after discovering that the word 'n*****' had been hacked into the door to her flat. The council came to repair the woodwork, painting a black square over the graffiti - but the word is still visible. Leona Jarvis, 26, was furious after council workers painted a black square over racist abuse on her door, but left the derogatory word still visible . The mother-of-one found the word 'n*****' on her front door in Selly Oak, Birmingham, on November 2 . Miss Jarvis, who lives in the flat with her three-year-old son, accused Birmingham City Council of making the situation worse. She said: 'I think it's disgraceful, disgusting. They've just drawn people's attention to the word.' The 26-year-old student discovered the derogatory word on the green door of her Courtway House flat on November 2. The next day, she called West Midlands Police to tell them of the racist abuse. It is not the first time Miss Jarvis has faced racism in Birmingham, she said, saying she had hurtful words hurled at her while she was walking around a shopping centre recently, but the incident has left her shaken. 'I don't fear for my life, but I'm on edge,' she said. Birmingham City Council say the black square was a temporary measure and that they will fix the door permanently soon . West Midlands Police believe children may be responsible for the abuse at the flat in Courtway House over the Halloween weekend . 'When it was Halloween I didn't leave my flat over the weekend, so I can't be sure when the damage was caused. 'A police officer told me kids may have done it. I suffer from depression and this hasn't helped.' Her shock turned to anger after the council's botched paint job, however. Miss Jarvis said: 'If nothing else, it looks unsightly. But it singles my property out.' Despite her experience, Leona wants to stay in the council block, her home for the last three years. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'We take reports of hate crime very seriously and would urge anyone with information to contact us on 101.' A council spokesman said: 'Birmingham City Council takes hate crime extremely seriously and in this case the immediate response was to paint over the graffiti as a temporary measure. 'We understand how distressing this incident must have been and will return to the property shortly to carry out more permanent repairs.'","Mother Leona Jarvis had the word 'n*****' scrawled on to her front door .

"One of Afghanistan's most outspoken feminist MPs has survived an assassination attempt which killed three people. Shukria Barakzai, a former journalist who once ran a secret school for girls under Taliban rule, escaped with minor injuries after the suicide blast this morning in the capital Kabul. Officials said the attacker was driving a car which attempted to ram the 42-year-old's vehicle as she headed to Parliament, where she is one of 69 women MPs in the 249-seat chamber. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Shukria Barakzai, one of 69 female MPs in Afghanistan's Parliament, leaves the scene of a suicide bomb attack today which killed three people in the capital Kabul including a young girl . Shaken: The MP looked dazed but coherent as she walked from the bomb scene carrying her handbag . Blackened: The MP's car after the blast. She said from hospital: 'I survived because of my people's prayers' Deaths: Three civilians including a young girl were killed, and their bodies were stretchered from the scene . The attacker then detonated explosives, triggering a blast which was heard across the capital and drew hundreds of people to the scene. Interior Ministry spokesmen said three civilian bystanders, including a young girl, were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded including Ms Barakzai's driver. She told the Reuters news agency from her hospital bed: 'I survived because of my people's prayers'. She was seen walking away from her car, looking dazed but coherent and carrying her handbag, in video footage shot after the incident which circulated online. It showed twisted metal lying in a crater in the dirt and the front of the MP's silver vehicle was badly damaged and blackened in the blast. Another yellow car was reduced mostly to a mangled metal shell. At least one body was seen lying on the ground as another victim walked away from the scene with blood streaming down her face. Video courtesy of 1TV News Afghanistan . Mangled: Another car was left twisted and pockmarked by the blast, which was heard across the capital . Crime: The attack came amid a string of assaults by insurgents for the Taliban, which once ruled the country . Crowds: A member of the Afghan security forces runs as hundreds of people gather at the bombing site . Sirens blared as hundreds of civilians gathered at the scene in a bid to help. Ms Barakzai is a high-profile advocate of women's rights and media freedom. She founded the Women's Mirror weekly magazine which specialised in campaigning journalism before becoming an MP ten years ago. A close ally of new President Ashraf Ghani, she has received several international awards and was named Woman of the Year by BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour in 2005. No one has formally taken responsibility for today's attack. However, it is the latest chapter in escalating violence as the U.S.-backed Afghan government comes under fire from insurgents for the Taliban, which ruled the country before being toppled by Western forces after the September 11 attacks. During the Taliban's rule women's rights were severely restricted, and the 69 women MPs were seen as a mark of progress in the country. Progress: Ms Barakzai ran a secret school for girls under the Taliban then became a campaigning journalist and later a politician in Afghanistan's Parliament, which has 69 women - a higher proportion than Britain . Outspoken: The MP on the campaign trail in 2005. She is not the first female politician to be targeted . Unstable: The attack comes as U.S. and UK troops withdraw from the country after 13 years of bloodshed . Blow: Investigators at the scene today. Last week the Taliban made a bid to kill Kabul's police chief . At almost 28 per cent of MPs, women make up a higher proportion of Afghanistan's Parliament than Britain's - where the figure is just 23 per cent. But the situation remains unstable amid mounting attacks as British and U.S. forces prepare to leave the country after 13 years. Last week the Taliban made an assassination attempt on Kabul's chief of police, General Mohammad Zahir Zahir. And it is not the first attack on the female Afghan MP. Former teacher Fariba Ahmadi Kakar was abducted at gunpoint in August last year when insurgents stopped her car on a highway. She and her children were returned a month later, reportedly in exchange for five Taliban fighters and six family members.","Shukria Barakzai was one of 69 women MPs elected to Kabul government .

"Ever wondered how good you look in bed? Well now you can have the answer. An app on Google Glass called Glance will soon allow users to see sex from your partner's point of view. With the addition of your phone, you can also see what sex looks like from another angle in the room. Glance app will stream the view from your partner's Google glasses to yours. Users can also record the view to watch back later on an iPhone. It claims to bring a completely new perspective on personal experiences . To get started, a couple who are both wearing Google glasses will have to say 'Ok, glass, it's time.' The technology will then stream what they are seeing to each other. To end the session, the person wearing the glasses just needs to say, 'Ok Glass, pull out.' The app was created by a team of three people, who came up with the idea during a hackathon in London at the end of last year. Since Google Glasses were invented, a range of apps have been designed to enhance the product (picture posed by model) They said of the invention: 'Glance let’s you see two different perspectives, seamlessly. It changes the way you experience something personal. Like sex. 'It’s an experiment. We are learning on the fly. Having sex with Glance brings a completely new perspective.' The new Glance app will give men and women the opportunity to see what they look like in bed (picture posed by models) Anyone who wants to watch the footage back for a critique can also save the stream as a film. But the inventors are keen to point out that they have strict privacy guidelines and all footage is only available on individual phones, not on the app database. They said: 'Your videos belong to you. Not the Internet. Couples will be able to record the view from their glasses straight onto their phone to watch back later (picture posed by models) 'That’s why we’ve decided to upload anything to the cloud. And not host any videos. Not only that, but if you leave the app, everything disappears forever. 'Unless you deliberately save to your camera roll, everything is wiped.'

"Ingenious or incredibly dangerous? A DIY Gatling gun created using six SKS semi-automatic rifles has been sold for $3,450. And the homemade uber-weapon - dubbed the 'Redneck Obliterator' - is said to be perfectly legal, too. All that is known about the creator is that he is a 'bespoke gunsmith', according to Vocativ. Scroll down for video . Firepower: This makeshift Gatling gun, created six SKS semi-automatic rifles, has sold for $3,450 at auction .

Dangerous: One SKS rifle can fire 35–40 rounds each minute and this weapon has six rifles . However the blaster went under the hammer at the Rock Island Auction in Illinois. Both the seller and the buyer chose to remain anonymous. However apparently the latter nabbed a bargain. Gatling guns are considered the first successfully-made machine guns and were created by Richard Gatling. It used a multi-barrel design that would fire a single round once each rotation, usually operator by a hand-crank. They were first seen during the American Civil War in 1860s. Replicas sell for prices starting from about $6,500. However genuine Gatling guns sell for up to $75,000. 'I can't decide if I'm awed, appalled, or a little bit of both,' Bob Owens, editor of pro-gun website Bearing Arms, told Vocativ. Ian McCollum, who edits the website Forgotten Weapons, poked fun at the 'Redneck Obliterator' - or at least its name. 'Congrats to the new owner!' he wrote in a Facebook post Sunday.

"Two convicted cannibals have been rearrested in Pakistan after a young boy's head was discovered in their home. The gruesome discovery of a three-year-old's head was made in the house of Mohammad Arif Ali, 35, and his brother Mohammad Farman Ali, 30. The pair, from the small town of Darya Khan in the country's interior, had previously served two years in jail for cannibalism and were only released last year. Scroll down for video . Farman Ali and Arif Ali, two brothers previously convicted of cannibalism, are taken to a local court after they were arrested again for cannibalism, in Sargodha, Pakistan . At the time, local police said the two men had dug up more than 100 corpses from the local graveyard and eaten them. Arif and Farman have now been rearrested as an investigation gets underway in to the grim discovery at his house. District police chief, Ameer Abdullah, said officers swooped after residents complained of a bad smell coming from the brothers' home. 'Residents informed police after a stench emanated from the house of the two brothers,' he said.

"Speaks for itself: Amazon users are furious that the product is being sold and called the tops 'disgusting' Amazon has removed a T-shirt range bearing sickening messages about sex crime and violence towards women. The T-shirts pulled from sale by the online retailer included phrases like Keep Calm And Rape A Lot, Keep Calm And Punch Her, Keep Calm And Grope On, Keep Calm and Choke Her, Keep Calm and Knife Her and Keep Calm And Kill Her. The U.S. firm that makes the shirts, Solid Gold Bomb, blamed  a ‘computer’ error for the offensive slogans. But Tory MP Caroline Dinenage said: . ‘These are ridiculous, mindless products for anybody to attempt to sell. It is absurd to say they were manufactured in error.’ A flood of complaints on social-networking websites prompted the decision by Amazon. Solid Gold Bomb sold the short-sleeved t-shirts for between £15 and £17 on the warehouse website. But potential customers were clearly . not willing to buy the deeply offensive t-shirts, slamming both Amazon . and the clothes shop, which has its headquarters in the UK. Users branded the shop and its message 'disgusting' and 'disturbing'. But on Solid Gold Bomb's Facebook page, . someone wrote under the company name that they had 'no idea' that the . message was printed and said it had been computer generated.

Twitter users vented their fury that the t-shirts 'promote rape' and also poke fun at the serious sexual assault. Angry users urged others to email the clothes shop and Amazon to express their disgust and demands that it be removed from sale. Amazon reveiwers flooded the 'feedback' panel with comments expressing their thoughts on the 'awful' product . Amazon customers quickly rounded on the company and the seller, saying that the people who wore the branded shirts are 'scum' The brightly-coloured tops' message are a twist on the 'Keep Calm and Carry On' morale-boosting slogan used in World War II by the British Government. The offensive t-shirts were a result of a problem with a computer programme used by manufacturers Solid Gold Bomb. The programme uses a list of words to generate a mocked-up graphic of the t-shirt that appears to shoppers on Amazon. It generates random variations on the 'Keep Calm and... ' formula and then prints them on demand if someone decides they like it and order it. Founder Michael Fowler says the problem arose because some of the words in the company's list of 700 words - chosen for design and length reasons - 'both individually and in combination were or became offensive'. He said: 'This was a computer error of my creation and I accept my responsibility in the matter.' The message has experienced a boom in popularity in recent years, and sparked a trend in shops producing products such as tea-towels, posters and cushions, bearing the slogan, or a play on it. Solid Gold Bomb, who produce the t-shirts, was created and launched from Melbourne, Australia, and describes itself as a 'small global t-shirt company'. They write on their website about their range: 'We managed to list our Keep Calm and Carry On parody series on the site. 'Bake On, Beat On and Teach On are Proving Very Popular! Rock On!'

"Rockets could take off from a spaceport in Britain within five years after ministers launched a search for a suitable site. The UK Space Agency has been tasked with opening a site by 2018, with the first flights having lift-off within a year. A remote site, away from homes and businesses, will be required in the plan to better prepare the UK to deal with threats from space – and offer trips to space tourists. The government has launched a search for a site for a spaceport to become the UK's answer to Cape Canaveral . Space minister David Willetts said the Government wanted to make sure Britain was more resilient to risks to space services and capabilities and enhance national security interests in space. Experts from the defence and space industries will now work with transport agenies and business groups to draw up a list of potential sites for the spaceport. Mr Willetts said: ‘We want an area where there is not much civil airspace, where it is not very busy,” said Mr Willetts. ‘It might be smaller airports, it might be underused or disused RAF airfields. ‘We’re starting to look at relatively remote parts of the country,’ he told the Telegraph. Science minister David Willetts said the port would help protect Britain from threats from space . ‘We’re . rediscovering our great tradition of developing space vehicles and . having a spaceport where we can launch will be part of that long term . plan.’ He is working with Europe Minister David Lidington, Defence Equipment Minister Philip Dunne and Immigration Minister James Brokenshire in a cross-Whitehall effort to draw up the UK's first ever National Space Security Policy. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson want to find a Europe base for his Virgin Galatctic space tourism enterprise. Launches will begin in New Mexico in the US, but Sir Richard is looking for a site closer to home. Sites in Scotland, Cornwall and Wales have previously been suggested to become Britain’s answer to Cape Canaveral. Next year British astronaught Tim Peake will go into space to join the International Space Station next year. But he will have to take off from Kazahkstan or French Guiana. The cross-government group looking for a site is expected to report back by July. Mr Willetts highlighted close . relationships with the United States, France and Germany and pledged the . Government would continue to work on ‘transparency and . confidence-building measures’ at the United Nations. Sir Richard Branson expects to start Virgin Galactic space tourism flights from next year, taking off from New Mexico in the US . Mr Willetts said: ‘The policy also sets out how we intend to monitor and prepare against threats and hazards which might harm these interests, and our wider national security. ‘It identifies potential threats from state-sponsored and criminal attacks against satellite capabilities and services, and hazards such as severe solar storms and growing debris in space and how these might be prevented or the impact mitigated. ‘Through the National Space Security Policy, the Government will foster a closer space security partnership with industry and science that would allow more pooling of space security expertise and better sharing of information on space security risks, and on ways and opportunities to mitigate these. ‘We recognise that maintaining and enhancing co-operation with our international partners is also fundamental to our space security objectives.’","UK Space Agency needs to find a site away from homes and businesses .

"The Advertising Standards Authority is to formally investigate Channel 4's advertising for Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, after the Irish Traveller community successfully appealed the regulator's original decision. Adverts used to promote the show have been criticised for using the words: 'Bigger. Fatter. Gypsier' in large letters across images of travellers, including one of young children. The London Travellers' Unit and two members of the London Assembly have likened the word 'gypsier' to other terms deemed racist and abusive. In March the ASA dismissed more than 370 complaints against the campaign, but decided that an investigation was unnecessary as Channel 4's TV and billboard ads were not likely to cause widespread offence. Victory: The Advertising Standards Authority is to formally investigate Channel 4's controversial advertising  for Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, after the Irish Traveller community successfully appealed the regulator's original decision . Statement: Billboards advertising the hit show across the country have seen graffiti scrawled across . But now the ASA has made an embarrassing climb down and admitted its decision not to review the complaints was 'flawed.' The green light for the investigation to commence was given after a meeting between Lord Smith and independent reviewer Sir Hayden Phillips, a former senior civil servant. The decision to investigate the series ,which has pulled in up to 8 million viewers, is damaging to the show's sponsor Honda and the car company admitted some viewers had rang them directly to lodge a complaint. The posters appeared all over the country on billboards this year in the run up to the launch of the six-part series . They sparked outrage among the traveller community in Hackney, in East London, who even staged a street protest in opposition. John Biggs is one of the members upset by the posters. He said: 'Channel 4 should show greater respect and restraint.' Protest: The London Gypsy and Traveller Unit hold banners and placards reading: 'Ban these adverts and say sorry' He wrote to the broadcaster with Jennette Arnold, who is also a member of the assembly, saying the adverts were 'totally inappropriate, offensive and disrespectful' and raised concerns that they would cause more 'ill feeling and discrimination'. Meanwhile, travellers said they have been upset by the show and have found it 'insulting and degrading'. The documentary makers have also been accused of portraying traveller men as 'menacing'. The accusations came as earlier this month, the sons of Big Fat Gypsy Weddings star Paddy Doherty admitted their role in a violent street brawl between feuding gypsy clans. Several men were involved in the punch-up when rival families clashed outside Manchester magistrates court in Spinningfields. Britain's youngest Gypsy bride: Earlier this month Danielle Maughan, wed in a lavish ceremony costing £50,000 on the hit television show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, was one day past her 16th birthday when she married 21-year-old Brendan Joyce . Happily ever after: Danielle Maughan, 16, and her new husband Brendan Joyce, 21, walk back down the aisle as Mr and Mrs after the ceremony . The fight broke out after brothers John and Dougie Joyce appeared before magistrates, accused of attacking Paddy Doherty, their cousin. John, David and Simon Doherty - Paddy’s sons - were arrested with members of the Joyce and Ward families after the fight, in the city’s busy business district last summer. Eight men have now admitted their involvement in the violence which erupted as part of a long-standing feud between the groups and will be sentenced in June. The popular show follows young gypsy couples in the run-up to their weddings and is notable for showcasing brides' extraordinarily extravagant wedding dresses and the provocative outfits of their teenage wedding guests. In a statement yesterday the ASA said: 'Following a recommendation from the Independent Reviewer of ASA adjudications, the ASA Council has decided that its original decision not  to conduct a formal investigation into complaints about the Channel 4 Broadcasting Ltd’s advertising campaign for the TV programme Big Fat Gypsy Wedding was flawed. 'It has decided that a formal investigation should now commence. 'In their evaluation, the Council noted that it had made its original decision without the benefit of knowing that the Irish Traveller Movement of Britain had complained and that this was a material fact to which they should have had regard.'","Travellers likened the word 'Gypsier' to terms deemed racist and abusive .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s beloved pet dog, Lupo, is set to be immortalised in a series of children’s books and toys. Featuring a picture of the pampered cocker spaniel on the cover, The Adventures of Lupo the Royal Dog: The Secret of Windsor Castle, will hit bookshelves in September - with three further stories and a range of merchandise to follow. Its author Abigail King took her inspiration from the frequent walks she enjoys with her own spaniel, Lily, in Kensington Gardens, where Lupo is also exercised. Scroll down for video . Author Aby King has written a series of books 'inspired' by the Duchess of Cambridge's own pet dog 'Lupo' The royal pedigree came from a litter born to Kate’s family dog, Ella, in 2011 and was brought back to Kensington Palace at Christmas that year. Ironically given the new book deal, William and Kate’s spokesman at first refused to even confirm their new pet’s existence, saying it was a ‘private matter’ - even though the Queen and other dog-loving members of the royal family happily release details of their animals on the royal website. ‘We don’t want to breach our own privacy,’ an aide said. There was then another month-long stand-off after royal aides also declined to reveal the puppy’s name. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have created a number of companies to protect their 'brand' from people trying to cash-in on their fame . It eventually emerged after a seven-year-old boy simply asked the Duchess when she visited a primary school in Oxfordshire. After being handed a toy dog by young Abubakr Hussain, Kate said she would name it after her own pet, Lupo, which means Lupo in Italian and is a derivative of the Latin word for the animal. The pup now has its paws firmly under the table with Kate even telling one well-wisher who gave her a gift for the dog on the family’s three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand last month that she was missing Lupo terribly. ‘Everyone gives presents for George but nobody knows how much I’m missing my own dog,’ she said. ‘This is the first present I’ve received for my dog and I’m really happy because I do miss him. He’ll be really happy to have this to play with.’ The stuffed toy was then flown back to the UK - First Class - with other official gifts. Although somewhat overshadow by the birth of Prince George, the Lupo books will bring the royal pooch back under the spotlight. The series has been acquired in the UK by international giant Hodder Children’s Books, who also publish Enid Blyton, and describe it as a ‘One Hundred and One Dalmatians for today’s readers’. It is hoped that a deal may be struck for the US rights to the book. In the first story Lupo is accused of a serious crime he did not commit - an attack on a swan, which are protected under the Queen’s charter. In his efforts to prove his innocence, he crosses paths with the dastardly corgi Vulcan - named after one of the Queen’s actual pets, a corgi-dachshund cross known as a Dorgi - who has discovered a centuries old secret which he is determined to ‘use against England and the crown’. Members of the Royal Family including William, Kate, George and the Queen, all make appearances in the book, but the focus is very much on the animals of the Royal Household and their adventures. Miss King has now trademarked Lupo with an eye to cashing in on the valuable merchandising market, putting his name on everything from action figures to bath toys, board games, cuddly toys and even scooters. The Adventures of Lupo details the escapades of the royal pets and features several members of the Royal Family . The move to capture that market is particular interesting given the Mail’s revelation earlier this year that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had secretly set up firms to protect their own ‘brand’ and ‘intellectual property rights’. It enables the couple to sell officially-endorsed products and take action against anyone selling items that could harm their ‘image’. A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment on the book deal yesterday. Privately educated Miss King, 38, says she has never meet Kate or Lupo personally, although she frequently writes about walking with the royal pet or how his favourite food is toast on social media accounts such as Facebook. She insists the books were simply inspired by walking her own dog, Lilly, whom she describes as Lupo’s ‘girlfriend’, in Kensington gardens in the spring of 2012. She said: ‘I’d seen in the papers that Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge now had their very own Lilly - a black cocker spaniel named Lupo - and I started to think about what life as a royal puppy, with palaces and parks at your disposal, might be like.’ The royal family inhabits a ‘secret’, behind-closed-doors world we never really get to see. Could a series of books about a dog like Lupo help children explore it? ‘Over the next few months, the idea never strayed far from my mind. I began to see the scope for mystery and adventure - secret passageways and tunnels in royal palaces, portals to other times. A royal menagerie of characters began to form in my head. ‘ . First time author Miss King has a tragic family history. Her mother was a successful model and actress in the 1960s, who died of leukaemia when she was just 14. And in 2008 her property developer fiancée shot himself just five weeks before their wedding amid the collapse of his business empire. Miss King, who recently re-married, says her dog, Lily, was instrumental in bringing joy back into her life. Her agent Vicki Field added: ‘It is a really exciting and imaginative children’s book that draws its reader into the imaginary world of Lupo, the royal dog. ‘Abigail has included fleeting references to the Duke, Duchess and Prince George as well as other members of the royal family, but the focus is very much on the animals of the Royal Household - dogs, corgis, cats, mice and the like. We are very excited about the project.’","Author Aby King is using the royal pets as inspiration for her new range of books .

"The first NHS trust to be run entirely by a private firm has one of the highest levels of patient satisfaction in the country. Hinchingbrooke, a hospital in Cambridgeshire with 160,000 patients, was on the verge of going bust when it was taken over by Circle last year. But NHS figures show it is now ranked as one of the highest for patient happiness and waiting times. Patient satisfaction: Hinchingbrooke Hospital, the first NHS trust to be run entirely by a private firm, is ranked as one of the highest for patient happiness and waiting times . The company running the trust has slashed losses at the hospital by 60 per cent and will soon begin to pay off burgeoning debts built up over years of mismanagement. The takeover deal, which saved the hospital from closing down, is seen as a blueprint for the future of many NHS trusts. The George Eliot Hospital in Warwickshire is already considering adopting the model. The NHS is attempting to improve patient care drastically in the wake of a damning report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire, where up to 1,200 died needlessly. It blamed the horrific care on a culture of targets across the health service with managers inclined to ignore the concerns of frontline staff. Damning report: The NHS is attempting to improve patient care drastically in the wake of the scandal at Mid Staffordshire, where up to 1,200 died needlessly . Experts say the system in place at Hinchingbrooke, which empowers doctors and nurses, could be used in dozens of other struggling NHS trusts. Jim O’Connell, chief executive of the hospital, said: ‘We put more of the decision-making in the hands of the doctors and nurses. He added: ‘There are still a lot of inefficiencies in the NHS because it is the bureaucracy that has built up over all these years, and we have to change that. ‘Any changes that we make have to be good for patients and good for efficiency as well.’ Patient satisfaction has risen to 85 . per cent, placing Hinchingbrooke in the top six of the East of England’s . 46 hospitals. The feedback is calculated by asking families and . patients whether they would recommend the hospital, then weighting the . answers compared to local peers. Previously the trust was among the lowest ranking for satisfaction. Figures also show that Hinchingbrooke . has risen from being one of the worst performing trusts to one of the . best under the private firm’s management.When Circle took over, the . hospital was consistently near the bottom of the 46 trusts, with many . patients waiting more than four hours in A&E. It now tops the list for short waiting times, seeing 98.2 per cent of patients within the required window.The hospital also ranks fifth for the proportion of patients with suspected cancer having tests within a fortnight. Before the takeover it had missed targets every month since June 2010. It now treats 89 per cent of cancer patients within 62 days, beating the 85 per cent target. Circle saved millions of pounds a year by cutting out arduous paperwork and middle management. Under the former ownership, a lengthy form had to be filled out every time a lightbulb needed changing, in a process that often took more than a week. The group, which runs independent hospitals in Reading and Bath, inherited debts of £39million with the project. The hospital had been expected to lose £10million last year, but this has been whittled down to  £3.7million by the Circle group. It made up the deficit from its own coffers, rather than taxpayer funds, and is expected to break even in the current year. Empowers staff: Jim O'Connell, chief executive of the hospital, said that more of the decision-making is 'put in the hands of the doctors and nurses' (file picture of doctor and patient)","Hinchingbrooke Hospital is ranked one of the highest for patient happiness and waiting times .

Open dialogue: William Hague spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov today . Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov today amid continuing anger at Moscow’s decision to block a UN Security Council resolution on Syria. The Foreign Office said the two men discussed the latest situation in the country by telephone for around half an hour following Mr Lavrov’s visit to Damascus yesterday. Mr Hague insisted that Western countries were not contemplating military intervention in Syria but said he believed that President Bashar al Assad should now step down. He also tackled Mr Lavrov about reported Russian arms sales to the regime. Mr Lavrov retorted that such sales were not illegal. In the Commons, David Cameron was dismissive of Russia’s unilateral attempt at a diplomatic intervention, saying he had 'very little confidence' that it would end the fighting. He told MPs at Prime Minister’s Questions that the international community had now to work with Syrian opposition groups both inside and outside the country to co-ordinate a concerted opposition to President Assad’s regime. He said: 'I think the bloodshed in Syria is absolutely appalling. I think the Russians have to look at their consciences and realise what they have done. 'But the rest of the world will keep on fighting as hard as it can to give the Syrian people a chance to choose their own future.' He accused Russia and China of 'setting themselves against' Arab and world opinion by their decision to veto the UN Security Council resolution. Mr Cameron yesterday approved plans to train spin-doctors to help Syrian opposition win support. But despite the move, a report by MPs concluded that Britain's military has been cut so severely it would struggle to wage a campaign in the country. It said the UK's dwindling and stretched Armed Forces face 'significant challenges' if asked to tackle a crisis alongside the war in Afghanistan.

"Up to 50 MPs are supporting a call for the BBC licence fee to be scrapped in favour of a voluntary subscription service, it has been revealed. A group of Conservatives will support an appeal to the Culture Secretary Sajid Javid urging a review into funding for the corporation. It is led by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who was written to Mr Javid to say the current funding arrangement is 'increasingly becoming unsustainable and out of keeping with the modern media environment'. MP Andrew Bridgen, left,  has written to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, right, to urge a review into the BBC's funding . Mr Bridgen told MailOnline: 'The licence fee is an anachronism. It dates back to a time when there wasn't much choice. 'At the end of the day, I think the BBC has got to be independent of government. 'However, the funding mechanism is effectively a poll tax - and independent of people who pay for it. 'The way it is collected is heavy-handed. Criminality should not be part of it.' In the letter, which is reproduced below in full, Mr Bridgen said expressed his concern for the sustainability of the BBC's funding structure. He wrote: 'I believe strongly that the BBC should be planning for a future without the licence fee and investigating subscription based payment options as well as a wealth of other opportunities that exist for its worldwide operation.' He added that nearly 500,000 people access BBC content via the iPlayer for free meaning licence fee payers are 'being discriminated to the tune of around £70million.' The letter Mr Bridgen sent to Mr Javid explains the BBC's funding structure is becoming unsustainable . And Mr Javid has already said the £145.50 fee is big expense for families and 'nothing will be ruled out' when it is reviewed next year. Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr show in June, he said the BBC Charter, which sets out its scope and remit and will be renewed for another decade in 2016, must take into account big technological changes in how people watch programmes. The corporation has recently come under fire for spending licence fee money on an awards ceremony for staff and freebies for celebrities and politicians - despite plans to axe 400 jobs. This week, it was revealed that the corporation spent more than £23,000 on tickets and hospitality for this year’s events, including for BBC Proms, with guests as varied as Homeland star Damian Lewis, Home Secretary Theresa May, Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, and presenter Sir David Attenborough rubbing shoulders at the licence fee payer’s expense. Costs for the Corporation's annual Gillard Awards included a £35 Venison dinner for more than 200 people and free travel to and from a hotel, a source revealed. The hotel costs alone for last year's event topped £25,000, with thousands more spent on alcohol and transport, it was alleged. The Gillard awards ceremony, which celebrates local radio, was held months before bosses revealed more than 400 jobs would be axed in a bid to save millions. A group of Conservative MPs support the bid for the BBC licence fee to be scrapped, it has been revealed . An estimated 415 jobs are to be scrapped to save £48 million a year by 2016/17 with James Harding, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, describing the cuts as ' an extremely difficult undertaking.' Mr Bridgen added: 'In a time when all is transparent, the BBC are still opaque and that leads to suspicion. 'The BBC are telling us that they are world class and I believe they are - they should have no problem competing on a subscription service basis.' But the BBC has insisted its licence fee is vital to ensure its programmes can be accessed by everyone. The corporation said the licence fee ensures wider access to its programming, and claimed support for the charge has increased in the past 10 years. 'At just £2.80 a week the BBC licence fee is excellent value for money - only this weekend newspapers have been reporting the rising costs of subscription services. 'It's vital that programmes like EastEnders, Strictly, Sherlock, Doctor Who and Match Of The Day can be watched by everyone - not a select few. 'Support for the licence fee has actually risen by 22% since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC.' The corporation says the licence fee ensures wider access to its programming, including hit Sherlock .","Conservatives will support appeal to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid urging a review into funding for corporation .

"The married son of renowned sex researchers Masters and Johnson has been arrested for pleasuring himself in front of female undercover police officers as they passed by his exclusive summer home in Michigan. Charged with aggravated indecent exposure, William H. Masters III, 60, was released on $5,000 bail and is facing two years in jail for the incident, which officers say was only the latest in a string of debaucherous deeds in the area. Female officers, posing as kayakers, were part of a local sting operation investigating the 'indecent' goings on of the posh summer homes in the Pointe aux Barques. Guilty William H.

'It’s a very rich, wealthy gated community,' explained a local source to the New York Post, 'with cottages built by families like [tire magnate] Harvey Firestone.' Masters III was nude on the banks of the Pinnebog River at the Port Crescent State Park Day use area in Hume Township when two female kayakers paddled by.

'A lot of law enforcement time, effort and resources have been expended over the years on this non-sense. This was not our first operation and will not be our last.' He added that in the past two weeks alone, there have been four such incidents. 'One thing is for certain, future ""free stylists"" need to take note that their actions will not be tolerated,' he said. There have been numerous incidents reported to police over the past five years, but there have only been two arrests so far.

"Lawyers for Gable Tostee, the 28-year-old  man accused of murdering New Zealand woman, Warriena Wright, on the Gold Coast in August may not proceed with his bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court tomorrow. The hearing is still listed for 10am on Tuesday, November 18, but Robertson O'Gorman, the new firm appointed by Tostee following his first bail hearing had thrown the application date in doubt. Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, fell to her death from the balcony of Tostee's 14th-floor luxury apartment at around 2.20am on August 8, hours following a night together after they met at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. Scroll down for video . Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . Mr Tostee was arrested a week later and has been in custody since.  Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright.  Mr O'Gorman refused to confirm or deny to Daily Mail Australia whether the bail hearing would proceed, however he told the brisbane times he was 'uncertain' and that the application was 'a work in progress'. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment. Mr Tostee is in custody and an application for bail may now be postponed . Mr O'Gorman described as 'absolutely worrying' police claims in the affidavit filed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, which included that Mr Tostee and Ms Wright allegedly had a fight before she fell. The police affidavit was among eleven documents filed for Gable Tostee's first bail application, before  Justice Debra Mullins, who adjourned the matter to give Mr Tostee's defence team more time. Devastated: Warriena Wright (above, right) with sister, Reza, who was devastated by the death . Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.' No medical files about Mr Tostee's alleged autism condition, nor any additional documents have been filed for Mr Tostee's bail application since the appointment of his new lawyers.","Gable Tostee in custody charged with murdering Warriena Wright on August 8 .

"Iain Duncan Smith said new arrivals in British schools ‘literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking English’ The character of Britain’s schools is being altered by the influx of migrant children who do not speak English, Iain Duncan Smith said last night. The Work and Pensions Secretary said new arrivals in many communities ‘literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking English’. His comments put him at odds with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who has tried to downplay the impact of migration on schools. She insisted earlier this month that schools were ‘doing extremely well’ with students from abroad. Mr Duncan Smith also warned about the potential future cost to the Exchequer when young migrants grow old and ‘start taking from the State’. He dismissed as ‘silly’ recent research which suggested European migrants had made a £20billion contribution to the UK between 2001 and 2011. He told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘I thought there was a silly report recently in the last couple of weeks that said in tax terms they have contributed more. ‘First of all you have to take them all the way through to when they get older and they actually start taking from the State, you don’t account for the fact that often in many communities they literally change the schooling because so many people arrive not speaking English. ‘You have then got problems with local services, transport, all that kind of stuff.’ Yesterday, in his second major intervention on immigration in a week, Sir John Major called for Britain to be allowed to suspend free movement for up to a year and restrict arrivals from the continent. The former Tory PM said Britain needed ‘a little help’ to deal with the ‘huge bulge’ in the number of migrants, boosting Britain’s population by seven per cent in a decade. ‘I think there are some practical things that could be done that don’t infringe the principle but do meet the problem,’ he said. His suggestion echoes plans for an ‘emergency brake’ mechanism being discussed at the highest levels of Government which could allow Britain to limit numbers if they are higher than expected. He also warned that any future outside the EU would be a ‘lesser future’ for Britain, which could leave the Government powerless to influence trade rules. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured)  has sought to downplay the impact of migration on schools and insisted earlier this month that schools were ‘doing extremely well’ with students who come from abroad . Mr Duncan Smith said he agreed with the former Tory premier, and he thought Germany would be prepared to support such a move. He said: ‘Europe as a whole needs to tackle this because when all the GDPs of the various economies were about the same then the freedom of movement really was a fairly balanced process. ‘Once the economies are not the same you get big difficulties, so he is simply warning what the Germans already know privately and have said to me – they need to sort this problem out.’ Earlier this month, Mrs Morgan slapped down the head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said schools were struggling to cope with migrant pupil numbers. He warned that schools needed more help to deal with growing numbers of foreign language children, saying it was a ‘big issue for government’. But Mrs Morgan said his language wasn’t ‘helpful’, adding: ‘When I go round schools I see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad.’ Critics warn there is a serious shortage of places at primaries - at which one in five pupils now speak English as a second language. In some parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three-quarters of the school roll. The figure is around half in places including Slough, Luton and Leicester.","Character of schools is altered by influx of migrants, claims Duncan Smith .

"David Cameron is set to strike a blow for ‘Britishness’ by putting the Union Jack on all new photocard driving licences from next year. But the move has sparked fury among Scottish independence campaigners after ministers ruled against allowing licences north of the border to carry the Saltire instead. That is despite the fact there are no plans to put the Union Jack on driving licences in Northern Ireland because of what officials referred to as the ‘particular sensitivities surrounding symbols’ in the Province. The current driving licence has the European Union's 12 gold stars with the word 'UK' inside, but David Cameron will put the Union Jack there instead, infuriating Scottish independence campaigners . Mr Cameron announced two years ago that he wanted to see the UK flag on British photocard licences. They currently show the European Union’s 12 gold stars with the word ‘UK’ inside. A final go-ahead was postponed until after the referendum on Scottish independence. Government sources said last night that licences would carry the flags of both the EU and the UK from next Spring. But they will not allow Scottish licences to use the flag of Scotland, or Welsh licences to carry the Red Dragon flag ‘on cost grounds’. Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said: ‘If the UK Government is able to make different arrangements for other parts of the UK, I don’t see why that shouldn’t also be the case for Scotland.’ The Union Jack will be placed in the top left corner of the driving licence, but the Saltire will not be permitted .","The Union Jack will appear on all photocard driving licences from next year .

"This motorist avoided decapitation by millimetres when he crashed his 190mph Corvette underneath a removal truck - by ducking. The driver of the sleek sports car was travelling up a steep highway when he came up behind the slow-moving HGV. He went into the back of the truck, causing the low slung Corvette Z06 to go underneath it; finally coming to a halt once the front of the sports car had gone six feet beneath the trailer. Lucky to be alive: Blood is clearly visible on the driver's forehead as he is freed from the car . Write-off: The Corvette was destroyed - but at least the driver was not badly hurt . I may have pranged it slightly: The HGV was going slowly when the Corvette went into the rear . The middle-aged driver ducked at the last moment and avoided potential decapitation, emerging relatively unscathed despite the carnage. However, the high-powered Corvette was less than lucky and was completely written off in the smash. The incredible incident took place on the southbound San Diego Freeway near Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. Retired LA firefighter Rick McClure, 60, was among the first to arrive at the scene. He said: 'He was very lucky to say the least. In the past drivers have been decapitated after crashing underneath trucks so a law was introduced so they had barriers to prevent this. Crash scene: Firefighters examine the car and work out how they can free the Corvette's driver . Pulled out: A stretcher is lowered down as the firefighters prepare to remove the driver from the wreck . 'But somehow he still managed to get the Corvette underneath. 'It happened at about 11:10pm so the freeway was fairly open. It was an uphill stretch of the road and the truck was going slowly up the steep grade. 'The Corvette must have been overtaking a few other cars and then all of a sudden he saw the slowing truck and went up the back of it. 'I was first at the scene and it was unbelievable to see the guy in the Corvette talking. He had some minor injuries but was in good spirits considering what had happened.' The driver was transported to the nearby Ronald Reagan Medical Centre with minor injuries.","Corvette Z06 ended up wedged 6ft under the truck's trailer .

"A controversial ‘seduction artist’ accused of encouraging violence against women now faces a ban from entering the UK, it emerged last night. Julien Blanc runs a ‘pick up’ company for men which critics say uses sexually abusive methods to attract women and encourages his clients to treat women badly. He was expected to come to Britain next week to run a two day seminar, but campaigners have demanded he is blocked from entering. Scroll down for video . 'Pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has been criticised over his sexually abusive and racist methods . Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, is expected to intervene in the case. Last week a minister in her department, Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone, said she was lobbying Mrs May to refuse Mr Blanc a visa. Video footage shows the 25-year-old Mr Blanc using racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat. His other proposed methods include threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from their friends. One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: ‘Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding’ . Video footage shows the 25-year-old using racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat . He was expected to come to Britain next week to run a two day seminar, pictured with comedian Russell Brand (left) His website suggests that men who are otherwise not successful at meeting women can ‘shortcircuit’ their target’s ‘emotional and logical mind.’ Miss Featherstone said she was ‘extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women’. She claimed his appearance in the UK would lead to an increase in sexual harrassment and intimidation of women. Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has also called for Mr Blanc to be barred. A YouTube video shows Mr Blanc on the streets of Tokyo grabbing young women and pushing their heads towards his groin. He describes ‘romping through the streets just grabbing girls’. A blog post describes how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women. Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, is expected to intervene in the case . It states: ‘Makes threats to hurt her; make her drop charges; make her do illegal things; threaten to report her to welfare; prevent her from taking a job; take her money and humiliate her.’ He was forced to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled. A similar campaign was mounted to bar him from Canada. A petition calling for him to be refused entry to the UK has received more than 136,000 signatures. The woman behind the petition, who goes by the pseudonym of Caroline Charles said: ‘Julien Blanc dresses up his seminars as dating advice, which at best is disingenuous - he focuses on tricking women into having sex in order to make money. ‘It is wrong on every level - it is promoting violene against women and girls, it takes advantage of men and it sends a message to survivors of sexual assault that they will not be listened to. To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.’ Other commentators have suggested that the campaign against Mr Blanc merely generates him unwarranted publicity. Blanc’s company, Real Social Dynamics, runs three day courses costing around £1200. His company is due to host a two day course starting on 27th November and another from December 19. Eleven more events are scheduled for next year. Mrs May can use discretionary powers to ban anyone for reasons of ‘unacceptable behaviour’. The Home Office refused to comment on the specific case for legal reasons. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.’ Mr Blanc’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.","'Pick-up artist' Julien Blanc criticised over his sexually abusive methods .
