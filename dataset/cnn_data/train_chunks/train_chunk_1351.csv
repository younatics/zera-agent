"A historic pharmaceutical factory best known for being the home of cod liver oil is set to be transformed into a £80million 400-home garden village. The former Wellcome factory in Dartford, Kent, which once employed 1,300 people, closed in 2008 after more than a century. But now developers are turning the Mills Pond site into houses and apartments with prices ranging from £150,000. The Wellcome Factory in 1900 in Dartford, Kent, which became best known for its production of cod liver oil and other pharmaceutical products . The plant, pictured in 1931 was located close to the River Darent, where the raw materials to make their products was brought to the factory by barge . The factory was wound down and closed in 2008 and now developers have bought the site, pictured now, to transform it into a 400-home garden village . The plant was famous for producing cod liver oil, malt and saccharin and supplied medicine chests to explorers, aviators and members of the royal family. The Wellcome Pharmaceutical Factory was found by Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs in 1889 after it replaced the Pheonix Paper Mill, which was built on the site in 1852. It became famous for producing cod liver oil and in its Edwardian heyday, the factory covered 33 acres of land, employing 1,300 people.

A chemist delivery van pictured outside the factory in 1910. In its later years, the factory produced medicines including insulin, migril, zovirax and retrovir . Chairman Bob Weston said: 'Our new £80 million garden village will transform surplus industrial land and bring it back to use as high quality residential housing and commercial premises. 'The Mill Pond and river setting will provide attractive water features for the adjoining homes and the leafy garden suburb inspired design will create a highly attractive place to live. 'It will be ideal for families and executives wanting a home within the M25 providing easy commuting into central London.' Historians believe that the health benefits of cod liver oil were recognised as far back as the Viking era, when fisherman rubbed it into their joints to ease soreness. By the 18th century, medics noted that the oil could be used to treat rheumatism, with the first recorded use of cod liver oil by a doctor in Manchester in 1782. By the 1800s, it was officially recognised by doctors for its health benefits and it started to be used to treat a wide range of conditions. These include gout, rickets, arthritis, those suffering from vitamin D deficiency and to help repair damaged teeth, skin, hair and nails. By 1850, the process of extracting the oil from steaming cod livers was perfected, which led to a surge in its consumption and production. The Wellcome Factory was one of the first to produce cod liver oil in tablet form.","Former Wellcome factory in Kent was best-known for making cod liver oil .

"Having both worked for the BBC for more than 20 years, Radio 4 presenters John Humphrys and Justin Webb have a wealth of experience when it comes to uncomfortable exchanges. And while normally it's their punitive line of questioning that sees interviewees squirm, this time the pair had listeners grimacing all by themselves in a painful bid to get down with the kids. Taking instructions from an urban slang expert, the journalists spat the words 'bro', 'rude-boy' and 'blud' as part of their early morning broadcast. Scroll down for video . BBC Radio 4 presenters John Humphrys (left) and Justin Webb (right) tried to get down with the kids in a painful broadcast on urban slang . To the entertainment of guests Nihal Arthanayake, a BBC Asian Network presenter, and Peter York, author of the famous 1980 Sloane Range Handbook, Humphrys and Webb held nothing back as they indulged their inner street-egos. Their conversation stemmed from David Cameron's claim that he and Barack Obama are so close, the President sometimes calls him 'bro'. 'Well when I come in at 4am, I normally say to John: 'Yo rudeboy', 54-year-old Webb joked. 'Yo rudeboy, that's right,' Humphrys, aged 71, joined in. Complimented that in fact he had good 'street credentials' by Arthanayake, also known as DJ Nihal, Humphrys retorted: 'Thanks bro.' Later, the veteran journalist revealed where he had learnt some of the phrases tossed around in the excruciating exchange. 'What about blud? My son calls me blud often.' Listeners took to Twitter to share their amusement, with one jokingly comparing Humphrys to the American rapper Drake. Listeners shared their amusement after hearing the awkward exchange on BBC Radio 4 this morning . Varied panel: The presenters were joined by author of the Sloane Range Handbook, Peter York (left), and DJ Nihal (right),  a BBC Asian Network presenter . The bizarre episode was sparked by David Cameron's confession that he and Barack Obama are so close, the American president calls him 'bro'. Referring to the Prime Minister's boastful admission, social commentator Peter York said he likely recognised the term as one of endearment from the American drama, The Wire. The show, which follows Baltimore narcotics police and a network of violent drug dealers as they evade try to evade prosecution by the former, was 'very, very popular, where the Prime Minister grew up, he said. 'The Wire was really popular int hat bit of notting hill where Cameron used to live, so there is Cameron - a certain kind of public schoolboy with a certain kind of sensibility, thinking it's flattering, thinking he's cool. 'But actually the most important thing is to stake his claim for closeness to the most powerful guy in the world, it wouldn't matter what he called him as long as it was tolerably intimate.' York is the author of the 1980s Sloane Ranger Handbook, an observation on the etiquette and lifestyle of privileged west Londoners. Unlike the Prime MInister, York, the former style editor of Harpers and Queen, said he would greet acquaintances as 'Darling you.' Rather than an opt for an urban alternative, the author said: 'I would say You or Darling, You. 'Obama to Cameron, I don't think ""Darling, you"" would quite work. 'Perhaps the other way around.' At the end of the programme he celebrated: 'My dogs..Wonderful, my dogs. It's wonderful that four middle-aged people would devote time to talking about this.' The presenters were discussing David Cameron's admission that he and  Barack Obama were so close, the president sometimes called him 'bro'","Justin Webb said he greeted John Humphrys as 'rudeboy' every morning .

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Sunday that the thorny question of whether to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples should be decided at the state level. The position, a political insider in Florida told DailyMail.com, is calculated to leave his options open as he considers a run for the presidency next year. 'It ought be a local decision. I mean, a state decision,' the former governor told The Miami Herald after a round of golf. 'The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it's been overturned by the courts, I guess.' Scroll down for video . THREADING THE NEEDLE: Jeb Bush's states'-rights position on gay marriage could mollify conservatives even as he seems resigned to accept the federal government's role in legalizing the practice nationally . OFF AND RUNNING: Aaron Huntsman, left, and William Lee Jones, right, embraced Monroe County Clerk of the Court Amy Heavilin, center, on Friday in Key West, Fla. after completing their marriage license application; they plan to receive the license just after midnight on Monday. The couple successfully challenged Florida's anti-gay-marriage constitutional amendment in federal court . Florida voters approved a state constitutional amendment banning the practice in 2008, a year after Bush left the governor's mansion. But four months ago a federal judge ruled that the U.S. Constitution considers that move an illegal form of discrimination. Bush said little six years ago about the ballot initiative that temporarily enshrined male-female unions as the only legal ones in his home state, but held the position that a state law banning gay marriage was sufficient. His position seemed to evolve in 2012 when he told PBS that gay parents could be considered role models. But 'traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned' by governments, he added. 'If people love their children with all their heart and soul and that's what they do and that's how they organize their life, that should be held up as an example to others, because we need it,' he said then. And in a 2014 speech, Bush warned that the GOP shouldn't allow itself to be seen as 'anti-gay.' Some of that rhetoric neatly mirrors what other Republicans have said as they have appeared to soften their earlier hard line against gays walking down the aisle. But the states'-rights position, an Iowa campaign consultant told DailyMail.com, is 'a band-aid approach that will – maybe – give conservatives just enough reason to hold their nose and vote for a Jeb Bush or a Chris Christie if one of them emerges as the 2016 nominee.' Christie, the New Jersey governor, has drawn flak for cozying up to President Barack Obama, particularly after the White House sent much-needed relief funds following Hurricane Sandy. MIXED BAG: Gay marriage is legal in states shaded blue, while states marked in green have court challenges pending . FRACTURED: The US is the only nation where gay marriage rights are split along regional lines . On Friday, Idaho Gov. Butch Otter filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court appealing the legalization of same-sex marriage in his state, saying that defining marriage along traditional lines is better for children. He also said states – and not the federal government – should have the right to decide the issue. Same-sex marriage was legalized in Idaho on Oct. 15 after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Otter's argument. He's now requesting reconsideration. In Florida, though, the federal government has taken the reins. In August, Judge Robert Hinkle, decided against the 2008 Florida amendment but stayed his ruling until just after midnight Monday night to allow for appeals. The Herald reported Monday that 'both a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down requests from Florida's attorney general to extend the stay until the appeal is heard.' On Thursday Hinkle notified county clerks statewide that refusing to issue marriage licenses to gays and lesbians would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution beginning on Tuesday. FUTURE FIRST COUPLE? Bush (left) and his wife Columba (right) could be the next DC power couple if the former governor can avoid alienating the GOP's conservative base . GLOBAL TREND: The first gay weddings in Scotland were held on December 30, following Parliament's decision to grant same-sex couples an equal right to marriage . Bush's position drew jeers from the American Civil Liberties Union, which suggested his acceptance of state-level laws banning gay marriage made him an unsuitable presidential candidate. 'So the people should have the right to enact a discriminatory law?' asked Florida ACLU director Howard Simon. 'That sounds like what he was saying.' 'That unfortunately is consistent from what I remember about Jeb Bush's tenure as governor.' Bush faces an uphill climb with the right wing of his party as he explores the feasibility of a 2016 White House run. Conservatives see him as soft on tea-party issues and have already put him in what one GOP Capitol Hill staffer called 'the Mitt Romney box' on Tuesday. 'If he runs, he's going to be the Romney guy this time around. Or the John McCain guy,' the aide to a right-wing Republican House member said. 'And we've seen how well that turned out.' Both Romney and McCain lost their elections to Obama. Bush is polling in the top rungs of Republican contenders.","Former Florida governor is expected to run for president in 2016 .
Hopes to frame gay marriage as states-rights issue since Florida voters banned the practice in 2008 .
But a federal judge has told Florida county clerks they'll be violating US Constitution if they don't issue marriage licenses to gays starting Tuesday .

"A Queensland police officer catches the slimiest of crooks, but it is not the kind you think. One of North Tamborine Sergeant Mick Jones' latest captures was a 1.5-metre carpet snake that made a meal out of a young family's pet guinea pig named Fluffy Wuffy. The officer was called to the family's house at Mount Tamborine on Sunday to find the reptile bulging from swallowing its prey inside the pet's hutch in the backyard. Scroll down for video . North Tamborine Sergeant Mick Jones' latest capture was a 1.5-metre carpet snake that made a meal out of a young family's pet guinea pig . 'It’s quite a regular occurrence every summer. Where a guinea pig used to be, there was a snake,' Sgt Jones told Daily Mail Australia. 'The gap that it goes through when it is skinny is too small, once they have that big lump they have got to wait.' When the warmer months come along, Sgt Jones and his colleagues are not only police officers but snake catchers as well. He said they got calls at least three times a week to capture or rescue animals in the North Tamborine region. The death of the guinea pig followed that one of a cat's, which met the same fate as its fellow mammal . Sgt Jones said he was called to another home at Mount Tamborine on Monday at 6.30am, where the residence's owner had snapped a photo of a cat's tail sticking out of a python's mouth . 'Nine out of 10 times it's a chicken, budgerigars or cockatiels,' Sgt Jones said. The death of the guinea pig followed that one of a cat's, which met the same fate as its fellow mammal. Sgt Jones said he was called to another home at Mount Tamborine on Monday at 6.30am, where the residence's owner had snapped a photo of a cat's tail sticking out of a python's mouth. 'It was a feral cat I hope, judging by its tail. Cats are very hard to catch. It was probably a kitten,' he said. 'By the time I got there it was well and truly swallowed. 'The people who rang it in said it [the cat] wasn't theirs and they didn't think people around there owned it.' He shared a photo of a snake sitting in the colleague's chook pen after eating a chicken's eggs . But Sgt Jones is no stranger to animals having lived in Karumba in far north Queensland . Sgt Jones said it would have taken only a matter of minutes from the time the homeowner took the photo to his arrival for the cat to disappear completely, down the python's throat. 'When [the owner] only came out, there was only the bit of the arse left.' Snakes have even been found in the backyard of one of his own colleagues. He shared a photo of a snake sitting in the colleague's chook pen after eating a chicken's eggs. But it was still hungry as the snake is seen waiting patiently for the animal to get off more eggs she was sitting on so it could eat those as well. Sgt Jones said it was taken away before it could do that. Several months earlier, the sergeant had to pull another carpet snake from a drain pipe barely a kilometre away from the station on Main Street. Several months earlier, Sgt Jones rescued a snake from a drain pipe in the North Tamborine area . The policeman has been stationed in North Tamborine for nine years and snake catching comes part of the job often . But the policeman is no stranger to catching dangerous animals, having been stationed in Karumba in Queensland's Gulf region. Though not many people would consider crocodile trapping as part of an officer's job description, Sgt Jones said he had to catch a fair few during his six-year stint up in the state's far-north. He helped keepers at Australia Zoo catch one of the park's main main attractions, Digger, in 2005. 'The croc was 14 feet [4.2 metres] and we worked together with the Australia Zoo guys,' Sgt Jones said. 'We caught him within in an hour. 'He was harassing kids on the boat ramp so he had to be relocated. 'He was caught on Anzac Day so they named him ""Digger"".' In 2005, Sgt Jones helped Australia Zoo staff capture Digger in Karumba in far-north Queensland . Digger was at that point, 4.2 metres long and was terrorising children on the boat ramp . Sgt Jones said it was a joint effort between police and zoo keepers, taking about an hour . Here the group is seen trying to get Digger into the cage in which he would travel back to Australia Zoo in .","Sergeant Mick Jones and his colleagues often catch snakes during the summer in North Tamborine in Queensland .

"Exposed to blistering temperatures, inhaling thick smoke and putting their bodies on the line to extinguish the flames. These are the conditions front-line firefighters are faced with while battling the devastating bushfires burning across the Adelaide Hills. Footage of inside the inferno, which is the worst since the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983, has been taken by Burnside Country Fire Service volunteer firefighter Ben Wilson, whose team has been out trying to tame the fires since Friday. Scroll down for video . The Adelaide Hills fires have been burning since Friday and temperatures are set to soar to 38 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Wednesday . Country Fire Service volunteer firefighter Ben Wilson has taken photos and video, giving people a first-hand account from the front-lines . He and his fellow colleagues face blistering temperatures and inhale thick smoke as they battle to contain the blaze . In South Australia, the Ash Wednesday bushfires killed 28 people. Luckily so far, the only thing the fire has claimed are properties. With a GoPro strapped to the photographer's helmet, viewers get a first-hand look of what firefighters are working to contain as temperatures are expected to hot 38 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the eight-minute video, firefighters are seen trying to put out spot fires at Sampson Flat as smoke surrounds them and thicker plumes billow in the distance, with light from the fire turning the sky orange. The team Mr Wilson was with were very experienced - the cab officer and driver alone had 70 years between them. 'They knew exactly what was going on, and sometimes conditions can look a lot worse than they are,' he said. 'We did what we needed to do and got the job done. We were highly trained and knew what we needed to do.' Mr Wilson has been a volunteer for CFS for nine years and he has battled fires on Kangaroo Island where flames were 300 metres high. 'We were a kilometre away but that means it could get to us in ten seconds,' he told Daily Mail Australia. But he had not seen any fires as bad as what he has seen in South Australia. 'The flames were crowning the top of trees, and through the clouds... The inferno was the worse thing I’ve ever seen in my life,' he said. 'That kind of fire is crazy, that's why the fire is out on control still because you can't put bombers on it. The water would evaporate before it hit the fire.' Mr Wilson said the conditions had been a massive shock to firefighters as it had not been brought under control in five days, even with the help of 200 volunteer firefighters from both South Australia's CFS along with 200 NSW crew members and 40 from the Metropolitan Fire Service. 'That's a huge amount of people and we still haven't got it under control. You think, ""put water on flame"" and it goes out, but that’s not how it works. 'Wednesday will be a very questionable day. The weather isn't looking positive, and everyone is knuckling down and preparing. But Mr Wilson reassured people firefighters were more than up for the task. Mr Wilson has captured footage on a GoPro strapped onto his helmet as he helped battle the Sampson Flat fires . Thick smoke is seen rising sky high over the Adelaide Hills, which is a popular tourist destination in South Australia . It is thought more than 400 firefighters were battling the blaze on Sunday as hot temperatures could worsen the blaze . In the eight-minute video, Mr Wilson is seen putting out spot fires with a hose along with assisting other crew members . The sun is seen burning a bright orange through the thick smoke billowing over the region, which is 26km away from Adelaide's CBD . At one stage, Mr Wilson is so overwhelmed by smoke he starts coughing violently as it blows over a property he is defending . He and his colleagues kick into action as flames surround a property they arrive at, which has flames just centimetres away from sheds . And this is made evident by the way crew members executed their sweep of the Sampson Flat house. Firefighters leapt into action, grabbing a hose to extinguish the fires as well as protecting the house by dousing its gutters with water as the sun is seen shining through the smoke with a red ring around it. As firefighters continued to storm the property, the video shows how close the fire is burning, with flames just centimetres away from setting a garden shed alight. At one point a plane is seen flying over the house as what it is believed to be the sound of smoke alarms break through the eerie silence. 'When we were rolling up to the house within minutes it had jumped a good 500 metres. An ember sparked and all the other trucks went down to road where the fire was but we went up to the house where the fire front actually was,' Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Seeing something like that shows exactly how out of our hands it can be. We saved one house, and we did the best in that area we could. 'That's one less house on the tally.' Mr Wilson said the most devastating thing on the job was seeing people lose their homes. 'You see people waiting on the side of the road at road closures, not able to get back in and you can tell that they know they've lost their home. 'It's sad to see when people could have saved their house by being prepared and end up losing their homes. 'Everyone thinks ""I'll be right, we'll be ready"" or they think they'll leave if it gets bad. 'Some houses are really hard to save. Unless they cut down huge trees and even if they do prepare it's tough. 'We have a fire truck and we still struggled to save the house.' In the video, Mr Wilson is also seen running over to a shed where hay is kept, while a colleague looks to be watering it down so the fire cannot use the tinder to spread. Mr Wilson takes up an axe to break-up wood lining the walls of the blackened tin shed to prevent it from re-igniting. A thick smoke blows over the house and it becomes too much for him as he starts coughing violently to clear his lungs. As the crew travel along the road, they put out spot fires they drive past with a quick spritz of the house to stop it from spreading . Mr Wilson worked to spray down leaves in gutters to ensure the house would not catch alight . Firefighters from all over Australia have been helping battle the blaze since Sunday, with conditions the worst since 1983 . In 1983, the Ash Wednesday bushfires in South Australia claimed 28 lives and destroyed 51 homes . Despite getting an upclose and personal look at the sheer destruction of the fire, Mr Wilson said 'the biggest thing' he had seen during the bushfires was people's willingness to help. 'I've had so many people call me and ask ""What can we do?"". They've said ""I'll deliver sandwiches and water, I can offer shelter and storage"",' he said. 'It's crazy how much citizens are banding together to help out, this doesn't normally happen. 'People realise that every little bit counts. If someone donates six bottles of water, that's six firefighters who don’t have to buy it out of their own pockets when they’re already giving their time.' As for how Mr Wilson deals with fear, he said he tried not to focus on it while out on a job but on helping people. 'I've never experienced fear to the extent where I thought we'd die. I mean, we're all human and fear will kick in, but as a firefighter you need to be push that aside and operate on your skills and listen to your officers,' he said. 'We'll never be forced into a situation that we aren't comfortable with. 'What drives me is the ability to be able to help people who are in a situation where they can't help themselves. 'All voluntary things are great. You're there on your own time which means your heart is in it, and because it means people really care.'","Bushfires are burning across the Adelaide Hills in South Australia with conditions the worst since 1983 .

"Japan's Prime Minister will 'express remorse' over the country's role in the Second World War on the anniversary marking 70 years since it ended. Shinzio Abe yesterday sought to reassure the world that he wouldn't veer from past official statements on Japan's wartime responsibility. Many analysts had speculated that Abe, known for his nationalist views, might downplay his country's role in the war in a move that would sour relations with China and South Korea. 'The Abe Cabinet will uphold the general stance on history of successive prime ministers, including the Murayama statement,' he said, referring to a 1995 apology made by then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama on the 50th anniversary of the war's end. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, pictured centre being led by a priest at the Grand Shrine of Ise, has said he will 'express remorse' over the country's role in the Second World War on the anniversary marking 70 years since it ended . Abe said the government would draft a new statement 'that includes Japan's remorse for the war,' though he stopped short of saying it would again apologise. Abe made the comments in the city of Ise after visiting an important Shinto shrine. The statement is expected to be issued around the anniversary of the end of the war on August 15. Seventy years on, the scars of the Second World War still poison relations in Asia, particularly between Japan and nearby China and South Korea, both victims of Japan's wartime aggression. Commemorative events will be held around the world, but across Asia it's not just about remembering the past. The tenor of the events and the specific words chosen by leaders in each country will have current-day implications for Japan's still strained relations with its neighbors. That prospect worries the U.S. government which fears more tensions at a time when China's emergence as a military presence is shifting the power balance in a region where the U.S. military has long dominated the seas. Abe said the government would draft a new statement 'that includes Japan's remorse for the war,' though he stopped short of saying it would again apologise . The liberal Asahi newspaper devoted a recent editorial to the statement, saying Abe needs to face up to Japan's war responsibility. The paper wrote: 'If ... Japan starts talking about the future without seriously facing up to its past, countries that suffered from Japan's wartime behavior could start wondering if the Japanese are saying, 'Let's forget the past.' Analysts said it's too early to predict what Abe will say seven months from now. While he may not revise the Murayama statement, he can still undermine it, said Koichi Nakano, a liberal professor of contemporary politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. He said: 'There has been growing concern that Abe might try to effectively overwrite the Murayama statement with the 'Abe statement.' Analysts said it's too early to predict what Abe will say seven months from now. While he may not revise the Murayama statement, he can still undermine it, said Koichi Nakano, a liberal professor of contemporary politics at Sophia University in Tokyo . Emperor Akihito, in his annual New Year's message, also stressed the need to remember the past, saying: 'So many people lost their lives in this war,' he said in a statement. 'I think it is most important for us to take this opportunity to study and learn from the history of this war, starting with the Manchurian Incident of 1931, as we consider the future direction of our country.' The proof, China says, will lie in Japan's actions. 'We hope Japan can match its words, honestly facing up to its history of aggression, (and) abide by all the solemn statements and promises it has made on the issue of history,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said yesterday.","Shinzio Abe stopped short of saying he would 'apologise' for Japan's role .

"The sub-zero temperatures and biting Siberian winds didn't seem to deter locals and adventurous tourists from taking a dip in the freezing waters of China's Songhua River during an annual festival. The race took place in a 'pool' that was carved out of ice in the northern city of Harbin. More than 700 enthusiasts from 49 amateur groups braved the icy waters to compete in a two-day ice swimming competition. More than 700 swimmers took on the sub-zero temperatures to compete in annual contest . Winter swimming is enjoyed across the north of the country, mainly by middle-aged and elderly people who either believe it benefits their health or simply enjoy the way it feels. Swimmers break a hole in a frozen river surface and jump in, using sticks and brooms to sweep ice off the surface as it forms. Like any major swimming event, these contests were organised by age and gender. Contestants try to be the first to make it across the 80ft pool in temperatures colder than -17C.

"Two men have been charged in the United States with conspiring to help overthrow the government in the tiny West African nation of Gambia, federal prosecutors said Monday. Both men were in custody and were expected to make court appearances Monday in Baltimore and Minneapolis. The charges stem from a Dec. 30 coup attempt in the former British colony, which came as the longtime ruler was away. Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, who has since returned to the country, blamed 'terrorist groups' for the coup attempt and alleged that plotters had received backing from foreign countries. Accused: American citizens Cherno Njie, 57 (left), and Papa Faal, 46 (right), were arrested upon their return to the US from the tiny West African nation following a thwarted December coup in which they allegedly participated . Home: In this Monday photo is the home of Papa Faal in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. Faal and Njie are accused of traveling to Gambia independently of one another to participate in a coup. Njie hails from Austin, Texas . Shots fired: Residents walk on an empty street in Banjul, Gambia, Tuesday, December 30 on the same day heavy gunfire rang out Tuesday near the presidential palace in the tiny West African nation . Prosecutors say the two men, Cherno Njie and Papa Faal, traveled separately from the United States to Gambia to participate in the unrest there. They later returned to the U.S. and are now in custody. 'The United States strongly condemns such conspiracies. With these serious charges, the United States is committed to holding them fully responsible for their actions,' Attorney General Eric Holder said in the statement. Overall, about 10 to 12 people were in Gambia to try to overthrow the government 'with the expectation that others in the country would join and assist them,' the department said. According to BBC News, court documents indicate Njie was a leader of the conspiracy who was set to be appointed interim leader of Gambia had the coup succeeded. Human rights activists have long criticized the Gambian government for targeting political opponents, journalists and gays and lesbians. Jammeh came to powern in The Gambia in a coup 20 years ago and has a tight grip on the tiny nation, a slither of land on the Atlantic coast surrounded by Senegal . Gambian-Americans: President Yahya Jammeh is pictured in 2006. The Gambian president was out of the country on Tuesday when shots rang out in what appeared to be a coup led by Gambians who'd since left for other countries, including at least two from the United States . The U.S. government recently removed Gambia from a trade agreement in response to human rights abuses, including a law signed in October that imposes life imprisonment for some homosexual acts . Faal, 46, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Gambia who lives in Minnesota, told investigators that in August he joined a movement in the United States bent on overthrowing the government. He said he was motivated to be part of the group, which prosecutors said planned to ambush the president's convoy, by concerns that elections were being rigged and over 'the plight of the Gambian people,' according to court papers. Prosecutors say he purchased semi-automatic rifles in Minnesota that were then shipped by cargo ship to Gambia. After members of the group were defeated at the Gambian State House, Faal escaped by ferry to neighboring Senegal, where he walked into the U.S. Embassy, spoke to U.S. officials and gave the FBI permission to search his home in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, prosecutors say. Njie, 57, is a U.S. citizen of Gambian descent who lives in Austin, Texas. He was arrested Sunday after flying into Dulles International Airport from Senegal. It wasn't immediately clear whether the two men had lawyers. Yahya Jammeh seized power in a 1994 coup . Gunmen attacked the capital, Banjul, in the early hours of December 30, when President Yahya Jammeh was out of the country. Diplomats say at least four attackers were killed. On the run were several others. Since returning on Wednesday, Jammeh has warned he would not spare anyone involved in the attempted coup, which local media said was led by former presidential guard chief Lamin Sanneh. Sanneh's mother and brother were amongst those arrested so far, family members said, asking not to be named. 'Nobody can also destabilize this country. So anybody who comes to attack this country; be ready because you are going to die no matter who you are and who backed you,' Jammeh said. 'We will get to the bottom of this and we will not spare anybody,' he said. 'Enough is enough. They want to destroy our country. We will destroy them,' he added. Jammeh came to power in a coup 20 years ago and has a tight grip on the tiny nation, a slither of land on the Atlantic coast surrounded by Senegal. A failed coup plot in 2006 led to a crackdown and some executions, according to rights groups. Jammeh is one of Africa's most vocal anti-gay leaders and has previously threatened to behead sexual minorities found in his country. The U.S. government recently removed Gambia from a trade agreement in response to human rights abuses, including a law signed in October that imposes life imprisonment for some homosexual acts. Jammeh also drew swift condemnation from activists in 2007 after he insisted that HIV-positive patients stop taking their antiretroviral medications, claiming he could cure them with an herbal body rub and bananas. Soldiers loyal to Gambian President Yahya Jammeh went house-to-house in search of opponents Thursday after the longtime leader blamed 'terrorist groups' for staging a coup attempt earlier this week. Jammeh, who was out of the country at the time of Tuesday's attack but has since returned to Banjul, the capital, alleged that the coup plotters had received backing from some foreign countries. 'I live for the Gambia and I will die fighting for the truth. No human being can do anything to me, my government or the Gambia,' Jammeh said. 'It was not a coup. It was an attack by dissidents based in the US, Germany and United Kingdom.' After hours of fighting, forces loyal to Jammeh's regime succeeded in getting the upper hand, killing five insurgents. It was not immediately known how many casualties were suffered by the national military. 'We are all gripped by fear,' said one Banjul resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. A 2011 campaing poster for Jammeh stands along the side of a Banul road. Papa Faal said he was motivated to be part of the group, which prosecutors said planned to ambush the president's convoy, by concerns that elections were being rigged and over 'the plight of the Gambian people,' according to court papers.","Cherno Njie, 57, and Papa Faal, 46, were arrested upon their return to the US from the tiny West African nation following a thwarted December coup .

"According to the most recent figures, one million Britons claim to have gotten a tattoo during a late night drinking session. But for one man, the consequences proved particularly severe. Not only did  Lee, a father-of-five from Grimsby lose his job, his facial tattoos have also resulted in social ostracism and his children being picked on at school. So desperate to get rid of them did the 35-year-old become, he even resorted to trying to scratch them off using a cheese grater. Scroll down for video . Disaster: 35-year-old Lee says his facial inkings have ruined his life and left him an outcast . 'I went from a hard-working father to unemployed overnight,' says Lee. 'I find it hard to get a job of any kind and as for paid work, I haven't had any in five years. 'Interviewers say ""I don't think you'd be quite right for this position"" and I know it's because of my face.' Lee's ordeal began following a drunken party. After the discussion moved to inkings, a friend boasted he could make a tattoo gun. Much to everyone's surprise, he did. 'He got a little motor, some biros and this welding thing and he came back an hour later with this machine,' remembers Lee. 'I thought: ""This is pretty cool!"" He didn't have any ink so someone went and got a printer cartridge and we all thought: well this will do! It was nuts!' Unemployed: Since getting the tattoos, the Grimsby father-of-five has been unable to find a job . Difference: Lee  wishes he had kept his face tattoo-free and says people judge him for his tattoos . The next morning, much to his horror, he woke up to find three wobbly tears etched into his cheeks with jet black ink. 'When I sobered up I looked in the mirror and thought: Who are you? What the Hell have you done to yourself? You look like an idiot,' he remembers. 'It looks like an alien sneezed on my face.' Worse was to come. On his first day back at work after getting the tattoo, his bosses called him into the office and gave him the sack. 'The first day I went back in after having the tattoo, they said: Sorry, you can't work here. Bye-bye, see you later. Straight away.' But almost as bad was the daily abuse he began to receive and the social ostracism that followed. 'When I'm out and about in town, I get stared at pretty much 24/7,' he says. 'Old ladies cross the street and clutch their handbags like I'm going to nick something of theirs. 'I've been called Coco the Clown, a murderer... I think people think I'm some kind of psychotic clown gangster sort of thing.' Lee has also had to watch his children be bullied at school as a result of his inkings. 'It makes me feel guilty all the time,' he admits. 'Knowing they're suffering because of something I did.' Desperate to remove the inkings but unable to afford laser treatment, Lee hit rock bottom and decided to take drastic action. 'I've got a nutmeg grater and I've been trying to grate them off my face,' he reveals. 'It didn't work, so I tried a cheese grater. Awareness: Lee, who appears on Bodyshockers with Katie Piper, hopes others won't repeat his mistake . Brighter future: Lee, who is now having laser treatment, tried to get rid of his tattoos using a cheese grater . 'I grated them quite a lot and I thought, ""oh, it's coming out"" because blood was coming but I woke up the next day and they were still there - with scabs too.' Lee, who has now begun laser treatment to remove the etchings, says he would tell anyone thinking of getting a facial inking not to have it done. 'Bascially, I've regretted it since the day I got it done,' he says. 'People think they can call you every name under the sun. 'What affects me most is people's preconceptions of who I am. Because of the tattoos, they always expect the worst of me.'","Lee, a father-of-five from Grimsby, says tattoos have ruined his life .

"Two sheriff's deputies lost a loaded shotgun after they spent an hour driving around Los Angeles with the boot of their squad car open. The chrome and bright yellow shotgun from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department disappeared from the open boot of the deputies' car as they drove from Agoura Hills to Hollywood. It was inside a black canvas carrying case and ready loaded with four beanbag shells, of the kind intended for 'non-lethal' attacks. However it is capable of acting as a regular gun if loaded with live ammunition, police said. Missing: A shotgun like the one lost by two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies as they drove around the city with the boot of their squad car open. The lost weapon is loaded with beanbag rounds . 'The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is very concerned about finding this missing shotgun. The search is ongoing,' a spokesman said in a statement. 'The cause of the loss is under investigation, including to determine if the trunk latch was somehow blocked, if the trunk was not fully closed, or if the trunk latch somehow disengaged in transit.' The two deputies from Lost Hills Sheriff's Station in Agoura Hills had loaded the shotgun into their car before before driving to attend a report of child abuse at a Hollywood hospital at about 7.30am on Saturday. It was only an hour later, when they reached Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, that they were flagged down by a passerby who warned them the boot of their car was ajar. Bungling: It was only an hour after they set off, when they reached Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, that they were flagged down by a passerby who warned them the boot of their car was ajar .

"A Roma couple buried their ten-week-old daughter in a Paris suburb miles from their home today, after the mayor of the town where they live refused to allow her to be buried there. About 200 family members and townspeople attended a funeral Mass in Champlan, a Paris commuter town, on Monday. A hearse then took the small coffin to the town of Wissous for burial. Wissous offered a gravesite for the baby after Champlan mayor Christian Leclerc reportedly refused a burial, saying the local cemetery had 'too few plots' and 'priority is given to those who pay taxes'. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Iliana and Marin Francesca, both kneeling, grieve over the coffin of their ten-week-old daughter as she is laid to rest in a cemetery in Wissous, France, after she was refused a place in a cemetery in their town . Pain: The grieving parents and their relatives sob as they prepare to bury the baby girl . Insult heaped on loss: Wissous offered a gravesite for the baby after Christian Leclerc, the mayor of Champlan, where the family live, reportedly refused a burial, saying the local cemetery had 'too few plots' Under heavy criticism, Mayor Leclerc later denied ever refusing a burial site. A top government official said he would investigate. Whatever the truth, the case has brought to light the racism faced by France's estimated 20,000 Roma, also known as gipsies. Like Maria's parents, most live in makeshift camps with few basic amenities. The community in general is regularly linked to crime and anti-social behaviour. Pictures showed Iliana and Marin Francesca sobbing over their daughter Maria's white coffin on an damp and overcast morning in Wissous cemetery. Most of the mourners appeared to be from the Roma community, but others looked like wellwishers who had lent their support out of outrage over the way the tragic case has been handled. Loic Gandais, a Roma rights campaigner, said Mr Leclerc was simply expressing a hatred of Roma which is now widespread across France. 'It's about racism, xenophobia, and stigmatisation,' said Mr Gandais, saying the baby died in hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes from sudden infant death syndrome on Boxing Day. Sadness: Iliana and Marin Francesca walk behind their daughter's hearse as it approaches the grave plot . Difficult: Mrs Francesca stumbles in her grief as she and other mourners follow the slowly moving hearse . Why? The couple raise their faces to the sky as they grieve for their daughter, who was just ten weeks old . 'The pain of the mother must not be worsened': Right-wing UMP party mayor of Wissous, Richard Trinquier, in front of the town's city hall. He offered a plot for the child's burial, saying it was a 'question of humanity' Mr and Mrs Francesca are Romanians who have been living in France for eight years, sending their two other young children to local schools. The plot in Wissous was made available for their late daughter after Richard Trinquier, the local mayor, said it was a 'question of humanity'. 'The pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months, and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened,' said Mr Tranquier as he announced his decision. Champlan's Roma gipsies live on two plots without fresh water or electricity. There are frequent calls for their camp to be razed. Mr Valls, France's Socialist Prime Minister, is among many who have expressed a desire to see the country rid of its Roma community. As Interior Minister, he often approved orders aimed at smashing up Roma camps and evicting entire families. He said on one occasion: 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. 'We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.' But he struck a conciliatory note after the scandal surrounding Maria Francesca's burial, writing on Twitter: 'Refusing a child a burial because of its roots is an insult to its memory, an insult to France.'","Champlan Mayor Christian Leclerc said the local cemetery was too full .

"Thousands of Twitter users were sent into a frenzy on New Year's Day after the Arizona Department of Transportation claimed to have spotted a family of Bigfoot.

"Oldham Athletic are on the verge of signing convicted rapist Ched Evans and are set to make an announcement on Monday. Sportsmail understands that the former Sheffield United striker will train with the Latics on Monday morning ahead of a move to Boundary Park. Evans, who is staying in a hotel nearby, wants a return to football after being released from prison in October. A club source said a deal is '50-50'. ldham Athletic are on the verge of signing convicted rapist Ched Evans (pictured in Cheshire on Sunday) Ex-Sheffield United striker Ched Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October . Evans could be in line for a return to football after it was announced a League One club could sign him . The developments represent a dramatic U-turn by Oldham, who insisted they had no intention of landing the 26-year-old last month. A statement on December 1 read: 'The Board of Directors would like to confirm that we will not be extending an invitation for Ched Evans to train with Oldham Athletic nor will we be offering him a contract. 'The club will not be making any further comment on this subject.' Senior officials at the club are known to believe Evans' side of the story. They spoke to the player in late November but decided against making a move amid fears it would further tarnish the club's image following the signing of Lee Hughes in 2007. Hughes had served half of a six-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. Director Barry Owen, a former police officer instrumental in bringing Hughes to Oldham, is understood to have been heavily involved in this deal. Oldham offered Lee Hughes a way back into football in 2007 after he had served three years in prison . Hughes played for Oldham for two years, scoring 25 league goals during his time at the club . Since defeating Rochdale 3-0 on November 29 Oldham's season has suffered a dramatic downturn. Lee Johnson's side have lost four games in a row including a 4-0 home humbling by his dad's Yeovil Town and a 7-0 drubbing at MK Dons. Evans  served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said there would be a press conference at an unnamed League One club, but Sportsmail understands there isn't one planned. 'The club are due to hold the press conference tomorrow and I've made it clear to them that I cannot attend tomorrow,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. According to one board member of Trust Oldham, the official club supporters trust that has a stake in the club and even provides financial support that can extend to the payment of a player’s wages, they have not been consulted about the possible recruitment of Ched Evans. Ray Coverley told Sportsmail he knew nothing of Evans joining the club. Speaking personally and not on behalf of Trust Oldham, he did however argue that – having served his sentence for rape – Evans was entitled to return to work as a footballer. 'We haven’t discussed it,’ said Mr Coverley. 'But speaking personally I’m of the opinion that if he has served his sentence we can’t keep going on about it. I understand the emotional point, but taking that aside he’s now entitled to play football again.' Maltese side Hibernians announced on Friday that they had offered the 26-year-old  striker a deal for the remainder of the season, but that move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice as Evans is not allowed to work abroad. He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players union the Professional Footballers Association. But following a backlash from supporters, sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer. Taylor warned that any move for the 26-year-old striker had to be for the right reasons. Evans' attempts to return have so far been fruitless, with clubs turning down the chance to employ him . 'Bearing in mind what happened with his release and then of course the furore that we had at Sheffield United we feel that any club wishing to sign him needs to be 100 per cent committed to signing him for proper and legitimate football reasons,' Taylor added. Any move to sign Evans is likely to lead to public outcry, but Taylor is keen to avoid a similar situation to the one that engulfed Sheffield United after they made their offer to the player. 'I don't want to create a replica-type situation that we had at Sheffield (United) because I'm a little bit concerned that we need press conference and that will invite, of course, many antagonists,' he said. Taylor said the PFA appreciated the situation was 'very sensitive', but reiterated its stance that Evans deserved the chance to resume his career following his release from prison. 'We've made it clear in our statements that we feel he's been unable to say much because of the appeals process, but he has served his time and the job of society is to look to rehabilitate,' Taylor said. The Welsh international's most recent set-back came this weekend, when a move to Malta was blocked . On Friday Maltese side Hibernians revealed that they had made a contract offer to Evans for the remainder of the season, although the BBC quoted a spokesman for Evans denying the player received such an offer. However, any move abroad is unlikely to materialise given the UK's tough regime in managing sex offenders. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims. 'Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad. 'The offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.'

"It's not what those of us who gave the credit card a serious nudge over Christmas wanted to hear - with many businesses set to hike up prices of electronic goods and clothes. The financial headache caused by the festive season could develop into a full-blown migraine with experts tipping more than a third of outlets will soon pass on increases to consumers. Cheap televisions, tablets and phones may not last much longer with prices expected to begin rising this year, with 31 per cent of businesses intending to lift their selling prices in the first quarter, while just four per cent are prepared to offer discounts. Scroll down for video . The financial headache caused by the festive season could develop into a full-blown migraine with experts tipping more than a third of outlets will soon pass on increases to consumers . Cheap televisions, tablets and phones may not last much longer with prices expected to begin rising this year, with 31 per cent of businesses intending to lift their selling prices in the first quarter . Boxing Day sales alone were up significantly on last year, with more than $2 billion having gone through retail tills across Australia. That's up more than $70 million on last year . Dun & Bradstreet's monthly Business Expectations Survey shows the Selling Price Index for the March quarter lifting to 26 points, that's up from about 17 last quarter and 19 last year, to reach its highest level since the third quarter of 2009. The index measures the difference between the percentage of businesses expecting to increase prices minus the percentage intending to decrease prices. It comes in the wake of a bumper sales period for businesses. Boxing Day sales alone were up significantly on last year, with more than $2 billion having gone through retail tills across Australia. That's up more than $70 million on last year. But the lift in the Selling Price Index continues a steady trend that commenced during the middle of last year and can be tied to a similar movement in the level of the Australian dollar; suggesting that the weakening currency is leading to higher input costs for many local firms. It's not just retailers, the survey showed that 40 per cent of wholesalers are planning to raise their prices in the coming three months, while just one per cent will reduce. Bad news for buyers, the Dun & Bradstreet survey shows the selling price index at levels not seen since 2009 . Gareth Jones, CEO of Dun & Bradstreet in Australia & New Zealand, says the falling currency is having a mixed impact on the business sector . According to Gareth Jones, CEO of Dun & Bradstreet in Australia & New Zealand, the falling currency is having a mixed impact on the business sector. 'The double-edge nature of currency movements is being borne out with mixed views from businesses on its effect,' said Mr Jones. 'While there has undoubtedly been a benefit for sections of the economy, such as manufacturers, the weaker dollar has introduced new cost pressures for businesses and industries that are reliant on imported goods. 'To cover these costs, many operations will be forced to lift their own prices, which will in turn flow through to other businesses and consumers alike,' Mr Jones added. D and B economic advisor Stephen Koukoulas said: 'In the past year or two we have had the cautious consumer, we've all been a little bit worried about a range of factors and, let's be honest, both sides of politics have not made it any easier, with scare campaigns about budgets and the like'. 'One thing that is a little worrying are selling prices, as a greater number of items are directly linked to the strength of otherwise of the Aussie dollar, we are going to be paying more seeing that we import the bulk of electronic goods and clothing,' Mr Koukoulas added. Steven Koukoulas of Dun & Bradstreet warns: 'You’d be saying that in the next two to three months basic consumer imported items, will see us asking ""why is my cost of living becoming more expensive"" and it will be a little bit more considering the cheaper items that we bring in.' It's predicted the spend nationally through and beyond the festive season sales could top more than $16 billion . Australian Retailers Association Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said retailers had seen unprecedented crowds during the recent sales, with many stores forced to restrict entrance due to the sheer number of people already in store. 'While consumers can now purchase almost anything from the comfort of their own living rooms, online shopping can never fully replace the five-sense experience that comes with being amongst the craziness and excitement at the local mall on Boxing Day.'

'Yes things like Chinese manufactured goods are so cheap because of cheap labour and cheaper overheads and they were as cheap as chips when we were above parity (dollar to dollar) but now it's not we face a double whammy - the Aussie is presenting about 20 per cent less value. 'But the good news is that hiring intentions have picked up, businesses can help by giving consumers a job. 'Employment which has been weak in the past year or so – not catastrophic but weak, so if we are getting a turning point on employment that would be significant. 'There's so many conflicting pressures on the economy, the big fall in terms of trade and iron ore prices, the RBA is getting a bit worried, now the dollar is falling, it's a lot to manage. 'On the other hand, low borrowing rates, cheaper fuel and an improving US economy, provide additional cause for optimism.'

The D&B survey reveals the significance of the falling dollar on businesses, with 21 per cent listing it as the issue that will influence their operations the most, with 'cash flow' the only more pressing concern (26 per cent) for their operations in the first quarter of 2015. A notable concern too going forward is the number of businesses optimistic about growth this year compared to last. That figure has fallen from 74 per cent to 65 per cent month-on-month, and from 68 per cent year-on-year.","Falling Australia dollar means higher prices are on the way .

"The people of Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar have lived through countless bombings, shootings and kidnappings in recent years, but now a new peril stalks the streets - huge house rats. Residents of the city, on the front line of Pakistan's battle against Taliban militants, say the rodents have eaten countless chickens, bitten dozens of adults, spread disease and even killed a baby. But help is at hand in the stocky form of Naseer Ahmad. Scroll down for video . Rat catcher: Naseer Ahmad watches his daughter as she collects dead rats in a residential area of Peshawar . Armed with a hoe, wheelbarrow and plastic gloves and accompanied by his three young daughters, the 40-something Mr Ahmad is waging a dogged battle against the rats of Peshawar - and says he's killed more than 100,000 in the past 18 months. 'It is my mission and I took it on after I saw my friend taking his wife to hospital because she was bitten by a rat,' Mr Ahmad told AFP while on a mission in the city's densely populated Zaryab neighbourhood. 'Her medical treatment cost him 5,000 rupees ($50, £30) and she had to have an anti-rabies injection.' The rats are nine to 12 inches long, almost the same again when you include the tail. 'They are everywhere, in the streets, in markets and in shops.' Mr Ahmad lays poison for the rats: Residents of the Peshawar, on the front line of Pakistan's battle against Taliban militants, say the rodents have eaten chickens, bitten adults, spread disease and even killed a baby . Scourge of the rodents: Mr Ahmad is accompanied by his three daughters are he prepares his special poison mixture. He says Peshawar's rats have now become resistant to regular poisons . Daddy's girls: Mr Ahmad watches his daughter pick up a dead rat for disposal after it has been poisoned . Man on a mission: Peshawar's children watch Mr Ahmad disposing of a rat. He might be dedicated, and popular with residents, but so far Mr Ahmad's efforts are strictly unofficial - and unpaid by the authorities . The rat-hunter says they attack at night and escape before dawn, damaging the fabric of houses and shops, contaminating food and biting women and children. In past, the rat numbers in the city were limited but monsoon flash floods in the surrounding countryside in recent years have driven them downtown. Many make their home in an open sewer which flows through the city and come out at night, gnawing with their large teeth and scurrying about in poor neighbourhoods. As night falls, Mr Ahmad begins his hunt, tracking the rats on foot - street by street, house by house and shop by shop. He takes a piece of bread, sprinkles sugar on it and sprays it with a chemical mixture. 'They are actually immune to local poison now, so I have to apply my own formula,' Mr Ahmad said. While Ahmad and his daughters lay the bait, further down the narrow grubby street, resident Gul Zada patches up holes chewed by rats in the floor of his house. Other than structural damage, Mr Zada said rats killed his infant nephew. 'They bit my nephew last year, he was one and a half years old, but we took him to hospital and he died there,' he told AFP. Mr Zada's grandfather Faqir Gul said everyone has traps in their houses, but locals say Mr Ahmad is the only effective resistance force. 'They attack like an army and come around 10 c'clock at night,' Ammanullah Khan, a tailor who makes leather jackets, told AFP, complaining the rats chewed through his stock. Rats: Dozens of the filthy rodents, flies crawling all over them, can be seen piled up ready for burial . Infection control: Before disposing of the rats, Mr Ahmad packs them into plastic carrier bags . Helping hand: A boy holds open a carrier bag while Mr Ahmad shovels rats in using a hoe . Ashes to ashes, dust to dust: The dead rats are finally buried in a field on the outskirts of Peshawar . Mr Ahmad lays the poisoned bread in corners, in front of shops and all other places where the rats can sneak in. The morning after comes the clear-up, and Mr Ahmad's formula seemed to do the trick. Residents could be seen collecting dead rats with shovels and hoes and throwing them in a street corner. Mr Ahmad gathered up to 100, pitching the dead rats in his wheelbarrow using a hoe. He put them in plastic bags and buried them in a field. He might be dedicated, and popular with residents, but so far Mr Ahmad's efforts are strictly unofficial - and unpaid by the authorities. But he remains undeterred. 'I have no resources and no help from government but its more than a mission for me,' Mr Ahmad said.","Monsoon flash floods in the countryside have driven rats into the city .

"Britain has a higher proportion of single parent families than any other country in Western Europe, official figures show. An analysis across the EU showed that nearly one in five British families are headed by a single adult. And while 18.4 per cent of families in this country have a solo parent, numbers come to just 12.7 per cent in Germany, 14.4 per cent in France and 10.6 per cent in the Netherlands. Britain has a higher proportion of single parent families than any other country in Western Europe . In Belgium – long considered the closest continental comparison to Britain for single parents – the share is 16.1 per cent. In Ireland, it is 18.1 per cent. The proportion of single parents is higher only in the former communist countries of Eastern Europe, which have suffered a lack of state support for the family unit and high levels of social problems such as alcoholism. The figures, published by the EU statistics arm Eurostat, are fresh evidence of the decline of family stability in Britain. Last week it emerged that 16-year-olds in this country are more likely to have a smartphone (62 per cent) than live with both parents (57 per cent). Family researcher and author Patricia Morgan said: ‘It is deplorable that we now find ourselves in the same situation as Eastern European countries.’ The figures are fresh evidence of the decline of family stability in Britain (picture posed by model) Despite children from two parent families being more likely to do well at school and have good health, the UK accounts for five of the top 20 cities in Europe for single parenting. According to the latest EU analysis, these include Belfast, where 34.6 per cent of families are lone parent; Liverpool has 31.5 per cent; Glasgow 31 per cent; the Inner London East zone 30.7 per cent; and Birmingham 26.9 per cent. All other cities and regions that make the top 20 are either in Eastern Europe or France’s overseas departments in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean. The figures, which are based on the 2011 UK census, come at a time of deepening controversy over the role of co-habitation in generating single parent families. While divorce rates have been falling in recent years, rates of break-up among cohabiting parents remain four times higher than those for married couples. Several judges are in favour of more legal rights for partners who live together, and Lib Dem peer Lord Marks has launched a Bill to bring in a law for cohabitees. But critics believe that giving legal status to cohabiting couples would encourage parents not to marry and lead to even more family breakdown. In 2013, the Office for National Statistics estimated there are 1.9million lone parent families in England and Wales whose children are school age or younger. It said around a quarter of all families with dependent children are led by solo parents. And one in three British couples raising children have a child from a previous relationship in their family unit, according to a report by Aviva last year.","Britain has highest proportion of single parent families in Western Europe .

"As many as 800 homemade tacks have been discovered scattered around a park with the deliberately-placed dangerous objects being labelled as a malicious and cowardly act. Yarra Council parks crews have conducted an extensive search of Edinburgh Gardens in North Fitzroy using a high-powered magnet sweeper everyday since a resident found two in the grass of the Melbourne park told last Friday. So far there have been an astounding 800 tacks found which look to be made out of chicken wire with multiple spikes - and some are as large as a ten cent coin.

"Happy New Year! The festive season is sadly over and it’s back to work and reality for most of us now. All that eating, drinking and partying during Christmas and New Year can really take its toll on the complexion, so I’ve decided a January skin-detox is due. Out with the old products, and in with the new. Scroll down for video . Binky's New Year's beauty resolution is to detox her skin and regain a healthy complexion . It’s always a good idea to switch up your skincare routine every so often to correlate with your skin’s needs for the season, so this week I thought I’d share with you some of the products I’m using to revive my dull, tired post-Christmas complexion. Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past few weeks, you’ll have heard that the French Pharmacy classic La Roche-Posay Serozinc is now available to buy in the UK – exclusively at Escentual.com – and this little gem has completely transformed my skin. Serozinc is a zinc-sulphate enriched toning mist that has been applauded by bloggers, beauty writers and dermatologists around the world, and until a few days ago you’d have to venture across the pond to get hold of it – so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard I was finally going to be able to try it! The toner only has three ingredients – zinc sulphate, sodium chloride and thermal spring water. The simple yet highly effective formulation targets spots and blemishes, calming redness and with continued use leaving the skin looking and feeling clean and fresh. It’s hypoallergenic and non-perfumed too, making it suitable for acne-prone skin. As part of her skin revamp Binky had  a Skinbreeze Hydro Mask, the gel mask has powerful antioxidants that reduce redness and smooth fine lines and wrinkles . It also mattifies oily skin and prevents shine, as well as tightening the appearance of pores for an altogether more radiant and clear complexion. Serozinc can be used as a daily toner between cleansing and moisturising, as well as during the day whenever your skin needs refreshing. I’ve been using it morning and night as part of my skincare routine for a few weeks now and the amount of angry red marks or blemishes popping up on my skin has drastically reduced – my complexion feels clear, clean and fresh. Serozinc is selling fast, though, so make sure you get your mitts on it while you still can! Binky also tried out Masque Bar Brightening Sheet Mask said to give you a radiant glow in just one use . I’m sure most of us have suffered from pesky post-Christmas breakouts – myself included – so to restore and clarify over-worked skin I recommend the Vichy Normaderm 3 in 1 Cleanser, Scrub and Mask, which clears imperfections and eliminates excess sebum. As it’s both a cleanser and an exfoliator, it also leaves the complexion looking brighter and more radiant, making it the ideal remedy to dull winter skin. The moisturiser you pick is very much dependent on your skin type – if you have oily skin, the La Roche-Posay Effaclar Mat Moisturiser will reduce shine and tighten pores, while keeping your complexion feeling super-soft. For dry skin types, the Vichy Nutrologie 1 For Dry Skin Moisturiser rehydrates the skin by replenishing its natural supply of lipids – leaving skin feeling smooth and nourished for 24 hours. Another product to brighten up partied-out skin is the La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Serum. It immediately minimises the appearance of dark spots and dull areas on the skin, evening out skin tone for a radiant and more uniform complexion. Serozinc is said to be the hottest new beauty ingredient used by bloggers, beauty writers and dermatologists . January is a month for R&R, and for me there’s nothing more relaxing than chilling out with a face mask to refresh and rejuvenate dull, tired skin. One of my ultimate favourites is the Skinbreeze Hydro Mask. It’s a gel mask filled with powerful antioxidants which immediately reduce the appearance of redness and irritation on the skin, as well as smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles. The Hydro Mask – like the name suggests – always leaves my complexion feeling ultra-hydrated, making it the perfect January pick-me-up for the skin. Another face mask I’m loving is the Masque Bar Brightening Sheet Mask. It helps minimise the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation on the skin for a more even complexion, and transforms skin from dull and sallow to radiant and glowing after just one use. Finally, if overindulging at Christmas has led to any pesky spots or blemishes cropping up, the REN ClearCalm 3 Clarity Restoring Mask will help calm them down and restore clarity to your skin. Its mix of antibacterial nutrients also reduce excess oiliness and minimise scarring, leaving skin feeling and looking purified. 2015, I’m ready for you (well, at least my skin is!).

"New Orleans Saints linebacker Junior Galette was arrested Monday in a domestic violence case in which a woman says her face was scratched and her ear bloodied after an earring was ripped off. Galette was booked with misdemeanor simple battery stemming from the disturbance at the player's house in Kenner, a New Orleans suburb. Prosecutors could later charge him. It is not clear if Galette, who left jail on $600 bond Monday afternoon, has a lawyer. New Orleans Saints linebacker Junior Galette was arrested Monday in a domestic violence case in which a woman says her face was scratched and her ear bloodied after an earring was ripped off . Officers arrested Galette after a 22-year-old woman called Monday morning, police spokesman Lt. Brian McGregor said. He said an arrest under Kenner Police policy was required because of visible injuries. The woman contends Galette and his cousin Terrance Banks, of Newark, New Jersey, forcibly removed her from the home during an argument that began when she demanded a cab fare. Banks also was arrested and was released on $300 bond. The Saints said they are aware of the arrest and are gathering information. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league knows of the arrest and is 'looking into it.' New Orleans Times Picayune notes that the case will be a test for the NFL's newly revamped personal conduct policy in the wake of several domestic violence incidents over the last year, most notably former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Price . Because the case is in its early stages, it was unclear what punishment Galette could face from the NFL, which this past season adopted new codes of conduct pertaining to domestic violence. The policy calls for a six-game suspension, without pay, 'for violations involving assault, battery, domestic violence, dating violence, child abuse, other forms of family violence, or sexual assault.' The policy also says that 'consideration is given to possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances.' According to McGregor, the woman gave this account: Galette pushed her and helped Banks pin her down in an effort to subdue her. She momentarily struggled to breathe while beneath the two men, and when they let her up she grabbed a knife, fearful she would be attacked again. At that point, Galette began to record a video of her actions. Prosecutors could later charge him. It is not clear if Galette, who left jail on $600 bond Monday afternoon, has a lawyer . The woman told police that after she dropped the knife, Banks lifted her off the ground and carried her from the home, and Banks then took her phone as she started to dial 911. McGregor said Galette also indicated he had a video recording, and police are attempting to execute a search warrant to obtain it. When police asked the woman about her relationship with Galette, she said she has 'stayed with' him for about two years, cooking, cleaning and doing 'everything for him that he wants, and he takes care of me,' McGregor said. Galette disputed that the woman lived with him and referred to her as 'a dancer,' McGregor said. Galette did not give authorities any other statements about the disturbance, McGregor added. The 26-year-old player was the team's sacks leader this season 10. He was signed as an undrafted rookie in 2010 and in September signed a $41.5 million contract extension through 2019.","New Orleans Saints linebacker Junior Galette was arrested Monday in a domestic violence case .

One of his first ventures will be to launch the 'Kubby': a cannabis lozenge. Venture: Mike Gravel, 84, plans to launch a cannabis as the new head of innovative weed firm KUSH . 'I’m anxious to assist in bringing this important resource to a broader market in a serious and credible way,' Gravel said in a statement. It is the latest in a political lifetime of controversial moves for Gravel, a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War and drug law reformist. An entire chapter of his book Citizen Power slams the 'war on drugs' that started with President Nixon. His appointment comes after years as 'an aggressive board member' at Cannabis Sativa Inc, Gravel told Alaska Dispatch News. With bases in Washington and Colorado - where marijuana use is legal - the firm plans to venture into Alaska in the near future after a ballot measure legalized recreational use in November. Steve Kubby, chairman of Cannabis Sativa Inc - and namesake of the new lozenge - said in a statement: 'Senator Gravel stood up to Nixon, stood up to the Pentagon, and now he is standing up to those in power who would keep the healthful benefits of cannabis from those who need them. 'He’s been a director of KUSH since its inception and brings invaluable perspective and connections to our group. 'He’s a true American hero and we’re excited to have him serving in this capacity.'

"The unfortunate teenager whose feet grew so big that he was barely able to walk successfully underwent surgery at a hospital in China. Teenager Xiao Meng was born with a genetic condition that causes the feet to swell abnormally - meaning he cannot wear shoes. The 14-year-old, dubbed Hobbit Boy by schoolmates, is pictured here having his feet measured by doctors at Shanghai Children's Hospital ahead of the treatment. Scroll down for video . Under the knife: Doctors take measurements from 14-year-old Xiao Meng's feet. The boy underwent a four-hour operation at Shanghai Children's Hospital . Marking the spot: Doctors prepare Xiao for surgery by marking points on his feet where they will cut away the growths . The 14-year-old's feet had grown so large that he was no longer able to wear shoes and could barely walk . Following the operation doctors said that his left foot is expected to recover fully but that his right foot will require further treatment. Speaking to reporters, Xiao said: 'I wish I could wear shoes like my classmates. I wish i could run fast like they do. I wish I go everywhere I want.' Xiao's family were too poor to pay for treatment and, as a result, his feet have grown bigger and bigger with age. The hospital has pledged to carry out the operation and subsequent care for free, following a campaign launched by his school teachers that was supported by the Chinese media. Xiao rests in bed before going for treatment. He told reporters before the surgery: 'I wish I could wear shoes like my classmates. I wish i could run fast like they do.' Anaesthetised: The teenager hopes to be able to walk again one day but will need physiotherapy to learn how to walk . Hard at work: Xiao was able to achieve funding for his treatment after a campaign by teachers and the local media . His family have also received thousands of pounds towards his care as a result of the campaign. A team of doctors can be seen making marks on Xiao's feet before the operation. The medics first cut away the excess growths from his feet before allowing six months of recovery time. Xiao will now undergo physiotherapy to learn how to use his newly trimmed feet. Speaking . earlier this week, his father Meng Zhaoguang, said: 'We're an ordinary . family and it breaks my heart to see him suffer but we have no money for . medicine.' Xiao's father massages his feet in Shanghai Children's Hospital before the operation . Xiao described his melancholy at not being able to join his friends as they play games. He said: 'I like school but it hurts to walk and I can't go quickly or join in many games. Children sometimes call me names but they don't mean to be cruel.' But, after appearing in local media, well-wishers donated thousands of pounds towards medical fees. Before the operation one of the doctors, Tang Yujin, said: 'We can treat the condition and when that is stable we plan to reduce the size of his feet so they look and feel more normal.'

"He might be the Prime Minister - but that doesn't mean David Cameron can't do with a little guidance from time to time. Mr Cameron has revealed that he consults his wife Samantha before taking 'life and death' decisions - including whether to  rescue British hostages. The Prime Minister said he turned to Mrs Cameron about the matters which keep him awake at night - including 'putting troops potentially in harm's way' - because he valued her opinions. David Cameron (left) has revealed that he consults wife Samantha (right) before taking 'life and death' decisions - including whether to rescue British hostages in Syria . He said: ‘Samantha is passionate about me continuing what I am doing. The Government has done a good job but it isn’t finished. We have to see it through, that is her strong view.’ He added: ‘She has very good judgment. I talk to Samantha about the most difficult decisions, life and death situations such as rescuing hostages or putting troops potentially in harm’s way. 'You worry a lot. It is a very turbulent night when something like that is going to happen. ‘There is a whole process in Cobra (the emergency committee) and listening to military advice, but in the end I make the decision.’ Mr Cameron made the comments during an exclusive interview with the Mail On Sunday, to mark the launch of his election campaign. Praising his wife's organisational skills, he added: ‘If she’d organised Napoleon’s march on Moscow, they would have reached Vladivostok in good time. Passionate: The Prime Minister, right, made the comments to The Mail on Sunday editors Geordie Greig, left, and Glen Owen . 'This year she did a lot of the Christmas shopping but I tried to make up for it with some cooking.’ Mr Cameron took the decision to send in the SAS to rescue aid worker Helen Johnson in Afghanistan in 2012. He also agonised in recent years over whether British hostages held by ISIS could be saved. The Prime Minister has said in the past that he found Mrs Cameron’s advice useful because she took a common sense - rather than political - approach to current affairs. Last year, the Prime Minister’s wife is said to have pressed him to do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria. As an ambassador for Save The Children, Mrs Cameron spent time in Lebanon at a refugee camp for those displaced by the civil war. At the time, the Prime Minister denied that his wife had influenced his thinking. The Camerons are due to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary next year. Talking about their relationship, he said: ‘We love each other. 'We try not to go to bed on an argument and we spend time together and don’t take it for granted.’ In the interview, Mr Cameron also revealed that his new favourite musician to cook to is the folk star Nick Mulvey and that he had also been appointed chief supervisor for their children’s homework. On the political side, the Prime Minister spoke about his relationship with Washington, revealing that Obama rings and now calls him ‘bro’.","Prime Minister turns to wife about decisions which keep him awake at night .

"Three police officers returning from the funeral of a slain New York City cop helped restrain a suicidal woman on a JetBlue Airways flight until the plane was diverted to Chicago. The flight, bound for Salt Lake City, Utah, landed instead at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport late on Sunday after the 32-year-old woman with a medical issue 'created a disturbance'. Once the plane arrived at O'Hare Airport, an ambulance took the woman to an area hospital, where she was being evaluated, Chicago Police Department spokesman Thomas Sweeney said. Scroll down for video . Salt Lake County Sheriff's Sgt. Terry Wall, left, and two other Utah police officers, including Detective Robert Odor (right) returning from the funeral of a slain New York City officer helped restrain a suicidal airline passenger as the plane was diverted to Chicago . The Long Island woman, who has not been identified, was allegedly intoxicated and reportedly so upset following a fight with her husband that she began threatening suicide with prescription medication that she was carrying. 'She started writing a note on a spiral notebook. It was in large letters. It was kind of in shaky writing. And what it turned out to be was a suicide note,' police detective Robert Odor told The Desert News. 'So I was reading it as she was writing it. She tried to take the remainder of the pills, I don't know how many. She tried to take the whole bottle. So at that point I intervened and took the bottle away from her, took the note away from her.' Detective Odor later told a press conference: 'It was street fight at 30,000 feet.' JetBlue Airways spokeswoman Sharon A. Jones said Flight 71 departed from John F. Kennedy International Airport at 7.45pm (EST) and arrived in Chicago around 9pm. The plane refueled before departing again. It landed at Salt Lake City International Airport around 1.40am (MST), around three and a half hours late. Salt Lake County Sheriff's Sgt. Terry Wall and two officers from the Unified Police Department described the experience at a news conference on Monday, saying the flight crew seated the woman near them about an hour into the flight. After being seated near the officers, the woman started having a medical issue and became combative. The officers said she tried to kick and spit at them and a doctor who was assisting her. Sgt. Wall said they did not handcuff the woman but held her arms and legs for about an hour and a half until the plane landed. Jones said there were no reports of injuries or any damage to the aircraft. The woman was not arrested and no charges were pending. Wall, Odor and Unified Police Officer Cody Stromberg were among the thousands of mourners attending the Sunday funeral of Officer Wenjian Liu, who was killed in an ambush shooting along with another officer while sitting in their patrol car in Brooklyn last month.

"Chinese TV fans are furious after a big-budget costume drama about the nation's only empress was edited to cut out her cleavage. The Empress of China was mysteriously taken off the air last month after its star's low-cut dresses prompted a flurry of chatter on social media. Now it has returned to TV screens - but the shots are so tightly cropped that viewers can only see actress Fan Bingbing's face. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Big-budget costume drama The Empress of China has returned to TV screens - but with actress Fan Bingbing's cleavage decidedly cropped out. Viewers went online to vent their anger at the move . The TV drama, also known at The Saga of Wu Zetian, was one of most expensive ever made in the country and documents the reign of China's only known empress from AD 690 to AD 705. It first aired on commercial satellite station Hunan TV on December 21, but was removed a week later for 'technical reasons', according to state news agency Xinhua. The show resumed broadcasting on New Year's Day, but eagle-eyed viewers were quick to realise what had changed. Several posted 'before and after' shots to Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, complaining about the apparent interference by the government. They said the hasty cropping had left the £1million show's reported stock of 3,000 outfits, including hundreds of costume changes by the empress herself, almost completely redundant. Evidence: Fans of the show, one of China's most expensive either with a reported budget of around £1million, posted these before and after shots from the same episode on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter . Others complained that cutting out the Wu Zetian's breasts damaged the show's historical accuracy. According to Shanghaiist, one wrote: 'In Tang Dynasty, the higher a woman’s social status, the lower her neckline. 'I didn’t have a thorough study on how low their neckline is, but I think it shows that the drama should follow the historical facts. 'No matter if the show is good or not, I don’t agree with the media regulator’s measures.' A poll of 86,000 users by Sina Weibo found 95 per cent thought the censorship was unnecessary. 'Can revealing cleavage really be considered pornographic?' wrote one. 'Isn't this feudalism?' Ruined: Some users complained that the tweaks made the star's hundreds of costume changes redundant . But some supported the move, according to Xinhua. One, Jingjingmi-ko, wrote: 'I can hardly look at the TV as there are so many breasts'. The incident is the latest in a long line of tales of censorship and state control in modern China. A 2013 study found almost a third of online posts which are deemed inappropriate on Sina Weibo were being deleted within half an hour. Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach, writing for arXiv.org, found  some posts were deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online. Needed: Another internet user said the actress's cleavage was necessary to ensure historical accuracy . Popular: The show documented the life of Wu Zetian, the only empress ever to rule China in her own right . In November campaigners complained China has censored a wide array of websites - including Youtube - in a days leading up to the World Internet Conference in eastern Zhejiang province. And last week Chinese Gmail users were unable to access their accounts for days after the service appeared to have been blocked in the country, along with parts of the Google search engine. Wu Zetian, the only empress ever to have ruled China in her own right, began as a concubine to Emperor Taizong in the seventh century. When he died she married his ninth son and successor Emperor Gaozong, building up considerable political influence until Gaozong suffered a stroke in AD 690. She ruled for 15 years, enshrining Buddhism as a protected religion and ordering successful attacks on enemy garrisons before losing the throne in a coup shortly before her death in AD 705.","Scenes  featured in big-budget costume drama The Empress of China .

"Commuters heading home from their first day back at work after Christmas have been hit by 'dangerous overcrowding' at London Bridge station. Trains reportedly left the station half-empty after crowds became trapped outside the ticket barriers and stranded commuters at London Bridge tonight took to Twitter to vent their frustration. Chris Adams wrote: 'Trains leaving London Bridge half empty because everyone is stuck being crushed in the queuing system outside. Genius.' Scroll down for video . Commuters heading home from their first day back at work after Christmas have been hit by 'dangerous overcrowding' at London Bridge . Trains reportedly left the station half-empty after crowds became trapped outside the ticket barriers . Chris Beaumont added: 'Utter bloody chaos on the trains in and out of London Bridge tonight. I've been commuting in London for 16 years and never seen it so bad.' Liz Fenwick wrote: 'Train prices rise and so do tempers at London Bridge.' And Andy Jones said: 'Really dangerous overcrowding at London Bridge. No trains anywhere for 50 mins & tickets not allowed on alternatives. No policing anywhere.' The busy rail station partially closed over the festive period due to major engineering work and reopened this morning - only for passengers to be hit by long hold-ups. As part of the £6.5bn Thameslink programme, London Bridge saw two new platforms opened and new track laid. But this morning, there were delays of up to 45 minutes at London Bridge station due to a signalling problem. It came as commuters were also hit by New Year price hikes, which saw season ticket fare go up by 2.5% from January 2. The busy rail station had partially closed over the festive period due to major engineering work . Starting during the morning rush-hour and lasting until at least 12 noon, the delays affected passengers with the Southern train company. Passengers using Southern trains at London Bridge tweeted their experiences this morning. Lindsey Jenkinson ‏wrote: 'It seems I'm destined to spend the rest of my life sitting on a Southern train outside London Bridge station. Send food.' Chantelle Maie wrote: 'London Bridge station is such a shambles.' Martin O'Neill wrote: 'First day back for many, rail fares up and loads of people stranded at London Bridge station. Oh the joy of joys of being British.' Protests against the fares rise were held at more than 40 stations today. Those demonstrating included trade unionists and the Green Party. At Brighton station, Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said:  'It is now high time to end the annual persecution of rail passengers with constant above-inflation fares hikes. 'Labour should commit itself to a 12-month long fares freeze from next January if it wins the general election in May.' Southern and Thameslink trains had been unable to call at London Bridge from December 20 to January 4 due to the engineering work. There also rush-hour problems today for CrossCountry and First Great Western passengers following an overrun of planned engineering work. This caused buses to replace trains between between Weston-super-Mare and Bristol Temple Meads until around 7.30am, with services back to normal at around 8.15am. There were other problems for rush-hour train travellers, many of whom were returning to work for the first time since the holiday. Trains at King's Cross were cancelled because of overrunning Network Rail engineering works last month . A signalling problem at Merstham in Surrey prevented trains towards London from stopping at Redhill, Merstham or Coulsdon South. This affected passengers travelling on Southern and Thameslink services. Another signalling problem, near Eaglescliffe in County Durham, meant buses had to replace trains between Middlesbrough and Darlington stations during the morning peak. A broken-down train at Harrow & Wealdstone in north west London led to delays between London and Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire. In the West Midlands a broken-down freight train at Bloxwich meant no trains could run between Rugeley Trent Valley and Walsall. On Merseyside, an electrical supply problems at Meols caused delays to trains between Bidston and West Kirby. The problems today follow chaotic scenes in London on December 27 when a Network Rail (NR) overrun led to the closure of King's Cross and Paddington stations. Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the overrun was totally unacceptable, and NR and the Office of Rail Regulation have both launched inquiries. The NR inquiry report is expected to be completed by the end of this week. Next week NR chief executive Mark Carne, who has said he is not taking his annual bonus, is due to appear before the House of Commons Transport Committee to explain the December 27 difficulties.","Trains left station half-empty after crowds became trapped outside barriers .

"The first winter storm of 2015 is striking flashbacks of last year's polar vortex, as it conjures gusting winds, blizzard-worthy snowfall and deathly-low temperatures across much of the country. Fifteen states from Washington to Ohio are on high alert, as winter storm Gorgon threatens to blanket 2,000 miles of the U.S. in snow before Tuesday morning. Forecasters say Gorgon will strike hardest late Monday night, as it speeds up crossing the Mississippi River to hit the Midwest and East Coast with winter weather chaos. Gorgon will cause the most trouble on Midwestern roads, since the combination of high winds and snow will hamper visibility and freezing temperatures will render road salts useless. Scroll down for video . Welcome to winter: The banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois were pictured frozen on Monday, just hours before Winter Storm Gorgon's arrival in the Midwest . At the start: Gorgon formed over the Northwestern U.S. on Sunday, and started moving east on Monday to dump several inches of snow in Montana and the Plains states. Above, Cody Charboneau shovels a walkway in front of the Blackstone building in downtown Great Falls, Montana on Monday . Across the country: Much of the northern U.S. will feel the impact of Gorgon on Tuesday. Above, a map that shows nationwide temperatures for Tuesday . Drivers in the region are also being warned to bundle up before they take to the road, in case their car becomes stuck in the road in the fatal below 10-degree temperatures. The banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago are already freezing over, and residents there could see as much as five inches of snow by early Tuesday. Meanwhile, in New York, rainy showers will give way to cold air and the Big Apple 'will be lucky if it hits 20' for a high and could see lows near 10 degrees, forecasters said. The first winter storm of 2015: Fifteen states from Washington to Ohio have issued winter storm alerts as the nation braces for Gorgon . Powdered: Snow started falling in Rocky Mountains and Plains on Monday, with the most accumulation in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho . Flurries: Gorgon will continue to drop snow as it makes its way to the East Coast, with the most snowfall in the Great Lakes region . Gorgon formed Sunday over the northwest, but didn't start moving until Monday, when caused landslides in the Pacific Northwest and car accidents in the Plains states. The several inches of snowfall and 70-mile-an-hour  winds also led to school closures in Montana, Wyoming, The Dakotas and Iowa. Jackson Hole, Wyoming reported some of the heaviest snow fall with 17 inches Monday morning. Pine Creek Pass, Idaho saw 15.7 inches while most of the Plains received half a foot. Less snow is expected as the storm moves into the Great Lakes, Ohio River Valley and Appalachia, but the conditions will be worse for driving conditions in these more populated areas. Accumulation: On Monday, Gorgon moved out of Montana into the Plains states, where it continues to drop several inches of snow. Above, Bill Taylor crosses Main Avenue while walking from the Sioux Falls, South Dakota Family YMCA to his office downtown  on Monday, January 5, 2015 .

Winter is hard work: Hueners seen back at working clearing the sidewalk in front of  his Sioux Falls property . Deteriorating: Gorgon is expected to get worse as it moves east towards the Midwest and East Coast. Above, Dave Dandar shovels the sidewalk outside a building he owns, during Winter Storm Gorgon on Monday in Sioux Falls, South Dakota . Exposure: Laurie Furey works on clearing snow at South High School to make way for students returning to school, on Monday, January 5, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota . By Tuesday morning, the storm is expected to hit the East Coast cities of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC and New York just in time for the commute to work. Only a light dusting of snow is expected in these cities, as the storm winds its way down. However, temperatures will drop and are expected to stay uncomfortably low through Thursday. For many parts of the country, temperatures will reach highs of just zero to the teens and twenties. The storm system will also bring a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to parts of upstate New York. In the south, even Atlanta, Georgia, will see low temperatures of around 15 degrees on Monday and Tuesday - but there is not expected to be any ice to accompany the chilly weather. Frozen wonderland: A photographer braves the cold to shoot photos along Lake Michigan on Monday, January 5, 2015, in Chicago. The city could see as much as five inches of snow by Tuesday morning . Aftermath? Lake effect snow in the Great Lakes region could be triggered in Gorgon's wake. Above, a bike commuter walks on an ice-covered path near Lake Michigan on Monday in Chicago . Frigid: Waves splash as blocks of ice pile up along Lake Michigan near Oak Street Beach in Chicago on Monday . Brrrr: Blocks of ice pile up along Lake Michigan near Ohio Street Beach, Monday, January 5, 2015, in Chicago . Cold weather: Ice covers the shore of Lake Michigan on Monday in Chicago. Forecasters expect significant snowfall and continued freezing temperatures this week in northern Illinois . Ice water: People around the state woke up to below-normal temperatures Monday. The coldest temperatures were in northern Illinois, where the National Weather Service said it was 2 degrees below zero at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Above, ice forms on Lake Michigan near Oak Street beach on Monday in Chicago . And in the West, a stream of Pacific moisture will drop as much as six inches of rain in the Seattle area - and could mean substantial snowfall in the Cascades. In fact, California appears to be one of the only U.S. states unaffected by the weather. The drought-ridden state will be sunny this week. A dip in the jet stream means cold air from Canada and points north is plummeting into the eastern two-thirds of the United States. However, forecasters are shying away from calling it a 'polar vortex'. The forthcoming cold can be linked to the dip, according to Michael Musher, with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. This is because the air is coming from near the north pole, he said. But the low-pressure system itself isn't going to sink into the United States this year, just the temperatures that precede it. By the end of the week, temperatures are expected to lift slightly, forecasters said. Commuters cross the Chicago River on their way to work as temperatures hovered around zero degrees Fahrenheit during the morning rush on January 5, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois . No end: Temperatures are expected to remain in the single digits today and three to six inches of snow are expected to fall this evening . Shivering: Commuters cover their heads and wrap their necks with scarves as they walk to work in Chicago on Monday . Dreaming of summer vacation: The commuters looked none-to-happy to be out in the cold on their way to work in the frigid temperatures . Power on: A commuter in winter coat, gloves and a hat makes his way down a street in Chicago on Monday . Earlier this week, Weather Channel meteorologist Roy Lucksinger explained Gorgon as a series of 'dangerously cold 'arctic air masses thar are similar to - but not quite - last year's so-called 'polar vortex'. 'We're looking at 50million people in 24 states seeing some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,' CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said. 'This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous. Wind chills in Minnesota and the Dakotas are as low as minus 45 degrees. A second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday.' Speaking to USA Today, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin added: 'This is going to be a big cold outbreak, pretty windy as well. It's going to drive all the way down south.' Worrying: A series of 'dangerously cold'  arctic air masses will strike almost everywhere east of the Rockies on Monday (pictured), bringing freezing temperatures to more than 50million people, forecasters have said .","Winter storm Gorgon will hit the Midwest and East Coast late Monday night and Tuesday morning .

"As she cuts open deep red radishes to reveal the pink rings inside, you might think Amber Locke is creating an elaborate salad. But while she tears up lambs lettuce and arranges waxy-skinned chillies, she is actually creating an exquisite piece of art. Artist, vegan cook and blogger Ms Locke has made a series of designs in which she lays real fruit and vegetables on a sheet and photographs them from above. She says the idea for 'veg art'  blossomed from her own passion for a fruit and vegetable-based diet and living a healthy lifestyle. Eighteen months ago she decided to follow a vegan diet, which was not for ethical or health reasons but simply because it makes her feel 'fantastic'. She accidentally dropped some vegetables she was carrying home onto her flagstone doorstep, and some autumn leaves blew into them. It looked so beautiful, she decided to start creating other pieces of art, deconstructing salads and placing the produce into intricate patterns in order to create gorgeous designs. 'I love the beauty of natural foods; their different colours, shapes, textures and characters,' she told MailOnline. 'So to me, fruit and veg are not only really good for you nutritionally they also have a wonderful aesthetic appeal too. 'It’s a joy to use beautiful ingredients and my work aims to showcase their unique qualities, reflect the changing seasons of the year and also be a celebration of healthy living.' 'I love how each ingredient has its own little back story and how sometimes a seemingly random collection of things can inexplicably make a harmonious whole.' This is a rose petal strewn design, with ingredients  for a middle-eastern inspired salad. Amber said: 'I was making a salad with a slightly more unusual dressing. I used candy beetroots, cut finely so you could see the beautiful rings inside. Then I used chilli, ginger and some yellow beetroot which my mother had grown for me in her garden. As well as lettuce in the salad, I tossed through rose petals afterwards for a romantic feel' 'A textile-type design using a selection of fruit and veg I had to hand. It features watermelon radish from my parents. They pulled them out of the garden which is why you can see the roots. Then I used the last of the yellow courgettes from my greenhouse, long green peppers and pomegranates  , purple heirloom carrots (a gift from my mother’s kind friend) and some forgotten figs I found in the fridge' This design features yellow courgettes, fig leaves and radicchio flowers. 'I loved the yellows, greens and blues. My radicchio plant looks so beautiful when it goes to seed. The sun came out and cast a shadow across everything - I just love the quality of natural light.' This is a design for a root vegetable salad using heirloom carrots and autumn celeriac. Amber said wanted to use 'boring' ingredients like celeriac (pictured in white) and make them look interesting. She was inspired when she found the multi-coloured carrots at a stand in her local market. She said: 'He stocks veg by garden enthusiasts. You get an array of colours. This is where the carrots came in. I made it into two salads. Made a cashew mayonnaise and a julienne salad with a poppy seed dressing.' This was a paisley-inspired design for a super berry smoothie, featuring raspberries, strawberries, pink grapes, oranges, currents, goji berries, cashews and almonds. 'I arranged the fruits into a paisley design and put some glassware in, which I've never done before. I just thought it was really beautiful glassware' Amber said. 'It made for a pink, sweet and creamy smoothie.' This design is a wintery vegetable pattern using purple carrots, red Brussels sprouts, romanesco cauliflower, baby beets and turnips . 'It was winter and I was thinking about spring. I found some champagne rhubarb and I liked the way the leeks looked fluffy. I added, oranges, grapefruit and lime. The black twiggy  things that have pink flower were from a Japanese plant in my garden. I love the design because it looked spring like and cheered me up,' Amber said . This Caribbean style design features purple and white kale, pomegranate, papaya, oranges, strawberries, cucumber, passion fruit and cherries. Later, Amber whizzed it up into a smoothie. The design was a result of a trip to a Caribbean stall at her local market. 'I found some beautiful vivid kale, as bright as the picture,' she said. 'It was the colour of dark lavender. Then some white kale, with a green ruffle. It looked like fabric. For the design I just came back from the market with all these bright fruits and flunked down on the floor. The gorgeous smell of passion fruit filled the room' An autumn fruit salad with red apple 'spaghetti', pale pink pomegranates, turkish figs, black dessert grapes and an orange and passion fruit dressing. Amber said: 'The black grapes were from my little vine. They are very sweet and I scattered them at the end and the sunlight just caught them' Pictured are candy cane beets, purple radishes, and pink flamingo swiss chard, photographed with a soft, vintage-style filter. 'Every candied beetroot looks different and I get excited each time I cut into one. I just love that they have psychedelic pink and white candy cane stripes.' 'I have this green smoothie everyday. The design includes cucumber, broccoli, pears, lemon, spinach, apple, parsley and romaine lettuce' A design for a tropical smoothie featuring apple bananas, pineapple, papaya, mango. super sweet. 'The long spiky things were from a palm plant outside my black door. Pinepples are my favourite fruit, they're so beautiful and regal with their spikes and tortoise-shell skin.'

"Construction will begin in Fresco this week on the first 29-mile segment of the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train track after two years of delays and court battles. The $68-billion project has been dogged by political and legal opposition, with the California High-Speed Rail Authority having to win a series of court challenges  in order to secure funding and begin works. But despite a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled to take place Tuesday, rail officials are yet to secure the funds needed to complete the initial system over the next 14 years. Construction will begin in Fresco this week on the first 29-mile segment of the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train track after a two year fight . The two-year delay has largely been caused by problems acquiring land. The state still only has 101 of the needed 526 parcels for the first 29 miles. Agreements with two of the nation's most powerful private freight railroads, concerned about how the network will affect them, are also yet to be reached. Rail board Chairman Dan Richard told the LA Times that despite the challenges ahead 'we feel very confident that this program is going to go forward'. The groundbreaking will be led by Gov. Jerry Brown who sees the project as an important part of his leadership legacy. The concept originated during Brown's first term. Making the idea a reality, has proved to be one of the most difficult and contentious in recent state history. Martin Wachs, a UCLA professor emeritus of urban planning, said the high-speed rail authority had 'overcome quite a lot' to get this far, but still had 'enormous hurdles ahead of them'. The largest, he said, was securing funding to start a statewide system. In 2008, voters approved a $9-billion bond measure. The Obama administration then chipped in added grants of $3.2 billion. Then, last year, the Legislature agreed to provide 25 per cent of future greenhouse gas — or cap-and-trade — fees, which could produce $250 million to $1 billion annually for the bullet train. Martin Wachs, a UCLA professor emeritus of urban planning, said the high-speed rail authority had 'overcome quite a lot' to get this far, but still had 'enormous hurdles ahead of them' If the line is completed on schedule for 2028, only $26 billion would have been raised. Not even half the estimated cost, which is expected to rise as further delays and problems arise. Mr Wachs said the costs were 'surrounded by uncertainty'. He told the newspaper: 'The public should understand that the uncertainties are much greater than the certainties. But our political process doesn't allow us to say 'We don't know what it will cost or how long it will take, but let's get started anyway.' Mr Richard, the rail board's chairman, acknowledged that the project needed billions more in funding, but said that could be offset by money it could make through advertising and real estate developments along the route. The high-speed rail link is scheduled to be completed by 2028 and is expected to cost $68 billion . The state is counting on private investors to fund about a third of the system, but they are unlikely to commit until at least part of the system is up and running successfully. Mr Richard said a bridge over the Fresno River would be the first piece of major construction and that might not start until April. A further problems is that under federal funding requirements, billion dollar grants from both Washington and the state will need to be spent by October 2017, meaning construction will need to proceed at high speed. Over the next 1,000 days the state will have to spend at a rate of $3 million to $4 million every calendar day. Any unspent federal funds would have to be returned, although Mr Richard said he 'doesn't expect to leave any money on the table'.","A groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled to take place in Fresco tomorrow .

"A Chinese newborn with her umbilical cord still attached was found dead after apparently being thrown from a 17-storey building. Highly distressing images of the infant lying in a pool of blood, too graphic to publish, have been circulated widely on social media and news websites in China. It is believed the girl's body was found on the busy pavement on Saturday, prompting an urgent police investigation to find the baby's mother. Horrifying: A Chinese newborn with her umbilical cord still attached was found dead after apparently being thrown from a 17-storey building. The baby girl was found in the city of Liaoyuan in eastern China (file photo) Officers questioned residents of the building, which is in the city of Liaoyuan in China's eastern Jilin province, after the alarm was raised by horrified witnesses. Yesterday it was reported that the baby's mother may have been a vulnerable teenage girl with mental health issues. Liaoyuan's Peninsula Morning News, which posted the update on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, said the investigation was still in its early stages. Neighbour On Chiang said he 'spotted something on the ground and didn't immediately recognise it', according to the Central European News agency. 'I saw the blood first, and then I realised it was the body of a tiny baby', he added. 'I called police and told them what I had seen, and said that I couldn't see anybody in the building that might have thrown the child, nor was anybody else around. It was really shocking.' Investigation: The city where the baby died is in eastern China, near the country's border with North Korea . Reports suggested there was no lock on the door which accessed the building's stairwell, so the mother could have been someone living elsewhere. Residents who were interviewed by local journalists said they could not remember a pregnant woman living in the building. The incident has shocked many in China, a country where occasional horrific baby killings were often blamed on the government's one-child policy. The hugely unpopular policy demanding couples have no more than one child, despite many in China wanting to bear a son, was eased slightly in December 2013 but still exists for many. A 2001 report suggested up to a million girl foetuses were abandoned in China every year and tens of thousands of baby girls were abandoned. In 2012 the nation was horrified when a premature baby girl was found with her throat cut in Anshan, Liaoning province. The baby survived and was taken to hospital. Other incidents, however, are based on a combination of fear, naivety and mental health issues. Last April a Chinese mother threw her one-year-old girl and her six-year-old brother under a 40-tonne truck in Cixi, Zhejiang province. The baby girl was crushed to death almost instantly.","Distressing images circulated on social media of infant in pool of blood .

"They have imitated the success of their male counterparts on the field. And now Oxford University women's rugby team are copying the boys by posing for their own naked calendar. With only strategically positioned hands to maintain their modesty the players leave little to the imagination. Line out: The Oxford University Women's Rugby Football Club (OUWRFC) present their first ever naked calendar which features current members of the team on the pitch, in the gym, in the library, and around Oxford . Captain Tatiana Cutts, 25, tackling teammate Danielle Yardy, 23, by the river . The female team stripped down to just their rugby boots and socks for the black and white photographs taken around the city. Tatiana Cutts, 25, who tackles teammate Danielle Yardy, 23, by the river in the September photograph, said it was 'mostly hilarious, really very cold, and absolutely worth it for such a good cause'. The law PhD student at Keble College, who lectures undergraduates part time and is the club captain, said: 'It was a bit nerve-racking at first but after a minute it was good fun and great for team bonding. 'We were lucky it was a sunny day, but I was still absolutely freezing in the picture. We ended up in the river twice, it was utterly miserable.' Miss Cutts, who is from Tavistock, Devon, and went to Devonport High School for Girls, dismissed the idea that the calendar is distasteful. 'What we're doing is celebrating strong women,' she said. 'These girls are athletics, these are their body shapes, and they should be celebrated.' Posing up: The female team stripped down to just their rugby boots and socks for the black and white photographs taken around the city . Good sports: The girls described the day as 'mostly hilarious, really very cold, and absolutely worth it for such a good cause' The women's rugby team, who have the motto 'Back Yourself', decided to pose for their own calendar after previously helping to sell the men's calendar. Club president Elizabeth Dubois, from Dartmouth, Canada, who is studying for a PhD in Information, Communication and the Social Sciences at Balliol, said: 'We saw the success of the men's calendar last year and while were helping to sell them at matches people said ""if it was your team in the pictures, we would buy one"".

'With this calendar the club hopes to highlight the inclusiveness of women's rugby. 'When you play women's rugby people have a stereotypical image of you and we wanted to confront that. We have girls of all shapes and sizes, and studying all types of academic subject.'

"Malia Obama has been pictured wearing a hip hop group's t-shirt just days after one of its founding members was arrested for breaking a security guard's nose. The image, which was first shared to Instagram on Sunday, shows the president's 16-year-old daughter adjusting her hair while wearing a t-shirt for Pro Era, a hip hop collective based in Brooklyn, New York. After the photo emerged, Pro Era apparently saw it as a marketing opportunity and promptly shared the image to their own Instagram page with the caption: 'Malia Obama rocking that classic Pro Era tee! | Make sure you get your official Pro Era gear from theproera.com!' Mystery surrounds the photograph - a rare private image of the teenager - and questions remain over where she took the image and how it ended up on Instagram. Scroll down for video . Rap fan: An image apparently showing Malia Obama, 16, wearing a t-shirt for hip hop collective Pro Era has been shared on Instagram by the group who have used it as a marketing opportunity . A representative for Joey Bada$$, one of the founding members of the collective, told Gawker that they received the image via 'a mutual friend of Malia and the pro era member'. Pro Era, also known as Progressive Era, formed in Brooklyn in 2009. It is made up of 47 members - including rappers, producers and non-musical members, such as photographers and publicists. Joey Bada$$, who has previously released tapes to critical acclaim, releases his highly-anticipated debut album 'B4.DA.$$' on January 20. But not all his publicity recently has been quite so positive as Malia's support. On Friday night, he was arrested and charged with assault for punching a security guard in the face after the man asked to see his credentials before a show in Australia, ABC.net.au reported. Joey, who broke the man's nose in the attack at the Falls Festival near Byron Bay, was granted bail and is due back in court in March. Having fun: Malia Obama previously revealed herself as a rap fan when she attended the 2014 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, where she posed for pictures with other attendees, pictured . With dad: Malia was seen returning to the White House on Sunday following a family vacation to Hawaii . Pro Era, also known as Progressive Era, formed in Brooklyn in 2009. It is made up of 47 members - including rappers, producers and non-musical members, such as photographers and publicists. Of these, only several have signed management and recording deals. In 2014, the group sparked controversy for their use of a logo showing the number 47 that strongly resembled a swastika. The group said they had intended the sign to be a tribute to a member, Capital Steez, who killed himself, as well as symbolic of balance and peace. Bada$$, one of the founding members who has previously released tapes to critical acclaim, releases his highly-anticipated debut album 'B4.DA.$$' on January 20. The 19-year-old raps about political and racial issues, and life in Brooklyn. Joey Bada$$'s debut mixtape '1999' was nominated at the BET Hip Hop Awards in 2012, and he was nominated for 'Rookie of the Year' the following year. Joey Bada$$'s debut mixtape '1999' was nominated at the BET Hip Hop Awards in 2012, and he was nominated for 'Rookie of the Year' the following year. Some Instagram users expressed their shock at the collective's support from Malia, while others questioned whether or not the image really showed the first daughter. Malia previously revealed she is a rap fan as she attended the 2014 Lollapalooza festival, where she was seen dancing to Chance The Rapper's set. She was snapped at the event surrounded by burly Secret Service agents - but at least one teenager managed to sneak past them to pose for a photograph with the first daughter. Malia also revealed herself as a selfie fan early in 2013 when she and her sister were pictured snapping numerous photos of themselves during their father's inauguration. But the White House is famously strict about which images of the Obama girls appear in public, and the Obamas themselves said they were apprehensive about Malia having her first cell phone. Malia was allowed a cellphone when she was 12, but was initially only allowed to use it on the weekends, her parents said.

Collective: He is one of the founding members of Pro Era, pictured, who formed in Brooklyn in 2009 . During an interview on Live! with Kelly in 2012, Mrs Obama revealed that she 'scared the heck' out of Malia with 'days of lectures' on the dangers of talking to strangers before handing the device over. Even then the phone was restricted to certain numbers and every person on her contacts list had to be screened to make sure they were not a threat, she said. Malia and her younger sister Sasha are banned from using Facebook until they are 17, she added.","Brooklyn hip hop collective Pro Era posted a photograph to Instagram showing the president's 16-year-old daughter wearing a Pro Era t-shirt .

"Muslim clerics have issued fatwas banning everything from yoga to Valentines Day in Malaysia in a bid to stop the influence of Western culture. While Malaysia is a bastion of Islam, many residents see themselves as both devout to their faith and cosmopolitan in their interests. But as Malaysia becomes more modern in its thinking and culture its state-backed religious authorities are fighting to slow progress by issuing some 1,500-plus rulings. Muslim clerics have issued fatwas banning everything from yoga to Valentines Day in Malaysia in a bid to stop the influence of Western culture . Fatwas are guidelines, but police can enforce them under Malaysia's Sharia laws. To ensure Muslims can keep pace with the rules, an 'e-fatwa' site has been started the Globalpost reports. Yoga -  it's Hindu origins can 'destroy the faith of a Muslim'. Wagyu beef - the cows are occasionally fed beer which is forbidden. Botox - unless medically necessary. Black metal - is said to be powerful enough to 'force a Muslim to forsake their faith'. Valentine's Day - as it has elements of Christianity and 'its practice is mixed with immoral acts'. Halloween - it is too Christian and is also 'associated with the devil'. Coffee - if the beans are defecated by animals before being processed. The issue recently came to a head at a dog-petting festival for Muslims, with the organiser receiving threatening phone calls. Muslims are taught that canines are unclean. Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar, recently wrote that Muslims are 'sick and tired of being told, yet again, of more categories of Muslims and practices to be denounced, hated and declare deviant'. Her women's rights group, Sisters in Islam, has also been targeted. It was issued with a fatwa for pushing 'liberalism'. It had pushed for Muslim women to be able to enter beauty pageants. The group were challenging the ruling. The list of fatwas now includes, Halloween, which is said to be too Christian and black metal because it is 'powerful enough to force a Muslim to forsake his faith'. Botox is banned, but can be used if medically necessary.","Fatwas issued to stop Malaysian Muslims from adopting Western ideals .

"Fear: Clarie Jones, 39, suffers from venephobia - fear of developing varicose veins . Many women worry they will develop varicose veins as they age. Very few, however, would rather lose their legs than have to look at the veins. But that is what happened to 39-year-old Claire Jones, whose phobia was so bad that she begged doctors to amputate her healthy legs. Miss Jones pleaded with her GP to refer her for the operation because her fear of veins was triggering several panic attacks a day. She said the anxiety made life so difficult that she felt being confined to a wheelchair would be more bearable. However her GP turned down her request and she has now undergone therapy to help her manage her venephobia. Miss Jones, a bank cashier from Liverpool, said: ‘When it was refused I wished I could do it myself.’ She added: ‘It’s impossible to live hiding from your own legs and in the end I just thought I could be a better parent without them triggering anxiety all the time.’ The mother-of-three believes her phobia of veins may have been triggered by a botched attempt to remove a wobbly tooth when she was six. She recalls seeing the tooth dangle from what she thought was a vein and bursting into tears. She began panicking at the sight of veins, particularly her mother’s varicose veins. Varicose veins are swollen, dark blue veins, which are often lumpy and raised above the skin. They affect three in ten adults and women are more likely to develop them than men, especially if they are overweight or pregnant. Miss Jones said: ‘I would freeze and cry at the sight of them so my mother always knew to wear trousers so I didn’t get upset.’ But as she grew older Miss Jones’s phobia became worse. She began crossing the street to avoid older women in dresses that might reveal veins and avoided strenuous activities likely to make her own veins bulge. Miss Jones said: ‘Drawing or swimming with my daughter was impossible because I would start to get anxious seeing the veins in my hands bulge. ‘At work I had to hold them up for the blood to drain down.’ But her phobia got more severe when she developed varicose veins in her own legs three years ago. She said: ‘I had always struggled looking at them but it got one thousand times worse over night. My biggest fear had come true. ‘Catching sight of them would trigger major anxiety and end up with a full-blown panic attack. Scroll down for video . Solution: Miss Jones pleaded with her GP to help her get an amputation as her daily anxiety and panic attacks made life so difficult that she felt being confined to a wheelchair would be more bearable . Fear: Miss Jones, pictured after giving birth to baby Bella, says she developed varicose veins herself three years ago, which made her childhood phobia even worse . Stricken: Miss Jones would cross the street to avoid older women in dresses that might reveal veins and avoided strenuous activities likely to make her own veins bulge . Helped: Miss Jones, with daughters Bella, left, and Brooklyn, right, is now undergoing therapy . ‘Imagine trying to shower, dress and walk to work without seeing your legs. 'I was struggling to cope and got to the point where I thought life would be easier if I wasn’t trying to avoid my legs all the time.’ She saw her GP who refused the amputation but instead agreed to refer her for surgery to remove the varicose veins. However, in the past two years she has had two more children and more varicose veins appeared. She added: ‘Had I known I was going to extend the family I would have waited to have the vein operation as unfortunately they have come back as happens with pregnancy. ‘I just hope this helps people understand because one of the hardest thing about living with a phobia can be being laughed at and judged. ‘Women tell me they would love legs like mine but I just cannot see them that way. To me they are just terrifying.’","Claire Jones suffers from venephobia - fear of developing varicose veins .

"A Labrador retriever missing after surviving a car wreck that killed his owner New Year's Day has been found unharmed. Alone and scared, Wall-E, a five-year-old yellow lab, took off that Jan. 1 night after his owner, 49-year-old Anthony Besch, of Illinois, was killed in a car wreck. Besch fell asleep at the wheel causing his vehicle to go off the road and slam into a guardrail on an  interstate near Alabama, according to FOX 5. Besch, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene. The five-year-old pooch was nowhere to be found when authorities responded to the wreck. Wall-E: Wall-E(photographed), a five-year-old Labrador retriever was found safe after fleeing the scene of the New Year's Day wreck that killed his owner . Wreck: Anthony Besch, 49, (photographed) fell asleep at the wheel causing his vehicle to go off the road and slam into a guardrail, ejecting Besch from the vehicle . One day after the incident, Besch's family received news of the wreck and his mother began making phone calls to find the missing pooch, AL reports. 'I've already lost my son; I have to find his dog,' Besch's mother told the owner of an animal rescue group in Tanner. Moved by Besch's mother's phone call, Cathy Oakley, the owner of Bark Avenue, a kennel in Tanner, and organizer of Peace, Love, and Animals animal rescue, put out alerts and, within hours, hundreds of people were on watch for the dog, according to AL. Animal rescue volunteer Jackie Metcalf was one of several Limestone County residents who tried to help find the missing dog. Metcalf located Wall-E Friday afternoon, less than one day after he went missing, according to WHNT. 'Princess Perfect:' Here, is a funny photo of Wall-E that Besch posted on his Google+ profile, Wall-E sports an phony mustache . She spotted him in a neighbor's yard. The neighbors said they found Wall-E wandering the interstate Thursday night and took him in out of the cold and rain, according to the New York Daily News. 'The people that had him had taken care of him,' Metcalf told WHNT, 'and made him feel at home, so they really did a really good job of taking care of him.' The neighbors said they called the phone numbers on Wall-E's collar but all were for Anthony Besch, whose phone was destroyed in the wreck. Metcalf took Wall-E, named after the 2008 Pixar movie, to Bark Avenue, which is described on its Facebook page as a 'pet resort,' and the dog was checked for injuries, AL reports. 'Pet Resort:' Wall-E remained in the Bark Avenue kennel, which is described on its Facebook page as a 'pet resort,' until Debbie, Besch's ex-wife (left), and his daughter Arianna (right) picked the dog up after the man's funeral . Wall-E was uninjured. The dog stayed in the kennel until Besch's family members picked him up after his funeral Saturday. Debbie Besch, Anthony's ex-wife, made arrangements for the dog to live with her and her nine-year-old daughter, Arianna, who is Anthony's daughter, according to AL. Debbie and Anthony divorced in 2013, according to AL, but the two kept in close contact in order to raise Arianna. 'I just appreciate everybody's effort in finding [Wall-E],' Debbie said. 'They made Arianna so happy, and she needed that.'","A yellow Labrador retriever was found unharmed Friday after a car wreck killed his owner New Year's Day .

"It looks like a glittering golden palace fit for a Russian tsar, and its appearance on the Moscow property market is perhaps a sign of the crisis facing the super-rich amid the rouble's collapse. With nine sumptuous bedrooms, Baroque-style living areas and two swimming pools - as well as being decorated with gold throughout - this home looks almost too lavish for royalty. Chandeliers hang from the ceilings and every room is fitted with exclusive custom-made ornate furniture, with the mansion sitting amid towering pine trees in its own 97 acres. Scroll down for video . Fit for an oligarch: This sumptuous palace is for sale in Moscow's most elite suburb - and is only the third most expensive on the market . Luxury: The £70million estate has 97 acres of pine forest and custom-made furniture, with copious amounts of decorative gold throughout . Excess: The luxury of the mansion, including its snooker room, is a testament to the eye-watering wealth of some in post-Soviet Russia . But all this luxury comes at a price, with only billionaire oligarchs - many of whom have suffered mega losses due to the rouble fall - likely to be able to afford the hefty $109 million (£70 million) price tag. Located in Russia's 'Beverly Hills', it is described by estate agents as being 'in the style of the country estates of the European aristocracy'. The identity of the seller is not disclosed. In its sales material Sotheby's International Realty states: 'The interiors are reminiscent of Baroque palaces. 'The rooms have a lot of gold, natural stone and precious wood. In some rooms the floors are made of natural marble and the billiard room and library are solid oak and mahogany.' The 'golden palace' is located in the prestigious Rublyovka suburb in Moscow, where A-listers reside and property prices are some of the highest in the world. Snug: One of the house's nine bedrooms is themed entirely in red, black and gold, even down to the colours of the wooden floor . Luxury: The walk-in shower, set on a central marble plinth, is big enough for an oligarch and a few mistresses for good measure . Tub: Even the bathrooms do not escape the marble, chandeliers and gold. The collapse of the rouble raises doubts over the home's future . Panelling: The study has hints of James Bond. The suburb of Rublyovka, where the mansion is, became a Beverly Hills in the 1990s . Entertaining: Should you buy the palace, there is ample enough room to invite round all your oligarch friends for caviar and fizz . The three-storey main residence, which has similarities to a modern French chateau, has 2,300 square metres of living space. Inside, the bedrooms are particularly notable, with each one dripping in gold and decorated in a different style. Some feature four-poster beds, while others boast expensive works of art on the walls, but all resemble presidential suites in luxury hotels.

Swimmers taking advantage of the larger indoor swimming pool will notice the Sistine Chapel-esque painting on the ceiling. The mansion comes completely fully-furnished, with some of the pieces made by European cabinet makers. Rublyovka, in pleasant woodland on one side of the Moscow River, became a Russian equivalent of Beverly Hills in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The western suburb quickly became home to billionaire oligarchs, showbusiness stars, government officials and industry tycoons.

As well as expensive properties, the area also boasts exclusive boutique shops and sports clubs frequented by the rich and famous. As an indication of the exclusivity of the neighbourhood, the golden palace is not even the most expensive on the market, with others commanding higher prices. Ilya Menzhutov, director of the elite real estate company Metrium Grupp, said: 'It is by far not the most expensive house in Rublyovka. 'As of today, there is at least two houses that outrun the mansion in price. One of them is $130million (£85million) and the other is $150 million (£98million). 'Moreover, the most expensive estate is not in the famous Rublyovka but off the Skolkovskoye highway, where the buyer will have to pay $200 million (£130million).'

Estate agents in Moscow are divided on how well such homes will sell at the moment, particularly amid the rouble crisis and Russia's slide towards recession. In its November review on the premium market, before the latest slump, IntermarkSavills suggested that the fall of the currency was becoming critically important. After its collapse, the official rate is around 60 roubles to the dollar. Many estate agents are now advertising their prices in dollars - or setting a fixed rate of 37 to 45 roubles to the dollar, said Nina Reznichenko, the head of suburban real estate department at IntermarkSavills. 'Clients have also reacted to such dramatic changes almost immediately: negotiations are getting longer, and the majority of purchases are made in below $2million segment.'. Tweed estate agents say the buyers of the most expensive properties have been put off by the currency problems. Just a few miles away in Moscow's supermarkets, the nation's economic woes take a very different form - with shelves stripped bare thanks to economic sanctions.

"Hundreds of letters between a couple who were struggling through a long-distance romance in the 1950s are being brought back to life by a university student for her final-year dissertation. Sophie Abbott, 21, from Cullingworth, West Yorkshire, is using the ups and downs of the British couple's relationship for her final-year photography exhibition and dissertation. The romantic box of letters tells the love story of long-distance couple - April and RAF member Ron, between 1952 and 1955. Sophie Abbott, 21, from Yorkshire is sorting 300 long distance letters between 'Ron and April' for her university dissertation. The couple corresponded between West Germany and London in the 1950s . The letters, which start in 1952, highlight the couple's desire to keep their relationship alive, despite living over 400 miles apart. At the time, Ron was fighting for NATO within the British Army of the Rhine in Oldenberg, Germany, while April was living in Edmonton, London. The letters, which stop suddenly in 1955, were found by a friend of Sophie's at a car boot sale years ago. Sophie, who studies photography at the University of Huddersfield, said: 'I remember him bringing them into school one day. 'Recently, I was contemplating over an idea for my final project and I remembered about these love letters. 'I asked my friend if I could borrow them and luckily he was happy for me to borrow them.' The letters, which start in 1952, highlight the couple's desire to keep their relationship alive, despite living over 400 miles apart . At the time, Ron was fighting for NATO within the British Army of the Rhine in Oldenberg, Germany, while April was living in Edmonton, London . She continued: 'Now my everyday life is focused on going through these 300-400 letters. 'It is pretty much a constant chore of delving further into Ron and April's story.' As well as letters, the box of correspondence also holds Valentine's Day cards and comic strips that the couple exchanged. One typical note shows Ron 'very excited' after his girlfriend suggested the idea of moving into a houseboat on the Thames. He often expresses his affection for April by writing 'I love you' several times on the same page. Miss Abbott said: 'I want this project to be a realistic insight into a turbulent relationship. 'Like any normal couple, the letters highlight their highs and lows while they were forced to spend time apart. 'As the letters are all dated, you can see some were actually sent quite close together. 'Because of this, they were often struggling to think of what to write to each other but they still persisted in keeping up regular contact.' As well as letters, the box of correspondence also holds Valentine's Day cards and comic strips that the couple exchanged. In one letter, April draws a map of the area near her  new home . Sophie is planning on revealing more information about the couple in an exhibition for her university course . Through her research, Miss Abbott managed to find out what happened to Ron and April after the letters stopped. She added: 'Throughout the letters, the topic of marriage came up regularly. 'They often talked about getting married in April 1955 and settling down together. 'I have now found out they did get married as planned in the letters and eventually had three children.' Although Sophie has discovered that April has since died, she has so far failed to find any information on what happened to Ron. She is planning on revealing more information about the couple in an exhibition for her university course. She is also hoping to write a book about the letters. Ron often expresses his affection for April by writing 'I love you' several times on the same page . The letters, which stop suddenly in 1955, were found by a friend of Sophie's at a car boot sale years ago . At the moment, Ron and April's full identity is being withheld from the public, as Sophie wants to behave in a sensitive manner towards any remaining members of their family. However, she is currently looking to get in touch with April and Ron's children, who she believes are called Nicholas, Steven and Kay in order to find out more. Once the letters have been successfully scanned, which is expected to take weeks, Sophie will visit all of the places the couple discussed during their correspondence and will photograph them in their current state. Sophie has already visited April's London Home in Edmonton, but she is also planning a trip to Germany, where Ron was stationed, and France, where April  lived later in the correspondence. She raised the funds for her trip through a 'Kickstarter' campaign, called 'Do You Still Love Me Darling?'","Sophie Abbott from Yorkshire is sorting 300 letters between 'Ron and April'

"Sony has brought back its iconic Walkman as a high-definition audio player in a bid to win back users who listen to music on their smartphone. The firm hopes its high resolution audio device will convince listeners to switch back to a dedicated music player, but it is predicted to cost £950 ($1,443). The NW-ZX2 resurrects the iconic brand, first introduced in July 1979, with a 128GB capacity and 60-hour battery life. The NW-ZX2 Walkman resurrects the iconic brand, with a 128gb capacity and 60 hour battery life. 'For a while there was a novelty in carrying 10,000 songs in your pocket,' said Sony's Mike Fasulo at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 'Now, people are seeking a higher quality experience.' Sony also revealed a huge number of other high resolution audio hi-fi, speaker and headphones at the show. Other manufacturers are also beginning to focus more on high quality music files. 'The new Walkman is a great example of the quality of hi-res audio, it is tailored for outstanding sound,' said Mr Fasulo. 'I'm sure everyone here is not ready to delete their MP3 library - and we've got you covered. 'You'll be able to elevate the audio quality of your existing library. The old and the new: Sony's new . 'We can add quality, depth and more emotions to the cherished tunes in your collection.' However, experts say Sony has a tough fight on its hands, . 'There is clearly a resurgence it getting back to music in the purest way,' said Stuart Miles of Pocket Lint. 'If there is one brand that can associate with that it is the Walkman. 'However the question is whether there is enough of an appetite for enough people to justify bringing it back.' The original 'Walkman', model TCS 300, made by Sony . Sony has sold 220 million cassette Walkman players globally since the product's July 1979 debut that changed lifestyles by popularising music on the go. Legend has it that the device was first built in 1978 by Sony engineer Nobutoshi Kihara for Sony co-chairman Akio Morita, who wanted to be able to listen to operas during his frequent trans-Pacific plane trips. A massive hit for the entire 1980s and early 1990s the Walkman was eventually superseded by the emerging digital technologies of CD, DAT and Sony’s own MiniDisc. More than 30 years later, the cassette Walkman has been rendered an anachronism by MP3 players and iPods. Demand for cassette players in Japan is now largely limited to elderly users. Sony will continue production of the cassette Walkman in China to accommodate users abroad, including in the U.S., Europe and some Asian countries. The Walkman brand has continued in name only as part of the firm's mobile phone range. Google also joined the hi-fi battle. The search giant is set to bring its $35 Chromecast dongle to hifi systems. The firm today revealed a major new push into audio designed to take on Apple TV. It plans to partner with hi-fi firms to create speakers for the service, and today revealed it will already work with speakers connected to a TV. Currently the system allows people to play back video from sites such as Netflix. However, Google is now bringing the same technology behind its popular $35 Chromecast dongle into speakers, soundbars and A/V receivers. It says users will be able to 'cast' audio wirelessly from a variety of apps on your Android or iOS smartphone, or the Web, in a similar fashion to the way people with a Chromecast stream video. 'Just like Chromecast, simply tap the cast button in your favorite music or radio app on Android, iOS, or the web, and select a Google Cast Ready speaker to get the party started.' Similar to the video service, users can use their phone to control the music, which is then played directly through the speaker from cloud services, meaning they can use their phone for other things. Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, told MailOnline: 'Retro gadgets do seem to be making a comeback of late, but this is not the original Sony Walkman, or, indeed, anything like it. 'The original Walkman was innovative for its time, while this music player comes post iPod. 'Convincing people to carry one of these and a smartphone, even with the lure of top quality audio and a 60-hour battery life, may be a struggle.'","Sony says high resolution audio will be far better than smartphone sound .

"Seven people, including two children, needed hospital treatment after a coach carrying 34 British holidaymakers crashed in the French Alps. The coach was taking the party from the Alpine ski resort of La Rosière to Chambéry airport when it skidded off the motorway and flipped on to its side. Witnesses described the vehicle swerving out control, leaving the road, and then coming to rest by guard rails at the edge of a ravine. Lucky escape: Seven people were hurt, none seriously, when this coach carrying 34 British tourists crashed on its way from an Alpine ski resort to a nearby airport where it was due to meet a plane back to the UK . Dramatic pictures showed the coach lying on its side, with windows smashed. No other vehicles were involved. Around 50 firefighters were scrambled to the rescue, but those hurt suffered only minor injuries most passengers escaped unhurt. Today members of ‘two British families’ remained in Chambéry, where a victim suffering from a broken wrist was still being treated, said a spokesman for the Savoie prefecture. He added: ‘Around fifteen people underwent examinations and treatment following the accident, with seven taken to hospital in Chambéry.’ The spokesman said the bus driver was ‘slightly wounded’ in the hand, and was being interviewed about the possible cause of the accident. It is thought he might have suffered a sudden bout of illness before losing control of the vehicle. There is no indication that the driver, an ex-Navy serviceman with 20 years of experience in transport, had been drinking. His coach, registered in the nearby resort of Megeve, was equipped with an ‘anti-sleep system’. Tailbacks: The crash and ensuing rescue operation led to 10-mile traffic jams on the A43 motorway . Everybody on board was wearing a seat belt – a fact which is likely to have cut down the number of injuries significantly. The coach skidded off the A43 motorway and overturned near the village of Sainte-Hélène-du-Lac at around 8.45am on Sunday morning, The Guardian reported. Seven people sustained injuries to their wrists or arms and were taken to a nearby hospital while six others were treated for shock. The rescue operation caused 10 miles of tailbacks, AFP reported. The A43 links La Rosière with Lyon or joins the road to Grenoble. Picturesque: The holidaymakers had spent a week at La Rosière ski resort in the French Alps . La Rosière is a relatively small, family-focused ski resort near the Italian border. It was developed in the early 1950s on the site of an old hamlet. The coach party was on its way to catch charter flights to Southampton and Manchester. All of those involved has spent a week in France, arriving last Sunday week. Alpine roads in eastern France are packed with people heading to and from ski holidays at this time of year. Snow, ice and poor visibility often makes journeys particularly treacherous. The cause of the crash was unknown but authorities said that an investigation was underway.","Around 50 firefighters were involved in the rescue operation after the crash .

Lean diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans, from supermodels Elle Macpherson and . David Gandy, to actor Hugh Grant and Victoria's Secret models. FEMAIL caught up with the training guru to get his top tips for emulating his clients' lifestyles - and bodies - in 2015. His top tip? 'Stress less,' he says. 'Try to make some time for yourself. Book in for a massage or go to a yoga class to lower your cortisol levels and make you happier and leaner.' James also swears by the power of coconut and thinks we should all be eating more. He explains: 'Coconut fat is good for you in so many ways. For example it helps with your digestion and boosts your immune system. 'It can also help you to lose fat if eaten in moderation, since it boosts your metabolism.' Rosie's trainer, James Duigan, shares his most essential wellbeing tip as 'stress less'. He explains: 'Try to make some time for yourself to lower your cortisol levels and make you happier and leaner' James recommends eating coconut yoghurt CO YO as an 'easy and delicious way to get your daily coconut intake'. He also advises his clients to add a teaspoon of coconut oil to their coffee instead of low fat milk - as long as it's organic. We've all heard about the power of kale and James says the nutritional powerhouse is going nowhere in 2015. 'Eat a handful of kale and spinach (at least) every day,' he advises. 'Blend it, steam it, have it raw - there are no excuses not to have these amazing foods in your life daily. Trust me, you'll notice the difference.' His final two tips for living like Rosie are simple and won't cost a penny. James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up . 'Breathe.

Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism and were recently voted as best in the business by Tatler - become enthusiastic to the point of . fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular through word of . mouth alone. It recommends fresh food, as close to . its natural state as possible. No refined sugar, which Duigan describes as like a 'toxic fat . bomb' for your waistline. Cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the . morning. Rely on . natural, nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster . of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end . in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether . that be coffee, carbs, sweets or wine.

In . his book, Duigan explains that he came up with the term 'clean and . lean' to describe the 'ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body. 'The word ""clean"" here means a body that can deal effectively with . toxins - one that can deal with a few that sneak in (via a glass of wine . or a chocolate bar) and flush them out successfully,' he says. In . his years of studying nutrition, says Duigan, he has discovered that . while you can live off processed low-fat food and diet colas for a while . your body will be so toxic that you'll find it hard to keep the weight . off. 'People come to me . who have tried every single diet out there, yet they can't stay slim . for long. 'They cut carbs, they count calories, they ban whole food . groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food,' he . says.

Duigan says we should enjoy our food but make sure that rather than . processed foods, we eat healthy, natural food and avoid ones laden with . sugar. Clean foods are those that: . It's not just the wrong type of food that piles on the pounds. The relentless, low-level stress of everyday life can also add inches to your waist. When we're frightened, angry, tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol. The adrenalin keeps us alert and focused, while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a 'fight-or-flight' response. James Duigan says stress can lead to tummy fat . It also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy. It's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger. While this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen, modern-day stress, caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle, is really bad for you. It makes you fat, it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of serious illness. This is because many of the situations that cause stress nowadays don't present the sort of physical danger that you need to run away from. The result is that fat-storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release into the bloodstream - float around your system, eventually ending up as fat on your tummy and around your waist. They also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going. As stress levels subside, your adrenalin levels fall, but cortisol (and the resulting blood sugar) stays in the system much longer. Research shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol, giving you a layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that's really hard to shift, so doing regular sit-ups is pointless if you always feel stressed. And stomach fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain cancers. Constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles. So stress can leave you constipated, bloated and toxic.

"A U.S. brewery has been forced to apologize for naming an ale after the teetotal Indian leader, Mohandas Gandhi. The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed  for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India. What particularly caused upset was the can artwork, which reimagines Gandhi as a robot with one hand raised in blessing. Underfire: The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India . Following a legal complaint about the beer in Hyderabad, India, the New England Brewing Co issued an apology to Facebook. It said in a statement that its intent wasn't to 'offend anyone but rather pay homage and celebrate a man who we respect greatly.' Despite the backlash, the company says it has no plans to withdraw the beer, which is not sold internationally. It claims that Gandhi's granddaughter and grandson have seen the label and have 'expressed their admiration' for it. However, the company's stance could change when the case hits the courts Monday. A petitioner in India contends that Gandhi’s image on the alcohol cans and description of the father of the nation by the brewery is highly condemnable and punishable under Indian laws. Icon: What particularly caused upset was the can artwork, which reimagines Gandhi (seen here in 1948) as a robot with one hand raised in blessing . However, there are also those who fully-support the drink. One fan wrote on Facebook: 'Gandhi-Bot is best. Keep the craft up. 'I'm an Indian and proud to drive five hours often to [the The New England Brewing Co] just for Bot.' Another added: 'My only problem with your beer is that it is always sold out. Keep up the great work.' On the website Gandhi-Bot is pegged as an intensely hopped double India pale ale with a blend of three varieties of American Hops. It is also described as 'fully vegetarian' and an 'ideal aid . . . for the seeking of truth and love.'","The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut has been slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale .

"Nasa is set to launch a new satellite that will act like a 'lasso' to measure the moisture in Earth's soils with unprecedented accuracy later this month. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) instrument on board the Soil Moisture Mapping satellite will spin around 14 times per minute as it orbits Earth. The goal is to come up with a global map of Earth's soil moisture to help cope with drought and flood monitoring. Scroll down for video . A new Nasa Earth satellite will launch from California on 29 January. Called the Soil Moisture Mapping satellite (illustrated) it will map global soil moisture. The satellite largest rotating mesh antenna ever used in space. It will be used to map wide areas and cover entire Earth every three days . The SMAP satellite is set to launch at 9.20am EST (2.20pm GMT) on 29 January from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The instrument's three main parts are a radar, a radiometer and the largest rotating mesh antenna ever deployed in space. Remote sensing instruments are called 'active' when they emit their own signals and 'passive' when they record signals that already exist. Although the antenna must fit during launch into a space not much bigger than a tall kitchen trash can, it must unfold so precisely that the surface shape of the mesh is accurate within about an eighth of an inch (a few millimeters). The mesh dish is edged with a ring of lightweight graphite supports that stretch apart like a baby gate when a single cable is pulled, drawing the mesh outward. 'Making sure we don't have snags, that the mesh doesn't hang up on the supports and tear when it's deploying - all of that requires very careful engineering,' Dr Edelstein said. The mission's science instrument will use a sensor of each type to create the highest-resolution, most accurate measurements ever made of soil moisture. Soil moisture is a tiny fraction of Earth's water that has a disproportionately large effect on weather and agriculture. The ambitious mission is designed not only to be accurate, though, but also to cover the entire globe every three days or less. Engineers at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, designed and built the largest rotating antenna that could be stowed into a space of only one by four feet (30 by 120 cm) for launch. When unfolded the dish measures a huge 19.7 feet (six meters) in diameter. 'We call it the spinning lasso,' said Nasa's Dr Wendy Edelstein, the SMAP instrument manager. Like the cowboy's rope, the antenna is attached on one side to an arm with a crook in its elbow. It spins around the arm at about 14 revolutions per minute (one complete rotation every four seconds). 'The antenna caused us a lot of angst, no doubt about it,' Dr Edelstein noted. 'We test, and we test, and we test some more. We have a very stable and robust system now.' Pictured is the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) instrument as the protective covering is removed in the Astrotech payload processing facility on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California during a post-shipment inspection. The launch of SMAP is targeted for 29 January 2015 . SMAP's radar, developed and built at JPL, uses the antenna to transmit microwaves toward Earth and receive the signals that bounce back, called backscatter. The microwaves penetrate a few inches or more into the soil before they rebound. Changes in the electrical properties of the returning microwaves indicate changes in soil moisture, and also tell whether or not the soil is frozen. Pictured is the first stage of the Delta II rocket that will take SMAP into orbit at  Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . Using a complex technique called synthetic aperture radar processing, the radar can produce ultra-sharp images with a resolution of about half a mile to a mile and a half (one to three kilometers). SMAP's radiometer detects differences in Earth's natural emissions of microwaves that are caused by water in soil. To address a problem that has seriously hampered earlier missions using this kind of instrument to study soil moisture, the radiometer designers developed and built one of the most sophisticated signal-processing systems ever created for such a scientific instrument. The problem is radio frequency interference. The microwave wavelengths that SMAP uses are officially reserved for scientific use, but signals at nearby wavelengths that are used for air traffic control, cell phones and other purposes spill over into SMAP's wavelengths unpredictably. Conventional signal processing averages data over a long time period, which means that even a short burst of interference skews the record for that whole period. The engineers devised a new way to delete only the small segments of actual interference, leaving much more of the observations untouched. Combining the radar and radiometer signals allows scientists to take advantage of the strengths of both technologies while working around their weaknesses. 'The radiometer provides more accurate soil moisture but a coarse resolution of about 40 kilometers [25 miles] across,' said JPL's Eni Njoku, a research scientist with SMAP. 'With the radar, you can create very high resolution, but it's less accurate. To get both an accurate and a high-resolution measurement, we process the two signals together.' SMAP will be the fifth Nasa Earth science mission launched within the last 12 months.","A new Nasa Earth satellite will launch from California on 29 January .

"Hundreds of mourners waited outside a funeral home Monday in a line that stretched more than a block to pay their respects to former three-term Gov. Mario Cuomo, who died just hours after his son was sworn in for his second term. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, actor Alan Alda and former state Comptroller Carl McCall were among the prominent arrivals at Cuomo's wake on Madison Avenue. Vice President Joe Biden also made an appearance. Cuomo, 82, died in his Manhattan home on Thursday evening, hours after his son, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was inaugurated for a second term. Son: Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is now Governor like his father before him, arrives at the wake with his girlfriend, Sandra Lee, right, and one of his daughters . Vice President: Joe Biden was in New York City today for the wake in Manhattan . Somber: Biden was among a number of prominent Democrats who attended the event ahead of his funeral on Tuesday . Attendees: Matila Cuomo, Mario's wife, is seen outside the wake on the left, while right is former New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato . Throngs: Hundreds were seen waiting outside the wake, which some said would be unusual for most politicians . The governor spoke for the first time about his father's death publicly Saturday, saying, 'There is a hole in my heart that I fear is going to be there forever.' Lynda Rufo, a banker standing in line outside the funeral home, said her daughter was finishing law school because of Cuomo's encouragement. 'He was a part of New York,' Rufo said. 'He always took the time to be there for everyone, no matter who you were or where you came from. He loved people.' Paul Amelio, a friend of the family, said, 'The length of this line is surprising - but not for Mario. Long tenure: Cuomo, pictured right in 1997 towards the start of his political career, and left in 2008, was elected state governor three times . Friends in high places: Cuomo is pictured with then-President Bill Clinton in October 1994. He is expected at the funeral tomorrow . Famous faces: Kerredy Kennedy, center, approaches the event, with one of Andrew Cuomo's daughters in the background . Political heft: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi greets U.S Rep. Steven Israel (D-NY) outside the event . 'How many politicians can you say so many great things about? He did so much for the capital of the world, New York.' Cuomo's funeral was scheduled for 11am Tuesday at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Park Avenue. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton were expected to be among the mourners. Andrew Cuomo postponed his State of the State address, scheduled for Wednesday, until Jan. 21. Exuberant and eloquent, Mario Cuomo's most memorable national moment came at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Cuomo challenged Ronald Reagan's description of America as 'a shining city on a hill' by delivering a keynote address titled 'A Tale of Two Cities' — about a country split between haves and have-nots. Bill de Blasio used the same words when campaigning and winning New York City's mayoral race last year. The mayor said all flags in the city would be at half-staff in Cuomo's honor for 30 days. Mario Cuomo's 'A Tale of Two Cities' came from personal experience. He was the son of an Italian immigrant father who struggled to make ends meet. Cuomo, whom some called a Roman Catholic kid from Queens, never forgot his background. He once called politics 'an ugly business' and never ran for president, as some Democratic leaders pushed him to do in 1988 and 1992.

"The case against a 10-year-old Pennsylvania boy accused of fatally beating a 90-year-old woman has been moved to juvenile court. The Times-Tribune reports that Monday's ruling came after a prosecution psychiatrist testified the boy would benefit most from treatment in the juvenile system. Facing an adult charge, the ten-year-old was housed in an adult jail in the months following the Oct. 11 beating and killing of 90-year-old Helen Novak at the home of the boy's grandfather, Novak's caretaker. Juvenile Court: The case against a 10-year-old Pennsylvania boy accused of fatally beating a 90-year-old woman has been moved to juvenile court (photographed is the boy and his mother, Martha Virbitsky, left, and the boy posing, right) Helen: The boy is accused of beating and killing 90-year-old Helen Novak (photographed) Wayne County chief public defender Scott Bennett has said there's 'no real question' the boy beat Novak. The boy reportedly lost his temper after the woman yelled at him. Martha Virbitsky, the boy's mother, who took him to police barracks later that day, said the boy told her 'he got mad, lost his temper and grabbed a cane and put it around Novak's throat,' police said. Authorities said the boy told police that he held Novak down on the bed and punched her several times in the stomach and throat. He was charged as an adult with criminal homicide and held away from the general population at Wayne County's adult jail. The attorney who initially represented the fifth grader asked to have the boy released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility. However, the New York Daily News reports that the boy's family did not want him home. The attorney said the boy's parents were 'an emotional wreck' and did not feel comfortable with having the boy in their custody. Custody: An attorney petitioned a request to have the boy sent home, but his family was not comfortable with having the boy in their custody (photographed is the boy's mother) The other option, moving the boy to a juvenile detention facility, would make it more difficult for the boy's parents to visit him -- the closest facility is more than 70 miles away. The Daily News reports that the family believes the boy was being treated well in the county prison, however, detectives say they found a note in the boy's cell with 'How to Escape' written on it. The judge who decided to move the boy was also faced with the decision of whether or not to move the boy to a mental health facility, WNEP reports. Bennett says the boy needs mental health help. It wasn't immediately clear where he'll be housed next.","The case against the 10-year-old Pennsylvania boy accused of fatally beating a 90-year-old woman has been moved to juvenile court .

"Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse', has been seen in public for the first time since the 'sex slave' scandal broke. Dressed in a long grey coat and sunglasses, the 53-year-old looked sombre as she left her home in New York City and made her way to a nearby office building. She stands accused of procuring young girls for the sexual gratification of billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his ‘friends’. Scroll down for video . Sombre: Ms Maxwell, pictured today, was seen in public for the first time since the 'sex slave' scandal broke . Allegations: She is accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein'. Above, Ms Maxwell looks on as Prince Andrew smiles with Virginia Roberts in 2001 . Claims: Ms Maxwell, pictured left today and right in June 2014, was described in the court papers, filed in a Florida court last week, as a ‘primary co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’ Court documents filed by Jane Doe 3 - now known to be Virginia Roberts - say that Ms Maxwell ‘facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein’. Ms Maxwell was described in the court papers, filed in a Florida court last week, as a ‘primary co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. A spokesperson for Ms Maxwell has reportedly strongly denied the allegations, and she has previously made clear that Epstein's crimes were committed long before she had dealings with him. The Duke was meanwhile holed up at his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor today from where he is believed to have spoken to the Queen by phone to tell her he is innocent of claims levelled against him in a US court. The extraordinary allegation made by Miss Roberts is part of a US civil case against Epstein. She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 – a minor under US law – and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. The fifth in line to the throne slept with Miss Roberts at an orgy with other under-age girls on Epstein's private Caribbean island, as well as in a private house in London and in Epstein's New York mansion, according to the court papers. Denial: A spokesperson for Ms Maxwell, pictured today, has reportedly strongly denied the allegations . Accusation: Ms Maxwell, pictured, allegedly invited Virginia Roberts to Epstein's mansion to be a masseuse . In a strongly-worded statement, a Buckingham Palace spokesman has said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' Miss Roberts claims she was 15 when she met Ms Maxwell at a Florida spa in 1998. Ms Maxwell allegedly invited her to Epstein's mansion to be a masseuse. Miss Roberts claims she was made to perform sex acts on Epstein. She also claimed that the first time she met Prince Andrew was at Ms Maxwell's home in London, where she was flown at the request of Epstein. Close: Ghislaine Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein (left) at Sandringham in 2000 . One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Ms Maxwell looks on. Describing what happened, Miss Roberts said Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001. They flew to Paris, then Spain, then Tangier and finally, they went to London. 'After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's Maxwell's house' and 'was given a small upstairs bedroom,' Virginia said. She said: 'The following morning, Ghislaine came in. She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, 'Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight.' 'She said I needed to be 'smiley' and bubbly because he was the Queen's son. 'Ghislaine and I went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-up,' she said. 'We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress. 'When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. 'Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's daughters. 'Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17'. The four of them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her. 'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's. All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left'. Ms Maxwell, the cherished daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell, is no stranger to scandal. Her world came crashing down in 1991 when her father plunged to his death from the deck of his £15million yacht, named Lady Ghislaine in her honour. Shortly afterwards it was revealed that the notorious newspaper tycoon had stolen £440million from the Mirror Group’s pension fund. Ms Maxwell and her family were disgraced, and she fled to New York to escape the furore in Britain. Scandal: Ghislaine Maxwell with her parents, Robert and Elizabeth, in 1987 - four years before Robert's death . It was in America that she met Epstein, becoming his girlfriend for a time and attending celebrity events with him. He provided her with a champagne lifestyle of luxurious holidays and palatial apartments that she could never have afforded on the £80,000-a-year her father left her. In return, she used her contacts to introduce Epstein to leading lights of the world of showbusiness, politics and royalty, including Prince Andrew. But in recent years she has also faced accusations that she procured girls for Epstein – claims she has always denied. Ms Maxwell, now 53, was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University. In 2000 she and Epstein were seen on holiday with Prince Andrew at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. That same year, she took the prince to a ‘hookers and pimps’ themed party in New York, which was hosted by the former lingerie model Heidi Klum. There were once rumours that Ms Maxwell would marry Epstein, but their relationship reportedly ended because he wanted to see other women. However, it is alleged that the services provided by Ms Maxwell to the wealthy financier extended to finding attractive girls for him and his friends.

"The hunt to find the exact location of the lost Philae lander on comet 67P has so far struggled to locate the fridge-sized probe. Images sent back by the Rosetta spacecraft orbiting the comet have not yet revealed any clues as to where Philae may have fallen - and now experts believe the lander may be shrouded in dust. It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site. Scroll down for video . The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced, with its final suspected resting place in the top right. However, further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . Without sufficient sunlight on its solar panels, the probe's batteries went flat after just 60 hours and scientists lost contact with it. While also gathering data for other parts of the mission, the mothership Rosetta has also been taking photographs of the approximate landing site. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. Scientists have been poring over each image in the hope of detecting any bright spots that might be sunlight catching Philae's reflective surface. However, it is feared that the probe is entirely obscured by the overhanging cliff face it managed to photograph before running out of power. Dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could also have compounded the problem by falling back to the surface and shrouding the lander. Early results have shown that the icy surface of the comet is covered in a layer of dust around 3.9-inches to 7.8-inches (10 to 20cm) thick. Indeed, research teams behind the Rosetta mission are preparing to publish a scientific paper on the dust later this month. It is expected to provide new information on the way dust billows off the surface of the comet. Rather than streaming off the comet into space in a uniform way, it instead comes from a few hotspots that act like dust geysers. While some of this dust is scraped away to form the comet's tail, some also is pulled back to the comet's surface by gravity. Despite this, researchers at the European Space Agency hope that Philae will come back to life and reveal its location as the comet moves closer to the sun. The comet is currently 244 million miles (392 million km) from the sun and is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year. By then, there might be enough sunlight hitting Philae's solar panels to spark it back into life. Before its batteries ran out, Philae managed to send back this image of a cliff face that is shading the lander . The Rosetta spacecraft is now orbiting  comet 67P (left) at an altitude of 30km and has sent back a range of images revealed the landscape allowing scientists to recreate what it would look like to the human eye (right) Professor John Zarnecki, a planetary scientist at Open University who is the chair of the European Space Agency's Solar System Exploration Working Group and is one of the scientists working on the Rosetta mission, said: 'The lighting conditions on the comet will only change gradually as it moves closer to the sun. 'If Philae is indeed under a cliff as we suspect, then the lighting conditions will have to be right before we can see it. 'Dust settling on the lander could not only make it harder to spot but may also pose a problem for powering Philae back up as it gets closer to the sun by stopping the solar panels from working properly.' This blurry image captures the moment Philae bounced from the comet's surface after failing to anchor itself . Rosetta captured a mothership's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November, but rather than landing softly, the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice - first to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then 65ft (20 metres) - before finally coming to rest. Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air. Scientists described the comet's surface as being more like a trampoline, causing the probe to rebound so far. Images from Rosetta have been used to construct this model of how Philae is thought to have finally landed . Astronomer Stuart Atkinson cropped and tilted this image, taken by Rosetta and released by the European Space Agency, to show what comet 67P's dramatic landscape would look like when standing on its surface . This image is a composite of four pictures taken by the Rosetta probe 12 miles above the surface . Before its batteries finally ran out, Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images. Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet's surface appears to be made of a very hard 'sintered' ice. Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life. From several miles above the comet, Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived. Images taken with Rosetta's Osiris camera revealed an array of 'dinosaur egg' shaped boulders and blocks on the surface that are thought to be the remains of the original icy material that formed the comet 4.5 billion years ago. Large stretches of sand dunes and boulder fields have also been seen by Rosetta's cameras. They have provided evidence that 67P, which is just 2.4 miles (4km) across, is surprisingly strong - able to shape depressions and arrange boulders. This graphic shows how Philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet .","Scientists have been searching images taken by Rosetta for signs of Philae .

"The judge who will sentence former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for public corruption Tuesday has been inundated with 443 letters attesting to the Republican's integrity and asking for mercy on his behalf. The letter writers include family members, former colleagues, neighbors, longtime friends, priests and state legislators. Even Democratic US Sen. Tim Kaine and former state House Democratic leader Ward Armstrong put in a good word for the Republican politician. McDonnell, once widely considered a top prospect for national office, will be sentenced Tuesday on 11 counts. Scroll down for video . Awaiting his fate: The judge who will sentence former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell Tuesday (pictured here after his conviction in September) has received over 400 letters of support . Nearly all the letters describe McDonnell as an honorable man who did not intend to break the law when he and family members accepted more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from a vitamin executive who was seeking government support for his company's products. Some questioned why the executive, former Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams, got immunity for testifying against McDonnell. Some relatives blamed McDonnell's troubles on his wife, Maureen, who was convicted of eight counts and was portrayed at trial as emotionally unstable and eager to cash in on Williams' free-spending ways. She will be sentenced for her role in the corruption scheme February 20. Bob McDonnell's attorneys have asked US District Judge James Spencer to order three years of community service. Prosecutors say in court papers that the claims of good character are belied by McDonnell's lack of remorse and willingness to blame others. They want a prison sentence of at least 10 years. One of the letters sent to judge Spencer ahead of McDonnell's sentencing was penned by his eldest daughter, Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky, who called her father 'the least materialistic person that I have ever known.' 'My mom, in contrast, has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees. ... She hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she didn't communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve,' wrote the oldest of the five McDonnell children. Strained relationship: In the four months since his conviction, McDonnell (left) remained estranged from his wife of 38 years, Maureen (right), but the two came together to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas with their children . Ardent supporter: McDonnell's eldest daughter, Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky (left), called her father 'the least materialistic person that I have ever known' in a letter sent to the judge in his case . Zubowsky said her father quietly endured his wife's screaming when they fought over the way Maureen McDonnell mistreated other people. 'The testimony about my mom was not just part of a defense strategy and was not an attempt to 'throw her under the bus,' but unfortunately, was the reality,' she wrote. Nancy McDonnell Naisawald said her big brother, Bob, was unaware of many of his wife's actions. 'He only learned of his wife's many inappropriate interactions with Williams after the investigation began,' she wrote. 'He surrounded his wife with many trusted staff and advisors to help her adjust to her position as First lady. She neither trusted nor accepted their advice, preferring to make her own misguided choices.' Bob McDonnell's youngest sister, also named Maureen, offered a new example of her sister-in-law's 'inappropriate behavior' — a letter 25 years ago to sister Maureen's college boyfriend, an unnamed NFL quarterback, requesting money and asking him not to tell Bob. 'The tragedy is, none of us, including me, wanted to tell Bob about his wife's conduct for fear of hurting him, particularly when he was so busy as a state delegate and lawyer to running the Commonwealth and Republican Governors Association,' she wrote in her letter of support for her big brother. 'Our silence, in an effort to protect Bob, is something we all have to live with.' Rachel McDonnell, the McDonnells' youngest child, said that her mother showed her some designer clothing and accessories Williams bought for her. Supporters in academia: Both University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan (left) and former Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger (right) wrote that McDonnell never made any inappropriate requests . Bob McDonnell's youngest sister wrote that no one wanted to tell him about his wife's 'inappropriate behavior,' including her allegedly requesting money from an NFL quarterback . 'She specifically told me not to tell my dad that Jonnie purchased these items for her because she knew this is not something he would approve,' she wrote, adding that her father also didn't know that she and her sister used Williams' airline points for a trip to Savannah, Georgia. 'Please do not hold my dad accountable for my family's actions when he was not aware of everything that was going on.' Tim Kaine, a Democrat, praised McDonnell for restoring the voting rights of more than 8,000 felons, more than any previous governor. 'I am convinced that Governor McDonnell showed mercy to convicted felons not for political reasons or because he had anything personally to gain by doing so. The merciful attitude exhibited by this positive action is characteristic of him as an individual,' the senator wrote. University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan wrote that if McDonnell had wanted to pressure the university to research anything, he had many opportunities to do so in their private conversations. She added, 'Never, at any time, was there any pressure put on me of this sort.' Former Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger likewise wrote that McDonnell never made any inappropriate requests. He added: 'With all due respect, it is of considerable concern to me that Mr. Williams was granted immunity from prosecution. Actions such as this contribute to the loss of public confidence in our institutions.' McDonnell's lawyers argued in briefs filed late last month that the sentence sought by prosecutors is overly harsh for a defendant who devoted his life to 'honorable public service' but made errors in judgment that destroyed his once-promising career and left his personal life in shambles. The government, meanwhile, said McDonnell remains unrepentant and 'will not relent in shifting blame for his own actions to others' — including his wife and co-defendant, Maureen — and that he deserves at least 10 years in prison for selling the influence of his office. In the four months since his conviction, McDonnell remained estranged from his wife of 38 years, but the two came together to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas with their children.","Nearly all the letters describe Bob McDonnell as an honorable man who did not intend to break the law .

"One week into the Barclays Premier League season and Louis van Gaal is already beginning to sound a little like his predecessor. ‘I’m not hired to be fired,’ said the Manchester United manager. ‘I’m hired to build up a team. It’s a process and that process needs time. ‘I think the fans of Manchester are intelligent. I’ve already said that the first three months will be difficult for the players, especially, and the fans. I’ve said it also to (executive vice-chairman) Ed Woodward and the Glazer family that it is always like that — this is not an overnight job.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see Van Gaal say he's gone from the king to the devil in two weeks . Red Devils: Louis van Gaal (right) and new £16m signing from Sporting Lisbon Marcos Rojo . Keep the faith: Van Gaal has called on Manchester United supporters to be patient . Tough time: Wayne Rooney and Co will be hoping to bounce back after their opening-day loss against Swansea . Facing the media: Van Gaal didn't hold anything back during his pre-match press conference on Friday . Four months after his sacking by Manchester United, David Moyes is still upset that his own attempt to play the long game at Old Trafford was cut short after less than a season. Van Gaal, then, should be careful about looking too far into the future. Nevertheless, the Dutchman’s lament was easy to understand. These are extraordinary times at Old Trafford as the club’s first continental manager endeavours to impose a new playing style on a squad that looks short of quality and is already ravaged by injury. United lost to Swansea at home on the opening day and on Sunday they travel to Sunderland at the end of a week that has told us a lot. Manchester City and Chelsea have won away and look primed and ready, with strength in depth waiting on the bench. Making his point: Rooney will lead the line for Manchester United when they travel to Sunderland on Sunday . Blow: United were beaten in their first match of the Premier League season. Swansea won 2-1 at Old Trafford . United, meanwhile, are trying to plug holes, with Woodward looking for salvation in the last week of the transfer window and Van Gaal seeking understanding from his new audience. This week former United midfielder Paul Scholes claimed he was ‘scared’ of the future he envisaged for the club. ‘Paul Scholes has to believe in the philosophy,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I can imagine that the fans are also scared because they have seen the last year and now they have seen the first home match. But they have to believe. Two weeks ago I was the king of Manchester and now I’m the devil of Manchester. ‘It’s the football world — especially the media. The club have hired me for my philosophy, not because I’m a nice person. I am a nice person but it is my philosophy they hired. ‘For example, I have to drive on the left over here and I have to pay a lot of attention to drive properly. It costs me a lot of energy. It’s the same for the players. I bring another philosophy into the club and that’s difficult for them because I have to give a lot of information. I’m only saying what is my experience. Heading for the exit: Danny Welbeck has been told he can leave Manchester United during the transfer window . ‘Clubs like Barcelona and Bayern Munich are a good reference point. That’s what I am saying, it will take three months. But it could be one month, or it could be four months. But it is not a question of being champion at the end of the season, because we have to build up a team, and that process takes maybe longer. ‘At my other clubs, we did it in the first year, so what can I say? We have to wait and see, and believe in it. But when I have to say it five times, it is not a good signal.’ United’s new signing Marcos Rojo sat alongside Van Gaal at his press conference on Friday. The fact the central defender does not yet have a work permit to enable him to play perhaps sums up the start United have made to the new season. Rojo may have to wait until Tuesday in the Capital One Cup at MK Dons, a game where Danny Welbeck may also figure after apparently being told by the manager that he can leave the club. Van Gaal wouldn’t confirm that he was looking to sell the England striker but nor did he deny it. It is, however, hard to imagine United selling a talented 23-year-old in whom they have invested so much without buying a replacement first. ‘I know what I have said to Danny and Danny knows exactly what I have said to him,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I don’t speak about it, it’s private. I assume Danny Welbeck is not talking about our conversation and that’s the way it should be.’","Manchester United boss urges supporters to keep faith in his philosophy .

"Google is set to bring its $35 Chromecast dongle to hifi systems. The firm today revealed a major new push into audio designed to take on Apple TV. It plans to partner with hifi firms to create speakers for the service, and today revealed it will already work with speakers connected to a TV. Scroll down for video . The update allows users to control music on their compatible speakers from a mobile phone . Google Audio cast works with the following apps: . Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, TuneIn, and many others. However, key services, including Spotify, are currently missing. Currently the system allows people to play back video from sites such as Netflix. However, Google is now bringing the same technology behind its popular $35 Chromecast dongle into speakers, soundbars and A/V receivers. It says users will be able to 'cast' audio wirelessly from a variety of apps on your Android or iOS smartphone, or the Web, in a similar fashion to the way people with a Chromecast stream video. 'Just like Chromecast, simply tap the cast button in your favorite music or radio app on Android, iOS, or the web, and select a Google Cast Ready speaker to get the party started.' Similar to the video service, users can use their phone to control the music, which is then played directly through the speaker from cloud services, meaning they can use their phone for other things. 'Google Cast Ready speakers pull content directly from the cloud, so you’ll get the best audio quality and can freely multi-task on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all without straining the battery,' it says. The service is available from today, and Google's speakers will work with a growing list of apps including Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, TuneIn, and doznes more. The $35 gadget, which resembles a USB stick, is plugged directly into the HDMI port on modern TVs and streams content from the web, via peoples phones, tablets and laptops. All this content is controlled via apps, and the European version of the stick currently features content from the BBC, YouTube and Netflix, while the US version has a host of apps. Chromecast is a direct competitor to the Apple TV system that was launched by the Cupertino company in 2007, and is now in its third generation. It also rivals the streaming box services of Roku. By comparison, Roku boxes start at £60 ($99), while the Apple TV device sells for £99 in the UK and $99 in the U.S. Chromecast is compatible with Android smartphones and tablets, as well as Chrome and Apple's iOS operating system. However, some major streaming services, including Spotify, are currently missing from the list. Google intends to broaden the Google Cast ecosystem over the coming months by bringing it into more televisions, game consoles, and set-top boxes with Android TV. The company is also working to enable other non-audio apps to enhance the experience by supporting Google Cast Ready audio devices. For example, you might be able to see a video on a tablet, but hear the audio on a set of bedroom speakers.","Will allow users to 'cast' audio to compatible speakers and hifi systems .

"Sitting on long wooden benches in a dimly-lit hall, rows of men  - scruffy and unwashed - look grimly at the camera as they ready for another night in the shelter. Every one of them has paid one penny - roughly 32p today - for a space on the bench or on the floor. Their night will be spent sitting up, or leaning against a cold, dank wall. This shelter in Blackfriars, London, was set up by the Salvation Army in the early 1890s - one of a number of places that provided temporary housing to thousands who were poor or homeless. The bleak scene is just one of the images included in an upcoming museum exhibition that seeks to explore the places inhabited by London's most deprived at the turn of the last century. Scroll down for video . Home for the night: Each man in this photo paid one penny - roughly 32p today - for a space on the bench or on the floor of this London shelter . Benefits: While this scene of a workhouse mealtime might look bleak, reports suggest that some men were simply grateful for food . Through photographs, paintings and first-hand accounts, Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London, which opens at The Geffrye in London, shows what it really meant to be poor. While today the term can describe Britons who live comfortably, 110 years ago it covered the men, women and children who only had a few pennies to their name - if any. But despite their poverty, their experiences were not always the desperate tales immortalised in Dickensian novels, explained Hannah Fleming, a curator at The Geffrye. Your fate depended on who you were, where you stayed - and how much you could scrape together. Beginning in the 1840s, the exhibition charts how, as the century wore on, the problems of accommodating London’s poor became more acute. Slum clearance and the demolition of housing to make way for the railways pushed the poor into ever decreasing areas. Rents soared and living conditions plummeted. The exhibition starts with the street, looking at where the homeless slept rough in the city. This, said Fleming, drew some interesting comparisons to the present-day, with many of the same 'hotspots' for homelessness remaining today. It then looks at where the destitute, or those who were able to make only a precarious living might seek shelter. 'Coffin beds': These cramped bunks weren't particularly comfortable, but they did offer visitors a dry and clean place to sleep . While popular accounts of the shelters and workhouses, often by middle-class observers, make them seem bleak and uninhabitable, they are often seen in a more favourable light by their lower-class visitors. One of the sketches in the collection, for example, illustrates a group of men settling in for a night in so-called 'coffin boxes' - wooden bunks that were barely long enough to fit a body. This scene shows life inside Medland Hall, in the former London borough of Ratcliff. The establishment opened in 1893 and, by the early 1900s, attracted hundreds of men hoping to secure a stay in one of the 450 bunks. While the cramped and uncomfortable conditions might provoke shock in middle-class Victorians and modern-day viewers, the 'coffin beds' - clean, dry and sheltered from the elements - were a welcome sight for most homeless Victorians. And a meal in one of these shelters - captured in another depressing image that shows men sat side-by-side at long tables - meant food and a roof over their heads. Sleeping rough: This painting, titled 'A Recess on a London Bridge', by Augustus Edwin Mulready shows a poor Victorian boy on the streets . A night at one of these shelters, which were often run by charitable or philanthropic organisations, would cost one penny. Visitors also had the option of completing a work task to earn their keep. But shelters weren't meant as long-term solutions, said Fleming, so those who ran them had to keep them from feeling too inviting. She said: 'They didn't want to be seen to be encouraging homelessness so they implemented things like mandatory washing with shared bathwater when you entered.' Those who had slightly more money - perhaps earned from intermittent work - could pay threepence for a room in a common lodging. These simply-furnished rooms, situated in houses owned by private landlords, would include not much more than a simple bedframe, but they did offer more privacy than a shelter or workhouse. For sixpence, one could afford a bed in a model lodging house - with private rooms and slightly more luxury. The dirty and cramped conditions in these lodging houses excited both sympathy and disapproval from contemporary observers. Scraping a living: Thomas Benjamin Kennington's painting, The Pinch of Poverty, shows a young girl selling bunches of flowers on the street . Later in the century more efforts were made to provide housing for the poor, for families and for single men living by themselves, as well as specialist accommodation for children. Experiences also varied greatly on whether you were a man, woman or child, explained Fleming. Records of meals and sleeping arrangements reveal that slightly more care was given to the most vulnerable - 'invalids', women and children - while fit, working-aged men often had the worst deals. While our way of measuring - and handling - poverty and homelessness might have changed since the Victorian era, the issue remains a contemporary one. That is why a parallel exhibition will run along side Homes for the Homeless, one that engages with contemporary homelessness in London. Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London opens at the Geffrye, London 24 March - 12 July . Now . The main measure used by the Government to define poverty in the UK today is whether or not the household income is below 60 per cent of the median income. This is calculated Before Housing Costs (BHC) such as council tax and rent are taken into consideration. The UK's average salary, as of January 2014, is £26,500. The latest figures on poverty from 2012/2013, released by the Department for Work and Pensions in July this year, shows the average household income Before Housing Costs is £440 per week. Based on that figure, the report found 15 per cent (9.7m) of Britons are living in poverty. There have also been other types of poverty introduced which are recognised by the Government. These include fuel poverty and material deprivation, the latter of which refers to the 'self-reported inability of individuals or households to afford particular goods and activities that are typical in society at a given point in time'. The Government also recognises 'persistent poverty', seen as those living in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household, for at least three out of the last four years. In 2011, each person's disposable income in the UK was around £14,000. The 60 per cent measure is criticised because it is relative to the current economic state of the country - meaning there could effectively be 'less people' living in poverty during a recession. Then . During the 1800s, a great proportion of Londoners lived in terrible poverty. Victorian cities were overcrowded, filthy and bleak. But it was often not known exactly how many were 'poor' - and how they should be classed. Charles Booth, a successful businessman, thought social reformers had exaggerated London's poverty levels, which were said to be about a quarter. In 1886, he decided to find out the truth. As part of his research Booth lived with working-class families for several weeks at a time. It revealed the level of want was even worse than generally thought: as many as one third of Londoners lived in poverty. He took into account a wide variety of subjects including working conditions, education, wage levels, workhouses, religion, and police. Booth's work was instrumental in establishing the old age pension, an idea which had been around since Thomas Paine's Rights of Man in 1791. The first pensions were paid on 1 Jan 1909 (2 January in Scotland). The census also provided some information on the country's most deprived .","Upcoming museum exhibition explores the varied experiences of those living on the streets in Victorian London .

"A combination treatment including Viagra could help treat a range of viruses and bacterial infections . Viagra could be key to developing new treatments to combat illnesses including Ebola, brain cancer, influenza, hepatitis and the superbug MRSA. Scientists have discovered that drugs which attack the protein GRP78 may pave the way for new treatments. The study, at Virginia Commonwealth University clinically tested a drug combination, which included Viagra and Cialis, or Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, as they are also known. Researchers found they prevented the replication of a number of different viruses in infected cells. They also made antibiotic-resistant bacteria vulnerable to common antibiotics, and  killed brain cancer stem cells. 'Basically, we've got a concept that by attacking GRP78 and related proteins, we hurt cancer cells, inhibit the ability of viruses to infect and the reproduce, and we are able to kill superbug antibiotic-resistant bacteria, said lead investigator, Paul Dent, at VCU's School of Medicine. The study considered the effects in treating brain cancer, influenza, mumps, measles and rubella, adenovirus, coxsake virus, Ebola, hepatitis, E.Coli, MRSA, MRSE and N. gonorrhoeae. GRP78 is part of a family of proteins called chaperones. Their job is to help shape chains of amino acids into proteins and then to keep those proteins in the correct 3D shape. The Viagra drug combination used in the study attacks GRP78 and other chaperones, thereby killing cancer cells. After discovering the effect on cancer cells, Professor Dent and his team began to target GRP78 for infectious diseases, including viruses and bacterial infections. Professor Dent said: 'The findings open an avenue of being able to treat viral infections, infections that certainly most people would say we'll never be able to treat. 'They prove that GRP78 is a ""drugable"" target to stop viruses from reproducing and spreading. 'And in the case of bacteria, we have a new antibiotic target, Dna K, that if we’re careful and only use the OSU drug in hospitals, we’ve got something that can help to treat the superbugs.' He said the next steps have already been taken and are leading to new discoveries. Scientists at Virginia Commonwealth University discovered that by attacking a protein known as GRP78, virus like Ebola, pictured, can be prevented from reproducing in cells . 'We know in mice that the Viagra treatment can kill tumour cells but doesn't harm normal tissues like the liver and the heart. 'Of even more importance, we've just discovered that the Viagra combination for making tumour cells resistant to chemotherapy and for stopping life-saving brain cancer chemotherapy from entering into the brain and killing cancer.' Researchers from university have previously found Viagra drug combinations can be beneficial in other ways. In 2010, Dr Rakesh Kukreja and Professor Eric Lipman, working with Professor Dent, found Viagra improved the effectiveness of the breast cancer treatment Doxorubicin, while protecting the heart from the harm caused by chemotherapy. In 2013 and 2014 Professor Dent obtained similar data with Viagra and conventional chemotherapy in bladder, pancreatic and paediatric brain cancer cells. Based on Professor Dent's new study, a new phase one clinical trial will open at VCY Massey Cancer Center combining the colon cancer drug regorafenib with Viagra for all solid tumour patients. The pre-clinical study was published this month in the Journal of Cellular Physiology. The researchers also discovered the treatment was able to kill brain cancer cells, pictured .","Scientists have identified a protein GRP78 key to treating a range of illnesses including Ebola, brain cancer, hepatitis, MRSA and influenza .

"More than £30billion was wiped off the value of Britain’s leading companies as world stock markets tumbled yesterday. The FTSE 100 index fell 130.64 points or 2 per cent to 6417.16 in London, reducing the value of UK blue-chip firms by £33.2billion in a blow to millions of savers. Milan’s stock market was down 940 points, or 4.92 per cent, and shares in Athens fell 5.63 per cent. Falling: A currency exchange office yesterday in Athens, Greece, on the day that the euro dropped to a nine-year low against the US dollar . The dramatic sell-off came as fears that Greece will abandon the euro sent shockwaves through the markets. Speculation is also mounting that the European Central Bank is preparing to flood the eurozone with newly created money through quantitative easing, in a bid to stave off recession. The combination sent the single currency to a nine-year low against the US dollar. Dr Dennis Novy, an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick, said: ‘The eurozone economy has been in the doldrums for years now. Markets are expecting the euro to become weaker.’ A snap general election has been called in Greece for January 25 - opening the door to the Left-wing Syriza party, which is ahead in polls and has vowed to tear up the nation’s £188billion bailout agreement. It is feared this could lead to a euro exit. Dropping yesterday: The FTSE 100 index fell 130.64 points or 2 per cent to 6417.16 in London (as seen above) Past month: Yesterday's fall on the FTSE 100 reduced the value of UK blue-chip firms by £33.2billion . German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Berlin considers Greece quitting the euro almost unavoidable if Syriza seizes power - a report Germany’s government denied. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at banking group ING, said: ‘It would be a nasty precedent if Greece leaves as it could stimulate others to do the same, making it the first step of euro fragmentation. ‘The fact remains that losing one member of the family would ultimately open Pandora’s box.’ French President Francois Hollande yesterday said it is ‘up to the Greeks’ to decide whether to remain part of the single currency. ‘As for Greece remaining in the eurozone, Greece alone can decide,’ said Mr Hollande. ‘The Greeks are free to determine their own destiny.’ Determining their destiny: French President Francois Hollande (pictured yesterday in Paris) said it is ‘up to the Greeks’ to decide whether to remain part of the single currency . Analysts said talk of a Greek exit triggered heavy selling in stock markets across Europe. Alastair McCaig, a market analyst at trading firm IG, said: ‘Trading screens are a sea of red as talk of a Greek exit from the eurozone drives equity markets lower. ‘We are now entering what could be the final chapter of the Greek saga, in which the indebted nation breaks free from the single currency and tries to go it alone. ‘The rise of the anti-austerity Syriza party has sent shivers down the spine of dealers as they are well positioned for the election this month. ‘A victory for the left-wing party does not automatically mean a Greek exit but traders will certainly see it that way.’ Asda knocked 2p off the price of fuel yesterday, saying it will charge no more than 105.7p a litre for petrol and 112.7p for diesel from today.

Essentially it’s a fitness social network — a motivational tool with which you share your pain with others aiming to get fit and (for a fee) learn better techniques and approaches from expert trainers. You are encouraged to log your progress, list your challenges for others to see, then go about achieving them — using guidance and help of the other members, including fitness experts. Verdict: Well-designed and simple to use, this app could prove effective for anyone who tends to lose interest after the first few weeks. The idea that you report back to fellow exercisers can be very motivational. However, it’s targeted at the beginner and could quickly lose its appeal. 7/10 . BEST FOR YOGA FANS . Though targeted at all levels, even the more basic workouts assume some experience of yoga . Daily yoga . Free; iPod, iPhone and Android . This provides a library of more than 50 classes with video demonstrations, music and 400 poses. Plans come in a variety of intensities and durations. There are options such as ‘office yoga to de-stress’ and ‘seated yoga’ to be done at your desk or by people who are less mobile. Verdict: Though targeted at all levels, even the more basic workouts assume some experience of yoga. There’s plenty of variety, but those wanting more advanced postures will need the ‘pro’ version of the app (£22 a year). Yoga alone won’t improve all-over fitness, but it is a great adjunct to cardiovascular activities, such as running and cycling. 5/10 . Tabata Trainer involves performing 20 seconds of an exercise  followed by a ten-second rest . BEST FOR THE SUPERFIT . Tabata Trainer . £1.49; tabatatrainerapp.com; iPhone and iPod Touch . Tabata involves performing 20 seconds of an exercise — including lunges, squat jumps and press-ups — followed by a ten-second rest, repeated for four minutes in total. This provides a routines of varying lengths — there are no demonstration videos, so you need to know how to do each exercise. Verdict: Not suitable for beginners. There’s also a risk that technique will suffer as you focus on speed and intensity, raising the risk of injury and muscle strains. These type of workouts could be demotivating or too challenging because, even though short, Tabata is incredibly tough. 6/10 . BEST FOR INDOOR RUNNERS . BeatBurn Treadmill Trainer . £2.49; iPhone and iPod . Treadmill exercise classes — done in a group — are set to be a big trend in 2015, with gyms such as Virgin Active launching them. This app prescribes individual running workouts set to music with varying speeds — slower for the warm-up (which you can walk) and faster for sprints and hill work. You can customise the intensity and it can be used outdoors. Verdict: Running to a beat has scientific backing — psychologists at Brunel University have shown many people find running to music easier. A good variety of tunes and you can add your own. It’s all about running or walking, though, so you’d need to add your own strength moves. 8/10 . BEST FOR TONING . Barre3 . £2.99; barre3.com; iPhone and iPod . Creator and presenter Sadie Lincoln, who trained workout queen Madonna, provides 24 ten-minute ballet-style workouts for your mobile along with healthy eating advice and recipes. It can all be done on the go — all you need is a table, tree, bench or chair to lean on. Routines are based on the principle of a cardiovascular workout (such as repetitive fast side steps) combined with dance-inspired toning moves performed with small pulse movements that will leave your muscles quivering. Verdict: Well-presented and with clear instructions, but many exercises require equipment such as weights or yoga balls. You will need additional cardio exercises to keep your weight down. 6/10 .","High-tech fitness websites and apps offer workouts and fitness advice .

"The exact spot upon which Jesus stood as he was sentenced to death, may have been pinpointed by archaeologists in Jerusalem. Discovered around 15 years ago, the remains of Herod the Great’s palace have been carefully examined and a place between a gate and uneven stone pavement has been identified as fitting the description of the event in the Gospel of John. Pilgrims and tourists will be able to visit the Biblical site, because tours are being offered by the Tower of David Museum, which is located nearby. Scroll down for video . Discovered around 15 years ago, the remains of Herod the Great’s Palace have been carefully examined and a place between a gate and uneven stone pavement has been identified as fitting the description of the event in the Gospel of John. This site is close to the Tower of David (pictured) Archaeologists suspected the site’s religious and historical significance when they uncovered parts of foundation walls of the palace and an underground sewage system, when excavating an abandoned prison, The Washington Post reported. While historians largely agree that Herod’s palace stood in the west of Jerusalem’s Old City, whether Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate inside it, is the subject of much debate. This is mainly due to differing interpretations of the Gospels. While historians largely agree that Herod’s palace stood in the west of Jerusalem’s Old City, whether Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate inside it, is the subject of hot debate. This 19th Century illustration shows the trial taking place outdoors . Some academics believe the place where Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate lies within Herod the Great’s palace in the west of the old city of Jerusalem. They came across architectural features matching a description in the Gospel of John. Architectural features in a place between a gate and uneven stone pavement fits the description in the New Testament. But some experts maintain that Jesus was likely tried in the barracks of Antonia Fortress, which lies near Temple Mount. The building had been used as a prison by the Ottoman Turks and occupying British forces. Over 15 years of excavation, the site has revealed symbols scratched into the walls of jails by members of the Jewish resistance in the 1940s, as well as basins from the Crusades. Foundation walls and an underground sewage system are thought to have been built when the building was a sprawling palace for Herod the Great, ruler of Judea. The Gospel of John describes the trial of Jesus taking place near a gate and uneven pavement, which some archaeologists, including Shimon Gibson, an archaeology professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, believe matches evidence at the site. ‘There is, of course, no inscription stating it happened here, but everything - archaeological, historical and gospel accounts - all falls into place and makes sense,’ he said. The Reverend David Pileggi, minister of Christ Church located nearby the museum, told the newspaper that the discovery confirms ‘what everyone expected all along, that the trial took place near the Tower of David.’ However, not everyone is convinced. Some experts say that the Gospel’s use of the word ‘praetorium’ - which means general’s tent in military barracks in Latin - suggests the pivotal  trial took place in the Antonia Fortress. The fortress lies in the north eastern part of the old city, near Temple Mount. Despite some uncertainty, it's thought that the prison will become a visit on the pilgrim trail. Eilat Lieber, Director of the Tower of David Museum, says the museum is working with tour guides to explain the history and significance of the remaining ruins. However, Reverend Pileggi doesn’t think that the prison will become a major site of pilgrimage. ‘What makes a place holy is the fact that people have gone there for hundreds of years, prayed, cried and even celebrated there, so I don’t think there will be changes to the route anytime soon,’ he said. Pilgrims and tourists will be able to visit the Biblical site and historial prison, as tours are being offered by the Tower of David Museum (marked on the map), which is located nearby . This map shows Jerusalem, taken from a 1911 encyclopedia. The Palace of Herod, near Tower of David and the proposed site of Jesus' trial, is shown beneath Jaffa Gate. Sion, the location of the Last Supper is also shown. Experts believe the trial may alternatively have taken place at Fortress of Antonia (top right) As well as a Palace in the west of the Old City, King Herod (illustrated) had other properties nearby . As well as a palace in the west of the Old City, Herod had other properties nearby. He was born around 73BC and was governor of Galilee until 40BC. The Parthian Empire then conquered Judea, which was under Roman control at the time, and Herod fled to Jerusalem. He sought refuge in Petra, where his mother was said to have been originally from, and was later appointed King of the Jews by the Roman senate. With Roman support, he took back the kingdom three years later, and began building a colossal fortress 10 miles (16km) south of Jerusalem a decade after that. In December, archaeologists unearthed the arched entrance and corridor to the fortress, which was constructed between 23 and 15BC and included a palace and small town on the cone-shaped mound, where some experts say he was buried. The discovery in the Herodyon National Park was made by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology. University archaeologists said: ‘The corridor was built as part of Herod's plan to turn Herodium into a massive artificial volcano-shaped hill, a vast and impressive monument designed to commemorate the architect-King. n December, archaeologists unearthed the arched entrance and corridor (pictured) to a colossal fortress 10 miles (16km) south of Jerusalem. The discovery in the Herodyon National Park was made by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology . ‘During the course of the excavations, it became evident that the arched corridor was never actually in use, as prior to its completion it became redundant.' Archaeologists believe the palace was built by slaves and contractors and consisted of four towers, believed to have been where Herod lived. The site is the highest peak in the Judean desert, stretching 2,450ft (758 metres) above sea level. According to biblical accounts, when news of Jesus’ arrival reached the king, he was said to have felt threatened and ordered all newborn babies in Bethlehem to be killed. The Bible portrays him as a tyrant that would stop at nothing to keep his throne. In Matthew 2:16, the gospel wrote: ‘When he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.’ There were even accounts that the king killed three of his own sons, out of fear of losing his crown. However, few other historical accounts of this massacre have been reported. Archaeologists believe the palace was built by slaves and contractors and consisted of four towers - believed to have been where Herod lived. The site (pictured) is the highest peak in the Judean desert, stretching 2,450ft (758 metres) above sea level . Herod died in Jericho in spring 4 BC of an illness dubbed ‘Herod’s Evil’, which is thought to have been a combination of cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, and diabetes. Some archaeologists believe that his body was buried in a tomb on the site of the fortress. However, two years ago, experts ruled this location out because the tomb was too small for a ruler known for his decadence and love of ambitious, large scale architectural projects. King Herod had another fortified palace in Masada - an ancient fortification in the Southern District of Israel situated on top of an isolated rock plateau (akin to a mesa) on the eastern edge of the Judaean Desert, overlooking the Dead Sea. He built palaces for himself on the mountain, 12 miles east of Arad, and fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE. The site of Masada was identified in 1842 and extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin. Due to the remoteness from human habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia.","Archaeologists say features in Herod's palace, which was later used as a prison, match the description of the trial of Jesus in the Gospel of John .

"Eric Frein, the man who eluded police in the Pocono Mountains for seven weeks after shooting dead a trooper and wounding another, today headed to court for a preliminary hearing. The 31-year-old self-taught 'survivalist' sported neatly combed hair and glasses as he arrived at a Pike County courthouse in Milford, Pennsylvania in handcuffs around 8am on Monday. It came in stark difference to his appearance following his capture after a lengthy manhunt last year, when he sported a bloodied nose, bruised forehead, straggly hair and a mustache. At his hearing on Monday, surveillance footage was played of the moment he allegedly shot dead Corporal Bryon Dickson and injured Trooper Alex Douglass outside their barracks on September 12. Heading to court: Eric Frein, who is accused of shooting dead a trooper and then eluding police for seven weeks, is pictured heading to court in Milford, Pennsylvania on Monday morning . It showed the mortally wounded trooper falling to the ground before Douglass kneeled at his side - before he too was shot. Douglass then crawled into the lobby on his stomach. The video showed another trooper dragging Douglass into a secure part of the barracks and three troopers bringing Dickson inside. Frein, who was shackled by his hands and feet, sat quiet and still through the morning session in the packed courtroom. At one point, he wrote a note and whispered into his attorney's ear. At the hearing, a district judge must decide if there are sufficient grounds to send the case against him to county court. Frein was identified as a suspect shortly after the shootings when a passer-by found his vehicle partially submerged in a small pond near the state police station. Authorities launched a massive manhunt for Frein, an expert marksman, across the rural area - blocking roads and terrifying residents. Caught: Frein, 31, is pictured looking bruised, bloody and disheveled after his capture in October . Audience: People wait in line on Monday to enter the Pike County Courthouse for the hearing . At the hearing, Trooper Sean Doran, an evidence technician, testified that he found Frein's checkbook and two explosive devices in a backpack at a wooded campsite near Canadensis. Troopers also found three crumpled, wet pieces of notebook paper in a garbage bag at the campsite that authorities say bore Frein's handwriting and described the ambush in detail. 'Got a shot around 11 p.m. and took it,' one entry said. 'He was still and quiet.' After weeks of possible sightings, a team of federal marshals performing a systematic search stumbled across him at an abandoned airplane hangar about 30 miles from the scene of the shooting and were able to arrest him on October 30. John Schaaf, a deputy with the US Marshals Service, described how he was with two other deputies found at the abandoned airfield when another marshal first spotted Frein, ordered him to put his hands up, and asked him his name. Frein got onto his knees and told them who he was. Schaaf said he handcuffed Frein and searched him, finding a pocketknife but no other weapons. Hunt: Authorities launched a massive manhunt for Frein and eventually found him after seven weeks . He said he also spotted a green nylon cord attached to 'different metal devices.' 'I immediately thought he had explosives on him,' Schaaf said. But it turned out to be Frein's suspenders. He said Frein said, 'Can I tell you where the guns are in the hangar?' adding, 'I don't want a kid to find the guns.' He said that two rifles were upstairs in the hangar and a loaded pistol was downstairs. Frein was shackled with Dickson's handcuffs and driven to the police station in Dickson's squad car. Authorities said Frein confessed to what he described as an assassination designed to 'wake people up' and result in a change in government. He faces charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The lengthy hunt for Frein is believed to have cost authorities as much as $11 million. Gunned down: Frein is accused of fatally shooting Corporal Bryon Dickson, left, and injuring Trooper Alex Douglass, right, as they stood outside the Blooming Grove barracks in September . On the mend: Trooper Douglass (pictured center with his brother, right) left a rehab center so that he could spend Christmas with his family. He was shot in the pelvis in the September attack . Trooper Alex Douglass, who was shot in the pelvis by Frein outside the Blooming Grove barracks, left a rehabilitation center to spend Christmas with family in Lackawanna County. At the time of his release, Lieutenant Chris Paris said Douglass is in good spirits but has a long way to go with his rehabilitation in New York. His brother posted a message on his behalf on December 20, with a picture of them together beside a Christmas tree. Douglass was pictured grinning while using crutches to stand. 'Thank you all so much for your love, well wishes, and support!' his message read. ' I have seen all of your posts and truly appreciate how many of you care about me. Happy holidays!'

"The actor who caused controversy with films such as Borat, Bruno and The Dictator has sparked fury once again, this time with a club of British football fans. In preparation for his latest comedy, Grimsby, Sacha Baron Cohen has recruited six, 20-stone 'revolting' women to depict female footballer supporters from the coastal town. Residents slammed the choice of casting, with local politicians complaining the town had too often been the butt of cruel jokes. Scroll down for video . Sacha Baron Cohen (left, on set) has been criticised for casting 'revolting' 20-stone women for his film Grimsby. Among women cast as football fans from the British seaside town is Rebel Wilson (right) According to an extra in Cape Town, where the film was partly shot, the women chosen by Baron Cohen are 'enormous'. 'The gang of supporters from Grimsby are all enormous and revolting,' Maurice Maree, who worked on the film, told the Sunday Times. Local politicians have been outraged by the casting and the film's negative portrayal of the town. 'Why pick on us? There are other places where obesity is a problem where they've got a rough deal. Why is Grimsby picked on all the time,' Austin Mitchell MP told MailOnline. 'I know it's a joke but I haven't seen these fat ladies anywhere - if they were so fat they wouldn't fit through the turnstiles at the stadium. 'You can find fat ladies anywhere, we don't have an accumulation of then. We have the problems of a town which needs more development and jobs and its lost its basic industry. Local politicians have complained the film suggests Grimsby football fans are violent and overweight . The actor who shot to fame as Ali G visited the town in Lincolnshire before filming began abroad . Critics said the portrayal of residents and football fans as violent and obese created a 'very damaging image' Rebel Wilson and Sacha Baron Cohen on the set of Grimsby (above). A local MP condemned the actor's naming the film after the town, saying: 'You can find fat ladies anywhere' 'That's something to be helped and not made fun of. 'It creates a very damaging image.' Previously, councillor Matthew Brown told MailOnline he was 'disappointed' with the film. 'It is using the town's name in potentially a poor light. What also worries me is that there is no benefit to the local economy which is carrying the town's name. 'Anything that you associate with football hooliganism is going to be negative, but I hope people will be open-minded when they watch the film. He added that depicting Grimsby as a town which has a history of football violence is wrong. 'My view is quite simple. We don't have a massive issue with hooliganism. There is very good stewarding at the ground. In general we are not in the same category as other clubs like Millwall who have a history of it.' Among the women chosen to depict fans of Grimsby Town FC is Rebel Wilson, famed for her roles Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect in which she plays a character called Fat Amy. The Australian actress is seen locking lips with Baron Cohen in one scene, while his real-life wife, Isla Wilson, reportedly fills another on-screen role. Grimsby is scheduled for release in 2015 and see Sacha take on the role of a dimwit supporter of lower league team Grimsby Town. But while the town's representatives have been left disappointed by the way it is portrayed, residents have taken a more lighthearted approach. 'Should be good, there's no such thing as bad publicity,' one said online, while another said Mr Mitchell 'had no sense of humour'. Earlier a local councillor said he was disappointed with the film's portrayal of the seaside town. Above, actors film on the set in Tilbury, Essex . Besides claims that Grimsby is often picked on because of its name, critics asked why the film was being shot in Essex and abroad. Above, actresses playing local residents .

"New drone footage filmed by a campaign group is hoping to raise awareness of Lolita, the killer whale that has lived in captivity for 44 years. The 7,000-pound whale was first captured off the coast of Washington in 1970 and has been living in a 35-foot-wide tank ever since. The video was recorded by activist Paul James for Drones for Animal Defense, who wanted to highlight the whale's conditions at Miami Seaquarium. The tank, which reportedly violates the US's Animal Welfare Act for a whale the size of Lolita, is said to be 13 feet smaller than the legal requirement, according to protest groups, with no protection from the sun and elements. Campaign groups Whale and Dolphin Conservation and Orca Network have both highlighted the issue of Lolita's captivity. The Orca Network keeps fellow campaigners informed on its website, explaining: 'In the summer of 2011 a legal team began planning actions to help Lolita return to her native waters. 'Mostly from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), the team arrived at a multi-pronged approach. 'First, they focused on the fact the Seaquarium whale tank violates multiple provisions of the Animal Welfare Act, administered by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).' Lolita was first captured from the wild in 1970 and has lived in captivity ever since . Heartbreaking drone footage shows minuscule whale tank in Miami's Seaquarium theme park . While the original court case did not succeed, campaigners are still working to have Lolita placed in a larger sea pen in the San Juan Islands. The Orca Network claims Lolita's tank is the smallest and oldest in America and reports that Miami Seaquarium does not have the immediate funds for a new alternative. MailOnline Travel has contacted Miami Seaquarium for comment on the allegations. Lolita lives in what is reportedly the oldest and smallest killer whale tank in America at Miami Seaquarium . In August, the Miami Seaquarium was fined $7,000 for allowing trainers to work with the orca without sufficient protection. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that either trainers keep a safe distance from killer whales or that a physical barrier is in place. The regulations were approved following the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau who was killed by orca Tilikum at the SeaWorld park in Orlando, Florida.","Drones for Animal Defense captured the video of park conditions .

"Italy is on the verge of political meltdown, with a breakaway faction in Silvio Berlusconi’s party providing the only hope for the government’s survival. The billionaire sparked chaos at the weekend when he ordered his ministers to resign from a coalition with the centre left, leaving the government close to collapse. The threat of fresh elections, and months more turmoil, in the Eurozone’s third largest economy, has already scared investors, with warnings that Italy’s BBB+ credit rating is at risk of downgrade. Former premier Silvio Berlusconi has left Italy without a functioning government after ordering members to quit, causing bonds and shares to dive. Berlusconi, pictured last week arriving at his private residence, in Rome, faces eviction from parliament over tax fraud . Berlusconi’s centre right People of Liberty party has ruled in a uneasy coalition with the centre left since April. Prime Minister Enrico Letta faces a vote of confidence in the Parliament tomorrow.  If all Berlusconi’s MPs vote against him, the government’s majority will collapse. But a rebel faction within People of Liberty may provide salvation for Letta, a party source has claimed. If the dissidents support the government a workable majority could be cobbled together, preventing the collapse of the administration. Rumours of the rebellion slightly revived prices of Italian stocks and bonds. The yields on Italy's 10-year bond, a good indicator of long-term sentiment towards Italy, spiked to 4.73 per cent early on Monday from 4.42 per cent on Friday, the highest since June but well below a 7.5 per cent yield hit when Italy came on the verge of default in late 2011. Shares in Milan's blue-chip FTSE MIB plunged 2.5 per cent minutes after opening, with banking stocks particularly heavy. Shares in broadcasting group Mediaset, controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, were down nearly 5 per cent. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta will go before parliament on Wednesday and hold a confidence vote to verify what is left of his parliamentary backing. The outcome of a confidence vote is uncertain as some of Berlusconi's lawmakers from his centre-right party have shown increasing unease over his shock decision to withdraw government support. Minister Gaetano Quagliarello told an Italian newspaper on Monday there was talk to form another centre-right party. Italy's bonds are at a three-day low, and shares in big companies have fallen. It's goverment could face elections, causing more political and market uncertainty. Pictured Italy's Upper house, in Rome . 'The resignation of the centre-right ministers will clearly increase volatility in the government bond market, similar to what happened between February and April, before the current government was formed,' Goldman Sachs analysts said, adding the crisis threatened the few reforms Letta's coalition was trying to push through. Letta enjoys a commanding majority in the lower house but would need to win over a couple of dozen senators from Berlusconi's PDL party or opposition parties including the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement to be able to be sure of parliamentary support. 'Markets have grown accustomed to Italy's dysfunctional politics, but there's a sense that things are now spinning out of control,' said Nicholas Spiro, who runs specialised consultancy Spiro Sovereign Strategy.","Former premier's orders have left Italy without a functioning government .

"A 10-year-old special-needs boy has died in a Cleveland foster home, just over two years after his baby brother was starved to death by his parents and grandmother. Authorities say Xavier Brothers-Bartholomew was found in full cardiac arrest Sunday and was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later. The cause and circumstances surrounding his death are being investigated by the Cuyahoga County medical examiner and Cleveland police, which is normal procedure when a child dies. Sibling dies: Xavier Brothers-Bartholomew was found in full cardiac arrest more than two years after his 18-month-old brother, Isaac (pictured), passed away from malnourishment . Sentenced: James Brothers (left) and Adrienne Bartholomew (right) are serving six-year prison terms after pleading guilty to child endangering . Grandma jailed: Deborah Nelson, the children's grandmother and paid caregiver, was sentenced to two years in prison in November 2013 as part of a plea deal . Xavier and his five siblings became the focus of attention in November 2012 when their 18-month-old brother, Isaac, was found dead in his crib in the family's home in Vermilion, west of Cleveland. Authorities ruled that Isaac had died of malnourishment and that his siblings had been neglected by their parents, James Brothers and Adrienne Bartholomew, and their grandmother and paid caregiver, Deborah Nelson. The parents pleaded guilty last year to child endangering charges and were sentenced to six years in state prison. The children's grandmother, 63-year-old Ms Nelson, was sentenced to two years in prison in November 2013 as part of a plea deal. Police and paramedics responded to a foster home in the 300 block of East 160th Street at around 3pm Sunday after getting a 911 call about a young boy in cardiac arrest. Xavier Brothers-Bartholomew was rushed to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, where he was pronounded dead on arrival. 'It’s a very sad day for us,' Karen Balconi Ghezzi, director of Erie County Children Services, told the station Fox8. Balconi Ghezzi added that mistreatment by the parents didn't cause Xavier's death. A case worker visited the 10-year-old every week at the medically supervised foster home run by a licensed nurse and said he was receiving proper care. Isaac, Xavier and three other siblings were born with a genetic disorder that causes physical and mental impairments. All the children had been suffering from malnutrition, including a 6-year-old who weighed only 23lbs. A lawsuit filed in November 2014 on behalf of Isaac's estate and the guardian for his siblings said the eldest child, a boy who is not disabled, often was left to care for the younger children. New home: Xavier had been living in this medically supervised foster home run by a licensed Cleveland nurse . The lawsuit was filed against the parents and grandmother, officials in Erie County whose agencies were responsible for overseeing the children's well-being and doctors who had treated the children. The attorney who filed the lawsuit said the disabled children had begun to thrive in foster care and had doubled their weight. A Cuyahoga County official said Xavier lived in a foster home for children with special needs. She said Erie County remained responsible for monitoring the well-being of Xavier and his siblings.","Xavier Brothers-Bartholomew was found in full cardiac arrest at medically supervised foster home in Cleveland .

"A 30-year-old Princeton graduate, who allegedly shot dead his multimillionaire hedge-funder father, was upset that  his weekly allowance had been cut back, according to published reports. Tommy Gilbert Jr, a former pupil of Manhattan's most prestigious private schools, was being questioned by police on Monday after 70-year-old Thomas Gilbert Sr, founder of $200 million hedge fund Wainscott Capital, was found with a gunshot wound to the head. A source told the New York Daily News that Mr Gilbert Sr had cut back Tommy's weekly allowance to $300 and threatened to stop paying his rent. Gilbert Jr lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea where, according to listings, guarantors were accepted on the $2,400-a-month rent. Scroll down for video .

The NYPD broke down the door of Gilbert Jr's West 18th St ground-floor apartment (pictured) to arrest him on Sunday. According to published news reports, Gilbert Jr had his allowance cut back by his father who was paying his $2,400-a-month rent . The Ivy Leaguer, who was a regular fixture at Manhattan's black-tie benefits with society beauties on his arm, reportedly slipped past the doorman and into his parents' building shortly before the attack at 3.30pm on Sunday. According to The New York Post, Gilbert Jr went to his parents' eighth-floor apartment and asked his mother to leave to get him a sandwich. The father and son were discussing 'differences in their relationship', according to The Wall Street Journal. Gilbert Sr's wife Shelley, 67, found her husband dead in the bedroom within minutes of the alleged attack and called 911, police said. According to a Daily News report, he had the gun on his chest in an alleged attempt to make it look like suicide. Gilbert Jr was then seen walking out of the building in Manhattan's Turtle Bay area covering his face with a hoodie around 3.35pm, the New York Daily News reported. The 30-year-old was found in his ground-floor apartment at 10.30pm on Sunday, after he fled from his parents' home in midtown, multiple media outlets claimed, citing police sources. Police have detained Gilbert Jr (pictured left in August; right at a concert in Central Park in 2012) after he allegedly barged into his father's bedroom with a gun. He was arrested on Sunday night at his home in Chelsea . Tommy Gilbert Jr, pictured in March 2014, with fellow Princeton graduate Arielle Patrick, at the School of American Ballet's winter ball in New York . Gilbert Jr is reportedly being held at the NYPD's 17th precinct in midtown Manhattan after being arrested on Sunday night at his home . Police recovered a Glock 22 .40-caliber handgun from the scene. At 10.30pm on Sunday, Gilbert Jr was arrested without incident at his apartment after NYPD officers dressed in riot gear, chopped down the door and found him hiding inside. He was taken to the 17th precinct in midtown. Gilbert Jr was being questioned and has not been named a suspect, according to the NYPD. Police have not ruled out the possibility of suicide prior to a report from the city's medical examiner. Shelley Gilbert, 67, made the 911 call after finding her husband with a gunshot wound to the head . The NYPD have not released details of a potential motive. A spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Monday that the investigation was ongoing. Gilbert Jr had a lawyer and was refusing to speak to detectives. He was expected to be charged, The New York Post reported on Monday. Thomas Gilbert Sr started Wainscott Capital in 2011, growing the fund to a value of $200 million. He attended Princeton and Harvard Business School before a 40-year career on Wall Street.  According to Wainscott Capital's website, he had extensive knowledge of the stock market, private equity, real estate and the fixed income market. His son, Tommy Gilbert Jr, attended The Buckley school on Manhattan's Upper East Side from kindergarten until eighth grade. Tuition costs around $35,000 a year. Noteable alumni of the school include actor James Harder, philanthropist David Rockefeller Jr and Robert Wagner, former deputy mayor of New York. He then went on to the $50,000-a-year Deerfield Academy in Western Massachusetts, which counts the King of Jordan and Prince of Jordan among its alumni. After graduating from Deerfield in 2003, Gilbert Jr accepted a place at Princeton University where he graduated in 2009. A friend told Daily Mail Online on Monday: 'He was a really nice person. He was smart, athletic and he went to Princeton. 'He took some leave of absences from Princeton which is why it took him so long to graduate. He must have been really angry to do something so out-of-character.' A classmate, who attended Deerfield with Gilbert Jr, also said: 'Tommy was my classmate. This story is an incomprehensible tragedy. My heart goes out to the entire Gilbert family.' Details of Gilbert Jr's profession remain unclear but he was photographed on multiple occasions at black-tie society events. The 30-year-old was pictured in March 2014 at the School of American Ballet's winter ball with Arielle Patrick, a 2012 Princeton grad, child of Manhattan private schools and now a PR director, who sources told the Daily Mail Online that he had dated. Miss Patrick refused to confirm whether the pair had dated on Monday. A fellow Princeton graduate told Daily Mail Online that Gilbert Jr was a 'highly disturbed individual'. Another friend told Today that 30-year-old Gilbert Jr had become 'volatile' in recent years. Friends in the 30-year-old's circle told Daily Mail Online that he loved surfing, was 'handsome and nice' but extremely quiet and never talked. Investigators escort a woman, believed to be the victim's wife, from the family's Manhattan home on Sunday . The family property is a $6,000-a-month rental apartment at 20 Beekman Place on 50th Street, a few blocks north of the United Nations on the east side of Manhattan. The building's porter told the New York Daily News that Gilbert Sr was 'friendly, very nice' and a 'gentleman'. According to the paper, the son was spotted slipping past the doorman wearing a hoodie shortly before the attack. 'I immediately got a bad vibe,' the doorman told police, according to the Daily News. 'The kid got into the elevator before I got the chance to pick up the telephone.' A neighbor, named as Bernard, said: 'Five minutes later he comes running out covering his face with a hoodie.' Gilbert Sr also owns a $10 million property in the Hamptons which is listed for sale at $11.5million. The 2.5 acre property has five bedrooms, four baths, a heated pool and screened in porch and sits in one of the area's most exclusive enclaves. Police surrounded the family property, a $6,000-a-month rental, in midtown Manhattan on Sunday . Police reports said the alleged fatal attack took place at the family apartment (pictured left) on the east side of Manhattan. investigators with evidence bags enter the Gilbert family home in Manhattan on Sunday (right) Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, was found with a gunshot wound to the head at 3.30pm in his Beekman Place home on the east side of Manhattan. His son was arrested seven hours later after barricading himself in his home on West 18th Street . Wainscott Capital avoided losses which plagued other hedge funds in October last year, gaining 1.65 per cent that month. In an interview with FINalternatives, Gilbert Sr attributed the success to their moderate risk profile. 'We’re not trying to beat all of the biotech funds, we’re basically trying to avoid drawdowns,' he said. Named in the annual Who's Who In America list for five years running (1999-2004), Gilbert Sr started his career with a seven-year stint at Loeb Partners Corporation as managing director. Thomas Gilbert Sr owned this $10 million property in the Hamptons, which has since been sold .

"The Dead Sea has attracted visitors for thousands of years who come to float in its salty waters and reap its reported health benefits. But the attraction's days could be numbered after experts discovered the sea's water level is dropping by an average of one metre every year. The drop in levels is thought to have been caused by more water flowing out of the sea than into it from the Jordan River. Scroll down for video . The water level of the Red Sea is dropping by an average of one meter per year. It is being carefully monitored by the Israeli Geological Institute of Limnological Research, which uses a small research buoy (pictured) floating in the centre of the sea to measure its depth . The first measurements were taken in 1927 and since then the waters, made famous in Biblical stories, have declined. They are being monitored by the Israeli Geological Institute of Limnological Research which uses a small research buoy floating in the centre of the sea to measure its depth. The marker measures the water level near the Dead Sea coastal resort of Ein Gedi, Israel. The first measurements were taken in 1927 and since then the waters, made famous in Biblical stories, have declined. This image shoes dead palm trees standing in front of the Dead Sea coastal resort near Ein Gedi . It is estimated that the Dead Sea’s water level has dropped by more than 131ft (40 metres) since the 1950s. Here, an abandoned tourist boat shipwreck lies on the sandy bed . The Dead Sea is 1,407ft (429 metres) below sea level, making it the Earth's lowest elevation on land. It's 997ft (304metres) deep - the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. The Dead Sea is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean. It is so-called because fish and plants can't survive in the salty water. The water has attracted health tourists for thousands of years - since Herod the Great - and minerals were used as balms for Egyptian mummification and fertilisers. It has a density of 1.24kg/l, which makes swimming similar to floating. It is estimated that the Dead Sea’s water level has dropped by more than 131ft (40 metres) since the 1950s. The low level has been blamed on the imbalance between the amount of incoming and outgoing water. In particular, experts said there has been a large reduction of water flowing into the sea from the Jordan River. This may be due to the water saturating the land, or being taken from the river for various reasons. The Dead Sea, known as the Sea of Salt, separates Israel and Jordan. It is so-called, because its high salt content, which is almost 10 times as salty as the ocean, prevents fish and plants from living in it. The sea’s surface and shores are 1,407ft (429 metres) below sea level, making it the Earth’s lowest elevation on land. And at 997ft (304metres) deep, it is the deepest hypersaline lake in the world.

Salt rusts metal and this image shoes an old buoy used by the Israeili navy, lying about 20 metres out of the water, marking where the shore was about 30 years ago . There has been a large reduction of inflowing of water from the Jordan River, which some experts think is the reason for declining levels. This image shows an abandoned water park opposite its shores neat Ein Gedi . This has been attributed to the increased consumption of water within the Jordan River and irrigation drainage basin. Water resources in the region are in demand and affect Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan that border the basin. Evidence of the water scarcity manifests itself as exposed sinkholes, cracked mud flats, damaged plants and even a derelict water park. The Dead Sea area has been attracting health tourists seeking treatments for more than 2,000 years, and is now a centre for health research. Experts say the mineral content of the water, lower levels of pollens and allergen in the atmosphere, and higher atmospheric pressure, have health benefits. It has been found that people with respiratory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, have appeared to benefit from increased atmospheric pressure. Experts exploit features such as the temperature and humidity to treat patients with psoriasis, who benefit from sunbathing in the area due to its position below sea level and fewer UV rays. People with rhinosinusitis or sinusitis, typically receive saline nasal irrigation to relive their symptoms. It's also been suggested that Dead Sea mud pack therapy relieves pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees.

"A U.S. brewery has been forced to apologize for naming an ale after the teetotal Indian leader, Mohandas Gandhi. The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed  for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India. What particularly caused upset was the can artwork, which reimagines Gandhi as a robot with one hand raised in blessing. Underfire: The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India . Following a legal complaint about the beer in Hyderabad, India, the New England Brewing Co issued an apology to Facebook. It said in a statement that its intent wasn't to 'offend anyone but rather pay homage and celebrate a man who we respect greatly.' Despite the backlash, the company says it has no plans to withdraw the beer, which is not sold internationally. It claims that Gandhi's granddaughter and grandson have seen the label and have 'expressed their admiration' for it. However, the company's stance could change when the case hits the courts Monday. A petitioner in India contends that Gandhi’s image on the alcohol cans and description of the father of the nation by the brewery is highly condemnable and punishable under Indian laws. Icon: What particularly caused upset was the can artwork, which reimagines Gandhi (seen here in 1948) as a robot with one hand raised in blessing . However, there are also those who fully-support the drink. One fan wrote on Facebook: 'Gandhi-Bot is best. Keep the craft up. 'I'm an Indian and proud to drive five hours often to [the The New England Brewing Co] just for Bot.' Another added: 'My only problem with your beer is that it is always sold out. Keep up the great work.' On the website Gandhi-Bot is pegged as an intensely hopped double India pale ale with a blend of three varieties of American Hops. It is also described as 'fully vegetarian' and an 'ideal aid . . . for the seeking of truth and love.'","The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut has been slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale .

"A zoo keeper blames himself for a near-death experience with a crocodile which ended with his thumb being ripped off - although he does admit that he has very scant memories of the traumatic event. The owner of the reptile park, Ian Jenkins, was grabbed by a crocodile whilst performing in front of a large crowd,  at Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo near Childers, south of Bundaberg,far north Queensland . In extremely distressing scenes, the 58-year-old was dragged into the pond at which point the four-metre croc ‘Macca’ started a death roll. Thanks to the quick thinking of his fellow worker, Louise Smith, Jenkins escaped with his life. ‘I’m relieved but also so annoyed,' Mr Jenkins told Seven News from hospital after the incident. 'You just don’t get yourself into that situation with a crocodile!' ‘It was just a bit of a brain freeze I think.’ Scroll down for video . Ian Jenkins is recovering in hospital after a near-death experience with a crocodile at his reptile park . This four-metre long crocodile 'Macca' is responsible for the attack - although Mr Jenkins says he is responsible and fellow handler, Louise Smith, agrees that the croc is typically very docile . The hero was Ms Smith, insists she was just doing her job when she distracted Macca to free Jenkins . The people who viewed the terrifying ordeal, including many horrified young children. are still trying to come to grips with the vicious attack. It was a horrific sight during what was meant to be a fun holiday activity for families. Witness Emma Murray Bryant is clearly still in shock, her lip quivering with emotion as she struggles to tell the story of Ian Jenkins’ lucky escape. ‘He kneeled down and put his hat near his nose and the croc snapped and you knew…' Ms Bryant told Seven News. ‘It didn’t look good. Then the croc snapped at him the second time and that’s when he got him.’ She says she keeps replaying the sickening sound of the two ‘snaps’ she heard in mind, reliving the moments that Macca set on his keeper. Mr Jenkins' colleague Louise Smith is humble, explaining that intervening during a crisis is all a part of her job description. It is protocol that a second handler must be at hand during the crocodile show, just in case something doesn’t go to plan. Ian Jenkins (left), the owner of Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo, had his thumb ripped off and suffered head injuries when a crocodile grapped him and took him into the water . Jenkin's thumb was bitten off and also suffered head injuries and was airlifted to hospital in stable condition . Ian Jenkins with crocodile 'Macca' during one of his crocodile shows . She used a stick to repetitively whack the crocodile on the head until he reluctantly 'spat out' her co-worker. ‘I just tried to distract (the crocodile) to give me and Ian a chance to get out of there.’ After his crocodile attack, the 58-year-old was airlifted to Bundaberg Base Hospital, also sporting a head injury. He has since been transferred to Brisbane Hospital and has already undergone hours of surgery to try and reconstruct his mangled hand. It's understood that the ordeal all began when Mr Jenkins attempted to gain the attention of Macca by holding a chicken in his right hand. Instead, Macca caught Jenkins unawares as he lunged at his other hand. A section of his left hand was torn down to the wrist, but the modest animal-lover supposedly apologised profusely to the paramedics for 'causing such a fuss'. It is understood the man was visiting the Snakes Downunder Reptile Park and Zoo near Childers in Queensland .

He has been a much-loved member of the Childers community for more than 30 years. Photo by Time Travel Turtle . This is far from his first serious injury inflicted on the job. Five years ago, Mr Jenkins survived an eastern brown snake bite, which left him fighting for his life. He was also bitten by a king brown in 2003 and two black snakes before that. In January 2010, he was preparing an eastern brown snake for an educational show when he was bitten through a bag, causing the father to collapse and lose consciousness. The then 51-year-old was transported by air to Bundaberg Base Hospital, placed in intensive care and treated with two doses of anti-venom. He was back performing his snake show just hours after discharging himself from hospital. The reptile handler has lived in Australia for around 30 years, after his passion for reptiles was born during his childhood in Kenya, Africa. The victim, Ian Jenkins (second from left, pictured with family) was airlifted to Bundaberg Base Hospital and underwent surgery . He is thoroughly knowledgeable about the scaled critters and his wife Barbara Jenkins insists that her husband does not seek out danger. Rather, his passion for reptiles and his desire to educate people are the motivations behind his career choice, according to his supportive wife, Ms Jenkins. Mr Jenkins previously said that his primary concern is his family and that he hates to cause them distress when he suffers an animal-inflicted injury. It was business as usual at the park the day after the attack, bar the crocodile feeding shows - although they are planned to continue as soon as Mr Jenkins' injuries are fully heeled and he returns in the ring. Ms Smith insists that Macca is normally very pleasant and calm and this ‘hangry’ outburst was very unlike him. However, they will never forget this very violent wake up call. Paramedics were called to the zoo at 12.55pm local time, a Queensland Ambulance Service spokesman told Daily Mail Australia .

"Paul Cullinan, the voice behind Bungle, will appear on The Voice on Saturday . One of the characters from cult children's show Rainbow has made an unexpected TV comeback on BBC talent show The Voice. Child's entertainer Paul Cullinan played large furry bear Bungle in the classic ITV series, alongside much-loved puppets Zippy and George. But on Saturday, Bungle's alter-ego will reappear on TV for the first time in almost 25 years - as a contestant on the singing show. However, when he reveals to judges that he has previously starred on Rainbow, just one of the four knew what he was talking about. It falls to Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson to explain to his fellow judges - will.i.am, Rita Ora and Sir Tom Jones - that he was 'a slightly camp bear called Bungle'. During the audition, due to air on Saturday, Ricky adds: 'There was a guy called Geoffrey who lived in a house with a pink hippo, a thing, I don't know what he was, called Zippy, with a zip for a mouth.' Neither Rita, 24, nor Sir Tom Jones, 74, know anything about the programme. 'I haven't seen it, obviously I had a rubbish childhood,' said the former. will.i.am then grabs his iPad and finds the Rainbow theme tune, encouraging the studio audience to sing along. Cullinan, 48, was the last of three actors to play Bungle in the hit show, which ran from 1972 to 1992. Geoffrey Hayes, now 74, struggled to find work after the show ended and took a job as a shelf stacker before becoming a taxi driver. This year, UKIP's deputy leader Paul Nuttall was also forced to deny that he starred as Bungle in Rainbow after an internet prank. The fourth series of The Voice starts on BBC1 on Saturday. Bungle, Zippy, George and Geoffrey Hayes star in the vintage children's programme, Rainbow . Of the four new judges, only Ricky Wilson recognised the children's programme. American will.i.am (left) was understandably in the dark, while Rits Ora, 24, and Sir Tom Jones (right), said they didn't remember it . David Cook (presenter) Cook, 74, presented the first and second series of Rainbow. He went on to write two novels about a boy with learning disabilities called Walter. A radio play in 2009 saw Walter become a pensioner. Geoffrey Hayes (presenter) Hayes, 72, who joined Rainbow in the third series, found it difficult to find work after the show was dropped by ITV in 1992 - and even stacked supermarket shelves, before becoming a taxi driver. John Leeson (Bungle) Leeson is best known for voicing K-9 in Doctor Who in the 1970s and 1980s. He has since voiced the character again in various spin-offs, and has also served as a magistrate. He is now 71. With Bungle: David Cook, who is now aged 74, presented the first and second series of Rainbow . Rainbow stars: Geoffrey Hayes (left, a presenter from series three) and John Leeson (right, Bungle) Stanley Bates (Bungle) Bates, who played Bungle from 1973 to 1988, was bound over to keep the peace by magistrates in 2001 after appearing on a charge of assaulting a mother in a 'road rage' incident. At the time of the court case he was said to have become a self-employed lighting manufacturer. He is now 73. Malcolm Lord (Bungle) Lord, 59, who worked on Rainbow from 1980 to 1989, has recently performed on stage in Aladdin, Dick Whittington and Calendar Girls. He is actively involved in his local community in Shropshire. Stanley Bates (left) was Bungle between 1973 and 1988, while the late Peter Hawkins (right) was Zippy .

Peter Hawkins (Zippy) Policeman's son Hawkins, who also voiced the Daleks in Doctor Who, died aged 82 in July 2006 – but was perhaps most well-known for his gibberish language in Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men. Roy Skelton (Zippy and George) Skelton also voiced the Daleks in Doctor Who from 1967 to 1988, as well as the Cybermen and the Krotons. He also wrote many of the scripts for Rainbow.

"Denied: Amal Clooney said she was warned by Egyptian officials that she risked arrest before she took on the case of three Al Jazeera journalists . Amal Clooney has denied claims that she was threatened with arrest by Egyptian officials over her work representing three Al Jazeera journalists. According to a Guardian report last week, the human rights lawyer was warned after presenting a report identifying cracks in the judiciary that led to the conviction of three Al Jazeera journalists last year. On Sunday, Mrs Clooney clarified that the warning came in early 2014  - months before she took on the case - when officials said publishing a report could lead to her arrest. The International Bar Association moved the report's launch from Cairo to London as a result. Writing in an op-ed for the Huffington Post - which calls for the release of detained reporter Mohamed Fahy - Mrs Clooney wrote: 'The journalist has since apologized for the misleading presentation of this matter in the article and corrections were made to the text to attempt to address this.' Her words come after Egypt's interior ministry spokesman Hani Abdel Latif denied the allegations from Mrs Clooney, demanding she reveal who threatened her. 'She should say exactly who said that,' Abdel Latif said. 'Why not specify from the start who told her that?' 'We have nothing against her,' he said. Mrs Clooney's report, which was written before she became involved in the Al-Jazeera case, was considered highly controversial for its criticisms of Egypt's courts. Speaking to The Guardian after the Al Jazeera journalists' appeal hearing this week, she said: 'When I went to launch the report, first of all they stopped us from doing it in Cairo. 'They said ""does the report criticise the army, the judiciary, or the government?"" We said ""well, yes"". They said ""well then, you're risking arrest"".' The report, compiled on behalf of the International Bar Association, suggested Egypt's judicial system was insufficiently independent. It highlighted the fact that officials in the ministry of justice have too much power over judges and the government too much control over public prosecutors. Mrs Clooney, who recently married Hollywood star George Clooney, and her team recommended the practice that allows Egyptian officials to handpick judges for particular cases must stop. She added: 'That recommendation wasn't followed, and we've seen the results of that in this particular case where you had a handpicked panel led by a judge who is known for dispensing brutal verdicts.' The three Al Jazeera journalists represented by Mrs Clooney are Peter Greste, Baher Mohamed, and Mohamed Fahmy. The group was initially sentenced to between seven and ten years in prison last June by the controversial Egyptian judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata. Scroll down for video . Stuck in jail: The three Al Jazeera journalists represented by Mrs Clooney (L-R) Baher Mohamed,  Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste . 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial . Mr Shehata earned global notoriety during the journalists' trial after mocking Mr Fahmy's fiancee and rarely removing his sunglasses during proceedings. A few months later he gained further infamy after sentencing 188 people to death in one mass trial. The three journalists launched a new appeal yesterday - but Mrs Clooney suggested she fears the flaws highlighted in her report will prevent the group from receiving a fair trial. The men have been held since December 2013 - with their arrests coming after the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member. One of the defendants, Baher Mohamed, hold an Egyptian passport - and must pin his hopes on his sentence being overturned by the Egyptian courts. But Clooney's other clients, Mr Fahmy, a Canadian citizen, and his Australian colleague Mr Greste, are still hoping for deportation to their home countries. Both have applied to Egypt's chief prosecutor to demand they be sent to Canada and Australia  under the terms of a new presidential decree that gives foreign prisoners such an option. Inside Egypt, Mr Fahmy's appeals team was led by an Egyptian lawyer with contributions from Clooney that related to international law - but outside the country she is the one leading the efforts to win deportation.

"Two prospects from the U.S. Ski Team were killed in an avalanche Monday while skiing near their European training base in the Austrian Alps. The U.S. ski team said Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, died in the incident near the Rettenbach glacier near Soelden, the venue for the annual season-opening World Cup races. Berlack, from Franconia, New Hampshire, and Astle, from Sandy, Utah, were part of a group of six skiers who were descending from the 3,056-meter Gaislachkogel when they left the prepared slope and apparently set off the avalanche. The other four skied out of the slide and escaped unhurt. Scroll down for video . Avalanche: Ronnie Berlack, left, was from New Hampshire and has died aged 20. Bryce Astle, 19, was from Utah . Young: Berlack, 20, stopped skiing in early 2014 because of a knee injury, but returned to racing over the summer . Promising: Astle was the top-performing junior skier at the U.S. Alpine Championships in Squaw Valley last March . Officials in the Tyrolean region said an avalanche alert had been declared for the area after days of heavy snowfall and mild temperatures. U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association President and CEO Tiger Shaw said: 'Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport — both on the race course and skiing the mountain. 'Our hearts go out to the Berlack and Astle families, as well as to their extended sport family. Both of them loved what they did and conveyed that to those around them.' Berlack grew up racing in New Hampshire and had been a student-athlete at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy. He was named to the so-called development team for potential World Cup racers following two top-20 finishes at the 2013 U.S. national championships and a spring tryout camp. According to a ski team profile he came 11th in downhill and 17th in the 'super G' slalom race. Off-piste: The two athletes, along with four others, were skiing off of marked trails on the Rettenback glacier, shown above in early winter, when the avalanche struck . The deaths took place after an avalanche on the Rettenbach glacier (marked above) in the Tyrol area of Austria, near its borders with Italy and Switzerland . He injured his knee in January 2014, but competed through the summer and raced in Chile and Canada before heading to Europe. He was off to a strong season last year before suffering a knee injury last January. He had come back, competing in South American Cup races in Chile this summer and in NorAm and FIS races last month in Canada. Astle was invited to train with the development team this season after strong early season results, including two top-10 results last month in Canada. In a championship race at Squaw Valley, California, he came 13th in the giant slalom and was the top-performing junior racer. At the NorAm Cup in Canada last month he finished on the podium in all but two events, ski officials said. Snow slide: The skiers had been taking an unmarked route down the Rettenbach glacier while it was covered in fresh, heavy snows (not seen in the picture above) Ski base: The two athletes died on a glacier near Soelden, Austria, the U.S. team's long-time base (file photo) The disaster has left the U.S. ski team 'in shock,' Alpine director Patrick Riml told said in Zagred, Croatia, where the American slalom team was preparing for a night race on Tuesday. 'We are all very close,' said Riml, an Austrian who was born and grew up in Soelden. 'We train a lot in Park City. We'll see how they handle the whole thing and how they react.' Riml added 'it's a shock for everybody. Two great boys, great athletes, good skiers. They were fun to have around. We are all in shock, still. It's very tragic.'

"A senator's town hall meeting in Portland, Oregon was called off early on Saturday after anti-police and minimum-wage-hike protesters shouted down a 100-year-old U.S. Navy veteran's medal ceremony, . Shouting 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'I can't breathe,' more than 100 mostly African-American activists jousted verbally with hecklers from the audience who were assembled for a dialog with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden – and to honor Dario Raschio. When the ensuing chaos reached a fever pitch, the centenarian Raschio took the microphone to scold the protesters. 'Give me a chance,' the soft-spoken vet said. 'Let's show a little respect for this occasion.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT: Protesters stormed into Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden's town hall meeting Saturday in Portland, refusing to leave and eventually shutting the event down . Wyden planned to honor 100-year-old Dario Raschio and tweeted that he was pleased 'to present my neighbor with long-overdue medals he earned in WWII' 'I'LL BUST YOUR JAW, OLD MAN!': One activist (right) threatened to harm a campus public safety officer if protesters weren't allowed inside . 'God bless America. And you people who are here for a cause, whatever it might be – show respect to Senator Wyden,' he urged, bringing an eruption of applause from the audience. But the boisterous chants grew so loud – including shouts for a $15 minimum wage and the end of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East – that the meeting was disbanded 45 minutes after it was scheduled to begin. Raschio's medal presentation was the only part of the day's agenda that actually happened. The senator awarded him the U.S. Naval Aviator Badge, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the ""Ruptured Duck"" award and the U.S. Navy Honorable discharge pin. He also received a flag that was flown over the U.S Capitol in Washington, D.C. Wyden never got a chance to conduct his planned question-and-answer session with the public. NOT AMUSED: The audience sat and watched the drama unfold but never got to ask the senator any questions after the meeting was hijacked . But the liberal stalwart seemed unperturbed, telling The Oregonian that 'the symbolism of having a veteran, 100 years old, who fought so gallantly so that those who disagree with government policies and want to exercise their First Amendment rights could be heard – that's what made today so poignant.' Wyden is a far-left politician who has leveraged organized protesters in the past to help him pass legislation. Following the downfall of the 'Stop Online Piracy Act' in 2012, Wyden cited 'massive protests' and a 'grassroots victory for the history books' as the main reason for his success in blocking the bill. Activists in every U.S. state have shouted 'Hands up, don't shoot' during demonstrations opposing the fatal shooting of black 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in August. 'I can't breathe,' another rallying cry,' were the last words uttered by Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in July at the hands of a New York City police officer trying to subdue him. Campus public safety officers attempted to keep some of the protesters outside the building at Portland Community College, drawing threats from one of them. 'I'll bust your jaw, old man!' he shouted in an exchange caught on video. BEFUDDLED: An annoyed Sen. Wyden stood and watched as his event disintegrated at the hands of protesters whose politics he shares . 'MIC CHECK!' This protest leader organized her followers with chants drawn from the infamous 'Occupy Wall Street' encampments . Another argued with security, who asked if there was 'a possible way that we could get on with the meeting.' 'No,' she said. 'We're taking over the town hall. This is our town hall now. ... it belongs to the black people.' On Saturday, two protesters never made it to the event. Katharine Moore, 36, and Malcolm Chaddock, 51, were cuffed and booked after they refused to obey police commands to stop blocking traffic while protesting outside. They were charged with second-degree disorderly conduct. Wyden, Oregon's senior senator, has said he wants to hold a town hall meeting in every one of Oregon's 36 counties – this year, and every year. OPB News reports that he has convened more than 700 such meetings so far.","Activists shouted down Navy veteran Dario Raschio in his moment of honor at event hosted by Oregon Democratic Sen.

"More than 70 newly elected lawmakers will make their debut on Capitol Hill this week as the 114th session of Congress begins. The House will welcome 58 freshmen representatives this week, including 43 Republicans and 15 Democrats, pushing the GOP majority to 246 members, the most since the Great Depression. In the Senate, 13 new lawmakers, all but one of them Republican, will be sworn in, flipping control of the chamber to the GOP with a 54-vote majority. In this Aug. 27, 2014 photo Republican Rep.-elect Elise Stefanik,  is seen in Ballston Spa, New York. Stefanik, 30, is the youngest woman to take the oath of office in Congress . Rep.-elect Mia Love of Utah walks on Capitol Hill in Washington in this photo take in November days after she won election to Congress. Love will become the first black woman to represent Republicans in the legislative body when she is sworn in tomorrow . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, center, with newly-elected Republican members of the Senate before a meeting at his offices in the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Nov. 12, 2014. From left they are: David Perdue, Cory Gardner, Ben Sasse, Mike Rounds, Joni Ernst, McConnell, Shelley Moore Capito, James Lankford, Tom Cotton, Thom Tillis and Steve Daines. Capito and Ernst were the first women elected to the Senate from their states . The incoming classes will bring new gender and racial diversity to Capitol Hill, with 104 women in the House and Senate and close to 100 black, Hispanic and Asian lawmakers. The newcomers include the youngest woman elected to Congress, 30-year-old Elise Stefanik of New York, and the first black Republican woman, Mia Love of Utah. Stefanik, a Republican, is one of several young members bringing fresh blood to Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers, especially senators, are in their 70s or even older. Others are Democrats Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who is 36, and Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who's 35. The three all graduated from Harvard University and have friends in common, Gallego said. Gallego said the three have already discussed areas of cooperation, such as infrastructure investments and bringing down the cost of college. 'We have talked actually a lot, and I can definitely see us working together. 'We all want the same things in the general scheme of things — a stable country, a prosperous future. We may not agree 100 percent on how to get there, but I think Democrats and Republicans do want to find a way,' he said. As the new members prepared to arrive on Capitol Hill, several said they brought hopes of curbing the often partisan atmosphere in Washington, showing the public that they really can govern and, just maybe, getting Congress' approval rating back up past 20 percent. 'This election was not an endorsement of either party, it was a condemnation of, yes, the president's policies, but also of government dysfunction,' said GOP Rep.-elect Carlos Curbelo, who defeated a Democratic incumbent in Florida. 'I hope we can be different. ... I hope we focus on getting things done,' he said. Rep.-elect Carlos Curbelo, left does a television interview on Capitol Hill in Washington during freshman orientation in Washington. To the right is Rep.-elect Ruben Gallego, speaking in Phoenix, Arizona. Curbelo will be one of 10 Hispanic Republicans serving in the next Congress. Gallego, a Democrat, will be one of the youngest Members of Congress at age 35 . Rep.-elect Debbie Dingell, pictured here during an election night rally in Detroit, Michigan, is replacing her husband, John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress, who retired last year after nearly 60 years of service . Two of the newcomers to Congress are not new to Washington at all. In Michigan, Democrat Debbie Dingell is replacing her husband, John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress, who retired last year after nearly 60 years of service. Republican Barbara Comstock is replacing her onetime boss, outgoing Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, whom she served as a top aide and chief counsel on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee before joining the Virginia House of Delegates. Dingell and Comstock are friendly and have spoken about how they can collaborate and improve relations and policy making on Capitol Hill. 'People don't get to know each other, and that relationship-building and that sense of trust and knowing each other is part of what's missing,' said Dingell, who wrote a master's thesis on civility in Congress. 'And we've got to find ways for people to get to know each other and talk.' Comstock, who has started a women's leadership initiative in Virginia, said she, Dingell and other female lawmakers have met together and hope to forge coalitions. 'Debbie has been a great leader on her side and she knows Washington also so I think we will probably team up,' Comstock said. Although they're from different parties, 'Sometimes people get caught up in the labels. Good ideas are good ideas.' Rep.-elect Barbara Comstock is seen at her election night party in Ashburn, Virginia. While new to Capitol Hill as a Member of Congress, Comstock is not new Washington, D.C. Her district is located just outside the nation's capitol and she once worked for the representative she is replacing, Republican Frank Wolf . In this Oct. 29, 2014 photo, then-Massachusetts Democratic Congressional candidate, now Rep.-elect Seth Moulton, waves as he arrives at a campaign event in Lynn, Massachusetts. Moulton, 36, is one of 15 new Democrats elected to the House in November's elections . GOP lawmakers in the House and Senate remain overwhelmingly white and male, but some of the new Republican arrivals break that mold. In addition to Stefanik and Comstock, both women, and Curbelo, who is Hispanic, the GOP now claims two black House members, Love and Will Hurd of Texas. There is also one black senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, 10 Hispanic House members and two Hispanic senators - Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. There are 22 Republican women in the House and six in the Senate. The newcomers could add diversity of ideas to the Republican conference. Curbelo said he would push House GOP leaders to support immigration overhaul legislation, something the party has resisted. 'Of course as a freshman our influence is limited but we can work within our class, our freshman class to build support,' Curbelo said. A number of the new arrivals have also served in the military, something that has become increasingly rare on Capitol Hill. Moulton and Gallego both served with the Marines in Iraq, while another incoming freshman, Republican Lee Zeldin of New York, served with the Army there. Republican Sen.-elect Joni Ernst of Iowa is an Iraq War veteran and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard. Republican Rep.-elect Martha McSally of Arizona is a retired Air Force colonel and the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat. She told Fox News Sunday that military veterans bring a problem-solving perspective. 'We're very solution-oriented, we're very pragmatic,' McSally said Sunday. 'You can't be in the war you want to be in, you got to be in the war you're in, and you got to just get the job done.'","The House will welcome 58 freshmen representatives, including 43 Republicans and 15 Democrats.

"Adrian Lubecki, 19, has been accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy linked to four deaths . This is the teenager accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy tablets that have been linked to four separate deaths. Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich in Suffolk, appeared before magistrates this morning charged with supplying the red triangular drugs believed to have led to the deaths of four people. The teenager was remanded in custody as his case was referred to Crown Court. It comes after four men  died after taking ecstasy tablets stamped with an 'S' symbol, police believe. A fifth man was taken to hospital on New Year's Day and is making a recovery. The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day. The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - who died hours after Mr Hocking, is also believed to have been connected. All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman 'S' logo. A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation. Officers have offered amnesty to anyone prepared to hand in the tablets for testing in a desperate bid to get them off the streets. They are thought to contain a high amount of PMMA, often found in non-pure ecstasy. The chemical has prolonged effects, prompting some drug users to take double the amount they would normally if consuming MDMA-based ecstasy. Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths. The teenager has been accused of supplying a drug linked to the deaths of four men in the Ipswich area . Labourer, John Hocking, 20, (left) died after taking the drug on New Year's Eve while Lithuanian factory worker, Justas Ropas, was found dead on Christmas Eve at the house he shares with friends in Ipswich . The reddish tablets are embossed with an 'S' Superman logo and come in either a round or triangular shape . 'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them. 'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.' Meanwhile, Suffolk Police said a man arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Ipswich town centre earlier today became unwell and told officers he had taken a 'Superman' pill. He was taken to Ipswich Hospital but has since been discharged. Chief Superintendent Jon Brighton said: 'It is concerning that we have another report of a member of the public requiring medical treatment after taking a pill of the same description already under investigation. 'I would like to re-emphasise the messages we have given out so far - if anyone is in possession of these distinctive looking pills, please do not take them or pass them on, please hand them in to police or one of the other agencies listed. 'Our number one priority is to remove these drugs from our communities and prevent any further harm.' Police believe the deaths of the three men in Ipswich may be linked after they were called to three addresses across the town in the space of one week (pictured) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Adrian Lubecki, 19, has been accused of supplying the lethal drug .

"It was one small step for little Georgie Craig… but a giant leap forward for him and his family. The three-year-old was born with a condition that left him with movement problems and unable to communicate properly. But thanks to a special ‘space suit’, he is making great strides towards overcoming his difficulties and learning to make his way in the world. Georgie Craig, who suffers from a condition that left him with movement problems, is able to walk thanks to a special 'space suit' Baby steps: The three-year-old's parents feared Georgie might never walk until they found the specialist therapy not offered by the NHS . His parents Naomi Jamieson, 30, and Dean Craig, 28, a steel worker, feared Georgie, who has global development delay, might never walk. They had almost given up hope until they began researching specialist therapies on the internet not offered by the NHS. They discovered the TheraSuit, an assemblage of yellow rubber cords pioneered in Russia in the early 1970s to counteract the muscle wastage which astronauts experienced during long trips in space because of the lack of gravity. It was later developed in America by therapists Izabela and Richard Koscielny, who have a daughter with cerebral palsy, as a way of helping disabled children gain the strength and endurance needed for movement. It works by retraining the body to correct movement and reflexes. All the elements of the suit are connected with each other through the system of rubber cords and therapists can adjust it to hold the body in proper physical alignment. Georgie had his first block of £5,000-a-month therapy using the suit, which also has knee pads, over the festive period at Therapy in Praxis centre in Harrogate, North Yorkshire - and to his parents’ delight has now taken 11 steps in a row. After Georgie was born with global development delay, his parents Naomi Jamieson, 30, and Dean Craig, 28, thought he may never walk . Thanks to the yellow TheraSuit (left), used by astronauts to tackle muscle wastage experienced in space because of the lack of gravity, Georgie can take 11 unaided steps . Miss Jamieson, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, said just to be told by the therapists there was hope Georgie would walk was ‘amazing’. She said: ‘When all of this started we had no idea what would happen with Georgie, but to hear a specialist tell us that she was sure Georgie would walk - that was just massive for us. ‘When he was in the suit on Christmas Eve he took 11 unaided steps. It was the best Christmas present we could have ever hoped for and it really was a miracle.’ Miss Jamieson, also mother to Freya Craig, one, and Josh Jamieson, 12, added: ‘Georgie’s condition affects all parts of his development so the therapy has been targeting all areas. ‘It’s all through play therapy so he doesn’t realise he’s doing any work. ‘Wearing the specialised suit is the equivalent of running a marathon. After he has been in the suit for a few minutes, connections have been made in his brain so he knows what muscles to use.’ Georgie had his first block of £5,000-a-month therapy using the suit over the Christmas period . Georgie's mother said just to be told by the therapists there was hope her son would walk was ‘amazing’ Georgie began the therapy last month and has been doing four days a week for three hours a day. His family has been fundraising to pay for it with their ‘Go Georgie Go’ campaign. They have raised £7,000 and have set a target of £20,000 for further blocks of treatment. Full-time carer Miss Jamieson said: ‘We just want to give him a better quality of life, and for one day to hold a conversation with him. ‘Because of his condition, I have to second guess everything - it’s literally 24/7 care with him. But he’s so determined, you can see the poor little thing get stressed and as his mum, you just want to make him better.’","Georgie Craig was born with a condition that left him unable to walk .

"A teetotal mother-of-two is suing a novelty company after her high school graduation photo was used on a hip flask alongside the phrase: 'I'm going to be the most popular girl in rehab.' Church-goer Veronica Vigil from Chimayó, New Mexico, has filed a lawsuit against Anne Taintor Inc. after they used the image taken in the 1970s without her permission. Her attorneys claim the product is defamatory as she does not consume alcohol or drugs and is an invasion of her privacy, according to court documents. Angry: Church-goer Veronica Vigil from Chimayó, New Mexico, has filed a lawsuit against Anne Taintor Inc after they used a picture of her at her high school graduation from the 1970s on this  flask without permission . The complaint, obtained by the Santa Fe New Mexican, says: 'Given the seriousness of the issues of substance abuse in the community in which plaintiff resides, she has held herself out by reputation for her children and her community, to refrain from abuse or even use of alcohol and illicit drugs and has set an example that the issue is a very serious one that destroys families and lives.' The document adds that the use of the image has lead some people to believe that she has a problem with substance abuse - causing her to be the subject of 'scorn and contempt'. It is unknown what school she graduated from, but her lawyers claim it is either Española High School or Pojoaque High School. Mrs Vigil, who has two grown sons and runs an auto-repair shop with her husband in Chimayó, became aware of the flask when her daughter came across it while vacationing in Florida. The product was not listed on Taintor’s website Friday, but it was being offered on Amazon for prices ranging from $21.95 to $25.29. Case: She is suing Anne Taintor Inc (screenshot of website left), owned by the Havard University graduate (right), claiming the use of her picture is defamatory as she does not drink or do drugs . Blair Dunn, Mrs Vigil's attorney said Doodlet’s - a Santa Fe toy store and gift shop that has been in business since 1955 -  is also named in the complaint because the store has sold the flask and  other Taintor. They have claimed they should not be involved in the suit as they have never sold the flask with Mrs Vigil's face on it. Mr Dunn added that other New Mexico outlets, including Talin Market in Albuquerque and Costco, also have carried products with Vigil’s image . The company was started by Havard University graduate Anne Taintor in 1985 with the motto: 'Making smart people smile.' They create products including tea towels, mugs, calendars and phone cases with photos of women posing alongside sarcastic slogans. 'It’s okay, I didn’t want a real life anyway' and 'Make your own damn dinner' are among those that have been used. The suit charges Taintor with defamation, invasion of privacy and unfair trade practices, seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. For sale: The product was taken down from Anne Taintor's website, but was still listed on Amazon for $25 .

"Staff at a San Francisco restaurant got a pleasant New Year's surprise when a customer left a $2,000 tip in the latest in a series of 'Tips for Jesus'. A diner at Tacolicious left the gratuity after paying a bill of just $50.74 on January 2. A photograph of the receipt was then posted to the 'Tips for Jesus' Instagram account. Happy New Year: The substantial tip left at San Francisco restaurant Tacolicious on January 2 . Staff at the Tacolicious restaurant on Valencia Street would each get a share of the generous tip . The generous gesture follows one in Arizona on December 27, where a $11,000 tip was left on a bill of just $420, with a note saying 'Tips for Jesus'. A staff member at Tacolicious told Sfgate the tipper 'comes in here all the time and he's amazing. Amazing to the staff'. The restaurant worker said the gratuity would be shared among the staff. Many suspect the person behind the Tips for Jesus phenomenon is the former Vice-President of PayPal, Jack Selby. It has previously been reported that the Tips for Jesus tippers are a collective of wealthy people. 'Tips for Jesus' is believed to refer to the anonymous person - or people - who regularly leave extravagant tips at restaurants and document their recipients' joy on an Instagram page. The page, which has more than 84,000 followers, features the slogan: 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.' It typically features restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, as well as Phoenix. In the Arizona incident, an unidentified man initially left a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill for drinks and snacks he had shared with a woman at Crudo restaurant. A welcome surprise: A mystery customer has lifted the spirits of three Arizona-based restaurant workers after leaving around $11,000 worth of 'Tips for Jesus' two days after Christmas. Above, the tipper's receipts . Amazed: Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three servers who received the tips at Crudo restaurant in Phoenix, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, saying: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!! Unbelievable!' Bartender: The unidentified customer arrived at the restaurant in Phoenix at 10pm on December 27 and shared a post-dinner snack and a round of drinks with a woman, it is said. Above, Mr Spotleson . Venue: He then closed the tab at the restaurant (pictured), leaving a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill, before they both stayed for further drinks. When they later paid off the second $89.89 tab, the man added a $10,000 tip . The pair then stayed on further and when the man closed the second tab for $89.99, he left another tip of $10,000. Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three Crudo servers who received the tips, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, writing: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!!!! Unbelievable!!!' On both of the receipts, the words, 'Tips for Jesus', were scrawled in pen by the customer. Speaking to AOL, Mr Spotleson said he, another bartender and a cocktail waitress shared the $11,000 combined tip, but also chose to give some of it to Crudo's kitchen staff. Describing his reaction to the customer's estimated 2,500-per-cent tip, he added: 'I dropped everything I had and just froze for second.... I had a bottle in my hand when he said it. 'It was a quick slip, but I caught it. The owner kind of gave me this look like, ""Oh, my gosh, wow!"".' Maureen Campbell, one of Crudo's partners, told ABC News that although the tipper wished to remain anonymous, he did stick around long enough to allow the restaurant workers to thank him. Generous: 'Tips for Jesus' is believed to refer to the anonymous person - or people - who regularly leave extravagant tips at restaurants and document their recipients' joy on a dedicated Instagram page (pictured) 'That's amazing!': Members of the public responded positively to the anonymous customer's generous tip . 'He did hand them the check before he left and they were very grateful for such a generous amount of money they received,' she said. 'I don’t know what his response was.' She added that the woman who had accompanied the man was believed by staff to be his date. The customer, who was using an American Express card, apparently left a tip at the same restaurant last year. However, it was for a lower - still, generous - amount of $2,500. Describing the tipper, Mr Spotleson said: 'He's a man ... He's in an age group where he's not old and rackety, but he's definitely got the ability to spend that kind of money.'","The tip will be shared among the staff at the Tacolicious restaurant .

"Labour frontbencher Ed Balls today dismissed Russell Brand as a 'pound-shop Ben Elton' after the comedian labelled him a 'clicky-wristed snidey c***'. The war of words erupted at the weekend, when Brand used an appearance on Channel 4's Big Fat Anniversary Quiz to take aim at the shadow chancellor. Balls today hit back, insisting Jo Brand was funnier and questioning whether Brand was trying to be funny or offensive. Scroll down for video . Comedian Russell Brand tore into Labour's Ed Balls on the Channel 4 show, The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz . Brand launched his foul-mouthed attack in the show, broadcast on Friday night, in which he also warned Balls and former Prime Minister Tony Blair that they faced a tough time when his planned revolution overthrows the political establishment. When asked by MailOnline yesterday, a spokesman for Balls declined to comment. But today the Labour bruiser hit back, telling BBC News: 'I wasn't quite sure what it meant to be honest. I'm not quite sure what clicky-wristed means. 'I don't know whether that's supposed to be offensive or funny or whatever.' He went on to liken him to Ben Elton, the writer and comedian who built a reputation for left-wing stand-up in the 1980s. Ed Balls dismissed Russell Brand as a 'pound-shop Ben Elton' (left) and suggested he thought Jo Brand (right) was funnier . Ed Balls told BBC News: 'I wasn't quite sure what it meant to be honest. I'm not quite sure what clicky-wristed means.' Balls added: 'I think probably Jo Brand is a rather better political commentator. I suppose you could call him a pound shop Ben Elton. But it doesn't mean he's not sometimes funny.' He later told Sky News: 'I think he was funnier before he tried to do politics. Maybe it shows that being a funny politician is not very easy to do. 'I thought this reference to me having clicky-wrists; I wasn't quite sure whether he was having a go at my sexuality or whether he was just trying to claim that I had a disability. 'Either way, I thought it was a bit off. He's normally funnier than that.' Brand was appearing on the show alongside other comedians including Noel Fielding, Jonathan Ross, Jack Whitehall and Claudia Winkleman. It included questions about the last 10 years, and in one round teams were asked about an infamous tweet which Balls sent which simply stated: 'Ed Balls.' Between questions Whitehall asked Brand about the Labour MP's prospects if he gets his way and overthrows democracy. Whitehall asked: 'Ed Balls, Russell, after the revolution?' Brand replied: 'I think it's gonna be a tough time for Ed Balls.' He went on: 'I shook his hand once. All clicky wristed, he was a snidey c***.' Fellow guests including Whitehall and Winkleman appeared visible shocked by the foul-mouthed slur. The quiz, hosted by Jimmy Carr, had asked what Mr Balls had tweeted in 2011 which had been retweeted thousands of times . Referring to Brand's confrontation last year with Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, Whitehall added: 'Why didn't you say that in the Paxman interview?' Host Jimmy Carr said 'all clicky wrists' sounded like something from dystopian crime drama A Clockwork Orange. Brand went on, inspired by the film's Nadsat slang: 'All clickly wrist he were, real horror show. Me and my droogies done him in. Did him good it did as he spilt his claret like silvery wine.' Whitheall, appearing baffled, responded: 'It sounds wonderful but I am going to have to have it Google translated to posh.' The question in the quiz related to the tweet posted by Mr Balls on April 28 2011 which just said: 'Ed Bals.' In April 2011 Mr Balls posted just 'Ed Balls', which sparked a Twitter frenzy and led to April 28 being named Ed Balls Day . It has since been retweeted more than 30,000 times. As Carr gave the answer to the question, Brand responded: 'What a prick, clicky wrist prick.' Earlier in the show Brand suggested Mr Blair would also be in trouble when his revolution came. He has argued that there is little point in voting and insisted 'profit' is a dirty word. In 2013 Brand launched similar verbal assault on David Cameron, calling the Tory Prime Minister a 'w*****'. He told Alan Carr's Chatty Man: 'If you're always cutting benefits and being horrible, it's because you don't know how to f*** properly. 'I think if your job is to look after the country and you don't care about the people who need it most, you're out of order, and you're a filthy, dirty, posh w*****.' A spokesman for Mr Balls declined to comment.","Shadow chancellor Ed Balls hits back at comedian's foul-mouthed rant .

"She's the daughter of Hollywood royalty but now Dylan Penn's becoming a star in her own right, as the face of an Italian fashion label. Stunning Dylan, who bears a close resemblance to her actress mother Robin Wright, is the face of Ermanno Scervino's spring/summer 2015 campaign. The 23-year-old, whose father is Sean Penn, was cast in the California-inspired ads for her classic 'American beauty' looks, the designer said. Scroll down for video . Dylan Penn was snapped up for the Ermanno Scervino spring/summer 2015 campaign for her American looks . The 23-year-old starred in the California-inspired photos, shot in a Tuscan house by the Mediterranean sea . 'Dylan is a young, beautiful woman, conscious of her background and close to her family,' said the designer . Ermanno Scervino described Dylan as a 'contemporary beauty' and 'young, glamorous and international'. As the daughter of reformed bad boy Sean and  the House Of Cards star it's no wonder Dylan possesses arresting looks. 'Dylan is a young, beautiful woman, conscious of her background and close to her family but also very independent and determined to succeed in her own professional career,' said the designer. The campaign was shot in Tuscany by renowned Italian photographer Francesco Carrozzini. The shoot took place in a private villa on the coast of Tuscany with the Mediterranean sea as a backdrop. Yet the interior design of the location was intended to evoke California in the Seventies, a look that's echoed in Dylan's loose blonde waves, smoky eyes and natural make-up. Dylan Penn has clearly inherited her mother, Forrest Gump actress, Robin Wright's classic blonde beauty . Dylan may be the daughter of actors but her parents cut her off financially at the age of 18, forcing her to make her own way. After jobs as a pizza delivery girl, and a freelance screenplay editor, she fell into modelling. Speaking about growing up in a nothern California town, she told Treats magazine, 'I don't deny that I had a very privileged upbringing but my parents and that town maintained a sense of normalcy that I think many people find hard to achieve and I am so grateful for that.' Since finalising their divorce in 2010, Sean Penn, 54, has since been in a relationship with actress and model Charlize Theron. Robin, 48, was recently engaged to 3:10 To Yuma actor Ben Foster, 34, but the pair split last month.","Model chosen for being 'young, glamorous and international'

"The selloff in global oil markets showed little signs of slowing in the new year with U.S. crude breaking below $50 a barrel, the first time since April 2009, on fears of a supply glut. U.S. crude's front-month contract CLc1 hit $49.81 by the time markets closed, a dip of $2.88 or 5.47 per cent, in a single day. Benchmark Brent crude tumbled about 6 percent, hitting new 5-1/2 year lows after data showed Russian oil output at post-Soviet era highs and Iraqi oil exports at near 35-year peaks. The dip in oil prices caused shockwaves on Wall Street, where the Dow index had plunged 330 points by the time markets closed, shedding 1.85 per cent of its total value. Tumble: One U.S. oil future price hit $49.95 today before climbing slightly. Pictured above is a crude oil tanker outside a harbor in Singapore . U.S. driller ConocoPhillips added to the bearish sentiment somewhat, announcing it had struck first oil at a Norwegian North Sea project. 'There's no doubt that we have a combination of supplies hitting their zenith at a time when demand is weakening,' said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Front-month Brent LCOc1 hovered at $53 a barrel, down more than $3, after dropping to $52.66, its lowest since May 2009. Some traders appeared certain that U.S. crude will hit the $40 region later in the week if weekly oil inventory numbers for the United States on Wednesday show another supply build. Dip: Oil prices, shown above, hit their lowest level since the depths of the financial crisis . Downward-bound: Oil prices have dipped sharply since the middle of 2014 . 'We're headed for a four-handle,' said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in Laurel Hollow in New York. 'Maybe not today, but I'm sure when you get the inventory numbers that come out this week, we definitely will.' Open interest for $40-$50 strike puts in U.S. crude have risen several fold since the start of December, while $20-$30 puts for June 2015 have traded, said Stephen Schork, editor of Pennsylvania-based The Schork Report. Other indexes on Wall Street were also hit hard by the price drop. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,024. The Nasdaq composite fell 56 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,671. Energy companies had the worst declines in the S&P 500 index. Denbury Resources and Noble Energy each lost 9 percent. Russia's oil output hit a post-Soviet high last year, averaging 10.58 million barrels per day (bpd), up 0.7 percent thanks to small non-state producers, Energy Ministry data showed. Iraq's oil exports were at their highest since 1980 in December, an oil ministry spokesman said, with record sales from the country's southern terminals. The Russian and Iraqi data overshadowed reports of drops in Libya's oil output due to conflict. Libya's oil output has fallen to around 380,000 bpd after the closure of the OPEC producer's biggest oil port Es Sider, along with another oil port Ras Lanuf.","Price of U.S. crude hit  $49.81 before midday today - lowest since April 2009 .

"When CNN launched 34 years ago, founder Ted Turner vowed that the station would broadcast the news 24 hours a day until the end of the world. Therefore, anticipating that at one point the apocalypse would come, he is believed to have created a segment that would be shown as the cable channel signed off for the final time. The clip that would supposedly be played to the last people watching the station is a minute-long version of the 19th century hymn 'Nearer my God to thee' performed by the Armed Forces marching bands. According to Jalopnik, it is stored on CNN's MIRA archive and was initially edited to fit on cathode -ray TVs popular in the 1980s. Scroll down for video . The video that CNN will purportedly play at the end of the world is a minute-long version of the 19th century hymn 'Nearer my God to thee' being played by an Armed Forces marching band . It is believed to be stored on CNN's MIRA archive and was initially edited to fit on cathode -ray TVs popular in the 1980s . The file is believed to be kept alongside bold red letters which read: 'HFR (hold for release' till end of the world confirmed.' Michael Ballaban, who was an intern in 2009 for Wolf Blizter's program Situation Room, said he was first told about the video by a college professor who had worked at CNN for 20 years. According to an article he wrote for Jalopnik, he said the clip turned up on a database when he searched for 'Turner Doomsday Video'. He has since managed to get hold of the footage and has posted it online. Rumors of the doomsday tape's existence have been reported many times over the last 25 years. In 1988, it was included in an article published in the New Yorker, and as late as 2001, in the New York Daily News. He told the New Yorker: Normally, when a TV station begins & ends the broacast day, it signs on & off by playing the National Anthem. 'But with CNN - a 24-hour-a day channel - we would only sign off once and I knew what that would mean. So we got the combined Armed Forces marching bands together –the Army, Navy, Marine & Air Force bands–& took them out to the old CNN headquarters & we had them practice the National Anthem for a videotaping. 'Then, as things cranked up, I asked if they'd play ""Nearer My God, to Thee"" to put on videotape just in case the world ever came to an end. That would be the last thing CNN played before we–before we signed off. 'I can't watch this without getting tears in my eyes. 'I keep this tape around because when the world ends it'll be over before we can say what we wanted to say. Before we can leave any final messages.' DailyMail.com have contacted CNN for comment. Born as part of Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System, in 1996 it became a part of Time Warner. In 2000 America Online bought Time Warner for $164 billion, and in 2006 Ted Turner himself left the Time Warner board. In 2009, AOL was spun off from the company it once attempted to dominate. An intern said that he got hold of the video when he searched for it on a database. It is believed to be behind red letters saying: .

"A pilot is being praised for making a successful belly landing after a bird strike led to a landing gear malfunction on approach to Kenya’s capital. The Fokker 50 aircraft, carrying six people, was travelling from Wajir to Nairobi when it struck two marabou storks during take-off. One of the birds became wedged in a landing gear door, forcing the flight crew to make an emergency belly landing at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The pilot of the small plane is being praised for making a successful belly landing in Nairobi . Officials said the left main landing gear failed to extend because it was blocked by the carcass of a bird . No injuries were reported but flights into the international airport – one of the busiest in East Africa – were suspended for hours until the stricken plane was removed with a crane. Flights were diverted to the port city of Mombasa until the runway reopened. Skyward, the plane’s owner, said the flight crew ‘felt a thud’ when the aircraft collided with the birds but did not realise one was wedged in the left main landing gear door. The airline told The Standard: ‘On approaching Nairobi Wilson Airport and extending the landing gear, the nose wheel and the right main landing gear extended, but the left main landing gear did not extend as its door was wedged shut by the remains of the bird. The plane circled over Nairobi to burn off fuel before landing safely at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport . Skyward, the airline that owns the plane, said the aircraft struck two marabou storks during take-off . ‘After extensive trouble shooting and use of the emergency gear extension to lower the gear, the crew realised that nothing could lower the left main landing gear.’ The decision was made to burn off as much fuel as possible and divert to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for a belly landing. Skyward director Emil Arao told The Standard: ‘Our very experienced crew performed a very difficult manoeuvre and undertook a successful belly landing on JKIA's runway 06 at 1102 hours local time with no injuries to anyone both in the aircraft and on the ground.’","Plane struck two birds while taking off at an airport in Wajir, Kenya .

"Clean-cut: But Anders Behring Breivik had terrifyingly extreme views . The sight of Anders Behring Breivik – tall, clean-cut and dressed in a police uniform – must have at first seemed a reassuring presence to the young members of Norway’s governing Labour Party when they encountered him at their summer camp on the island of Utoya. Until the moment he opened fire. Now the 32-year-old who reportedly shot dead at least 85 victims in cold blood, and killed another seven with the Oslo bomb, has emerged as a Right-wing extremist bitterly opposed to Norway’s tradition of open-minded liberalism. His internet postings betray a hatred of multi-culturalism and include offensive references to ‘Somali immigrants with full Norwegian passports’ living off state benefits and sending money home to their Muslim relatives. Little is known about his early life, however, and there is no clue so far as to why he should have resorted to such terrible acts of violence. Breivik is thought to have grown up in comfortable circumstances and until recently lived with his mother Wenche in an affluent Oslo suburb. He studied at the city’s School of Management, which offers degrees and postgraduate courses, but it is not clear what qualification, if any, he obtained. His former landlady in the Skoyen district of the city said last night: ‘I cannot believe he was capable of doing such a thing.’ And a man living in the same block of flats said: ‘He did not appear to be interested in speaking to people and would just walk past neighbours. I got the impression he was a mummy’s boy who did not want to leave home because he had it so good.’ Breivik had no military background beyond the national service all young Norwegians are obliged to undertake. Nor did he have a criminal record and police say they knew nothing of him until his arrest on Friday. He was the registered holder of two weapons – a Glock pistol and an automatic rifle – both of which are thought to have been used in the massacre at Utoya. Home: Police believe Breivik planned a killing spree in the tranquil setting of his lakeside farm . Supplies: Several bags of fertiliser were found at Breivik's house near Oslo . Breivik moved out of Oslo two years ago and bought a farm in the town of Ostre Asta, where he set up an agricultural enterprise dealing in vegetables, melons, roots and tubers. The farm consists of a scattering of outbuildings on a grassy slope leading down to a forest-fringed lake. It was in this tranquil setting, police believe, that Breivik planned his devastating attacks. Using the farm business as cover, he placed an order for six tons of fertiliser with a local supplier two months ago. Oddny Estenstad, a spokeswoman for the supply firm, said he seemed like any other customer. ‘He contacted us in the normal manner, ordered fertiliser and had it delivered,’ he said. These pictures of Breivik were taken from his Facebook page, which has now been blocked . Police at the home of Breivik, a farm at Ostre Asta near Oslo, where he allegedly planned the entire massacre . The Norwegian police and security services are investigating possible links between Breivik and European far-Right groups, including the English Defence League. He is thought to have posted messages on a Norwegian website expressing admiration for the EDL and an extremist group called Stop Islamification of Europe. It is Breivik’s online profile that has provided the authorities with  most information about him so far. His Facebook page, which was blocked soon after the killings, listed his interests as bodybuilding, ‘conservative politics’ and freemasonry. He also had a liking for violent video games and American TV drama series Dexter, about a forensic blood spatter pattern expert with the Miami police who hunts down and kills criminals in his spare time. Breivik set up a Twitter account last week in which he hijacked a quotation by the 19th Century British libertarian and philosopher John Stuart Mill. Mill said: ‘One person with a belief is equal to a force of 99 who have only interests.’ Breivik changed this to: ‘One person with a belief is equal to a force of 100,000 who have only interests.’ Web: Breivik's sole tweet, posted last week, is attributed to the English philosopher John Stuart Mill - whose concept of liberty justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state control . In another message, he expressed concern about the effects of immigration on Norwegian society. ‘There are political forces in Oslo who want mass-subsidised and low-cost “Islam-blocks” in Oslo West for “better integration”,’ he wrote. And on his contacts with the English Defence League, he wrote: ‘I have on some occasions discussed with . . . the EDL and recommended them to use conscious strategies. The tactics of the EDL is to “entice” an overreaction from Jihad Youth/Extreme Marxists – something they have succeeded several times [with] already.’ In another posting, dated December 2009, Breivik claimed there was no country where Muslims lived peacefully alongside non-Muslims. Wrecked: The blast in Oslo was outside a government office . According to friends, Breivik began to espouse extremist views in his late 20s. But he was also a member of the second largest party in the Norwegian parliament from 1999 to 2004. Other members of the centre-right Progress Party described him as ‘a modest person who seldom engaged in political discussions’. But Breivik appears to have become disillusioned with mainstream politics. He wrote in one internet message that ‘the vast majority of new faces in the Progress Party are now politically-correct career politicians and not in any way idealists who are willing to take risks and work for idealistic goals’. Last night, however, the authorities were still trying to establish a motive for the killings. As Breivik was charged with multiple counts of murder, police said his internet postings suggested he had ‘some political traits directed towards the right and anti-Muslim views’. ‘But whether that was a motivation for the actual act remains to be seen,’ they added. ANALYSIS BY DAVID WILSON . The savage, blood-soaked massacre in Norway might seem like the act of a deranged madman. But the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, was nothing of the sort. In fact, he appears to have been an intelligent, well-educated individual and a competent businessman, who owned a successful farm. Nothing in either his life story or even in this unprecedented atrocity smacks of wild insanity. Just the opposite. He planned the whole operation with utter ruthlessness and precision, from using fertiliser from his farm to make the bomb that was planted at the government’s offices in Oslo, to disguising himself as a policeman to gain access to the island summer camp. Fatal: Seven people were killed in the Oslo bomb blast (pictured) Even as he carried out the mass shooting, he did not exhibit the behaviour of a frenzied lunatic. Instead, he coldly beckoned his victims towards him and then, like an iron-willed executioner, systematically fired at them. Tellingly, unlike so many spree killers, including Britain’s own Derrick Bird in Cumbria and Thomas Hamilton in Dunblane, he did not shoot himself, but instead allowed the police to take him into custody. The fact that Breivik was able to perpetrate this monstrous deed is partly a reflection of the extremely liberal gun laws that operate in Scandinavia. Much of this huge region is a wilderness, dominated by the untamed forces of nature, and, as a result, the ownership of firearms for hunting and self-protection is widely accepted, just as in the US the freedom to carry guns is an integral part of society. It was this freedom that gave Breivik his easy access to high-calibre weaponry Moreover, his work as a farmer meant that he could acquire fertiliser for his bomb-making without raising any suspicions. But ease of access does not explain why he acted as he did. After all, despite the prevalence of guns, there has never previously been a crime like this in Norway and even in wider Scandinavia such mass shootings are extremely rare. The only comparable recent events were massacres in Finland at Tuusula in 2007 and Kauhajoki in 2008. Scandinavia has extremely low overall rates of crime and murder compared with most advanced countries in the Western world. Yet it is a fundamental paradox of Scandinavia that, for all the region’s stability and order, there are deep-seated anxieties about crime and social disintegration. Beneath the tranquil surface lurks a dark spirit of foreboding. That is why there is such an appetite in Scandinavia for the violent crime-fiction genre that conveys this atmosphere of menace, as demonstrated by the smash-hit Danish TV series The Killing or the novels of Stieg Larsson, such as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Norway has its own acclaimed writer of bestselling thrillers, Jo Nesbo. His fictional blond, blue-eyed detective Harry Hole specialises in catching spree killers. This widespread disquiet has been driven partly by concerns that Norway’s national identity and traditional culture are under threat from mass immigration, multiculturalism and militant Islam. Many fear that the social contract of mutual responsibility which once built Scandinavia’s famously generous welfare system is now dissolving in the more fluid, globalised world.","Anders Behring Breivik posted online about 'Somali immigrants with full Norwegian passports'

"A businesswoman dubbed the City Supermum for balancing a highly successful career with having nine children still gets home at 6pm every day to do the ironing, it has been revealed. Helena Morrissey, chief executive of the Newton Investment Management company, said women 'overthink' when the right time to have children is and its potential impact on their careers. The mother-of-nine, who lives in Notting Hill, London, and earned the nickname of 'billion-dollar babe' in reference to the £51bn of assets under her management, is also the founder of the 30 Per Cent Club, campaigning to make UK boardrooms 30 per cent female by 2015. Scroll down for video . Helena Morrissey, chief executive of the Newton Investment Management company, said women also 'overthink' when the right time to have children is and its potential impact on their careers . The mother-of-nine,  (pictured with four of her daughters) who lives in Notting Hill, London, and earned the nickname of 'billion-dollar babe' in reference to the £51bn of assets under her management, is also the founder of the 30 Per Cent Club, a pressure group campaigning to make UK boardrooms 30 per cent female by 2015 . But the 48-year-old insists that having children shouldn't impact on a woman's career. In an interview with Evening Standard City Editor Chris Blackhurst, she said: 'My advice would be not to overthink it. I believe having a few months or a year out in what might be a 40 year career is neither here nor there.' Her children - six girls and three boys all ranging in age from 6 and 23 - were cared for both by her husband, who gave up his journalism career to help raise the children, and by the family nanny. But in an interview with The Times, Mrs Morrissey's 19-year-old daughter Flo revealed that despite her impressive career and influence, she is still a hands-on mother - even extending to keeping on top of the mountains of housework after her working day is done. The singer-songwriter said: 'She's very much as she's portrayed, but I don't actually know how she does it. She's really hands-on with us.

"Bianca Jagger (pictured), the 69-year-old ex-wife of Mick Jagger, was subjected to vicious abuse online after coming out in support of a campaign to stop Everton FC building a new stadium  in Liverpool . Bianca Jagger has hit out at abusers who trolled her after she opposed plans for Everton's new stadium, branding them worse than 'dictators and war criminals'. The 69-year-old ex-wife of Mick Jagger was subjected to vicious 'racist and sexist abuse' online after coming out in support of a campaign to stop Everton FC building a new stadium. The human rights campaigner said she had rarely received such a level of abuse despite campaigning for years against dictators and war criminals. Despite the abuse, she told the trolls 'you'll not silence me' and vowed to continue her support against the possibility of Everton building a new stadium in Walton Hall Park in Liverpool. Writing on Twitter, she said: 'I have campaigned in defence of human rights, social justice, peace and environmental protection for over 30 years. 'I've faced dangerous situations in wars and speaking out against ruthless dictators and brutal war criminals. My choices were not always popular. 'But I have rarely received as vile, racist and sexist tweets as I received for signing a petition to the Liverpool City Council urging them not to sell or destroy Walton Hall Park. 'I decided to support a community that want their children to have access to a park. Tweets from supporters of Everton's new ground were sexist and racist. 'Throughout my life, I have been threatened by death squads in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, by Serbs in Bosnia. You'll not silence me.' Walton Hall Park is the possible site for a new Everton FC stadium, which would see the club move from Goodison Park. The proposed move has left fans divided, with campaigners desperate to save the green space, saying it would be a 'disaster' for the community. Ms Jagger took to Twitter on January 2 urging people to sign a petition to save the park, after being encouraged to do so by Chrisie Byrne, of Friends of Walton Hall Park. The Premiership club has long been looking to move from Goodison Park (pictured) to a modern stadium . Walton Hall Park in Liverpool (pictured) is the proposed new site for a possible new Everton FC stadium . Ms Jagger told the internet trolls 'you'll not silence me' after condemning the tweets 'racist and sexist' (top) Ms Byrne said she was 'absolutely mortified' after dozens of trolls started bombarding Ms Jagger with 'disgusting' messages. She said: 'I'm proud of my city but I'm not proud of what these people have done. 'I felt responsible, as I'd tweeted her the campaign and she'd supported us. But now I've had phone calls with her, and she's so supportive of the campaign, she's read everything about it. 'It doesn't matter that she's not from round here - it's that the fight is right and she wants to support us.' Ms Byrne added: 'The fact this woman has been in war zones and never been abused this badly is just awful. Most of them have deleted the messages, but myself and Bianca saved them and will take them to the authorities.' The potential development on Walton Hall Park would provide Everton with a 50,000-seater stadium and create 1,000 new homes and 30,000 square metres of leisure, retail and restaurant space. A council spokesman said: 'We are continuing to listen to all views about the potential development at Walton Hall Park. 'The mayor has established a green strategy group to scrutinise the use of green space in the city to help formulate the local plan which will guide Liverpool's growth while protecting its heritage and green space.' Ms Jagger is not the only star to back a green campaign in Liverpool recently. Liverpool-born Sex and The City star Kim Cattrall has also previously weighed in on the campaign to save some inner city parkland. Campaigners are against plans for a new stadium at Walton Hall Park and have protested against it (pictured) Everton has long been looking to move from Goodison Park to a modern stadium. The club believes Goodison Park, the Premiership team’s home since 1892, can no longer generate sufficient revenue from a maximum capacity of 39,600. It announced plans for a new ground in Kirkby in 2006, but they were rejected by central government three years later. The idea of sharing a ground with Liverpool FC has been touted several times, although this has since been dismissed. Fans from both clubs objected to the plans. Liverpool announced in 2005 it was planning a new stadium to replace Anfield, but later confirmed it would instead expand its existing ground. In April, Liverpool City Council reaffirmed its commitment to working with Everton on the prospect of a new stadium. It was revealed last year that the club was exploring options for a new home inside the city boundaries of Liverpool. Everton believes Goodison Park can no longer generate sufficient revenue from a capacity of 39,600 people .","Bianca Jagger, 69, received vicious abuse online after backing campaign .

"A judge today began the process of selecting the jury that will hear the trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, telling the first of some 1,200 prospects to read no more news accounts about the deadly blasts. His accusers brandish a confession scribbled inside a boat during an intensive manhunt and a video they say shows him placing a backpack with a bomb a few feet from a little boy who died when it exploded seconds later. His defenders bank on the story of a difficult childhood in a former Soviet republic and his radicalization at the hands of an influential older brother who could have pressured him into participating in the deadly attack. Scroll down for video . On trial: A judge Monday began the process of selecting the jury that will hear the trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, depicted in this courtroom sketch January 5 . Dressed in a dark shirt and light slacks, the 21-year-old bombing suspect was described as periodically rubbing his facial hair and shirt collar . The 21-year-old appeared in court once again sporting a beard . If Tsarnaev is found guilty of being responsible for the twin bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013, they will decide whether he should be put to death. US District Judge George O'Toole acknowledged the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be aware of the incident, but reminded the group that their job during the three to four month trial would be to consider only the evidence presented in court. 'Mr. Tsarnaev is charged in connection with events that occurred near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 that resulted in the deaths of three people,' as well as with the fatal shooting of a police officer three days later, O'Toole told the group of 200 prospects. O'Toole signaled that he would allow about three weeks for selection of the jury that will determine both Tsarnaev's guilt and whether, if convicted, he will be sentenced to death. He said opening statements would begin around January 26. It is arguably the most high-profile federal death penalty case since Timothy McVeigh was convicted and executed for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Tsarnaev's lawyers tried in vain for months to get the trial moved, arguing the Boston jury pool was tainted because of the number of locals with connections to the race and drawing parallels to the McVeigh case, which was moved to Denver for similar reasons. But Judge O'Toole has been unmoved. Defense: This panel of file photos shows attorneys David Bruck, left, July Clarke, center, and Miriam Conrad, right, who are the defense team for Tsarnaev .

A federal police officer and K-9 dog patrol outside the federal courthouse in Boston, Monday, Jan. 5, 2015, for the first day of jury selection . Jury selection alone is expected to take several weeks because of extensive media coverage and the thousands of runners, spectators and others in the area personally affected by the bombings. The process also could be slowed if potential jurors express objections to the death penalty. In the end, a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be seated to hear a trial expected to last three to five months. At around 9am Monday, Tsarnaev arrived at the federal courthouse in Boston accompanied by her attorneys. Dressed in a dark shirt and light slacks, the 21-year-old bombing suspect was described as periodically rubbing his facial hair and shirt collar as he listened to the judge speak to the prospective jurors. He did not speak. A moderate police presence was visible outside the courthouse, located in a downtown neighborhood that is the site of extensive construction. Cruisers patrolled area roadways and officers with dogs walked the perimeter of the courthouse building. High-profile case: Those chosen from a pool of about 1,200 will decide whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, since here in a courtroom sketch from December 18, 2014, planned and carried out the deadly Boston Marathon attacks . Media circus: New cameras take positions outside the federal courthouse in Boston Monday for the first day of jury selection . Some legal observers say Tsarnaev's lawyers — facing powerful evidence against him — will probably focus their energies on the penalty phase, when they could present mitigating evidence to spare his life. He has a strong team behind him. Attorney Judy Clarke touts a strong record of helping her high-profile clients avoid the death penalty, including Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph; and Jared Loughner, who killed six people and wounded former US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Tsarnaev's lawyers are likely to narrow in on motive and any pressure exerted on him, said Dan Collins, a former assistant US attorney in Chicago who has investigated US ties to terrorism. ‘I think his mitigation will be in part paying close attention to what his explanation is and what circumstances beyond his control ... caused him to do this,’ Collins said. Prosecutors say 21-year-old Dzhokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev — ethnic Chechens who had lived in the United States for about a decade — carried out the bombings as retaliation for US actions in Muslim countries. They are also accused of killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. Tamerlan, 26, died after a firefight with police several days after the bombings. Jury selection alone is expected to take several weeks because of extensive media coverage and the thousands of runners, spectators and others in the area personally affected by the bombings (pictured) Clamoring for justice: Several victims of the attacks plan to attend the hotly anticipated trial . Brothers: Prosecutors say 21-year-old Dzhokhar (left) and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) carried out the bombings as retaliation for US actions in Muslim countries . Dzhokhar was captured later that day, wounded and bloodied, hiding inside a boat stored in a suburban yard. Prosecutors said he described a motive in a note written in the boat: ‘The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians’ and ‘We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.’ Tsarnaev's lawyers may lay the groundwork for some kind of mental health explanation, said Christopher Dearborn, a professor at Suffolk University Law School. That could include any persecution his family might have suffered as ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan, where the brothers spent most of their lives before moving to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters. ‘I think the real value in that may be to start to try to generate even a little bit of empathy around this and humanize the kid a little bit, hopefully enough to save a life,’ Dearborn said. Alice LoCicero, a Cambridge psychologist and terrorism expert who wrote a book, ‘Why “Good Kids” Turn Into Deadly Terrorists: Deconstructing the Accused Boston Marathon Bombers and Others Like Them,’ said she believes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been susceptible to the influence of his brother and others because he had lost structure in the year before the bombings. Among those life changes: Dzhokhar had left the family's Cambridge home to attend the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth, his parents moved to the volatile Dagestan region of Russia, and the family was having financial problems. Strategy: The defense team will likely focus their energies on the penalty phase, when they could present mitigating evidence to spare Tsarnaev's life . Long time coming: Security stands outside the federal courthouse in Boston, Monday for the first day of jury selection in the trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) Authorities believe Tamerlan became radicalized in the last few years of his life, including during a six-month trip to Dagestan and Chechnya in 2012. Prosecutors, however, say Dzhokhar showed signs before the bombings — even to his closest friends — that he was becoming radicalized. At least one of three college friends convicted of lying or impeding the investigation is expected to testify against him. An additional friend who pleaded guilty to possessing a gun used to kill a police officer during the manhunt is also expected to testify for the prosecution. Other prosecution witnesses are expected to include people hurt in the bombings, as well as police officers who helped in the aftermath. Remember: A memorial stands at the site of the first bomb that went off in the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013 on January 4 . Dzhokhar's defense team has been pushing to show that he may have been intimidated by his brother. Prosecutors revealed in a court filing that Ibragim Todashev, a friend of Tamerlan's, said Tamerlan participated in a grisly triple slaying in Waltham, a Boston suburb, in 2011. The trial, expected to last several months, is likely to draw spectators injured in the bombings, as well as supporters of Tsarnaev who have demonstrated outside the courthouse during pretrial hearings. Tsarnaev's own lawyers have asked that the demonstrators be kept at arm's length. Heather Abbott, a Rhode Island woman who lost part of her left leg in the bombings, is one of several victims who plan to attend at least part of the trial. She said she hopes to gain some understanding of the motive. ‘I don't see it as something that will get me past the horror of that day,’ she said. ‘It's something that I will always live with.’","Jury panel will be chosen from a pool of 1,200 over the next several weeks .

"In a picturesque village in the Andes mountains, an 82-year-old woman is putting her middle aged children into nappies. Mrs Cuartas, who lives in a small village called Yarumal, in Colombia, is forced to take care of her three children despite being an old woman herself. Her children have been afflicted with the village's curse: something they called 'La Bobera': the foolishness. The curse means many of the village's 5,000 residents have a genetic mutation that predisposes them to Alzheimer's disease – and most develop the condition by the time they are just 40 years old. Doctors say 5,000 people in the village of Yarumal, Colombia (pictured), are at risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's because of a genetic mutation passed down and spread through intermarriage . Yarumal is based in the Antioquia area of Colombia. People from this area call themselves 'paisa', meaning countrymen, and the mutation which causes Alzheimer's has come to be known as the 'paisa' mutation . 'To see your children like this, it's horrible, horrible.' Mrs Cuartas told The New York Times, . 'I wouldn't wish this on a rabid dog. It is the most terrifying illness on the face of the earth.' One of her sons, Dario, 55, has to be tied to a chair with blue shorts as he squirms so vigorously, shredding his nappy with his hands. Her daughter, Maria Elsy, 61, is mute and fed by a nose tube. Previously, she had violent rages. Maria Alsy was a nurse but started to forget her patients' medications at age 48. Mrs Cuartas' other son, Oderis, 50, can only remember to buy one item at a time from the shop. Many of the 5,000 villagers who live in Yarumal have inherited the mutation that pre-disposes them to Alzheimer's and intermarriage has accelerated its spread. It was inherited from the village's Basque country ancestors, and those from the Antioquia area of Colombia now call themselves 'paisa', meaning countrymen. Many of the 5,000 villagers who live in Yarumal have inherited the mutation that pre-disposes them to Alzheimer's and intermarriage has accelerated its spread. It was inherited from the village's Basque country ancestors, and those from the Antioquia area of Colombia now call themselves 'paisa', meaning countrymen. A single parent can pass down the mutation, located on the 14th chromosome – which causes a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's. Those who have the mutation have a 50 per cent chance of developing Alzheimer's, sometimes as early as 32 years old. The disease begins with forgetfulness but slowly progresses to being disorientated, having delusional ideas and being aggressive. In some families, parents and children have progressed through the illness together, from memory loss to dementia. A single parent can pass down the mutation, located on the 14th chromosome – which causes a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's.

The disease begins with forgetfulness but slowly progresses to being disorientated, having delusional ideas and being aggressive. In some families, parents and children have progressed through the illness together, from memory loss to dementia. But a neurologist named Francisco Lopera, who grew up in Yarumal, hopes there is a blessing in the village's curse. Thirty years ago, Dr Lopera, the head of the neuroscience program at the University of Antioquia, set himself an ambitious mission: to find a treatment to prevent Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia in the world. 'Most treatments have failed because they're administered too late. Our strategy is to intervene before the disease destroys the brain,' Dr Lopera said. Alzheimer's disease is caused by parts of the brain wasting away. It is not known exactly what causes this process to begin, although people with the condition have been found to have abnormal amounts of proteins called amyloid plaques, fibres  and a chemical called acetylcholine in the brain. These reduce the effectiveness of the brain's nerve calls and gradually destroying them. Over time this damage spreads to several areas of the brain, such as the grey matter (responsible for processing thoughts) and the hippocampus (responsible for memory). Francisco Lopera, a neurologist who grew up in Yarumal, has set himself an ambitious mission: to find a treatment to prevent Alzheimer's. He is trialling a new drug on 300 of the village's residents . For several months, Dr Lopera been testing an experimental drug on a group of 300 healthy patients aged 30 to 60 years old who have the paisa mutation. The active molecule in his drug targets the  proteins that attack the brain and lead to dementia. The trials are part of a $100 million (£65 milion) project financed by the National Institutes of Health and Banner Research Institute in the U.S., as well as Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche. The results are expected around 2020. The stakes are high worldwide: more than 36 million people suffer from Alzheimer's and, without a cure, the number could rise to 66 million in 2030 and 115 million in 2050, according to the World Health Organisation. That's nearly one new case every four seconds — three times the rate of HIV infections. 'We don't know what causes Alzheimer's, but for one per cent of the cases worldwide, it's genetic in origin. 'And that opens a very important window toward finding a preventive treatment,' said Dr Lopera, who estimates 5,000 people are at risk in and around Yarumal. At his university, a small room filled with refrigerators and formaldehyde jars holds a 'brain bank' created with organ donations from local residents — an invaluable research source. 'It was very hard for them to accept, in addition to their suffering, donating their loved ones' brains,' said Lucia Madrigal, a nurse in the neuroscience department who organises cognitive stimulation workshops for patients. The World Health Organisation predicts  115 million people worldwide will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Pictured is a brain scan of a 74-year-old patient with the condition . 'But without that social link, the scientific project could never have seen the light of day,' she said. Herself a fit 60-something with no plans to retire, she has lived Yarumal's nightmare along with residents. 'Some say they'd rather kill themselves. Then they get sick and they forget,' she said. Marta — an energetic, 72-year-old grandmother from Yarumal who has settled in the regional capital Medellin — said she is praying for Dr Lopera's treatment to work. Two of her daughters, aged 43 and 47, are suffering memory loss and 'becoming small children again,' she said. Another daughter, 53-year-old Alitee, is 'just a body' who drinks from a baby bottle. 'I've trusted my children to God. It's his decision,' she said.","Villagers have a mutation that predisposes them to early onset Alzheimer's .

He has not entered a plea and was due in court next month, according to ABC. Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, was found with a gunshot wound to the head at his New York home on Sunday . The 30-year-old was previously arrested in May 2007 on drug charges. The Princeton graduate was upset that  his weekly allowance had been cut back, according to published reports, when he went to his parents' home in midtown Manhattan on Sunday afternoon. A source told the New York Daily News that Mr Gilbert Sr had cut back Tommy's weekly allowance to $300 and threatened to stop paying his rent. Gilbert Jr lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea where, according to listings, guarantors were accepted on the $2,400-a-month rent. The Ivy Leaguer, who was a regular fixture at Manhattan's black-tie benefits with society beauties on his arm, reportedly slipped past the doorman and into his parents' building shortly before the alleged attack at 3.30pm. According to The New York Post, Gilbert Jr went to his parents' eighth-floor apartment and asked his mother to leave to get him a sandwich. The father and son were discussing 'differences in their relationship', according to The Wall Street Journal. Police remove a body bag from the luxury Manhattan apartment building late on Sunday where a multimillionaire hedge-funder was found with a gunshot wound to the head . The NYPD broke down the door of Gilbert Jr's West 18th St ground-floor apartment (pictured) to arrest him on Sunday. According to published news reports, Gilbert Jr had his allowance cut back by his father who was paying his $2,400-a-month rent . Gilbert Sr's wife Shelley, 67, found her husband dead in the bedroom within minutes of the alleged attack and called 911, police said. According to a Daily News report, he had the gun on his chest in an alleged attempt to make it look like suicide. Gilbert Jr was then seen walking out of the building in Manhattan's Turtle Bay area covering his face with a hoodie around 3.35pm, the New York Daily News reported. The 30-year-old was found in his ground-floor apartment at 10.30pm on Sunday, after he fled from his parents' home in midtown, multiple media outlets claimed, citing police sources. Police recovered a Glock 22 .40-caliber handgun from the scene. At 10.30pm on Sunday, Gilbert Jr was arrested without incident at his apartment after NYPD officers dressed in riot gear, chopped down the door and found him hiding inside. Police arrested Gilbert Jr (pictured left in August; right at a concert in Central Park in 2012) after he allegedly barged into his father's bedroom with a gun . Tommy Gilbert Jr, pictured in March 2014, with fellow Princeton graduate Arielle Patrick, at the School of American Ballet's winter ball in New York . Gilbert Jr is reportedly being held at the NYPD's 17th precinct in midtown Manhattan after being arrested on Sunday night at his home . He was taken to the 17th precinct in midtown Manhattan and questioned. A spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Monday that the investigation was ongoing. Thomas Gilbert Sr started Wainscott Capital in 2011, growing the fund to a value of $200 million. He attended Princeton and Harvard Business School before a 40-year career on Wall Street.  According to Wainscott Capital's website, he had extensive knowledge of the stock market, private equity, real estate and the fixed income market. His son, Tommy Gilbert Jr, attended The Buckley school on Manhattan's Upper East Side from kindergarten until eighth grade. Tuition costs around $35,000 a year. Noteable alumni of the school include actor James Harder, philanthropist David Rockefeller Jr and Robert Wagner, former deputy mayor of New York. He then went on to the $50,000-a-year Deerfield Academy in Western Massachusetts, which counts the King of Jordan and Prince of Jordan among its alumni. Investigators escort a woman, believed to be the victim's wife, from the family's Manhattan home on Sunday. Shelley Gilbert (right) was believed to have found her husband's body and called 911 . After graduating from Deerfield in 2003, Gilbert Jr accepted a place at Princeton University where he graduated in 2009. A friend told Daily Mail Online on Monday: 'He was a really nice person. He was smart, athletic and he went to Princeton. 'He took some leave of absences from Princeton which is why it took him so long to graduate. He must have been really angry to do something so out-of-character.' A classmate, who attended Deerfield with Gilbert Jr, also said: 'Tommy was my classmate. This story is an incomprehensible tragedy. My heart goes out to the entire Gilbert family.' Details of Gilbert Jr's profession remain unclear but he was photographed on multiple occasions at black-tie society events. The 30-year-old was pictured in March 2014 at the School of American Ballet's winter ball with Arielle Patrick, a 2012 Princeton grad, child of Manhattan private schools and now a PR director, who sources told the Daily Mail Online that he had dated. Miss Patrick refused to confirm whether the pair had dated on Monday. A fellow Princeton graduate told Daily Mail Online that Gilbert Jr was a 'highly disturbed individual'. Another friend told Today that 30-year-old Gilbert Jr had become 'volatile' in recent years. Friends in the 30-year-old's circle told Daily Mail Online that he loved surfing, was 'handsome and nice' but extremely quiet and never talked. The family property is a $6,000-a-month rental apartment at 20 Beekman Place on 50th Street, a few blocks north of the United Nations on the east side of Manhattan. The building's porter told the New York Daily News that Gilbert Sr was 'friendly, very nice' and a 'gentleman'. 'I immediately got a bad vibe,' the doorman told police, according to the Daily News. 'The kid got into the elevator before I got the chance to pick up the telephone.' A neighbor, named as Bernard, said: 'Five minutes later he comes running out covering his face with a hoodie.' Police surrounded the family property, a $6,000-a-month rental, in midtown Manhattan on Sunday . Police reports said the fatal attack took place at the family apartment (pictured left) in Manhattan. Investigators with evidence bags enter the Gilbert family home on Sunday (right) Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, was found with a gunshot wound to the head at 3.30pm in his Beekman Place home on the east side of Manhattan. His son was arrested seven hours later after barricading himself in his home on West 18th Street . Mr Gilbert Sr also owned a property in the Hamptons which was listed for sale at $11.5million. The 2.5 acre-property has five bedrooms, four baths, a heated pool and screened in porch and sits in one of the area's most exclusive enclaves. Wainscott Capital avoided losses which plagued other hedge funds in October last year, gaining 1.65 per cent that month. In an interview with FINalternatives, Gilbert Sr attributed the success to their moderate risk profile. 'We’re not trying to beat all of the biotech funds, we’re basically trying to avoid drawdowns,' he said. Named in the annual Who's Who In America list for five years running (1999-2004), Gilbert Sr started his career with a seven-year stint at Loeb Partners Corporation as managing director.

"Last month, Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan unveiled his next science-fiction blockbuster. Called Interstellar, it envisages a future where travel to other stars is not only a possibility but a necessity, and tasks actor Matthew McConaughey with leading the main mission. But a Nasa scientist claims such a mission isn’t necessarily just something reserved for science fiction - and has revealed a Star Trek-style ship that could make interstellar travel a reality. Pictured is an illustration of Dr White's IXS Enterprise, an interstellar ship drawn by artist Mark Rademaker that could be an accurate representation of what the first mission beyond the solar system will look like. The IXS Enterprise is a theory-fitting concept for a faster than light (FTL) ship . Dr Harold White is famous for suggesting that faster than light (FTL) travel is possible. The . 100-year Starship Project is a joint endeavour run by Darpa, Nasa, . Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development. Announced in January 2012, the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112. To . do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies, including . ‘warping’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at . faster-than-light speeds. The project is also considering building ‘generation ships’ that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population. To date Nasa has contributed $100,000 (£60,000) to the project and Darpa $1 million (£600,000). Using something known as an Alcubierre drive, named after a Mexican theoretical physicist of the same name, Dr White said it is possible to ‘bend’ space-time, and cover large distances almost instantly. This, in essence, would allow a spaceship to travel almost anywhere in a tiny fraction of the time it would take a conventional spacecraft. The ship in Nolan’s Interstellar movie, as well as those in Star Trek, employ a warp engine. And, in a series of new renders, Dr White reveals how a real spacecraft dubbed the IXS Enterprise could do the same thing. The images are based on the artist who created the original look for the famous USS Enterprise ship from Star Trek - Matthew Jeffries. To make the latest renders Dr White employed the help of artist Mark Rademaker and graphic designer Mike Okuda. The ship has a number of features that make interstellar travel possible. This includes the two rings surrounding the central spacecraft - these are known as an Alcubierre drive and are used to 'warp' space-time and travel many light years in a matter of days . The engine for Dr White's ISX Enterprise is based on something known as the Alcubierre drive. As shown in the illustration above this stretches space-time in a wave that causes the fabric of space-time ahead to contract while expanding the space behind, theoretically allowing 'faster than light' travel . Although . the speed of light is seen as an absolute, Dr White was inspired by . Miguel Alcubierre, who postulated a theory that allowed for faster than . light travel but without contradicting Einstein. Alcubierre's theory . was published in 1994 and involved enormous amounts of energy being . used to expand and contract space itself - thereby generating a 'warp . bubble' in which a spacecraft would travel. Allowing space and time to act as the propellant by pulling the craft through the bubble would be like stepping on an escalator. Despite Dr Alcubierre stating his theory was simply conjecture, Dr White thinks he and his team are edging towards making the realm of warp speed attainable. This illustration shows Dr White's design in its entirety. Struts around the spacecraft show how it would be directly attached to the rings. At the front is the 'bridge' where the crew would conduct operations on the spacecraft. Towards the back is the cargo area where so-called exotic matter for fuel would be stored . According to Gizmodo, their engine could get to Alpha Centauri in two weeks as measured by clocks on Earth. The process of going to warp is also one that is smooth, rather than using a massive amount of acceleration in a short amount of time. 'When you turn the field on, everybody doesn't go slamming against the bulkhead, which would be a very short and sad trip,' Dr White said. However, Dr White admits his research is still small-scale and is light years away from any type of engine that could be constructed into a spaceship like the USS Enterprise. In Christopher Nolan's upcoming film Interstellar, due for release in November, a team of astronauts undertake a mission beyond the stars to save humanity. To get there they use an Alcubierre drive, shown above in a clip from the film - the same engine envisaged by Dr White of Nasa for his Star Trek-style spacecraft . The ship at the centre of Dr White's IXS Enterprise would need to be small enough to fit inside the rings and it would need to not stick out too much. This is because when the rings are activated they will create a 'warp bubble', and anything outside of this will be cut off when the jump is made, according to Dr White . Look familiar? Dr White's design for the IXS Enterprise bears a striking similarity to the USS Enterprise as seen in various Star Trek TV shows such as Star Trek: The Next Generation, seen here. In the show this science vessel was used to 'explore strange new worlds' and 'seek out new life and new civilisation' To make the dream a reality Dr White has laid out a road map with important milestones that will need to be met along the way to achieving true interstellar travel. This begins with tests on Earth to prove the technology is possible. These initial experiments are very crude and very basic - but, if proved, there is, in theory, no limit to how it can be applied. The next step will be to use the warp technology on a spacecraft and complete a short trip to the moon, followed by a trip to Mars. This would ultimately test the technologies that would be necessary to complete ‘jumps’ beyond the solar system and reach destinations in a matter of months, weeks or even days. Illustrated here is a previous design from Dr White and Rademaker. This concept had a number of flaws. First, the rings were too thin, meaning they would have needed too much energy for warp travell. Second, part of the ship extends out of the rings, which would have been cut off when the 'warp bubble' was created . The main limitation is energy - previously it was thought mass equivalent to a planet would be necessary to provide the energy required for a warp jump. But revised suggestions suggest mass similar in size to a car might be more realistic. The research has done enough to pique the interest of Nasa and other agencies. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), for instance, is currently carrying out the 100-year-starship project with a view to sending humans outside the solar system at the turn of the next century. The rings around the spacecraft (shown) would actually shift the surrounding space. The drive would require something known as exotic matter to work, hypothetical particles that violate the known laws of physics (possibly such as dark matter), but as of yet none have been found or created . The main limitation of the concept, (pictured) is energy - previously it was thought mass equivalent to a planet would be necessary to provide the energy required for a warp jump. But revised suggestions claim mass similar in size to a car might be more realistic . Warp travel is the focus of the 2014 movie Interstellar.

"She may have been dead for more than half a century, but Hollywood's most sought-after blonde is still very much in demand. Max Factor has announced that Marilyn Monroe will be the new face of the make-up brand - despite her death in 1962. As the brand's 'global glamour ambassador', she will take the starring role in this year's advertising campaigns. Scroll down for video . Max Factor has announced that silver-screen starlet Marilyn Monroe (left and right) will be the new face of the make-up brand - despite having died in 1962 . The adverts will emphasise the role that make-up played in Monroe's transformation, during which she cemented her reputation as one of the west's most enduring sex symbols . The adverts will emphasise the role that make-up played in Monroe's transformation, from mousy Norma Jeane Mortenson to the red-lipped, platinum-haired bombshell which cemented her reputation as one of the west's most enduring sex symbols. The glamorous actress, who died at the age of 36, was a Max Factor client in the 40s, when the American brand catered for silver-screen starlets from its beauty parlour in Hollywood Boulevard. Earlier this year, Gwyneth Paltrow was transformed into a modern interpretation of Marilyn Monroe in celebration of the 1940s and to continue the brand's Hollywood legacy. Other faces of the brand have included Madonna and supermodel Gisele Bundchen. Pat McGrath, from Max Factor, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Marilyn made the sultry red lip, creamy skin and dramatically lined eyes the most famous beauty look of the Forties, and it's a look that continues to dominate the beauty and fashion industry. 'It is the ultimate look that defines glamour - nothing else compares.' The actress (pictured left in Seven Year Itch and right in River Of No Return) will be the brand's 'global glamour ambassador' Last year, Monroe was ranked as sixth in the Forbes magazine's annual list of the highest-earning dead celebrities. She makes an estimated £11m a year. The rights to Monroe's image belong to the Authentic Brands Group, a licensing company which helped develop Monroe-branded spas and nail salons, as well as a clothing line for teenage girls at U.S department store Macy's. Her real name Norma Jeane Mortenson, Marilyn was 36 when she died of a barbiturate overdose in 1962. She was married to the baseball star Joe DiMaggio and the playwright Arthur Miller, and it has long been claimed she had affairs with President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert. However, her last years were marked by illness and personal trauma. It has never been proved conclusively whether her death was a suicide or an accident.","Silver-screen actress will be 'global glamour ambassador' for the brand .

"Barack Obama's top spokesman shied away on Monday from confirming UK Prime Minister David Cameron's revelation that the president calls by a nickname – 'bro.' But it's the way he dodged a question about presidential nicknames from CBS White House Correspondent Major Garrett that had reporters laughing. 'To paraphrase a local baseball player here in Washington, D.C., that's a clown question, bro,' Earnest said during the first press conference since Obama and his entourage returned from a lengthy Hawaiian vacation. The reference wasn't lost on a chuckling press corps: Bryce Harper, an outfielder with the Washington Nationals baseball team, created that quip in 2012 to dismiss a post-game question he didn't want to answer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'CLOWN QUESTION': White House press secretary Josh Earnest dodged a question on Monday about whether Barack Obama has a masculine nickname for David Cameron . THE ORIGINAL: Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper dismissed a question about celebratory beers in 2012 by telling a reporter, 'That’s a clown question, 'bro' BRO: British PM David Cameron has a 'special' relationship with Obama and has earned a presidential nickname . Harper was just 19 years old then, too young to legally consume a celebratory beer after a game-winning home run in the U.S. – but he was in Toronto at the time. When a locker-room reporter asked him if he might have that drink in Canada, Harper grimaced and said, 'I'm not gonna answer that question. That's a clown question, 'bro.' Harper, as the journalist should have known, is also a devout Mormon. Washington's bro-mance with the phrase came full circle a week later, when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, repeated the line in a press conference on Capitol Hill. He was sidestepping a question about whether he planned to bring the DREAM Act, an Obama-favored piece of immigration legislation, to the Senate floor. Reid is known as a devoted baseball fan. Reporters erupted in laughter. Earnest's crown, however, groaned in recognition of what was likely a carefully planned response. This year's news bro-mentum came from an interview with David Cameron conducted by the Mail on Sunday, in which the PM commented on his close relationship with Obama. 'Yes, he sometimes calls me 'Bro,' Cameron confided. Earnest insisted Monday that he was joking, and then provided an official response. 'I am not able to give much more insight about the private communications between the president of the United States and the prime minister of the United Kingdom,' he said. But, he added, he didn't doubt Cameron's claim that he and Obama were close enough to generate a special nickname. 'I don't, because as you know, they have a special relationship,' Earnest said. But as the press conference ended and the White House's video feed shut down, Earnest could be heard telling a reporter that he had a backup line in mind if Bryce Harper's words had seemed the wrong way to go. 'It was either that,' he said, 'or ""Don't tase me, 'bro"".' That was a reference to a more ancient event, but a political one. 'DON'T TASE ME, 'BRO': Florida college student Andrew Meyer became an Internet sensation in 2007 when he jumped a Q-and-A line and earned an arrest from campus police . In September 2007 at a University of Florida event, then-Senator John Kerry took questions from an audience of students. Andrew Meyer, 21, jumped the queue and resisted campus police wen they puled him away from the microphone. As he struggled, four officers held him down while another zapped him with a stun gun. When Meyer saw the weapon, he shouted, 'Don't tase me, 'bro!' One video of that event, posted on YouTube by the Gainesville Sun newspaper, has been viewed more than 7.3 million times. Kerry was heard on the video, helplessly trying to restore order .","British leader is so close to the US president that Obama calls him 'bro,' Cameron told the Mail on Sunday.

In addition, the A7 piloted driving concept accelerates and brakes independently. Before the piloted driving system reaches its limitations, in city environments for example, the driver is requested to take control of the vehicle to ensure proper safety. The German auto-giant calls its self-driving technology ‘Piloted Driving’, and insists the sensors and equipment demonstrated in the vehicle are ‘production ready’. As a result, the company claims it is on course to put driverless cars into commercial production as soon as next year. Elsewhere, to highlight the growing importance of self-driving cars, Audi sent an automated A7 ‘supercar’ on a 550-mile (885km) journey from San Francisco to Las Vegas to prove the driverless car could soon be a reality on the world’s motorways. Self-parking cars are already in production and widely available, however the next generation of vehicles promise to carry their passengers on long journeys without incident or accident. 'At more than 550 miles of piloted highway driving with journalists behind the wheel, Audi is demonstrating the era of automated driving is nearly here,' the firm says. The long-distance test drive of the Audi A7 piloted driving concept car will show that unprecedented performance can be achieved with series production technology. The drive will take place from Silicon Valley, California to Las Vegas, Nevada to attend the International CES 2015 (Consumer Electronics Show), one of the world’s most important electronics trade shows.„ . 'The test drive from the west coast of California to Las Vegas demonstrates our leadership role in piloted driving', said Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi Board Member and Head of Technical Development. Before the piloted driving system reaches its limitations, in city environments for example, the driver is requested to take control of the vehicle to ensure proper safety. The car, that has been affectionately been named 'Jack' by the development team, can initiate lane changes and passing manoeuvres. The A7 piloted driving concept utilizes the latest technologically advanced systems developed by Audi. The concept relieves the driver of driving duties from 0 to 70 mph, or just over 110 km/h. The car, that has been affectionately been named 'Jack' by the development team, can initiate lane changes and passing manoeuvres. In addition, the A7 piloted driving concept accelerates and brakes independently. Before initiating a lane change to the left or the right, the vehicle adapts its speed to surrounding vehicles. If the speed and distance calculation is deemed safe, the vehicle initiates the lane change with precision and in a timely manner. The piloted concept vehicle utilizes a combination of various sensors, many of which are close to production ready. A new hi-resolution 3D video camera, already integrated into the next generation systems found in the new Q7, takes a wide-angle view out in front of the vehicle. Four small front and rear mounted cameras view closer surroundings. Navigation data is used for basic vehicle orientation. The long range radar sensors of the adaptive cruise control (ACC) and the Audi side assist (ASA) keep watch of the front and rear of the vehicle. Two mid-range radar sensors at the front and rear respectively are aimed to the right and left to complete the 360 degree view. Laser scanners are mounted within the Singleframe grille and the rear bumper skirt. The scanners deliver redundant information to provide detailed recognition of static and dynamic objets during piloted driving. The technologies are production ready including their vehicle integration and cost structure for vehicle production in the near future. Last year Audi showed off the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept completing a lap on the Grand Prix track in Hockenheim – at racing speed, without a driver. Before the piloted driving system reaches its limitations, in city environments for example, the driver is requested to take control of the vehicle to ensure proper safety. A trained Audi professional test driver will accompany the media from the passenger seat for added safety. Last year the German car giant  let the car show off its at skills at top speed for the first time. The Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept completed a lap on the Grand Prix track in Hockenheim – at racing speed, without a driver. Audi scored yet another major success in the development of piloted driving: Before the season finale of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), the latest technology pioneer was running up to its physical limit, with no driver. It took the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept just slightly over two minutes to complete a lap on the Grand Prix track in Hockenheim – piloted with high precision and accuracy to within centimeters. 'The top performance by the Audi RS 7 today substantiates the skills of our development team with regard to piloted driving at Audi,' said Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Technical Development at AUDI AG. 'The derivations from series production, particularly in terms of precision and performance, are of great value for our further development steps.' For orientation on the track, the technology pioneer uses specially corrected GPS signals. The car has no driver - and is driven entirely by software. For orientation on the track, the car uses specially corrected GPS signals. This GPS data is transmitted to the vehicle via WiFi according to the automotive standard and redundantly via high-frequency radio. In parallel to this, 3D cameras in the car film the track, and a computer program compares the cameras' image information against a data set stored on board. This is what makes it possible for the technology pioneer to orient itself on the track within centimeters - and decide on the perfect race line.

Piloted driving is one of the most important development fields at Audi: The first successful developments were achieved ten years ago. The test results continually flow into series development. The latest test runs at the physical limit are providing the Audi engineers with insights for the development of automatic avoidance functions in critical driving situations, for example.Driver assistance systems from Audi are already making driving more relaxed and better controlled. These systems' highest level of development can be experienced in the updated Audi A6* and Audi A7 Sportback* model series.","Concept car takes over at speeds from 0 to 70 mph .

"Incredible footage has emerged of heat-stricken koalas being cooled down by rescuers as bushfires continue to ravage through South Australia. One piece of footage shows the tiny bundle of fur  drinking from a red drink bottle of water after a firefighter came to its rescue in the Adelaide Hills on Friday. Feeding the marsupial water, the thirsty koala looked severely burned as the rescuer is seen stroking and scratching its head in the bushland as it embraces the drink. Another heartfelt video was posted onto Facebook by local resident Kerry Goldsworthy on Friday after she came home to find a 'very hot and thirsty koala' in her front yard. Scroll down for videos . Incredible footage has emerged of heat-stricken koala being cooled down as bushfires continue to ravage . 'I'm going to remember this forever,' she posted. 'He drank for 15 minutes straight before looking much better and climbing a tree. 'When we first got home he was lying on the hot concrete trying to get shade behind the wheelie bins.' The woman can be seen pouring a plastic jug of water into the little furry creature's mouth as it drinks and cools down. She also pours the water over its head to cool down the parched koala. The video has received over 450,000 views, more than 16,500 shares and a significant amount of comments from friends and strangers. The thirsty marsupial looked severely burned as the rescuer is seen stroking and scratching its head . One piece of footage shows the tiny bundle of fur drinking from a red drink bottle of water by a firefighter . The two videos comes after Sam the koala grabbed global headlines when a photograph had gone viral of her drinking from a firefighter's water bottle during the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in 2009. She was a symbol of hope and happiness for the survivors despite the grief as raging blaze swept through killing more than 200 people. Koalas are particularly vulnerable due to their slow movements and the flammability of their main food source, eucalyptus trees. Another heartfelt footage has emerged from a local woman who found the thirsty koala in her front yard .

The videos follows after Sam the koala grabbed headlines from Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria 2011 . As firefighters fear more homed are at risk, they continue to battle against a wave of extreme blaze before hot weather scorches the state again on Wednesday. A watch and act alert is active for the Sampson Flat bushfire, in the Mount Lofty ranges, which has been burning since Friday, and has claimed almost 13,000 hectares of scrub and farmland. At least a dozen of homes have been destroyed and South Australia's premier Jay Weatherill said another 20 are likely to have been lost in the inferno. South Australia is enduring the state's worst fire conditions since the Ash Wednesday blaze in 1983, in which 28 people died. The raging fires have significantly affected farms and other private land in the area, causing wide ranging damage to crops and leaving many animals in danger.","Incredible footage has emerged of heat-stricken koalas being cooled down .

"A controversial Naval Academy professor is back in the spotlight after calling for an end to military academies. Bruce Fleming, a professor at the English Department of the U.S. Naval Academy since 1987, has been praised for his short stories. But now he's turning that sharp pen towards a missive calling on the new Republican legislative majority to shut down 'four hugely expensive and unproductive U.S. service academies (Navy, Army, Air Force and Coast Guard) — taxpayer-funded undergraduate institutions whose products all become officers in the military — to more modest and functional schools for short-term military training programs, as the British have repurposed Sandhurst.' Bruce Fleming, a professor at the English Department of the U.S. Naval Academy since 1987, has been praised for his short stories . Writing at Salon, Fleming's column goes on to argue that the military is not suited to education - as opposed to training - and that the academies have lived beyond their usefulness. 'When they were founded in the 19th century (the Air Force split off from Army after World War II), college was classics and religion for gentlemen, so it made sense to have technical training institutes for people who would be in charge of increasingly technical warfare,' he writes. 'All the service academies have now to justify their cost and their pretensions, it seems, is their once-illustrious history, and the club of 'tradition,' which they wield mercilessly against students who dare question why things are as they are.' Writing at Salon , Fleming's column goes on to argue that the military is not suited to education - as opposed to training - and that the academies have lived beyond their usefulness. Pictured: West Point Military Academy campus . As they stand, he argues they provide no benefit to the taxpayers who back them and stand as mere 'vanity projects' operating without oversight, accountability, or indeed any room for criticism from military subordinates on their operations. Among their biggest defenders, he continues, are parents benefiting from government benefits and paid education. 'And no,' he adds, regarding health benefits, 'most people in the military aren't remotely likely to be shot at.' He claims that from his own long experience enjoying his own taxpayer funded job at the navy's institution that no one ever asks if they're doing their jobs well. Far from enjoying any academic boost, the students struggle to stay awake in class as they balance outside responsibilities. Fleming claims that from his own long experience enjoying his own taxpayer funded job at the navy's institution that no one ever asks if they're doing their jobs well . As The Washington Post reported in November, Fleming has long been an outspoken critic of the Naval Academy's practices and clashed with the institution's brass. He told the paper the school attempted to silence him with a formal reprimand this year after he criticized the school's sexual assault prevention training. 'What they are trying to do is to shut me down,' he told the paper, 'to put me at 11:59 so when the clock strikes 12, they can fire me.'","Bruce Fleming, a professor at the English Department of the U.S. Naval Academy since 1987, has been praised for his short stories .

"Technology has already changed the way we communicate, but now it's revolutionising the way we fall - and stay - in love. From gadgets that let you hold hands with distant loved ones to watches that share your heartbeat - the future of relationships is getting a lot more hi-tech. But despite being heralded as a new era in expressing our affections, some experts have warned that a reliance on apps, gadgets and robots will leave us emotionally stunted. ‘Everything that is useful has within it the potential to be abused. So there are dangers ... just as there are with cars, trains and ships,’ said robotics expert Professor Martin Smith. Scroll down for video . When one user squeezes their Frebble (pictured), the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. WRIST TO WRIST . Apple is on of the first major firms to push 'virtual connection'. Its Apple Watch, expected to launch in spring next year, includes a feature called 'Digital Touch' that lets wearers 'communicate without words.' Apple said it offers 'fun, spontaneous ways to connect with other Apple Watch wearers, wrist to wrist.' Researchers recently claimed people are so engrossed in their phones, they are unable to accurately read how people are feeling in real-life. This is the result of less face-to-face time interaction, according to a psychologist at the Children's Digital Media Center. It found children in particular are glued to electronic devices for nearly five hours each day, and this could be leaving them emotionally stunted. A separate study recently found that we spend more time on our smartphones than with our partner. The average smartphone user tends to spend two hours (119 minutes) a day using their gadget, the study found. Yet, the amount of time we spend with our other halves per day is just 97 minutes - a third less - on average. The study, from network operator O2 looked at exactly what we use our phones for and how much time each activity takes each day. This includes being able to sketch messages to a friend, send voice memos, and also the ability to send a heartbeat. It reads a user's heart rate, using a built-in sensor, before sending it to a fellow wearer, who feels the heartbeat on their wrist. HOLD HANDS... EVEN IF YOU'RE 100 MILES AWAY . Elsewhere, people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of Freebles. When one user squeezes their Frebble, the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. When combined with Skype, for example, the experience is said to be 'immersive'. Oculus Rift is also changing the way gamers virtually interact with characters - or even fake girlfriends. LIE ON YOUR VIRTUAL GIRLFRIEND'S LAP . Earlier this year, Japanese firm Up Frontier unveiled a bizarre pillow, shaped like a pair of girl's legs. When used with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, it lets men sit next to a virtual girlfriend, 'touch' them and rest their head on her lap. Each of the virtual partners are based on the Unity-chan cartoon character, which is the mascot for an open-source cross-platform game engine called Unity designed by Unity Technologies Japan. This 'lap pillow' mimics the shape of these character's legs. When one user squeezes their Frebble, the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. When combined with Skype, for example, the experience is said to be 'immersive' (pictured) Although many companies have attempted to create gadgets that help virtually connect loved ones, Apple became one of the first major firms to feature it in an upcoming product. Its Apple Watch includes being able to sketch messages to a friend (left), send voice memos but also the ability to send a heartbeat (right) ... OR EVEN FEEL HER BREASTS . The same firm also released a virtual breast simulator. This consisted of a model with a fake pair of breasts fitted with pressure sensors, and which connects to an Oculus Rift headset. When the wearer squeezes the model's breasts, a virtual character squeals with shock and places her arms over her chest. CYBER HUGS ALL ROUND . Elsewhere in Japan, a tech firm recently invented a chair that can hug people. Research has scientifically proven that receiving and giving hugs releases the body's natural 'love drug', oxytocin, calming the nervous system and boosting positive emotions. Earlier this year, Japanese firm Up Frontier unveiled a bizarre pillow shaped like a pair of girls legs.When used with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, it lets men sit next to a virtual girlfriend, 'touch' them and rest their head on her lap.This 'lap pillow' mimics the shape of the character's legs .

When the wearer squeezes the model's breasts, a virtual character squeals with shock and places her arms over her chest (pictured) The 'tranquility chair' is essentially a fabric doll built into a rocking chair. And its creators believe it could be particularly useful for the elderly and those who live alone. THE SEEDY SIDE OF TECHNOLOGY . Meanwhile, although cybersex isn't a new phenomenon, companies are looking at ways to make porn more immersive. Family meals have been decimated by technology, with children often spending their entire time tapping away on their phone - if they can be removed from their bedroom to come to the table at all. However, a free app claims to be able to solve the problem - by locking their gadgets at meal times. The free DinnerTime app can show children how long they have, then lock their phone - and even show them how long is left until they can leave the table. Adult streaming platform SugarDVD, for example, recently announced it's building an app for Oculus Rift that will 'put viewers into the action.' And a recent study alluded to the fact that within 10 years humans could even start swapping human partners for robots. More than a quarter of the participants of a University of Middlesex study said they thought robots or intelligent computers would be capable of feeling human emotions in the future. And almost half (46 per cent) thought technology was evolving too quickly and ‘undermining traditional ways of life.’ ‘Everything that is useful has within it the potential to be abused. So there are dangers inherent in robots; just as there are with cars, trains and ships,’ said Professor Martin Smith who led the study. ‘It has been said that when robots become more intelligent than us, if we are lucky, they might keep us as pets. If we are unlucky they might treat us in the same way as we treat chickens, pigs and cows.’ The rise of the machines was embraced by at least 17 per cent of those questioned who said they'd happily have sex with an android, while 29 per cent admitted they had no problem with other people enjoying android sex. A recent study found that a more than a quarter of the people believe robots or intelligent computers will be capable of feeling human emotion in the future. Andt least 17% of those questioned said they'd happily have sex with an android, similar to the Fembots in Austin Powers (pictured) Family meals have been decimated by technology, with children often spending their entire time tapping away on their phone - if they can be removed from their bedroom to come to the table at all. However, a free app claims to be able to solve the problem - by locking their gadgets at meal times (pictured) More than one in 10 even said they would like a robot child, similar to David in the 2001 movie A.I., and replacing a beloved animal with a robot appealed to nearly a fifth of pet owners. 1. Military/soldiers (45 per cent) 2. Industry/factory workers and labourers (33 per cent) 3. Space exploration/astronauts (33 per cent) 4. Domestic chores/cleaners (23 per cent) 5. Motoring/chauffeurs and taxi drivers (20 per cent) 6. Policing/policemen and women (10 per cent) 7. Transport/train driver, pilots, truckers (8 per cent) 8. Service industry/shop assistant, customer service, waiters, bartenders (8 per cent) 9. Sex and sex workers (4 per cent) 10. Cooking/chefs (3 per cent) TECHNOLOGY TEARING US APART? However, despite these technological connections, researchers recently claimed people are so engrossed in their phones, they are unable to accurately read how people are feeling in real-life.

"Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera and his family have escaped uninjured after a fire ripped through their 7,000-square-foot home in in Charlotte, North Carolina, early Monday. It took roughly 55 firefighters around an hour to extinguish the blaze, with early indicators suggesting it was accidental. The house - situated on the luxury Heydon Hall Circle where properties run upwards of $1million - is now inhabitable due to significant smoke and water damage. It's not yet known how much restoration will cost. Lucky: Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera and his family have escaped uninjured after a fire ripped through their 7,000-square-foot home in in Charlotte, North Carolina, early Monday . According to WSOC-TV, there were six people in the building when the fire started: Rivera, his wife Stephanie, his two brothers and their wives. Rivera's son and daughter were not home at the time. Charlotte Fire Department, Captain Rob Brisley, said that his staff were able to keep flames contained to the roof and attic area, meaning a lot of  household items were saved. He added: 'Anytime you are faced with a fire and your family is displaced it is significant for the homeowner and it is significant for the family. We are just grateful that there are no injuries.' State of shock: Rivera and his wife, Stephanie, stand outside their home . Significant damage: It took roughly 55 firefighters around an hour to extinguish the blaze, with early indicators suggesting it was accidental . Brisley said the fire started around 4am at the large two-story house. He said the alarm system worked properly, alerting the family to leave and the fire department. Fire officials reported seeing heavy smoke and fire coming from the house when they arrived. Television footage also shows blackened windows in the attic of the home. The family will not be able to live at the house until necessary repairs are conducted. 'When you at a fire like this, it is never easy to deal with a family that is being devastated,' Brisley said. 'But you can tell they have good support at all levels. It's a busy week for the city of Charlotte including this family.' According to property records, Rivera purchased the abode in April 2011, a few months after he became the Panthers' head coach. Career-driven: According to property records, Rivera purchased the abode in April 2011, a few months after he became the Panthers' head coach . Rivera's Panthers will play Saturday in an NFC divisional playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks. The fire comes two days after the Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-16 in an NFC wild-card game, Rivera's first postseason win in his four seasons in Carolina. The Panthers were not scheduled to practice Monday. However, Rivera is likely to address the media Monday afternoon as normally scheduled, according to team spokesman Charlie Dayton. This is the second significant off-the-field problem to hit the Panthers in less than a month. Quarterback Cam Newton was injured in a two-vehicle accident on December 9 and was hospitalized overnight with two fractures in his lower back. Newton missed one game but was able to return the following week.","It took roughly 55 firefighters around an hour to extinguish the blaze .

"The granddaughter of legendary Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is selling off a selection of his art work, as well as his famous French villa, for an expected $290million. Marina Picasso, who has famously spoken of Picasso being incredibly cold and distant from herself and her brother when they were children, has put at least seven pieces of art up for grabs. The offering includes a 1921 painting called 'Maternite' for $50m (£35m), his 1911 'Femme a la Mandoline' for $60m (£40m), and a 1923 portrait of his first wife Olga Khokhlova for $60m (£40m). Marina Picasso (pictured), inherited a vast number of pieces of Picasso's art, as well his French villa, following his death . Two of the pieces thought to be up for sale are his 1921 Maternite (left) and the 1911 Femme a la Mandoline (right) This 1923 portrait of Picasso's first wife Olga Khokhlova is also believed to soon be going on the market, at a price of $60m (£40m) Marina Picasso poses in 2013 outside a lavish villa in Cannes once owned by her grandfather. It is now likely to go up for sale alongside several pieces of his art . She is selling the artwork to the clients personally and will meet with prospective buyers in Geneva, according to the The New York Post. Also offered for sale is her grandfather's estate in Cannes, France, the paper reported. Called 'La Californie', he lived at the villa with his second wife Jacqueline Roque, who shot herself aged 59 following his death. It was at La Californie that she and her brother used to visit the artist as children, only to be told to wait at the gate by Roque until he finished working. It has since become a museum and gallery open to the public after it was inherited by Ms Picasso following her grandfather and brothers' deaths. Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, pictured in 1971, was a prolific painter throughout his lifetime . Picasso's 1901 painting 'The Blue Room' (pictured) ranks among his most famous and prized pieces of work, as it ushered in his famed blue period featuring melancholy subjects. The piece is not believed to be for sale . Two other paintings by Picasso to become highly sought after are 'Woman's Head' (left) and 'Harlequin Head' (right). Both were stolen in two separate art heists in recent years . She is the son of Paulo Picasso, who in turn was himself the son of Picasso and his first wife Olga Khokhlova. Although she had a world-renowned grand-father, she has said she grew up in poverty with Picasso unwilling to provide any financial assistance to the family. In modern times, Picasso has become the most stolen artist in history due to his prolific output, recognisable signature and valuable works. He has more than 1,000 paintings registered as stolen, missing or disputed, which is more than twice as many as the next on the list. The artist's 1924 painting, titled 'Still Life With A Cake' (pictured), is valued at more than $300m. It was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998 . This 1905 piece, 'Boy With A Pipe', was painted when Picasso was just 24 years old. When it was sold into private hands in 2004 for $104m (£71m), it became the most expensive painting ever sold .","Marina Picasso is to sell $290million worth of her grandfather's artwork .

"Students at Beverly Hills High School back for the start of a new semester were evacuated after a bomb threat was called in, police said. The high school received the bomb threat around 11:10am on Monday, the Beverly Hills Police Department said Monday morning. Beverly Hills students were evacuated into Roxbury Park, which is located across the street from the high school. Police had asked parents not to show up either at the park or the high school. No device was discovered on the school's premises, authorities said. Evacuation: Students were led to Roxbury Park after Beverly Hills High School was evacuated Monday over a bomb threat that was called in . Monday was the first day of the second semester at the high school. KTLA reported that both a K-9 unit and three police officers entered a building on campus as part of the search - and that 'hundreds of students' were evacuated Monday. Police later said Monday afternoon that 'The Beverly Hills High School campus has been cleared by officers and determined to be safe.' Police also stated the high school's administration decided to cancel classes for the rest of the day in a precautionary measure. Students were being reunited with parents Monday afternoon by the administration, authorities said. The high school is known for counting dozens of celebrities as its former students, a handful of which include Angelina Jolie, Nicolas Cage, Lenny Kravitz, Leighton Meester, Richard Dreyfuss and Jamie Lee Curtis.

"Labour was forced to backtrack over key public spending commitments yesterday as the Tories warned of a hidden tax and debt bombshell costing every working family £1,200 if Ed Miliband wins power. In an echo of the 1992 election campaign, Chancellor George Osborne, flanked by four senior Cabinet colleagues, unveiled Treasury figures suggesting that Labour has already made almost £21billion of unfunded spending pledges. Conservative strategists are planning to echo the party’s ‘tax bombshell’ warning about Labour ahead of the 1992 election – the last time it won power outright. And focusing his fire on Mr Miliband, Mr Osborne insisted the Labour leader was ‘just not up to the job’ – this time an echo of the Tories’ attacks on Neil Kinnock. Chancellor George Osborne (centre) took the fight to Labour flanked by (left to right) Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, Home Secretary Theresa May and Commons leader William Hague . The Tories wheeled out five of the Cabinet big guns to show their team stretches beyond David Cameron . The campaign launch infuriated Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who condemned what he called a ‘dodgy Tory dossier riddled with untruths and errors on every page’. But Mr Balls quickly declared that he would not reverse many of the austerity measures included in the document that Labour has spent years criticising – including pay curbs for teachers, nurses, Armed Forces and other public sector workers. He also insisted cuts in arts funding, condemned repeatedly by Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, would go ahead, while a £500million policy to stop councils dumping food waste in landfill sites has been abandoned. Senior Conservatives said they were delighted Labour was being forced to confirm that many of the cuts it has attacked since 2010 would not in fact be reversed if they take power in May. An 82-page document set out the cost of every policy announcement by Labour since declaring it would make no unfunded commitments in mid-2013. Figures were drawn up by Treasury officials under rules allowing Opposition policies to be costed by civil servants. The document detailed £5.2billion in spending cuts which Labour has opposed, which the Tories assumed would be reversed, and £18billion in new spending commitments they said had been made by Mr Miliband and his frontbenchers. Only £2.5billion in new taxes and cuts have been identified by Labour, leaving it with a total of £20.746billion to find in 2015/16, according to the Tories. The Chancellor and the four other Cabinet ministers published a dossier claiming Labour had made more than £20billion in unfunded spending commitments in the first year of the next Parliament . Businesswoman and Apprentice star Karren Brady, a Tory peer, was in the audience at the event in Millbank Tower, Westminster . Taking questions from journalists, Mr Osborne dismissed suggestions that the document was 'nonsense' The document said voters would have reasonably believed Labour intended to cancel next year’s local authority cuts, which would mean spending an extra £3.35billion of taxpayers’ money. It highlighted 14 quotes from Labour frontbenchers attacking austerity measures affecting everything from libraries to public lavatories and street lighting. Mr Osborne, joined at a press conference by Home Secretary Theresa May, Commons Leader William Hague, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, accused Labour of trying to ‘have it both ways’, opposing coalition cuts but refusing to admit it would mean higher taxes and borrowing. Mr Balls insisted Labour did not have any unfunded commitments and questioned the involvement of Treasury officials in producing the document. ‘It isn’t an impartial exercise, but a political smear based on false assumptions made by Tory advisers, including dozens of claims which are not even Labour’s policies,’ he said. The Shadow Chancellor, who derided the ‘Politburo-style’ line-up of Cabinet ministers, said Labour would stick to spending budgets for 2015/16 inherited from the coalition, and would therefore make no money available for public sector pay rises that year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg attacked both the main parties and set out his own plans to hit the wealthy with higher taxes to fund more NHS spending. He said: ‘Boy, if there was a lot of weary cynicism already, after the last three days it has just gone through the roof. A lot of the public must be thinking: “Are we really going to have months more of this to and fro between Labour and the Conservatives?”.’ Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold was unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon . Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold was unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon yesterday. The businesswoman who brought the Rampant Rabbit vibrator to Britain sat in the front row as George Osborne and his colleagues attacked Labour over spending. Miss Gold, 54, pictured, who has a £240million fortune, transformed her father David’s business Ann Summers by making the sex-toy and lingerie chain more female-friendly. It has 150 stores and 7,000 party planners. A Tory source said it had not been decided how prominent she would be in the campaign, but added: ‘She’s a successful entrepreneur. I think we should praise success rather than follow Labour’s culture of envy.’ Miss Gold said: ‘I have always been a supporter of the Conservative Party.’","Tories warn of hidden £1,200 tax and debt bill if Labour wins the election .

"Authorities are searching for a 7-month-old infant after a pickup truck, carrying the baby, rolled into a Florida river. A 46-year-old man held his infant nephew in the bed of the pickup truck parked on the edge of the Withlacoochee River in Dade City, with the truck's rear facing into the water, according to theTampa Bay Times. The man and the infant were among relatives having a picnic at the river's edge when the pickup rolled down a steep embankment, carrying the two into the river at around 6pm. Swept: A 46-year-old man and his infant nephew were swept into the Withlacoochee river after a pickup truck (photographed) rolled down an embankment . Truck: The man was pinned under the truck's engine block as he struggled to jump to shore while holding his nephew . The man tried to save the baby by jumping to shore, but was pulled under water. The truck toppled over and the man was  pinned beneath the  engine block, the Times reports. Panicked family members jumped into the river but could not find the man or the baby. Pasco County deputies responded around 6.30pm and found the man's body underneath the half-submerged truck 30 minutes later, WTSP reports. Deputies continued searching for the infant throughout the night, the Times reports, but their search was hindered due to strong river currents, darkness, and alligators. The Pasco County Dive Team and Marine Unit, along with officers with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are continuing the search for the infant. Hindered: Deputies continued searching the river for the infant throughout the night,  but their search was hindered due to strong river currents, darkness, and alligators . The commission had alligator traps on hand as they searched the river as the six-person dive team searched around the truck. The truck was pulled from the river at around 10pm. Authorities say that what was once a life-saving mission has now become a recovery mission for the body of the baby boy, ABC reports. The identities of the man and the infant have not been made public. The incident began as an outing, with the man, his nephew, and more than 50 family members and friends spending the day at the Withlacoochee River Park, according to the Times. When the park closed, the family parked their pickup at the river's edge and let down the tailgate at the private picnic area. Soon, what was once a fun-filled day at the park turned into a tragedy. Melanie Snow, Pasco sheriff's spokeswoman, told the Times Sunday that though conditions may be difficult, there are no plans to call off the search for the 7-month old boy. The searched continued Monday morning. 'At this point we have no plan to call off the search,' she said. 'We'll keep searching until we find the baby.'","A man and his 7-month old nephew were swept into Florida's Withlacoochee river after a pickup truck rolled down an embankment Sunday night .

"Two-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain is considered to be one of the most versatile actresses in Hollywood and has had her pick of what many would consider to be dream roles. But when it came to signing up for her latest film project - mobster movie A Most Violent Year - the 39-year-old has revealed that she approached the role with a rather unique mindset. 'I wanted to play [politician] Dick Cheney,' she told Yahoo Style about the movie, which sees her stepping into the shoes of Anna Morales, the wife of an immigrant who sets out to build up his own business in New York in the 1980s. Scroll down for video . Dark side: Jessica Chastain couldn't wait for the opportunity to play an 'unpopular' character . Chemistry: Jessica and her co-star Oscar Isaac have known each other since studying at Julliard School . Casting call: The 39-year-old actress suggested to director JC Chandor that he audition Oscar for the role . In other words, the actress was eager to sink her teeth into a role that would give her a chance to explore the complexities of being perceived as the bad guy, which is the way that many people have portrayed former Vice President Mr Cheney - a vocal supporter of the CIA's use of torture during America's war against terrorism. And unlike her previous roles, which have, more often than not, seen her working for the good guy, her latest starring part enabled her to experiment with a much darker side, as her character struggles to support her husband in his pursuit of the American Dream. 'She has more authority [than Kay in The Godfather],' Jessica says of Anna, comparing her to the central matriarch in infamous gangster movie The Godfather. 'She knows what she is doing. She knows she's cooking the books.' When it came to finding the perfect co-star, Jessica also exercised a fair amount of her own authority, immediately suggesting to director JC Chandor that he think about casting her fellow Julliard School graduate Oscar Isaac in the role. 'We had never acted together in school - he was a few years behind me,' she explained. 'But I always wanted to do something with him.' Star quality: Both Oscar and Jessica have received numerous awards nods for their roles in A Most Violent Year . 'Sheer evil': For her next part, Jessica will take on the role of a tabloid editor who tries to take down a Hollywood star . 'She knows what she is doing': Jessica explained that her character in A Most Violent Year shows a sense of real authority throughout the film . Both actors have already earned plenty of award nominations for their roles in the gangster flick; The National Board of Review named it the best film and Oscar as the best actor, while Jessica was given a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress. And as for Jessica's eagerness to play the unpopular characters, the movie has done little to dull her enthusiasm. In fact, the Zero Dark Thirty star has already signed up to play yet another villain, this time in director Xavier Dolan's The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, in which she will take on the role of a tabloid editor who attempts to 'take down' Hollywood's golden boy, played by Kit Harrington. 'We're going to have so much fun doing this,' the director told movie news website Thompson on Hollywood. 'She's a mega tricky villain. Like full-on b***h. I'm a fan of what she does and I can see all that she can do, but she has not played this part. It's a very specific part. It's sheer evil.'",The 37-year-old two-time Oscar nominee plays a mobster's wife in newly-released film A Most Violent Year .
"If you’ve piled on the pounds over the Christmas break, your belt might be feeling a little tight. But in the very near future, that belt could adjust to accommodate all those extra inches automatically. A smart prototype, called Belty, syncs wirelessly to an app to track steps, loosen and tighten as you move, and even warns you when you’re being lazy. This connected belt, called Belty (pictured), monitors the wearers waistline measurements and warns them if they're putting on weight. It also automatically loosens when the wearer sits, and tightens when the wearer stands. The product is still under development but it should be on the market by the end of the year . The metal and plastic model was created by French firm Emiota and is on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It syncs wirelessly to an app, which is used to input the wearer’s waistline measurement. If the waistline begins to expand, the belt warns the user via this app that they're putting on weight. The leather XOO Belt looks like a normal belt, but has a charger built into the buckle. It is held in place using magnets so it can be easily connected and disconnected. The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours. The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which contains a flexible battery. Belty automatically adjusts itself to be the perfect fit. When sitting down, the belt expands to give the wearer more breathing space, and it automatically tightens when the wearer stands up again. It does this by tracking tension on sensors fitted throughout the belt. Belty will also warn wearers if they’ve been sat still for too long, giving them a nudge to get up and walk around. The app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings, meaning it doesn’t become too tight, or too loose, when automatically adjusting. Plus, if the wearer leaves their fitness tracker at home, the belt includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to record steps and exercise levels, which also syncs with the app. It was created by Paris-based designers Bertrand Dupla and Carine Coulm. The product is still under development but Mr Dupla said he hopes to have Belty on the market by the end of the year, with prices yet to be announced.

"Sony's top corporate executive has broken his silence on the recent hacking assault against Sony's film division, saying his employees have been the victims of a 'vicious and malicious cyber-attack'. CEO Kazuo Hirai opened a press event at the International CES trade show on Monday by acknowledging he 'would be remiss' if he didn't mention the controversy over the Sony comedy, 'The Interview.' Hackers calling themselves the 'Guardians of Peace' managed to cripple the computer systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment in late November, before subsequently releasing a trove of sensitive corporate and employee records. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Kazuo Hirai slammed the attack as vicious and vowed to champion freedom of expression . The FBI has since blamed the North Korean government of orchestrating the attack, apparently in ire over the film's portrayal of an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Hirai said he is proud of his employees for standing against 'the extortionist efforts of criminals.' Sony initially said the film would not be released to major theaters in the face of threats by the hackers. However, after the company was criticized for that decision, it scrambled to release the film to independent theaters and online. Hirai did not offer any new information about the hack, but he said that freedom of speech and expression are 'very important' to Sony and its entertainment business. Controversy: The FBI concluded that the hack was from North Korea in retaliation against The Interview . He went on to thank the telecommunications and Internet companies who helped with the release, and 'most importantly the people who have gone out to see the movie in theaters or through various online venues.' He also joked about another Sony film release, saying: 'By the way, Annie is also a great movie as well.'

"A small bowl of porridge each day could be the key to a long and healthy life, researchers have found. A major study of more than 100,000 people for more than 14 years found that whole grains reduce the risk of dying from heart disease. They say a daily 28 gram serving of whole grains was associated with a 5% lower total mortality. Scroll down for video . Every daily 28 gram serving of whole grains was associated with a 5% lower total mortality. Each serving of whole grains also cut deaths from cardiovascular disease by 9%. Whole grains are cereal grains that are not refined and contain the 'germ', or seed embryo, which is packed with nutrients. Examples of whole grain foods include whole-wheat or rye bread, brown rice, whole grain pasta, and breakfast cereals such as muesli and shredded wheat. Although whole grains are widely believed to be beneficial for health it is the first research to look at whether they have a long-term impact on lifespan. Researchers followed more than 100,000 people for more than 14 years monitoring their diets and health outcomes. Eating whole grain foods reduces death rates from heart disease, but not cancer, a study has shown. Scientists looked at data on more than 74,000 women and 43,000 men to investigate associations between whole grain consumption and death risk. Over a period of more than two decades, a total of 26,920 deaths were recorded. After adjusting for factors such as age, smoking and body mass index (BMI) that may have influenced the results, the researchers found that people who ate whole grains were less likely to die than those who did not. Every daily 28 gram serving of whole grains was associated with a 5% lower total mortality. Each serving of whole grains also cut deaths from cardiovascular disease by 9%. However, there was no evidence of an impact on cancer death rates. Writing in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, the authors, led by Dr Hongyu Wu, from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, US, concluded: 'These findings further support current dietary guidelines that recommend increasing whole grain consumption to facilitate primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease and also provide promising evidence that suggests a diet enriched with whole grains may confer benefits towards extended life expectancy.'

Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This is an interesting study and reinforces existing dietary recommendations to eat more foods high in fibre. 'But this study didn't look at what might be the cause of the link between eating whole grains and reduced death rates for cardiovascular disease. 'People with a higher intake of whole grains also tended to have a healthier overall lifestyle and diet so it might not be the whole grains alone that are having the benefit in relation to cardiovascular disease. 'But at this time of year when we are all making resolutions to eat better, switching to whole grain versions of bread, breakfast cereals, pasta and rice is a simple change to make.'","Harvard study of more than 100,000 people for more than 14 years found that whole grains reduce the risk of dying from heart disease .

"A Bangkok Airways flight out of Chiang Mai Airport to Thailand's capital city was cancelled after a fire lantern was sucked into the plane's engine. A number of lanterns were spotted in and around the airport as the Airbus A320 taxied to its stand, with one coming to close for comfort and getting stuck to the turbine fan. The plane was scheduled to return to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport after landing in Chiang Mai on New Year's Day. A fire lantern got caught in a Bangkok Airways plane causing the plane to be out of action . The lantern was discovered in the fan turbine of the plane at Chiang Mai Airport . The flight was cancelled and the plane was later flown back to Bangkok, without passengers, for further testing. The incident has forced police in Thailand to clamp down on the popular custom of flying paper lanterns during celebrations, with a clampdown on all lanterns flying before 9pm. Speaking to Straits Times Royal Thai Police spokesman Pol Maj-General Prawut Thawornsiri said: 'Police have set clear measures about releasing 'kom loy' (flying lanterns). 'It can be done after 9pm but during the New Year holiday, many people released their lanterns in the evening.' Past incidents involving floating lanterns impacting air travel and causing delays have resulted in police threatening to invoke the ultimate penalty. 'Releasing paper lanterns near airports can be very dangerous to the safety of aircraft and it is a criminal offence,' said Police Major General Amnuay Nimmano. Passengers were left stranded at Chaing Mai as the flight was cancelled and further tests were carried out . Thai police have put an exclusion zone around airports for those caught flying fire lanterns . 'Those who violate the law will be dealt with accordingly and could face life in prison or the death penalty.' Back in November for the Yi Peng festival, thousands of lanterns, known as khom loy, lit up the night sky like a swarm of jellyfish . More than 150 flights in and out of Chiang Mai were cancelled or delayed during the peak of the holiday, from November 5 to November 7, affecting around 20,000 passengers. The air traffic control centre in Chiang Mai province declared a three-mile zone around the airport where people were advised not to launch lanterns during the festival. Several airlines, including Thai Airways, were forced to their flight schedules to give way to the lantern floating, which takes place mainly after dark. The festival coincides with Thailand's Loi Krathong festival, during which Thais float small rafts on rivers to ask for forgiveness from the goddess of water. They also believe that launching lanterns will rid them of bad fortune. Revellers were advised that they may float lanterns near the airport after 9pm, when the air traffic is cleared up.","Airbus A320 discovered with lantern attached within turbine fan .

"Habitable super-Earths - that have up to five times the mass of our own planet - could possess vast, long-lasting oceans. Oceans cover more than two thirds of the Earth's surface and are continually replenished by volcanic activity dragging up water buried deep underground. And now a new study indicates that habitable zone planets may be even better at establishing and maintaining these large bodies of water. Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics believe that habitable super-Earths with up to five times the mass of our own planet, could hold vast oceans. This image shows an artist's impression of a gas giant planet rising over the horizon of an alien waterworld . A planet occupying a star's habitable zone is in an orbit where temperatures are mild enough to allow the existence of liquid surface water, making lakes, rivers and oceans possible. Most scientists agree that liquid water is needed for the development of life as we know it. Dr Laura Schaefer, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led the study said: 'When people consider whether a planet is in the habitable zone, they think about its distance from the star and its temperature. Computer simulations  recently revealed the vital role oceans play in moderating climate. Without large expanses of water on a planet’s surface, seasonal temperature rises would be too rapid and weather too extreme to provide a comfortable home for life. Even a planet in the habitable zone of its star - the orbital region where temperatures are mild enough to permit liquid surface water - is likely to be sterile and lifeless without oceans. In our own solar system, barren Mars has no oceans despite being in the sun’s habitable zone, the researchers point out. As a result, its air temperature swings over a range of 100°C. Factoring oceans into climate models was vital to knowing whether a planet could develop and sustain life, said the researchers from the University of East Anglia’s School of Maths. 'However, they should also think about oceans, and look at super-Earths to find a good sailing or surfing destination.' Studies have shown that the Earth's mantle holds several oceans' worth of water that has been pulled underground by the movements of tectonic plates and sinking ocean floors. Without water being brought back to the surface by volcanism, the oceans would soon disappear. Dr Schaefer's team used computer simulations to verify that the same recycling process that keeps the Earth's ocean basins filled with water also takes place on super-Earths. In fact, oceans were even more likely to be found on planets having two to four times the mass of the Earth. Super-Earth oceans also persisted for a very long time - at least 10 billion years, assuming they were not boiled away by a swelling 'red giant' star near the end of its life. The largest planet studied, with five times the Earth's mass, did not develop oceans for around a billion years due to its thicker crust. 'This suggests that if you want to look for life, you should look at older super-Earths,' said Dr Schaefer.

Without water being brought back to the surface by volcanism, the oceans would soon disappear. Artist's impression of a super-Earth pictured .

Complex life was most likely to be found on super-Earth planets about 5.5 billion years old, around a billion years older than the Earth, said the scientists. Scientists have so far confirmed the existence of more than 1,739 planets outside our solar system, according to information from the Nasa Exoplanet Archive. There are thousands more unconfirmed 'candidates', and a total of 452 multiple planet systems have also been logged. The findings were presented at the American Astronomical Society annual meeting in Washington DC.","Studies have shown Earth's mantle holds several oceans' worth of water .

"Pat Schuerman, 50, says she no longer leaves the house because insecurities over her  psoriasis have left her feeling 'hideous' and like a 'leper' A woman has described how unsightly patches of silvery 'bark' are forming all over her body as a result of the skin condition psoriasis. Pat Schuerman, 50, is covered in thick, red welts and rough, silvery scales, which she described as 'looking like bark' or 'plaster of Paris'. She is constantly itching and feels 'hideous', but despite trying a range of treatments to help manage her condition, nothing has worked. She now no longer leaves the house due to her insecurities, and has also developed arthritis in her joints - a problem related to her skin condition - making walking painful. Her insecurities grew after she was thrown out a library and swimming pool due to psoriasis, which also affects celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, LeAnne Rimes and The Only Way Is Essex's Jessica Wright. 'I was asked to leave our local library because people complained I was getting flakes on the keyboard,' Miss Schuerman from Arizona, U.S., said. 'They thought I might be contagious and wouldn't let me back without a letter from a doctor. 'Then one day, I built enough courage to go swimming, but within seconds of stepping out the changing rooms I was told I couldn't get in the water. 'I'm treated like a modern-day leper so now I barely leave the house.' According to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, 125 million people worldwide — 2 to 3 per cent of the total global population — have psoriasis. It is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. It occurs when the process by which the body produces skin cells is accelerated. Normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months, but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days. The resulting build-up of skin cells creates the silvery, bark-like patches that Miss Schuerman suffers. It is believed this happens as the immune system attacks healthy skin cells by mistake. Miss Schuerman has been thrown out of shops, swimming pools and bars as the managers worried her condition was contagious. She now never leaves the house. Her arms are pictured, left and right . The condition causes red, flaky, patches of skin covered with silvery scales to form on her body.  There is no cure, and treatments to manage the symptoms have not worked. Pictured is her back covered in patches . Miss Schuerman first noticed the symptoms of the condition in her early 20s, when her skin began to become dry and flaky, with patches appearing, and she had excessive dandruff. 'Even the dandruff shampoo I'd been using hadn't helped,' she said. 'I was only 24 and took pride in my appearance. But most days I looked like I'd stepped out of a snow storm.' 'It was getting worse by the day. The psoriasis was spreading.' Taking her clothes off was a nightmare, as her skin came away as she pulled off the garment. 'I inched my sock down my leg and peeled the top layer of my skin off with it,' she said. 'Day by day, my body was slowly being swallowed up by a thick covering of scales and sores, even between my fingers and toes.' She was finally diagnosed at age 24, but diagnosis brought little relief as there is no cure for the condition. 'The doctor explained it's a skin condition that can cause flaky red patches of skin covered with silvery scales,' Miss Schuerman said. 'They told me there was no cure but that most people are only affected in small areas so it would be manageable with creams and medication.' Miss Schuerman says the silvery patches look like bark or plaster of Paris. She suffers constant itching, and has difficulty taking on and off her clothes because they stick to her skin, causing sores. Her legs are pictured, right and left . 'The itching drives me crazy,' she continued. 'My skin is so dry and brittle that my constant scratching leaves me red and bleeding. 'Even though I slather myself in moisturising cream in the morning, by evening I have to peel my clothes away from my skin, where they've welded themselves to my weeping wounds. 'The affected bits looked like thick bark or as if I'd been covered in plaster of Paris.' She has tried an array of treatments to reduce her symptoms, but claims nothing has worked. 'It's on my legs, arms and torso,' Miss Schuerman said. 'It's even between my fingers and toes. It's hideous. I've tried creams, tablets and UV light treatment but nothing's made any difference. 'I even bathed in tar because someone said it would help. It didn't.' She said the physical pain she endures from the psoriasis is nothing compared to the insecurities the condition has left her with. As well as the library and swimming pool, she has been thrown out of bars, shops and restaurants. Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back but can appear anywhere on the body. Around two per cent of the UK population, 1.8million people, are affected by the condition, which can start at any age. For most, psoriasis develops before the age of 35 and the condition affects men and women equally. The severity of the condition varies from person to person, for some causing a minor irritation, while for others it has a major impact on their quality of life. The condition develops when the body's immune system starts to attack healthy skin cells. Normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months, but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days. File picture . Psoriasis is a long-lasting, or chronic, condition that involves periods when a sufferer will have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by more severe outbreaks. The condition occurs when the process by which the body produces skin cells is accelerated. Normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months, but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days. The resulting build-up of skin cells creates the patches associated with psoriasis. While the condition is not fully understood, it is thought the increased production of skin cells is related to a problem with a person's immune system. For those suffering with the condition, their immune system attacks healthy skin cells by mistake. Psoriasis can run in families and there is thought to be a genetic element to the condition. Many sufferers will experience symptoms following a certain event, a trigger. A trigger can include injury to a person's skin, throat infections and using certain medications. The condition is not contagious, so cannot be spread from person to person. There is no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can be used to improve symptoms and the appearance of the affected skin patches. In most cases a sufferer will be prescribed creams and ointments to ease the symptoms. If these prove ineffective, doctors may opt for phototherapy treatment. It involves exposing the skin to certain types of ultraviolet light. In the most severe cases, systemic treatments are used. They are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the body.

Between 10 and 30 per cent of people who have psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, according to studies, as both are caused by inflammation. Inflammation causes the joints to swell and become painful, sometimes restricting movement . Recently, Miss Schuerman's long-held fears about the psoriasis spreading to her face have become a reality. 'Last month I noticed a patch of dry skin by my eyebrow,' she said. 'I live in constant fear of being swallowed up by my skin condition forever. It's like I'm turning into a tree.' However, despite having to battle insecurities and physical pain, Miss Schuerman remains positive. 'I know what's on the inside of a person, not the outside, that counts,' she said. 'I hope others will come to understand that too, and accept me for who I am, not judge.'

"Sat-navs may help motorists negotiate the trickiest of ring roads and even avoid speeding fines, but the urgent instruction of ‘turn around when possible’ is enough to panic the calmest of drivers. Now, experts claim the instruction could mean more than a navigational nightmare – it could also put a driver and other road users at risk of a serious crash. A survey has revealed that one in seven drivers who use a sat-nav admit making impromptu illegal or risky manoeuvres to correct mistakes when following sat-nav instructions. A survey has revealed that one in seven drivers who use a sat-nav admit making illegal or risky manoeuvres to correct mistakes when following sat-nav instructions. A stock image of a sat-nav is shown . The statistics, gathered by road safety charity Brake and insurance firm Direct Line, suggest that urgent u-turns are not the only danger. The study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat-nav. This number rose to 11 per cent of drivers aged under 24, but dropped to below five per cent for motorists older than 35 year’s old. If used correctly, sat-navs are a safer option than a driver looking away from the road to a paper map, but there is fresh evidence to suggest that relying on the gadget can make individuals drive faster, paying less attention to hazards on the road. A total of seven per cent of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted to being distracted by the stereo, while 12 per cent said they took their full attention away from the road because of passengers. The study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat-nav.  Previous studies have found that people are more than four times likely to have a crash (stock image) if they are multitasking while driving . A total of three per cent of people said they were distracted by their smartphone, while two per cent were preoccupied by food and drink. Brake has called on drivers to programme their sat-nav before they set off on a journey and not to fiddle with any gadget while driving. Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive, Brake, said: ‘The sat-nav is there to help you keep focused on driving rather than worry about directions, but it's not there to make all the decisions for you. ‘Driving is an unpredictable activity, so you still need to look at signs, particularly those warning of hazards or speed limits, and watch for people and unexpected problems. ‘For many drivers there is an increasing array of technological temptations that can pose a deadly distraction; it’s essential to resist to ensure you and others arrive safely.’ Research by Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in Massachusetts has shown that the vast majority of people are unable to multitask at the wheel without their driving being affected. A study of in-vehicle video footage  estimated that 22 per cent of crashes could be caused, at least in part, by driver distraction. It also showed that drivers who perform a secondary task at the wheel are two to three times more likely to crash. Other studies have found that more complex secondary tasks, like talking on a mobile phone or texting, increase crash risk even more. Researchers at the University of Western Australia have shown that talking on a phone (hands-free or hand-held) makes drivers four times more likely to have a serious crash, and texting raises the odds further. A study by Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in Massachusetts found that while drivers may think they can multitask, 98 per cent are not able to divide their attention without a significant deterioration in driving performance. Scientists at Royal Holloway University of London found that using a sat-nav can increase driver speed and reduce observation, but research has also found that using a voice-based sat-nav is safer than using a visual display or paper map. Listening to loud music has been found to slow drivers’ reaction times, and encourages aggressive driving, according to researchers at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. Monash University Accident Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia, found that fiddling with a stereo while driving leads to slower reaction times and more errors such as accidentally lane drifting. Devices such as cruise control, aimed at reducing the driver’s workload, can also have the unintended side-effect of making drivers less attentive and more susceptible to fatigue, a study by the University of Toronto concludes. A total of seven per cent of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted to being distracted by the stereo, while 12 per cent said they took their full attention away from the road because of passengers (stock image) Furthermore, drivers who text and talk on a phone while driving are two to three times more likely to crash than those who are concentrating on the road. The charity has called on the British government to regulate the use of built in entertainment and information systems in cars, which show social media updates and traffic warnings on the dashboard, for example. ‘If these devices are used for tasks such as emailing and social media updates while driving, they are potentially as distracting and dangerous as using a mobile phone,’ it said, suggesting tougher penalties for distracted drivers, including much higher fines for those caught using phones. Brake also wants to ban hands-free kits due to recent research highlighting they do not make driving with a phone much safer.","Survey by road safety charity, Brake, found one in 14 drivers have narrowly avoided a crash because they were distracted by a sat-nav while driving .

"Police and forensic experts were left baffled after what appeared to be a severed human finger, proved to be nothing more than a piece of convincing coral. A local man had been walking his dog along the shore of Lee Point Beach in Darwin's north on Sunday when he made the initially horrifying discovery. He promptly called triple zero, fearing that the flesh coloured object which even appears to have a fingernail, was evidence of a homicide. Police were left baffled after a local man found a suspected finger (pictured) on Sunday . Officers who arrived at the scene also treated the discovery as suspicious, assuming the suspected finger was likely to be human remains. 'The location was recorded and the finger, complete with fingernail, seized and sent for forensic examination,' watch commander Brendan Lindner said. However, the forensic tests soon came back inconclusive and the finger was sent to pathology for further analysis. Meanwhile officers at the Casuarina Police Station were left debating over whether the finger was real.

"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh admits that no one will find much joy as jury selection begins today in the trial of marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, but that the process is a necessary step for the city to find closure. Projected to last for months, the trial 'is going to be a tough time' for families who 'are going to relive what happened on that horrific day,' he told reporters. Still, 'the judicial process has to take place' for those same families to really heal, Walsh argued. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh admits that no one will find much joy as marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial gets underway, but that it was a necessary step for the city to find closure . Three people were killed and more than 260 injured in the double bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013. Among the dead was an 8-year-old boy. Tsarnaev is accused of orchestrating the bombings with brother Tamerlan, using a pair of pressure cooker bombs. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with the police three days later. Tsarnaev was found hiding in the a dry-docked boat outside the town of Watertown, just six miles northwest of Boston's city limits. He's since entered a not guilty plea to each of the more than two dozen charges he's facing. Defense attorneys have pushed for a trial delay and change of venue but have had both requests denied by a federal judge . Walsh told ABC News that he didn't believe the trial would be enough for the victims to find closure, calling it instead a 'chapter in their life' they could close without having to 'worry about the court case, not worry about what evidence is being admitted and what evidence is not being admitted.' Beyond telling journalists that he had faith in the city's citizens to be a fair jury, he wouldn't comment on the trial itself. Defense attorneys have pushed for a trial delay and change of venue but have had both requests denied by a federal judge. Because the damage caused by the bombings was so far-reaching throughout the community, and because of the case's high profile nature, Tsarnaev's attorneys argued that 'every member of the jury pool is, in effect, an actual victim of the charged offenses.'","Projected to last for months, the trial 'is going to be a tough time' for families who 'are going to relive what happened on that horrific day,' mayor Marty Walsh told reporters .

"The owner of the St. Louis Rams has announced intentions to build a massive new NFL stadium and entertainment complex in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. Stan Kroenke revealed the grand plan to the LA Times on Monday. In addition to an 80,000-seat stadium, the billionaire and his partners are proposing an adjacent 6,000-seat performance venue. Los Angeles was home to the Rams from 1946 to 1994 and, as St. Louis scrambles to come up with a plan for a new stadium in order to retain the team, the City of Angels appears ever more likely to get a pro football team after two decades without one. Returning to LA? St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke has announced grand plans for an 80,000 seat NFL stadium in Los Angeles. The Rams called LA home from 1946 to 1994 . Kroenke and his Rams currently have a 30-year lease at St. Louis' outdated Edward Jones Dome. Unless the city reaches an agreement on a new venue with Kroenke by March, he has the option of converting the lease to month-to-month. The Rams' lease requires the Edward Jones Dome to remain among the top quarter of the 32 NFL stadiums, based on various criteria. The Rams and St. Louis remain $575 million apart in the negotiations, the LA Times reports. The city along with Governor Jay Nixon were expected to announce a proposal by the end of January. To help make his gleaming plans a reality, Kroenke has partnered with Stockbridge Capital Group, who own the 238-acre Hollywood Park racetrack adjacent to the Ignlewood plot where Kroenke intends to place his so-called City of Champions Revitalization Project. 'We are excited to unveil an expanded plan that will bring a world-class sports and entertainment district to Hollywood Park,' Stockbridge founder Terry Fancher told the LA Times in a statement. 'We are committed to working with [the Kroenke Group] to build a project that will put Inglewood back on the map as home of the truly great sports and entertainment venues.' Kroenke purchased a plot of land in Inglewood adjacent to the Hollywood Park track (pictured). The park owners are working togather on the proposal, which also contains a 6,000 seat performance venue . Speculation about Kroenke's intentions has run rampant since he purchased the land one year ago, meanwhile this newest Los Angeles NFL stadium proposal is among two others that currently have clearance to be built. One is the Farmers Field proposal located in downtown Los Angeles. The other is real estate billionaire Ed Roski's proposal in City of Industry, the LA Times reports. While these two projects are ahead of the game in terms of bureaucratic hurdles, neither project is backed by a team owner as Kroenke's is. However, as the LA Times notes, the threat of moving to Los Angeles has been a powerful team owners have leveraged in the past to entice their home cities and states into okaying new stadium deals. Kroenke and his associates say they plan to have enough signatures to get the proposal on Inglewood's municipal ballot in 2015. Outgrowing St. Louis? The city of St. Louis has until March to come up with plans for an updated stadium or the Rams can convert their lease to month-to-month .

"The death of a Pennsylvania college student whose body was pulled from a river near his home was likely an accident, his family are now saying. The disappearance of 21-year-old Shane Montgomery in Philadelphia on Thanksgiving Day caused a widespread search and led to a $65,000 reward for information about his whereabouts. On Saturday, volunteer divers discovered the West Chester University senior's body in the Schuylkill River near Kildare's Irish Pub in Philadelphia, where he had spent the night drinking until 1.45am on November 27. The medical examiner's office has conducted an autopsy to determine a cause an manner of death, but has not yet released the results. Found: The body of Shane Montgomery, pictured, was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on Saturday, close to where he was last seen on November 27 . Bittersweet: His heartbroken parents, Karen and Kevin Montgomery,spoke with the media after their son's body was discovered today . Search: Teams had been searching the nearby canal for the last month but turned up no signs. Montgomery's body was found Saturday in the water behind the Manayunk Street Brewery . However, Montgomery's uncle Kevin Verbrugghe told the Allentown Morning Call that investigators believe his nephew's death was accidental. Verbrugghe did not elaborate on how they think Montgomery died. The young man's body has been released back to the custody of his grieving parents, Karen and Kevin, who are planning the funeral on Friday at their Catholic parish in the Philadelphia neighborhood of Manayunk. 'Today we have done what we have promised,' Karen Montgomery told NBC Philadelphia on Sunday. 'We have found and we brought Shane home.' Two weeks earlier divers found a set of keys belonging to Montgomery in the same section of water after they were tested on his parents' house. Montgomery was last seen leaving a bar in Manayunk in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day, having returned home from college for the holidays, and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot. Recovered: Different clues lead search crews to Montgomery's body, especially the discovery of a set of keys nearby (left) in the Schuylkill River two weeks ago. Manayunk is a neighborhood of Philadelphia (top right) A bereft Karen Montgomery is comforted as she gets ready to speak with the media . Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters . The search predominantly focused on the nearby Manayunk Canal, with police not suspecting foul play. His heartbroken parents were sure something unfortunate had happened to their son. 'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home,' Karen Montgomery previously said. Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in Manayunk - a neighborhood of Philadelphia  -at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table. Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, had a distinct Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder . He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it. One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave. Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning. The footage has been withheld by authorities. The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him. His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.'","The body of Shane Montgomery was recovered from the Schuylkill River in Manayunk, Philadelphia, on Saturday .

"Gary Griffiths has been jailed for 16 years for trying to kill his ex-girlfriend by setting fire to her house . A jilted boyfriend who sent his ex-girlfriend a chilling 'goodbye' text before setting fire to her home in an attempt to kill her has been jailed for 16 years. Gary Griffiths, 44, poured petrol through Tracey Powell's letterbox along with a burning piece of paper after she refused to take him back. Luckily, Miss Powell, who dumped Griffiths after a two-month relationship, escaped from the inferno at her house in Walsall on March 4 last year. Griffiths hounded and bombarded his ex-girlfriend with text messages begging her to take him back, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. On one occasion he even turned up at the school where she worked as a teacher holding a bouquet of flowers. But when she refused to see him again, he snapped and drove to a fuel station where he filled a five-litre container with petrol. Griffiths then drove to Miss Powell's terraced home and poured the fuel all over the front door and through her letter box. He then used a cigarette lighter to set fire to a piece of paper which he shoved through the letter box before sending a text to Miss Powell, which read: 'Goodbye Tracey.' CCTV captured Griffiths waiting outside the house as he watched the fire take hold of the downstairs. During the trial, Miss Powell told the jury: 'He wasn't that happy and said he was annoyed about the fact that we were not seeing each other. 'I was shocked and thought it was a bit aggressive. Literally as I read it I realised something was going on outside. 'I heard a noise like a clunk or like something shutting. I looked outside and I saw something like hazard lights. 'Instinctively I opened the window and I saw him and saw flames from the footpath below the window. The flames were at the front door. Griffiths poured petrol through Tracey Powell's letterbox and all over her front door (centre) before setting fire to it last March . Griffiths, 44, was found guilty of attempted murder and arson during a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court . 'I asked him, ""what are you doing?"" 'He said, ""I told you not to upset me."" There was a lot of thick black smoke at the time. I called 999. 'I could smell smoke and burning and the petrol smell was really strong.' Griffiths was later arrested and charged with arson and attempted murder. He was today jailed for 16 years after being found guilty of both charges. After the case, Stephen Davies, Acting Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Unable to accept the fact that the victim did not wish to rekindle their relationship, Gary Griffiths sought revenge on his ex-partner and planned to burn down her house while she was asleep in it. 'Once he had set fire to the house, rather than call for help, Griffiths watched from across the road as the flames took hold of the downstairs of the house and then left the scene of his crime knowing that the victim was trapped upstairs. 'Through his reckless actions, he not only put the victim's life in danger, but that of the neighbours and the emergency services who were called out to tackle the blaze.'","Gary Griffiths, 44, poured petrol through his ex's letterbox and set fire to it .

"A man accused of sexually harassing several young women in central India received an unorthodox punishment for his alleged crimes. Virat Dhoni was forced to bend over in the middle of a public street after which a female police officer and his accusers, a group of teenage girls, smacked his backside. The 23-year-old had been accused of wolf whistling and cat calling the teenage schoolgirls in Sendhwa, in India's Madhya Pradesh state. Justice served: One of the  teenage girls who accused Virat Dhoni of catcalling her, smack her 23-year-old harrasser with her shoe as her friends are lined up, waiting their turn . The teenagers complained to Police Sub-inspector Monica Singh, who seized Mr Dhoni and carried out the humiliating punishment before letting the accusing teenage girls also spank Mr Dhoni. 'I had a choice,' Police Sub-inspector Singh said. 'I could take him to court and watch as he wriggled off the hook, or I could hand out some justice then and there.' Mr Dhoni then complained to local judges, saying the public spanking was humiliating and that he should have been charged and taken to court before any punishment was carried out. Public punishment: Police Sub-inspector Monica Singh seized Mr Dhoni and carried out the punishment with the help of the schoolgirls in the middle of the street . Backed by the court: Mr Dhoni complained to local judges, who rejected his claim saying he deserved public punishment and that it was 'very fitting' for his 'crime' He said: 'I felt shamed by standing there while these women hit me. I hadn't laid a finger on them and it is not a policewoman's job to decide who is and who is not guilty.' But judges in Madhya Pradesh rejected his claim, saying Mr Dhoni had deserved the beating and would not have got off with a simple slap on the wrist if the courts had dealt with the case. The ruling said: 'He had tormented his victims in public with his whistling and cat calls, and he was punished in public. 'It was very fitting.'","Man harassed a group of schoolgirls with catcalls and wolf whistles .

"A group of Texas gun activists have taken to confronting officers on the streets, armed with video cameras - and assault rifles. The 'Cop Block' videos that they shoot and post online are meant to hold police accountable and combat police brutality. The activists say they're well within their rights to do it while openly carrying rifles, shotguns and antique pistols. The activists in the Dallas suburbs carry police radios so they can track the movements of police and film officers making arrests and conducting traffic stops. They also try to find police drunk driving checkpoints and speed traps and warn drivers about the officers up ahead. Jacob Cordova flashes the peace sign in front of two Texas police officers while he carries a weapon strapped to his back . Cardova was arrested last week after he pulled up to film a traffic stop while carrying a black powder revolver on his hip - which he says is legal under Texas law . Kory Watkins, a Texas gun activist, has already made a name for himself by carrying an AK-47 in public - as is legal under state law . One video shows a 'Cop Block' activist being arrested after arriving at a crime scene with a camera wearing a black powder handgun on his belt. He hurls insults at the officers as he tells them that the weapon is legal to carry openly in the state of Texas. 'What crime have I committed?' the activist, Jacob Cordova shouts at cops who are handcuffing him. 'You're carrying a firearm,' an officer responds. 'It's not a firearm, it's a pre-1899 black powder pistol (which is legal to openly carry under Texas law),' Cordova says. The officer replies: 'We'll figure it out.' Cordova shouts back: 'You better f***ing figure it out, ya douchebags!' He then proceeds to call one of the officers 'a little c**k s***er.' Videos posted on Kory Watkins' YouTube page show several confrontations with officers when they showed up at traffic stops and filmed the police while armed . Watkins, seen here talking to a police officer while armed, is one of several Texas libertarians who have seized on police brutality civil rights issues . Among the activities that the group undertakes is warning drivers about speed traps and DUI checkpoints - while armed, of course . 'The police department in Arlington is out of control and keeps wrongfully arresting people for doing things that are well within their rights. It’s wasting taxpayer money and it’s violating the rights of the people,' the group's leader, Kory Watkins, an Olive Garden bartender, told the Daily Beast. The activists, who often identify themselves as Ron Paul libertarians or members of the Tea Party, say they've picked up the mantle of civil rights activists protesting alleged police brutality against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York. They've even taken up the mantra of shouting 'hands up, don't shoot' and 'I can't breathe.' Cops say the activists have, at times, been a threat to officers who are just going about their jobs. Several members of the group have been arrested for various charges - disturbing the peace, and police fear that their interactions are becoming increasingly hostile. Jacob Cordova, the 27-year-old Air Force veteran who was caught on video being arrested for carrying an antique handgun, pulled up to a police traffic stop and pulled up his vest to show them that he was armed, police say. 'When you see somebody being aggressive, interfering with a stop, and armed with a deadly weapon, the officer can’t just ignore that,' Arlington police Sergeant Jeffrey Houston told the Daily Beast. Cordova denies that he did anything illegal.","Libertarians outside Dallas have taken up the civil rights cause of police brutality and begun filming officers on the streets - while armed .

Tragedy: A police car is stationed outside a a house in Kansas City, Kansas, where an eight-month-old boy was shot and killed as he watched television in the living room . Police were called to the house on North Early Street at 10:30pm  after a number of bullets were fired as the car passed the address. There were reportedly six children inside at the time. The boy's mother, who has not been named, was also hit, but only suffered minor injuries. According to Fox 4 News investigators spent several hours combing the area around for evidence, and picked up at least 22 shell casings. However they are yet to establish how many assailants were in the car at the time and the number of bullets fired in total. Authorities are also still trying to determine the motive behind the shootings and do not have any suspects.

"A member of the grand jury that declined to indict the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown asked a federal court Monday to remove a lifetime gag order preventing jurors from discussing the case. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed juror who wants to speak about the investigation but would be in violation of Missouri law by doing so. The lawsuit also questions St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch's characterization that 'all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges.' Scroll down to read full lawsuit... Misleading? The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed juror who wants to speak about the investigation but would be in violation of Missouri law by doing so. The juror also claims prosecutor Bob McCulloch misled the panel in Darren Wilson's favor . The suit was filed against McCulloch, who oversaw the investigation, because his office would be responsible for bringing charges against the juror, according to the ACLU. McCulloch's spokesman, Ed Magee, said his office had not seen the lawsuit and declined immediate comment. 'Right now there are only 12 people who can't talk about the evidence out there,' ACLU attorney Tony Rothert said. 'The people who know the most — those 12 people are sworn to secrecy. What (the grand juror) wants is to be able to be part of the conversation.' The suit does not seek to allow grand jurors in all Missouri cases to be free to discuss proceedings. But it argues that the Ferguson case was unique, and that allowing the juror to speak would benefit the national debate about race and police tactics that was sparked by the shooting. Brown, who was black, was unarmed when he was fatally shot after a confrontation in August with then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who resigned from the department late last year. Bob McCulloch, prosecutor in the Darren Wilson case, speaks to reporters in August . How many jurors serve on a Missouri grand jury? Twelve jurors serve on a Missouri grand jury panel. How many votes are needed to indict? In order for a grand jury in the state of Missouri to indict, nine out of 12 jurors must vote to 'hand up' the case. Whose ultimate decision is it for a case to move forward? Only the jury may choose to indict. However, the prosecuting attorney's wish to (or not to) indict is extremely influential. Per Richard Kuhns of Washington University Law School: . 'The prosecutor typically has de facto control over the grand jury. Except for usually minimal instructions from the judge, the prosecutor is the only person the grand jury deals with. 'The grand jury can decide to call witnesses on its own, but that doesn't happen often. Usually the grand jury is pretty subservient to the prosecutor. If prosecutor wants an indictment, he can almost always get it.' Is a prosecutor required to hold a grand jury? No. Grand juries are only guaranteed under the constitution in federal cases. A prosecutor may choose to forgo the process if he/she has probable cause. However, around half of high-level felonies and nearly all police-involved shootings go through the process. Who gets to present evidence? The only lawyer who presents evidence to the grand jury is the prosecutor. What's more, he or she has almost unrestricted control of what evidence is presented to the jury. The prosecutor is the only lawyer in the room in an official capacity during the proceeding. Source . Withheld evidence? St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch takes questions after announcing the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. A lawsuit filed by the ACLU on Monday on behalf of one of the jurors claims the prosecutor released some evidence presented during the hearing but mischaracterized it as all the evidence . Shooting: Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown dead in August. A suit filed on behalf of a grand juror in the case alleges the prosecutor in the case Bob McCulloch blamed Brown in the shooting as he handled the case differently from the countless others they'd seen . The shooting led to widespread unrest in an around the St. Louis suburb, including some protests that resulted in local business being burned and looted. Protests again turned violent on Nov. 24, when McCulloch publicly announced that the grand jury investigating the case had decided there wasn't enough evidence to indict Wilson. The grand jury — which included nine white people and three black individuals — met on 25 separate days over three months, hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses. Those witnesses included medical examiners and experts on blood, toxicology and firearms, according to McCulloch. The grand juror behind the lawsuit believes 'the current information available about the grand jurors' views is not entirely accurate — especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges,' the lawsuit contends. 'Moreover, the public characterization of the grand jurors' view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with Plaintiff's own.' Rothert, the ACLU attorney, noted that the grand jury convened in May and heard hundreds of other cases before devoting its attention to the Wilson case in August. Protest: Widespread demonstrations swept America under the 'hands up, don't shoot' slogan following the slaying of Michael Brown, who was unarmed . The suit contends that McCulloch's office handled the Wilson case far differently than the others, with 'a stronger focus on the victim.' The suit also contends that legal standards were discussed in a 'muddled' and 'untimely' manner. He also said the Ferguson case was unique in how it sparked a national debate. 'The Supreme Court has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror's First Amendment rights on a case-by-case basis,' Rothert said. 'The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance. The First Amendment prevents the state from imposing a lifetime gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent.' Jim Cohen, associate professor at Fordham University Law School and a grand jury expert, said the lawsuit will add to concerns about how the case was handled. ""Believe me, there's already more than a fair amount of skepticism about whether this process was fair, notwithstanding Mr. McCulloch's cynical attempt to pretend that it was fair,"" Cohen said. Cohen believes the juror has a strong argument in the lawsuit. ""This matter has been discussed by virtually everybody in the universe with the exception of any person actually subjected to the presentation of evidence,"" he said. Last month, state Rep. Karla May, a St. Louis Democrat, asked a joint House and Senate committee to investigate whether McCulloch ""manipulated"" the grand jury. It wasn't clear if the committee would take up that request. Messages were left Monday with May and state Sen. Kurt Schaefer, the committee's chairman. Grand Juror Doe v.

"Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville has thrown his support behind a bid to save a 400-year-old building used as a location in the hit ITV drama. Villagers in Bampton, Oxfordshire, are hoping to raise £250,000 to help preserve their village library and museum in the Old Grammar School. Downton fans will recognise the building as the Downton Cottage Hospital, which has played a key part in each series of the show. Scroll down for video . Hugh Bonneville is supporting a campaign to raise money for the village library and museum in the Old Grammar School in Bampton, Oxfordshire . The money is needed to replace a staircase which was removed in the 1960s as well as the renovation of the roof using original stone tiles and strengthening of the first floor to meet modern use requirements in the 400-year-old building. The work will enable the use of a space fitted with 16th century fireplaces and gothic stone windows to be used for the museum's local historical archive as well as to create an exhibition space dedicated to Downton Abbey. Bonneville, who plays the Earl of Grantham, said in a video supporting the campaign: 'We are asking you, the viewers of Downton Abbey, to raise the money we need to bring this wonderful building back into full public use. The Old Grammar School is one of the key buildings in the village used in the hit ITV series . 'It needs a new staircase, the floor needs strengthening and the roof is in urgent need of repair.' The video shows Bonneville walking through the village of Bampton, which plays a key part in Downton Abbey, and visiting the library in the Old Grammar School. He says: 'This is the Downton Cottage Hospital, where Lady Sybil helped Dr Clarkson treat recuperating soldiers during the First World War and where Mrs Hughes came when she feared she might be seriously ill.' He goes on to point out the nearby church, where Crawley weddings take place in the series and explains that the building is next to house where Isabel Crawley lives in the series. The Old Grammar School Building houses Bampton's library as well as the Bampton Community Archive which includes a permanent Downton Abbey exhibition and a small shop. The Old Grammar School can be seen being used in filming for Downton Abbey . Picturesque Bampton has become a hit with tourists since featuring in the ITV show, which has been viewed around the world. It is even included on a map issued by VisitBritain and the Visit Oxfordshire showing Downton locations that tourists can visit. The quaint village was chosen to be fictitious Downton when filming for the period drama began in 2010. Since then, Bampton has enjoyed rocketing numbers of visitors, with devoted fans flocking to see where main characters Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley married. Highclere Castle, which is used to represent Downton Abbey, has seen a surge in visitors since the series first began . Campaign spokesman Robin Shuckburgh said: 'Villagers have managed to keep the Old Grammar School going for over 400 years but it's now in desperate need of repair. 'By restoring the building to its former glory we can make the most of the interest in the village, and provide a wonderful archive for local people and those with ancestors here. The building was given to the village by a very kind and far-sighted man and it just cannot be allowed to crumble.' Mr Shuckburgh said: 'Bampton is incredibly popular with visitors because fans of Downton Abbey can recognise so many landmarks from the series. However, people want to visit the building and spend far more time here than we can accommodate which is a shame for them and a missed opportunity for the village.' To help raise the £250,000 a series of Downton-related prizes is going to be auctioned including a special edition Downton art work, luxury hampers and tours.","Old Grammar School in Bampton, Oxfordshire, is a key location in series .

"Labour is trying to 'bribe' Scottish voters with a 'vindictive' mansion tax raid on England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border, Boris Johnson claimed today. The London Mayor said the policy to 'mug' people living in the South East was the result of a plan by Labour to win back voters from the SNP. The policy to fund 1,000 nurses was one of the first major announcements by Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy. Mr Murphy said the 'vast majority' of the money raised by the levy on homes worth more than £2million would come from London and the South East but it was 'fair that you share that tax across the country'. Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy said 95% of mansion tax will be levied in the South East but that its 'benefit will be felt across the UK' But Mr Johnson told LBC: 'Labour has made a cynical calculation that they are more vulnerable in Scotland to the SNP than they are, say, in the South East or they are in London. 'They have decided to punish the South East, or to be fiscally vindictive towards the south east of England, in order to try to bribe the Scots to vote Labour. It's no way to run a country.' He added that Labour wanted to 'squeeze those Londoners until the pips squeak' and added: 'That is a way to set up resentments and I don't think it is the right way forward. 'Londoners perfectly accept that we have a duty to the rest of the country, we already export huge quantities in taxation - about £19 billion a year.' Mr Murphy said the mansion tax would send £250million a year north of the border – even though just 0.3 per cent of the revenue will be raised there. He said it enabled him to make a 'uniquely Labour pledge' to increase spending on the Scottish NHS without having to increase taxes on Scots. He added: 'As much as 95 per cent of the mansion tax will be levied in the South East of the UK but its benefit will be felt across the UK. 'There is a choice about what we would do with that money raised outside of Scotland and how we spend it in Scotland.' He said the levy will go towards funding an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland - even though just 0.3% will be raised north of the border (file picture) Launching Scottish Labour's election campaign, Mr Murphy added: 'We will support the NHS and nurses and use the money from a UK mansion tax to fund an additional 1,000 NHS nurses in Scotland over and above the SNP plans that we inherit.' Labour's proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million has proved hugely controversial, with experts – and many senior Labour figures – warning it is unworkable and divisive. Mr Murphy's comments also sparked an angry reaction in England. Conservative MP Dominic Raab, whose constituency is in Surrey, said it was deeply unfair to 'clobber' middle-class families in England to pay for health improvements in Scotland. 'Yet again, we're seeing the Labour Party selling out the English,' he said. 'It's bad enough they want to clobber the South with more stealth taxes that will inevitably hit the middle classes. 'But Scotland already has double the number of nurses per person compared to England. How is it fair to siphon off the lion's share of this revenue north of the border to pay for even more?' Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Every voter in London should read Labour's proposal for a homes tax in London to pay for the NHS in Scotland.' Full details of the mansion tax have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said last year that people living in homes valued at between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income. Critics warn London and the South East will bear the brunt, while fewer than 900 homes in Scotland would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the UK total. But because of the controversial Barnett Formula applied to UK funding, Scotland will be handed a vastly disproportionate share of the takings.","95% of mansion tax will be levied in South East England, Jim Murphy said .

"Spain's opposition conservatives swept commandingly into power last night as voters enduring a 21.5 per cent unemployment rate and stagnant economy spectacularly dumped the Socialist Party. The Popular Party, led by Mariano Rajoy, won 186 seats in the 350-seats lower chamber of parliament compared to . 154 in the last legislature, while the Socialists plummeted from 169 to 110, . their worst performance ever. The PP won an absolute majority . and resounding mandate from a deeply troubled electorate - it needed 176 . votes for such a cushion. Victor: Future prime minister Mariano Rajoy, pictured with his wife Elvira Fernandez, waves to supporters from the balcony of Popular Party headquarters in Madrid last night . Jubilation: Ecstatic supporters wave flags after news of the win is announced. But Mr Rajoy warned them of tough times ahead in his victory speech . The election result marks the third time in as many weeks that the eurozone debt crisis has claimed a government. As thousands of jubilant, cheering supporters waving red-and-yellow Spanish flags and blue-and-white party ones gathered outside Popular Party headquarters, their leader and future prime minister thanked Spaniards for their support. But, in a sign of the current economic turmoil, Mr Rajoy then sounded a sombre note of warning. He said: 'It is no secret to anyone that we are going to rule in the most delicate circumstances Spain has faced in 30 years. 'For me, there will be no enemies but unemployment, the deficit, excessive debt, economic stagnation and anything else that keeps our country in these critical circumstances.' 'There won't be any miracles,' he added. 'We never promised any. But as we have said before, when things are done properly, the results come in.' Socialist party candidate . Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba conceded defeat. Prime Minister Jose Luis . Rodriguez Zapatero, whose popularity plummeted as the crisis deepened . and enacted austerity measures that doomed him among supporters, did not . seek a third term in office, or speak publicly last night. But Mr Perez Rubalcaba said his party . would fight to protect the welfare state from social spending cuts that . Mr Rajoy will almost certainly make to meet EU-mandated deficit . reduction cuts his party has pledged to fulfil. Season of change: The election result marks the third time in as many weeks that the eurozone debt crisis has claimed a government, following in the footsteps of Greece and Italy . Tall order: Mr Rajoy and party members face their public after Spaniards resoundingly ushered in a new political era . Seal it with a kiss: Mr and Mrs Rajoy embrace as they celebrate becoming Spain's first couple . In the Senate, with 58 per cent of . the votes counted, it was 134 for the PP and 50 for the Socialists. Another few dozens seats in that chamber are not elected directly. One surprise outside the economic . realm is that a new pro-independence Basque coalition called Amaiur won . seven seats and now outnumbers the region's traditionally strongest . party, the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, with five. This comes about a month after the . armed Basque separatist group ETA declared an end to its armed campaign, . saying it would seek independence through strictly peaceful means. The promised change in political direction failed to immediately lift . financial markets, with Madrid's key Ibex index today down nearly 2 per cent . in early trading. Spain's key borrowing rate for ten-year bonds on the secondary market . started a second week edging toward 6.5 per cent, close to levels where . other eurozone countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to . request huge bailouts from the EU and the International Monetary Fund. A 7 per cent rate is considered unsustainable over the long term. Other than promise tax cuts for small- and medium-size companies that make up more than 90 per cent of all firms in Spain, Mr Rajoy has not specified how he will tackle Spain's unemployment nightmare. The 56-year-old faces the towering task of restoring investor confidence and lowering Spain's soaring borrowing costs with deficit-reducing measures, while not dragging an already moribund economy into a double-dip recession. It only just climbed out of one last year that was prompted by the bursting of a housing market bubble. Mr Rajoy said he has not promised miracles and there will be none, but that the PP has shown in the past - it ruled from 1996 to 2004 and got Spain into the euro along the way - it gets things done. He appealed to Spaniards to join together and resurrect the economy. Mr Rajoy, who has lost two previous elections, said: 'We stand before one of those crossroads that will determine the future of our country, not just in the next few years but for decades.' The conservatives won roughly 45 per cent of the votes and the Socialists took 29 per cent, according to official election results. In the last elections in 2008, the latter won by about four points. Loser: Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba concedes defeat after the results came in last night . Not all fun and games: Protesters burn a rag doll depicting Mr Rajoy at the Puerta del Sol square in Madrid . The PP won most seats in 45 of the . country's 52 provinces. The result, together with a clean sweep in . municipal and regional elections in May, left it in its strongest . position ever. It also meant that unlike the . outgoing Socialist government, the PP will not have to rely on support . from any other political party to implement its policies. Curiously, the PP only edged up from . 10.2million to 10.8million votes, while the Socialists' vote plummeted . from 11.1million in 2008 to 6.9million. That was to the benefit of smaller . parties such as the United Left, which saw its seat numbers shoot from . two in 2008 to 11 this year. The new numbers show Spanish voters have shifted decidedly to the right as they confront their worst economic crisis in decades and choose new leaders to pull them out of it. As part of that mess, the country is also at the forefront of Europe's sovereign debt crisis, with the Spanish government's borrowing costs rising last week to levels near where other eurozone countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to request huge bailouts from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Besides the recent changes in which Greece and Italy replaced their governments with teams made up of technocrats, Ireland and Portugal - which also required huge bailouts to avert default - also saw their governments change hands.","Mariano Rajoy elected prime minister by a wide margin .

"Councils across the U.S. Midwest are closing hills and banning sledding to prevent being sued in injury claims. It is not known just how many cities have banned or restricted the pass time, but every year the list grows. The latest city council to get on board is Dubuque, Iowa, where they are moving ahead with plans to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks. Councils across the U.S. Midwest are closing hills and banning sledding to prevent being sued in injury claims; the latest council to propose restrictions is in Dubuque, Iowa, where they are moving ahead with plans to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks (stock image) Marie Ware, Dubuque's leisure services manager, told Newsok that the council had 'all kinds of parks that have hills on them' and can't 'manage the risk' at all of the locations. More than 20,000 children each year were treated at emergency rooms for sledding-related injuries between 1997 and 2007, according to a study by Ohio-based Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Dubuque council members had been against the move, but conceded it was necessary given liability concerns and to meet demands from their insurers. They had cited two sledding lawsuits. One had involved a $2 million judgement against Omaha, Nebraska, after a 5-year-old girl was paralyzed when she hit a tree, and the other involved a $2.75 million payment to a man who injured his spinal cord after hitting a sign. Instead of out-right bans on sledding, some cities had lessened their liability by banning sledding only on certain slopes and by posting warning signs. In 2013, Paxton, Illinois officials removed their sledding hill altogether out of fears sledders may crash into trees. The 20-foot rise was more of a dirt mound - made to cover rubbish and junk metal - but it was  often crowded with sledders. Steve King, who runs a website that promotes sledding, said he understands why cities impose restrictions as most sledders don't wear helmets and it's near impossible to steer away from obstacles (stock image) After losing a lawsuit, Omaha banned sledding at a popular hill one winter, but later dropped the restriction as people were continuing to sled there. The city has now posted warning signs at sledding sights and put pads around posts and hay bales around trees. Kenneth Bond, a New York lawyer who represents local governments, told the website that most people realize that cities must restrict potentially dangerous activities to protect their citizens. He said previously people may have accepted they were responsible for their own actions, but they now expected the government to prevent dangers whenever possible. Steve King, who runs a website that promotes sledding, said he understands why cities impose restrictions. Most sledders don't wear helmets and it's near impossible to steer away from trees, rocks or signs, he said. Mr King said: 'We live in a lawsuit-happy society and cities are just being protective by banning sledding in areas that pose a risk for injury or death.'","An Iowa council plans to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks .

"Charles Dickens fans are being asked to vote for the  ending of his final novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, after he died in 1870 before finishing it . It is a mystery which has long baffled and excited fans of Charles Dickens, and caused arguments in literary circles. Some believe Charles Dickens' Edwin Drood is dead, murdered by his uncle or love rival, while others think the engineering student has simply followed his dreams to go to Egypt. Others suspect the character is merely lurking in Cloisterham in disguise - after his fate was never revealed because Charles Dickens died while working on the manuscript for The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Now a group of academics hope to solve the 150-year-old mystery of what actually happened to Edwin Drood by allowing readers to vote online for their preferred ending through a crowd-sourcing website. The project has been launched by Dr Pete Orford, an expert in Dickens at the University of Buckingham who has written several books on the author. 'There is a fascination with this book and people have been turning to it for almost 150 years to work out an ending,' said Dr Orford. 'People want to have an ending that they feel is worthy of Dickens, that's surprising and phenomenal.' Dickens was working on the manuscript of The Mystery of Edwin Drood when he died of a stroke in 1870. His fans had been kept on tenterhooks by the story because he published it in instalments and was about halfway through when he suddenly died. Various adaptations guessing the intended ending have been made - including that Drood, an orphan, was murdered by his uncle John Jasper in the fictional town of Cloisterham, based on Rochester. Others have pointed the finger at Neville Landless, a love rival for the young student's fiancee. Several films and even a Broadway musical have all dealt with the mysterious ending but Dr Orford hopes that now it could be solved by people voting for what they think happened to Drood. The University of Buckingham created a digital library of Dickens' weekly magazines and Dr Orford used this to create a separate website speculating on the untimely ending of Edwin Drood. Around 100,000 people have already visited the site and about 1,000 have posted their views on the ending. Dr Orford added: 'This book has been unfinished for almost 150 years now. And the response to it has been phenomenal. 'People have been drawn into the intricacies and trying to draw out the story. 'But because of this attention, it has moved more people away from the book because they start to believe it's for the absolute experts and theorists. I want to find a way to open this up again and give the public the chance to express their opinion on the ending.' He said visitors to the website are invited to read the case notes and give their verdict on the mystery. Dr Orford said the lack of ending was in fact a 'perfect finale' to a Dickens novel as it allows readers to remain engaged with him. An engraving of opium smoking called 'The Lascar's Room in Edwin Drood' by Gustave Dore in 1872 has added to the mystery over what happened to engineering student Edwin Drood when he disappeared . He added: 'It fascinates me why we keep turning to this book and asking these questions. It's not that unusual for an author to die halfway through a manuscript but this has captured people's attention. 'It's the most perfect final book for Dickens because it's not finished and allows the dialogue between reader and writer which he loved to continue.' Dr Orford said that because of the popularity of Dickens many people feel pressure to come up with intricate story lines, including many involving characters who are not central to the plot of Drood's disappearance. He cites one theory of a man who believed all of the characters were based on Ancient Greek Gods. This was based on the belief that a character named Luke Honeythunder was in fact Zeus and father to all the characters, making them all related. 'My own theory is rather boring,' added Dr Orford. The last handwritten page of the Edwin Drood manuscript has led to years of speculation about the ending . 'I don't believe there is any reason not to believe friends of Dickens and his biographer that Edwin dies at the hands of Jasper.  People will always want something a bit extra, that's surprising and phenomenal, because it is Dickens. 'They have all sorts of ideas, and normally not for the main characters.' The site includes profiles of the main characters and suspects in the mystery who include Drood's uncle Jasper. He is described as: 'a caring guardian to his orphaned nephew Edwin; if anything “Mr Jasper’s heart may be too much set upon his nephew”, and it has been observed that Jasper maintained “a look of hungry, exacting, watchful, and yet devoted affection” upon young Edwin at all times.' Rosa Bud, a fellow orphan and the fiance of Drood, is described as having her 'seemingly blissful life darkened' by the disappearance of her companion. People visiting the website called the Drood Inquiry are asked to vote anonymously on various aspects of the ending such as whether he is dead or alive, where his body is and who killed or attempted to kill the student. There are several theories about what happened to Edwin Drood and disagreement whether the character was intended to die or merely went into hiding. In the 19th century the prevailing view was that Drood was in hiding after an attempt on his life, made by his uncle John Jasper. Others believe the young student was murdered by John Jasper because his uncle had confessed to him about his opium habit. Jasper was also believed to be in love with Drood's fiance Rosa Bud. One theory is that Neville Landless may have murdered Drood because he was a rival for the affections of Rosa Bud. He then is believed to return in disguise as Detective Dick Datchery. The sudden death of Charles Dickens in 1870 led to an almost immediate reaction by American theorists who started coming up with possible endings to the story. Freddie Fox played Edwin Drood in the BBC drama . Henry Morford, a New York journalist, wrote an ending to the book after travelling to Rochester. In his version Drood survived an attempt on his life by John Jasper. Detective Dick Datchery then appears as Mr Bazzard, a clerk and playwright, in disguise. In the 1800s there were rumours that the book itself had been written by Dickens. In 1873 Thomas James, a printer from Vermont, published a version which he claimed had been 'ghost-written' by him channelling Dickens's spirit. Some believe Drood returned in disguise - possibly in the form of detective Dick Datchery who appeared six months after his disappearance. The audience were given the chance to choose their own ending from an array of seven suspects during a Broadway adaptation of the book in the 1980s. In the 1990s one theory was that each character represented an Ancient Greek God and all were related. In 2012 BBC 2 attempted its own ending of the tale with a two part series. At the moment the votes cast are strongly in favour that the young Edwin Drood is in fact dead, murdered by John Jasper. Most believe his body is hidden in the Sapsea Tomb, but some think he could have been concealed in quick lime. Opinion is far more divided on the fate and identity of the other characters. John Jasper and Neville Landless are tipped to be other casualties in the story but readers appear to be unsure whether Dick Datchery is in fact a detective, Helena Landless or an actor. Results of the vote will be published in April to coincide with an exhibition about Edwin Drood organised by the University of Buckingham. John Forster, biographer to Dickens, had previously claimed that Dickens told him the story was to be one of a young man murdered by his uncle, who is eventually sent to prison for the killing. However doubt was poured on his theories after critics found he had muddled up some of the details. Dr Orford's idea builds on that of the 1985 Broadway musical, which paused half way through to allow the audience to decide between eight potential detectives, seven possible murder suspects and six would-be lovers to give the story their own happy ending.","Charles Dickens died in 1870 before finishing The Mystery of Edwin Drood .

"They may not look like the most spacious, or glamorous, of buildings. But these shipping containers have been earmarked as a novel way to tackle the housing crisis in Detroit, Michigan. In one of the city's sprawling factories, the first converted shipping container is being constructed and it is hoped it might potentially be a model for the future. The first shipping container converted home is being constructed in a Detroit General Motors factory . It is hoped the shipping container idea could take off and be used as a way to tackle the city's housing crisis . Once the finishing touches have been applied, the container will be delivered to Michigan Urban Farming Initiative's headquarters in Detroit's North End neighborhood. It will serve as a base for university student caretakers for the nonprofit group and agricultural research activities. The 40-foot long container will feature 320 square feet of living space with two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. It is hoped the shipping container idea could go some way to helping Detroit's housing problems - the city has roughly 40,000 vacant homes waiting to be demolished. Tyson Gersh, from the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, said: 'It's scalable, works for everyone and it's also not going to ruin the environment. It's easier to maintain and can re-purpose existing materials.' The home is being prepared inside General Motors' Hamtramck Assembly plant in the city, which usually produces the electric Chevrolet Volt and other vehicles. Mr Gersh and others from the farming group met with the automaker a couple years ago, and came up with the idea. GM spokesman David Darovitz said: 'I loved the creative idea of taking and reusing an old shipping container and giving new life. It can be used as a model for a bigger idea.' The unusual building is viewed as a way to tackle the deteriorating and disappearing housing in Detroit . Shipping containers converted in to living or working spaces are common in some other cities. For instance, in Salt Lake City's rundown warehouse district, a nonprofit group last year converted them into 'micro-retail' spaces. It was in 2006 that California architect Peter DeMaria designed the first two-story shipping container home in the US, Redondo Beach Home. This in turn inspired the creation of Logical Homes, a company based on the idea of converting containers in to homes. The container will be used as a base for university student caretakers and agricultural research activities .","First converted shipping container being constructed in Detroit factory .

"The practice of closing down parts of the road and railway network over Bank Holidays is costing the country's economy, according to VisitEngland. The tourist board has appealed to transport bosses in an attempt to avoid offering 'a third world service' to tourists during key holiday periods and sporting events. Lady Penelope Cobham, who chairs the organisation, has been working with transport providers in the hope of convincing them not to shut down key services during Bank Holidays. VisitEngland urging transport providers to halt road and rail maintenance during big events and holidays . 'We are trying to run a first world tourism service for local and overseas visitors and there are certainly a number of overseas visitors around over Christmas, but we are more than hampered by a third world service over Christmas,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'I understand completely the need to do major works but when they say they are going to end working on a particular day, we have to be able to depend on that.' Lady Cobham was quick to applaud rail operators for listening to her concerns in recent months but claims there is still a long way to go to find a better solution. Thousands were left stranded due to work on the East Coast main line during the Christmas holidays. Pictured: Finsbury Park station . Upgrades, which began on Christmas Eve, have also caused disruption on the West Coast main line . Recently, Network Rail has come under fire for overrunning improvement works on the East Coast main line. Thousands were left stranded when King's Cross station closed for an additional 24 hours after works overran on Boxing Day. More than 11,000 engineers began upgrades on Christmas Eve, leaving London Bridge, the West Coast main line and routes through Reading facing disruption through the New Year. Trains were recently cancelled at King's Cross due to the overrunning of engineering works . Despite the travel delays, London has seen a 39% increase in tourism since the recession . 'There's never a good time to carry out vital maintenance and improvement work to the railway, but major holidays are when significantly fewer people travel,' a spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said. The Highways Agency has said that 219 stretches of road had roadworks in place during the festive period, though it suspended or accelerated more than 150 projects to help keep traffic moving over Christmas.","VisitEngland urges for a thoughtful approach to timing of engineering work .

"A California man is dead after witnesses say he challenged police with what turned out to be a fake gun, prompting the officers to shoot him multiple times. The unidentified white male, age 32, was reportedly behaving erratically in the parking lot of a Mission District police station in San Francisco. Officer Albie Esparza told reporters that police noticed the man in the parking lot at Valencia and 17th streets at about 5:20 p.m. Scroll down for video . The unidentified white male, age 32, was reportedly behaving erratically in the parking lot of a Mission District police station in San Francisco . The area is restricted to the public. ABC 7 News reports that the man started to leave after being confronted by three officers, then turned to challenge them just before reaching the parking lot entrance. As he began to back away facing the sergeants, Esparza says he moved his hands to his waistband and unveiled what looked like the butt of a gun. ""The sergeants saw the butt of the weapon as he pulls it out and brandishes it at the sergeants,' she said. Two of the officers opened fire. At least six or seven shots were fired, according to one witness at the scene, though its unclear how many of those shots may have hit the man. The weapon turned out to be an airsoft gun - good for shooting pellets but far from lethal. 'We don't know his motive or why he challenged the officers or approached them in the first place,' Esparza said. 'It was very erratic behavior by the suspect, very unusual.' Earlier that day the same man attempted to interact with police at the corner of 16th and Mission streets in the middle of responding to a domestic violence call. He'd asked them about their guns and ammunition, and if they'd ever been involved in shooting someone. '(The officers) didn't really interact with him' Esparza said, according to CBS San Francisco. 'They were busy on a call and he was sort of loitering around.' The man was transported to San Francisco General Hospital for surgery, but died there. At approximately 8:30 p.m. Pacific time, theABC 7's Twitter feed reported that the man had died.","The unidentified white male, age 32, was reportedly acting strangely in the parking lot of a Mission District police station in San Francisco .

"A two-year-old has become the youngest member of British Mensa after taking an intelligence test that ranked him smarter than Barack Obama and David Cameron. While most toddlers are busy learning to walk and scribbling on walls, child prodigy Adam Kirby enjoys reading Shakespeare, learning Japanese, Spanish and French, and even potty-trained himself. Adam, from Mitcham, south London, took the Stanford-Binet IQ test and scored 141, 10 points higher that two of the most powerful world leaders and four points short of Genius level, despite not even being able to speak in full sentences yet. Scroll down for video . Youngest Mensa member: Adam Kirby, aged two, has an IQ of 141, just four points short of Genius level . Adam's parents Kerry-Ann, 31, left, and Dean, 33, say they're 'bright' but nothing like their young son . The toddler’s parents Dean, 33, and Kerry-Ann, 31, say they realised their son was different when he’d potty-trained himself after reading a book on the subject aged just one. Mensa was founded in England in 1946 by Roland Berrill, a barrister, and Dr Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. The society welcomes people from every walk of life whose IQ is in the top two per cent of the population. Albert Einstein apparently had an IQ of 160, while former US presidents Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin and Bill Clinton also racked up very high IQs - mustering 128, 160 and 137 respectively. Napoleon Bonaparte scored 145 and Sigmund Freud had a score of 156. There are currently more than 1,000 members of Mensa aged under 18. Children under the age of 10-and-a-half can join Mensa by submitting prior evidence of their IQ score being in the top two per cent. Adults and children over the age of 10-and-a-half, take the Mensa Supervised IQ Test. The youngest person to ever join British Mensa was Elise Tan Roberts in 2009 aged 2 years and four months. At 29 months, Adam is able to spell 100 words, has conquered most of his times tables up to 10, has learnt his periodic table, and even mastered a world map puzzle designed for adults. After he scored so highly in the IQ test he was invited to join British Mensa, the society for those with outstandingly high IQs, and became the youngest boy ever to do so. The youngest British person ever to join was a girl, Elise Tan-Roberts, now six, who joined Mensa aged two years and four months in 2009; Adam joined at two years and five months. His father, Mr Kirby, an IT consultant from Mitcham, London, said: 'Adam’s abilities are outstanding and we’ve been actively developing his intelligence since he was 10 weeks old - but we’re certainly delighted for him. 'While most children are just learning to stand up or crawl Adam was reading books, his development was just mind-blowingly quick. 'We used to show him cards with the . words hippopotamus and rhinoceros on them and he could identify the . right animals most of the time.' The Stanford-Binet exam, originally . developed by French psychologist Alfred Binet and revised by Stanford . University’s Lewis Terman in 1916, has become renowned for being able to . accurately determine a child’s intelligence levels and predict future . grades. Adam’s score of 141 - just four shy of the ‘Genius’ category - puts him head and shoulders above the average Brit’s IQ of 100. His remarkable level means he becomes only the 19th UK child ever to join Mensa before even going to school. Adam has already mastered most of his times tables and is reading books designed for seven-year-olds . The gifted toddler can identify countries on a map and knows the planets of the solar system . Little Adam started to read when he was just one, and can type words and numbers on a keyboard . Mr Kirby said: 'Neither my wife nor I . are Mensa members. We are both bright, but Adam is significantly more . advanced at his age than we were. 'I think the main reason for his rapid development is that we have found effective ways to make learning enjoyable. 'Adam is able to progress at his own pace whenever he chooses to and in areas of his choosing. Despite his astonishing intelligence, Adam's parents say he is a happy, athletic and playful little boy . Adam's IQ score of 141 puts him above US President Barack Obama and British PM David Cameron, right . 'He knows the planets of the solar system, dozens of pairs of words with opposite meanings - he has a great sense of humour and most importantly he is self-motivated, athletic, very happy and playful.' Adam, who is reading the Oxford . Reading Tree series designed for seven-year-olds, is already in the top . 1.3 per cent of the population. And his parents expect him to score even higher once his communication skills develop fully. Bright family: Mr and Mrs Kirby have high hopes for their younger son Ethan, who is not yet two months old . Adam started reading aged just one, right, and is now reading Oxford Reading Tree books for seven-year-old . John Stevenage, British Mensa’s CEO, said: 'The members of Mensa always welcome new additions as we aim to stimulate people in an intellectual and social environment. 'We are look to help gifted children and encourage them to develop at an extraordinary. 'We look forward to Adam joining Mensa and expect him to have a very bright future.' Adam’s younger brother Ethan is not yet two months old, but his parents are expecting great things. Mr Kirby said: 'I expect that he will develop at a faster pace than Adam as my wife and I are now more experienced, and he has his older brother Adam to learn from. 'In addition, I’ve read that second children tend to be in a hurry to catch up with their older siblings, so I think this will keep him on an upwards curve.' - Adam has a reading age of at least a five-year-old and reads books aimed at seven-year-olds . - He is able to spell over 100 words and also knows many phonics . - Knows some of his times tables (2,3,4,5,10) - Recognises 2D shapes from a circle to 12-sided dodecagon . - Knows numerous 3D shapes . - Can count to more than 1000 in English, up to 20 in Spanish & Japanese and up to 10 in French . - Can add and subtract simple numbers .

"A grandmother who was found stabbed to death in her own home had been ‘living in fear’ for years, but tragically the real danger may have been closer to home than she suspected. Seven years ago Ruth Dodd spoke out about the fear she felt in her Townsville neighbourhood, as she endured relentless conflict with the family living next door. However, it has been alleged that Ms Dodd, 71, was stabbed to death by her own daughter on Friday night in her home in Heatley, a suburb in Townsville in north Queensland. Scroll down for video . Ruth Dodd had been terrified in her home, scared of an attack from her neighbours. Her own daughter is accused of being responsible for her vicious murder . Ruth Dodd, 71, was murdered in her home in Heatley, a suburb in Townsville. Here she is pictured in the kitchen of that home in 2009 . Ruth Dodd had previously lived in fear due to ongoing altercations and arguments with her neighbours . Alva Ruth Dodd, 36, was arrested for Ms Dodd’s murder on Sunday night and later charged. She appeared in a Townsville court on Monday and will remain in custody, with the matter adjourned until April 27. Ms Dodd was advised to leave her home by police six years ago when she was allegedly harassed and abused by her neighbours over their children’s behaviour and an ongoing disagreement about a shared fence. The situation with her neighbours in 2009 was so severe that the grandmother said she felt so threatened she feared leaving her home. She also had her home broken into eight separate times in 2010, despite a complex security system, and was concerned that police were not taking the matter seriously enough . Police advised that she leave her home. The grandmother and charity worker remained in the residence, which is now a crime scene as forensic investigators compile evidence at the site of the murder . In 2009 Ms Dodd explained that she was scared to leave her home as she feared an attack from her neighbour's children, who were known to thrown dangeous items at her, including steel bars . The grandmother's son Merv was very concerned about his mother's safety and tried to defend Ms Dodd against the neighbour's when they allegedly became aggressive . At her wits end, she reached out to A Current Affair for help, who came to her home and captured footage of the neighbour's vile treatment of the then 65-year-old. ‘I’m scared of the children. I never know when one will be waiting around the corner to hit me when I walk out my door,’ she explained at the time. However, the charity volunteer and cherished member of the community refused to leave her home.

Alva Ruth Dodd, 36, was arrested for her mother’s murder on Sunday night and later charged . A relative alleged that Ms Dodd knew who was breaking in, but although she took security measures to stop people from breaking in, it made no difference. ‘She said to me one day she didn’t think the police were taking her seriously,’ the relative told the told The Sunday Mail. ‘I said ‘if you don’t do anything you’re going to wake up and find yourself dead one day’. ‘They smashed her window, her kitchen bench. They even entered the house through the back through the toilet window. ‘They smashed the front door down. I saw all that when I was up there one day.

"It has been one of the most eagerly-awaited television series ever. But as millions tuned in to watch the opening episode of Broadchurch’s second series on Monday, it emerged that the viewers are not the only ones waiting to find out what happens in the crime drama. Producers of the ITV thriller have gone to such lengths to keep the plotline a mystery that even the actors themselves are unsure of how the eight-part series will conclude. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Even the actors in Broadchurch have no idea how the show will finish, and multiple endings have been filmed to prevent it being leaked to the public . Different endings of the second series have been filmed in a further effort to prevent the final conclusion being leaked, while the script was released to cast members in small sections. Arthur Darvill, who plays local vicar Paul Coates in the show, has revealed that not even cast members have been allowed to watch the second series in full. ‘I haven’t seen it,’ he said yesterday. ‘None of us have seen it. We’re not allowed to see any of it. ‘I’ve seen little bits of it but not a whole episode. From the little tiny nuggets I’ve seen it looks amazing. ‘There’s so many of us in it that we all concentrate on our own little bits, so I can’t wait to see everyone else in it.’ No clue: David Tennant said the cast was given their scripts as the production went along and no one knew what was about to happen . The second series has David Tennant and Olivia Colman reprising their roles as police officers Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller. The first series, which was broadcast almost two years ago, focused on the death of 11-year-old Danny Latimer in the fictional town of Broadchurch. It attracted more than nine million viewers and was tweeted about 470,000 times – the most for any ITV drama series. Viewers have been excitedly debating the plot of the second series since filming began in May last year, although the programme’s creator Chris Chibnall has suggested that it will not be a murder mystery. The Broadchurch cast have all been made to sign confidentiality agreements forbidding them from sharing any storyline elements. The second series has David Tennant and Olivia Colman reprising their roles as police officers Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller . There was security on set while filming in external locations so none of the residents of West Bay in Dorset, where the programme is filmed, could reveal the storyline. All scripts had an individual cast or crew member’s name across every page so that no piece of paper could be leaked without a name on it. The same measures were also employed during the filming of the first series, with producers keeping the killer’s identity a secret from the cast until the final episode so the actors could not unwittingly display signs of innocence or guilt. David Tennant said yesterday: ‘We all knew it was good as we made it and we were receiving the scripts as we went along and none of the cast and crew knew where it was going. ‘It became part of the national conversation which is something you always hope for with any piece of work you release out into the world, but you don’t really expect it. ‘When something takes off to that extent it is thrilling to be in the middle of it, but then there’s the notion that you might have to follow it up. Can you do anything other than disappoint?’","Multiple endings have been filmed for Broadchurch series two .

"The final few days of April last year were the worst of Sam Bell-Minogue’s life. Her one-year-old daughter, Poppy, was seriously ill in hospital with a mystery condition that gave her seizures and made her scream out in pain. ‘She couldn’t sit up or lift her head,’ says Sam, 30. Scroll down for video . Poppy was diagnosed with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) at the age of one after suffering seizures and screaming out in pain (pictured at around three weeks with mother Sam Bell-Minogue) ‘All of her muscle strength had gone and she couldn’t move her arms.’ Sam, an assistant sports director, had rushed Poppy to the Royal Derby Hospital after she suddenly took a turn for the worse following a week-long chest infection. Tests over a week at the hospital brought bad news. Although doctors couldn’t identify the cause, an MRI scan showed that Poppy had brain damage. Other tests, including a heart ECG and blood tests, indicated her organs were starting to fail. Sam and her husband Eugene, 34, a sports development manager, were warned that their daughter could die within a couple of months. ‘Apart from some physiotherapy, the doctors said there were no potential treatments,’ says Sam, who lives with Eugene, their four-year-old son Charlie and Eugene’s daughter Molly, eight, as well as Poppy, in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. Poppy in hospital in late April this year, taken with her grandmother Linda Bell . ‘We took her home and tried to come to terms with it. Losing a child — that’s the worst thing you can hear as a parent.’ Eugene adds: ‘We were talking about things like funerals. It was devastating.’ But a phone call a few weeks later brought some hope. Poppy had tested positive for Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) — a rare genetic condition that affects approximately one in 100,000 babies. It is so-called because it can cause urine to have a syrupy smell. She’d had the blood test for MSUD after a doctor at the Royal Derby was advised to test her by a neurologist, who recognised that trouble sitting up was a symptom of the disorder. Another MRI scan and genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis. It meant doctors could now treat Poppy. ‘She was still very poorly, but there was a chance of keeping her, so this diagnosis brought some relief,’ says Sam. MSUD causes problems digesting certain amino acids — the building blocks of protein. These can build up to a toxic level, severely affecting the baby’s brain and muscle function. This can lead to problems sitting up and moving limbs, as the build-up interferes with signals from the brain to muscles in the arms and legs. The digestive system can also be affected, leading to poor feeding and vomiting. Untreated, the build-up can lead to coma and permanent brain damage. But if MSUD is diagnosed early, babies can be treated with a low-protein diet and go on to live a normal life. Starting this week, MSUD is being added to the NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening Programme, along with three other conditions, in England and Wales. 'If it wasn’t for the neurologist thinking of MSUD, things could have been very different,' said Sam . Currently, all babies are given a heel-prick blood test at five days old to check for five conditions, including the blood disorder sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. Spotting the ‘new’ conditions earlier could mean the difference between a healthy, active life and an early death. In addition to MSUD, these conditions are homocystinuria, glutaric aciduria type 1 and isovaleric acidaemia. All are caused by an inability to process amino acids and can kill if not treated. If the baby survives, it can be left severely disabled or brain-damaged. But detected early, they can be managed with similar low-protein diets to the one for MSUD (avoiding proteins such as meat, fish and eggs and taking synthetic proteins to replace the amino acids sufferers can’t digest). Although rare (each affects around 25 babies each year) screening for the conditions will save or vastly improve many lives. The changes come after a successful pilot run by the National Institute for Health Research and Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation. Professor Jim Bonham, director of newborn screening at Sheffield, who headed the programme, says it could ‘radically improve the quality of life of children who are detected. For some, it could mean the difference between being in a wheelchair and playing football with their friends’. In the pilot, 437,000 babies in five cities were tested between July 2012 and July 2013. It identified 40 babies at risk — 12 were diagnosed with one of the four ‘new’ conditions and were then treated. While the new blood tests have been welcomed, countries such as Australia and New Zealand already screen babies for 28 conditions — rather than nine, as is now the case here. Campaigners believe we should follow suit and extend our test to even more conditions, such as Krabbe’s disease, a genetic disorder that can cause brain damage, which affects more than 100,000 people worldwide. ‘There are other disorders children are being severely disabled by, or dying from, which could be screened for with the heel-prick test,’ says Pat Roberts, executive director of the Save Babies Through Screening Foundation UK, which has organised an online petition calling for the test to be extended. All NHS screening programmes must be assessed and passed by the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC). Sam with husband Eugene, their four-year-old son Charlie and Eugene’s daughter Molly, eight, as well as Poppy who is now aged 19 months and learning to walk and talk as normal . Dr Anne Mackie, its director of programmes, says: ‘We have taken a very rigorous view of wanting to know, condition by condition, that we do more good than harm at reasonable cost.’ She adds that any UK test must be accurate, as this minimises ‘false positives’, and there must be an effective treatment available. UK NSC is considering ten conditions to add to the test, including Hurler syndrome, an enzyme deficiency that can cause organ damage, which affects around seven babies a year in the UK. Sam Bell-Minogue welcomes the new tests, but says she is concerned health workers may not be prepared: ‘When I was last in hospital with Poppy in November, none of the doctors or nurses knew about MSUD — or that screening would start in January.’ Poppy’s diagnosis came just in time. After three months, she was back to good health. Now aged 19 months, she’s learning to walk and talk as normal. However, MRI scans show she has ‘small pockets’ of damage all over her brain. How this will affect her will not become clear until she is older, but a recent scan has shown signs of improvement to her nervous system. ‘It’s been a miraculous recovery,’ says Sam. ‘If it wasn’t for the neurologist thinking of MSUD, things could have been very different. 'Without the test, we wouldn’t be here now.’ To find out more about newborn screening, visit expanded screening.org .","One-year-old Poppy was seriously ill in hospital with a mystery condition .

"Labour's attacks on increasing privatisation in the NHS were undermined yesterday when a Blairite former health minister said the move is ‘sensible’. Lord Warner said his party had expanded the use of private providers in health care – which could not survive without them now. Insisting the independent sector was now ‘embedded’ in the NHS, he also warned that tough restrictions planned by shadow health secretary Andy Burnham may be illegal under EU competition rules. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham  insisted he was not scaremongering to win votes . His comments come after Mr Burnham yesterday claimed that the NHS would be sunk by ‘a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation’ under the Tories, while Labour leader Ed Miliband said the service would be gone within five years under Conservative management. But Tory MPs accuse the party of hypocrisy, saying expenditure on NHS services provided free by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the preceding four years under Labour. Yesterday Lord Warner, a health minister under Tony Blair between 2003 and 2007, waded into the debate – insisting Blairite reforms had stopped the scandal of repeated operation cancellations because surgeons were concentrating on emergencies. Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to scrap the Government's controversial NHS reforms if he wins the next election . Saying independent sector treatment centres ‘changed the dynamic’, he added: ‘I’m not a mad privatising Right-wing member of the Labour Party – it was about challenging the NHS and the way it works. I feel that public monopolies need some kind of challenge. An extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland will be funded by a mansion tax on valuable homes in the South East of England, Labour’s Scottish leader said yesterday. Jim Murphy said the controversial levy would send £250million a year north of the border – even though just 0.3 per cent of the revenue will be raised there. He said it enabled him to make a ‘uniquely Labour pledge’ to increase spending on the Scottish NHS without having to increase taxes on Scots. He added: ‘As much as 95 per cent of the mansion tax will be levied in the South East of the UK but its benefit will be felt across the UK. ‘There is a choice about what we would do with that money raised outside of Scotland and how we spend it in Scotland.’ The proposed tax will target properties valued at more than £2million, despite criticism – even from inside Labour – that London and the South East will bear the brunt. Scotland will also be handed a disproportionate share of the takings under the controversial Barnett Formula. Former Labour Cabinet minister Charles Clarke yesterday called the idea an ‘absurd proposition’, while Tory MP Dominic Raab said Labour was ‘selling out the English’. Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: ‘Every voter in London should read Labour’s proposal for a homes tax in London to pay for the NHS in Scotland.’ ‘I’m simply saying that what we did under Blair in bringing in competition was to challenge the NHS – it remains a sensible policy.’ Lord Warner insisted Labour would have to take EU rules into account before embarking on plans to restrict the freedom of NHS providers to commission services from private providers. ‘The truth of the matter is that the private sector has not chosen to make any challenge under that, but they could do – and any Health Secretary would have to deal with it.’ The former minister also insisted that wider competition also helped with the ‘peaks and troughs’ of demand, especially in winter. ‘No one has been able to iron these peaks and troughs at any time since the time of Nye Bevan,’ he added. The NHS Confederation, which represents hospital trusts, agreed that the private sector could continue to play a role. Deputy director of policy Elizabeth Wade said was ‘vital’ that health bosses should be free to commission independent sector providers where they believe they offer the best service and value.John Appleby, of health think-tank the King’s Fund, said Mr Burnham should focus on securing quality for patients and value for the taxpayer. ‘This slight obsession about the private sector seems to be misplaced,’ he said. Labour has made the NHS central to its election campaign, issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’. Mr Burnham yesterday denied that Labour was scaremongering, claiming that the character of the NHS would be ‘changed beyond recognition’ if there was more private sector involvement. ‘I believe we [Labour] let the market in too far and it’s my view that if you carry on with this experimentation with the market in the National Health Service, you will in the end destroy everything that is precious about it.’ Ed Miliband addressing party activists in Manchester yesterday as he launched the Labour party's 2015 election campaign . Oover the next four months, voters will be bombarded with warnings of how the Tories ‘want to cut spending on public services to the levels of the 1930s, when there was no NHS’. The line was peddled by Ed Miliband and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham yesterday and was also the focus of the party’s first – highly negative – campaign poster. However, the statement is at best deeply disingenuous. It is true that the plans unveiled in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement would cut public expenditure as a percentage of national income, or GDP, to 35 per cent by 2020. And, as an overall share of GDP, this would be the ‘lowest level since the late-1930s’, as the Office for Budget Responsibility acknowledges. But Labour did not include the ‘share of GDP’ caveat, which is crucial. In real terms, the amount of money which is actually spent on the public sector, when inflation is factored in – will be reduced only to its lowest level since 2002/03. In other words, Labour is pretending that returning to the level of spending that took place during the second term Blair-Brown Government would inflict devastation upon the Health Service. Plainly, this is nonsense and does nothing to support Labour’s emotive claim that ‘the NHS as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’. Indeed, it is the health service where the cuts will have least impact. Along with international aid, the NHS budget is ring-fenced – and Mr Osborne has found an extra £2billion to further fill its coffers. By comparison, defence, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the communities department have seen their unprotected budgets slashed. The irony is that, when the Tories unveiled their much-ridiculed poster urging voters to stay on the ‘road to economic recovery’ last week, Labour screamed blue murder at David Cameron’s claim that the ‘deficit had been halved’ – which was itself true only as a proportion of GDP, not in cash terms. They are now guilty of the same crime themselves. At least the Tories were trying to deliver a positive message when they were caught out. For Mr Miliband and Mr Burnham, the sole intention was scaremongering. Regrettably, there’ll be plenty more to come.","Andy Burnham said the implications for the NHS were 'very serious'

"A grandfather says he could have had a heart attack after an energy giant mistakenly sent him a power bill demanding £8,275. Rob Gray, of Westley, Suffolk, was sent the bill for 30 times the amount he usually pays Scottish Power for his electricity. Repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful and the 66-year-old was then sent an email demanding he pay up. The company has finally admitted its mistake and apologised to the pensioner for the blunder. Rob Gray was left furious after it took Scottish Power weeks to sort out an £8,275 bill he was sent last month . Retired taxi driver Mr Gray received the initial request, covering a period of under six months, on December 5. Mr Gray, of Westley, Suffolk, said: 'I tried to ring them, but couldn't get through. I tried booking a call back but none were available. 'Eventually I emailed them and they sent me the response saying they would phone within 10 days. They never did.' His worries were made worse when he then got an email demanding 'prompt payment'. He said: 'I  tried everything to get in touch with them. That email was the point at which I thought ""that's enough"". 'You would think someone at some point would have looked at the bill and noticed something was not right. 'I have had a few sleepless nights over this. It's not that I think I will have to pay it, but it is frustrating. I'm on heart pills - and this kind of bill could give you a heart attack. 'I would normally expect to pay £250 to £300 over the winter period, but this is mad. I don't even think a small business could use this much.' The amount - which is 30 times his usual bill - was caused by an IT problem at the huge energy firm . Mr Gray has now finally received an apology from Scottish Power. The electricity giant told Mr Gray that IT problems were to blame for the bungle and said his 'delayed' bill would be sent shortly. 'My bill was not delayed, it was just completely wrong,' Mr Gray said: 'They have not recognised that at all.' An error in the estimated night time reading put the total usage for the period at 99,057kwh, compared to the equivalent last year of just 3,331kwh. A spokesman for Scottish Power, which reported profits of £184million last year, said the company had launched an urgent investigation into the mistake. It is not the first time the energy giant has bombarded a customer with electricity bills. Earlier this year, Tina Jones, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, received a series of energy bills for her terraced cottage holiday home in Gwynedd, North West Wales.

In June, she received a statement telling her she owed just over £12. This was par for the course given she only uses the storage heaters in winter and makes monthly payments of £28 set by the energy firm. But in early September, out of the blue, she received a statement for a staggering £6,861.04. Calls to Scottish Power to resolve the issue resulted in Ms Jones, 66, receiving eight further statements between September 23 and December 3. On three occasions, she received two bills with the same statement date but for different amounts. At the time, the firm told The Mail on Sunday it would be issuing Ms Jones and her husband Norman with an updated bill and agreed to make a goodwill payment for the error.","Retired taxi driver usually pays Scottish Power  £300 every six months .

"A musician whose mother was diagnosed with a severe case of Alzheimer's has released a heartbreaking video of himself singing one of his own songs to her, in the hopes of helping her to remember. Joe Fraley, a songwriter who lives in Alhambra, California, commented alongside the video, which has now received more than one million views on YouTube, saying that it helps to raise awareness of the illness - and that it inspires people to cherish their own parents, while they can. 'This is a video of me playing a song to my Mom who has Alzheimer's,' he explained. 'This was before she moved into assisted living, when she lived at home with me and my Dad. 'I am so confused': At the start of the video, Joe's mother can be seen getting quite upset, but as soon as he starts singing, she begins to smile and laugh . Mother and son: Songwriter Joe recorded the video shortly before his mother was moved to an assisted living facility . 'I am a little embarrassed for posting something so personal. I wasn't expecting all the attention it's been getting, but the fact that it has touched so many people makes makes it worth while. 'My Dad and three siblings are proud as well. Thank you everyone so much for such kind words. 'I hope this video promotes awareness of this horrible disease... and encourages people to give their parents a big hug.' Joe explained to Daily Mail Online that he finally decided to post the video, after much deliberation, when his mother's disease worsened - to the point where she was sadly no longer able to recognize him, or his music. 'I recorded the video cause I was working on a song of mine,' he said. 'I was trying it out faster than I normally play it and wanted my mom's reaction. 'I posted it online when I recorded [it] a few months ago it but didn't share it until the other day because I was upset that my mom no longer seems to recognize me or respond to my music anymore.' In a post on Reddit, Joe added that he initially felt guilty about releasing the video to the public, because it showed his beloved mother 'at her worst' and he felt, to a certain extent, as though he was exploiting her illness. 'Part of me felt like it would be exploiting my Mom and letting strangers see her at her worst,' he wrote. Raising awareness: Although he admits to having reservations about posting the clip, Joe hopes that it will help to encourage more people to learn about the effects of Alzheimer's . Hug it out: The musician also encouraged his viewers to show their own parents as much love as possible . 'I don't know myself': Joe's mother has advanced Alzheimer's and struggles to remember anything about herself or her family . 'She was a college professor and after she was let go from her job she was very self-conscious of people thinking she was stupid. 'But I'm glad I posted it. People have said such nice things and it promotes awareness of such a horrible disease.' At the start of the video, Joe's mother appears to look quite distressed, asking her son where they are, where she lives and explaining that she doesn't know who she is. 'I feel like I don't know myself,' she says. But as soon as her son starts playing, a smile spreads across her face, and - remarkably - she begins mouthing the words along with him, while dancing to the catchy melody. 'You have a nice face and a pretty smile and you're a nice person,' she says at the end of the video, to which her son replies: 'Thank you mom, you too. I love you.'","Songwriter Joe Fraley filmed himself singing to his mom shortly before she was moved into an assisted living facility .

"Close encounter: Prince Andrew with 17-year-old Virginia Roberts in 2001 . Soon the murky affair of Prince Andrew and Virginia Roberts will face scrutiny via a series of sensational cases due to come before the U.S. courts. But as the scandal escalates, here are ten questions the Royal Household must address… . 1 You have denied that Prince Andrew had ‘any kind of sexual relationship or contact with Virginia Roberts’. He certainly did meet her, however: a photograph was taken late one night in early 2001 of the pair together at a London apartment owned by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the shamed late newspaper boss Robert Maxwell. The picture shows the Duke of York’s left hand cradling Ms Roberts’s bare midriff. At the time, she was 17; he, on the other hand, was a 40-year-old father of two. So how did this image come to be taken? 2 Ms Roberts claims to have first met Prince Andrew at Ms Maxwell’s property the previous afternoon. During this initial encounter (over tea and biscuits), Roberts says the Prince was asked to guess her age. Andrew correctly estimated that she was 17, prompting Ms Maxwell to reportedly joke that Jeffrey Epstein ‘would soon have to trade her in’. Did the Prince indeed meet her that day? 3 According to Ms Roberts — in a legal claim filed in Florida last month — she and Prince Andrew had sexual contact in the hours after they returned from the Mayfair nightclub Tramp. This, you have vehemently denied. Ms Roberts claims, however, that this alleged tryst was far from being a one-off: she says that she met the Prince on a second occasion at Epstein’s apartment in New York at Easter 2001. When she arrived that day, she alleges that the Duke of York was seated in a leather armchair in the library, with a girl called Johanna Sjoberg on his knee. So did Prince Andrew meet Ms Roberts at Epstein’s apartment at Easter 2001? And, furthermore, has he ever met Miss Sjoberg? 4 The lawsuit, filed last month at Florida District Court in West Palm Beach, alleges that a third sexual encounter took place shortly afterwards in 2001, on Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ms Roberts claims that she and ‘seven Russian girls’ were ‘told to assemble in a big cabana’ on the island, where Prince Andrew and Epstein were sitting in armchairs. You have described her claims as ‘false and without foundation’. But did the Prince ever visit Epstein’s private island? If so, why? And did he ever meet Ms Roberts there? 5 Jeffrey Epstein’s former handyman Juan Alessi alleges that Prince Andrew attended naked swimming pool parties at the billionaire’s Florida mansion in the early 2000s and was treated to regular massages by a harem of adolescent girls there. In sworn legal papers filed in 2011, Alessi described the house as being full of pictures of naked young women, and said that the Prince stayed in a blue guest room which contained soap in the shape of male and female genitalia. He also claimed to have set up massage tables on which the royal guest was treated on a daily basis. Visit: Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were among guests on this pheasant shoot, attended by Andrew (right), at Sandringham, Norfolk, after the Prince and the US businessman apparently became friends . You have, of course, robustly denied wrongdoing. But did the Prince indeed ever stay at Epstein’s Florida home? If so, why? Did he share its swimming pool with naked young women? Did he ever receive massages from young women there? 6 Prince Andrew appears to have regarded Epstein as a close friend. The American was invited to visit Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor Castle as a guest of the Queen. In turn, the Prince was invited, and agreed to go, on holiday to Thailand with him, where he was photographed on Epstein’s yacht surrounded by topless women. Despite the scrutiny it attracted, the Palace has never explained the exact nature of Prince Andrew’s relationship with Epstein. Were they purely social acquaintances? Or did they ever have wider business or financial links? Did the Prince have any idea of Epstein’s criminal behaviour? Ms Ferguson admitted that accepting money from Epstein had been ‘a gigantic error of judgment’ 7 In 2005, police began investigating Epstein’s abuse of young girls. The following year, they filed an affidavit saying that he should be charged with four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and one of molestation. In the meantime, dozens of alleged victims came forward. The case was settled in 2008, when Epstein struck a deal with prosecutors: he agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he would be jailed for 18 months. In return, all other inquiries were dropped and immunity granted to a number of Epstein’s alleged associates, including Ms Maxwell. That deal remains highly controversial, with many feeling that Epstein got off excessively lightly. A lawsuit filed in Florida last month now claims that Prince Andrew was among those who made ‘efforts’ on behalf of Epstein ‘to persuade the [U.S.] government to give him a more favourable plea arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement’. In response, you have said that ‘the Duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case’. But while he may not have ‘interfered’, did he discuss Epstein, formally or informally, with any person connected with the U.S. government, or U.S. authorities, during the period from 2005-2008 when his friend was under investigation? 8 Prince Andrew visited New York and Washington in September 2006, and Florida in February 2008. Did he discuss Epstein’s case with anyone at all during any of those visits? And did he meet Epstein, or anyone connected with him, during those trips? Official records show that Andrew also met with Sir David Manning, the then UK ambassador to Washington, in September 2006, and also with the then Foreign Office minister Kim Howells in July 2005. Was Jeffrey Epstein’s case discussed at any of those meetings? And did the Prince raise his case, formally or informally, with any person connected to the British government? 9 In 2010, after Epstein had been imprisoned for soliciting girls for underage prostitution, the Duke of York’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, agreed to accept a gift of £15,000 from him, in order to help clear her debts. After this was revealed by the Press in 2011, Ms Ferguson admitted that accepting the money had been ‘a gigantic error of judgment’. Was Prince Andrew aware of this gift? Did he help solicit it? And has the tainted money since been returned to Epstein? 10 Finally, in 2011, after Jeffrey Epstein had been freed from prison, the News of the World published a photograph of him strolling with Prince Andrew in New York’s Central Park. The image caused widespread outrage, and led to the Prince’s resignation as Britain’s roving Trade Ambassador. Why did the Prince choose to continue his personal relationship with Epstein — by then a convicted paedophile — at this time? How many meetings did he have with Epstein following his conviction? And when did he last speak to or meet him? Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Prince Andrew accused of sleeping with 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts .

His owners Zoe and Chris Gray believe that when their neighbour in Burnage took a load to the tip, Albus found his way into the van. They have issued an urgent appeal in the hope someone has seen two-and-a-half-year-old Albus since he went missing last Monday.

"Having tried for a baby for seven years, Nicola and Andrew Stone were heartbroken when two expensive rounds of IVF failed to yield a pregnancy. But determined to try and have child, they decided to opt for one more cycle - this time, with a twist. The couple asked for a special procedure they had read about in the hope it might give them the son or daughter they had dreamed of. The technique involves using a special adhesive to fix the couple's embryo to the wall of Mrs Stone's womb.

I didn't think it would work but I'm so glad it did. Sophia is everything we wished for. 'All I wanted was to be a mummy, but there were so many problems to sort out. Now she's here, we're so happy.' Mrs Stone was told to lose weight to help her conceive and Mr Stone, 47, a self-employed builder, was advised to take a variety of vitamins and minerals such as zinc to give his low sperm count a boost. But they also received the advanced glue treatment before Sophia was born in July. Mrs Stone said: 'My embryos were dipped in glue and the lining of my womb was scratched so that everything would implant. 'As the lining heals, doctors think it helps to keep the embryo safe and in place.' Mr and Mrs Stone started trying for a baby in 2007, two years before they married, but when nothing happened after a year, the pair went to see the doctor. 'A test revealed that Andrew's sperm count was desperately low and I was told that my BMI was too high,' Mrs Stone said. 'It was a shock to find out that Andrew had problems and I didn't know just how serious being overweight was in terms of becoming a parent. Embryoglue has been used in a handful of fertility clinics since 2012, but is unknown to most couples struggling to conceive. It is usually used as a last resort after couples have tried two rounds of IVF without success. In the final stages of their third course of IVF, the embryo is dipped in a strongly adhesive gluey substance prior to being put back into the womb. It sticks to the side of the mother's womb, increasing the chance of implantation of the embryo to the uterus. The product, which doctors describe as working like 'superglue', is made with naturally occurring ingredients. It also supports embryo development as it is enriched with nutrients and energy sources. Research has shown that using the glue increases birth rate by eight per cent. Dr Lucy Jenner, embryology manager at Care Fertility, Nottingham, said: 'There are lots of new ways for us to be able to maximise the chances of a pregnancy following IVF and it seems that Andy and Nicola have used all of them at once, which is quite unusual. 'Embryoglue is a natural substance we use to help 'super glue' the embryo in place and it seems to have done the trick this time.' 'My BMI was 36 and that was way too high and I was advised to get it down to 31, which meant losing about three stone. 'Before the first IVF effort, I had lost a stone. I was feeling quite hopeful. 'Andrew had managed to produce some healthy sperm and we were positive.' But two attempts ended in failure and the couple were devastated. Mrs Stone said: 'We decided to have one last attempt at IVF. We were offered a new treatment in which the embryos are incubated in a different way. 'We just wanted it to work. We would have done absolutely anything to have a healthy baby.' A new video technique to monitor embryos was used and Mrs Stone was given the glue to help the embryo implant in the womb. She said: 'I was so nervous because I knew we'd done so much this time. If this attempt failed, I knew we would be in serious trouble. The chances of having a baby would be zero.' Two weeks after treatment, a pregnancy test confirmed she was pregnant. 'I cried and cried. It was a dream come true. All I ever wanted was to be a mum. Andrew was completely overwhelmed, too,' Mrs Stone said. 'I think it was 6am when we did the test. I hadn't slept a wink. 'We waited until I was 13 weeks' pregnant before we told our family. 'Everyone was so thrilled for us. Our parents had been so supportive. All we wanted was to tell them we were having a baby. 'It had taken us seven years to get pregnant. I never dreamed it would be such a long journey.' Baby Sophia was born on July 14, 2014. She weighed a healthy 7lb 10oz. 'She was adorable and we were the proudest parents,' Mrs Stone said. 'Everything we'd been through seemed like a distant memory. 'When I held her in my arms, I cried with joy. We both did. Andrew cut her cord and it was wonderful. 'One day, we'll tell her just how special she is. But for now, all I'm interested in is having some special time with my family.' Mr and Mrs Stone, were unable to get IVF treatment on the NHS because they didn't meet the criteria. Mrs Stone was delighted when baby Sophia Elsie-May was born. 'She was adorable and we were the proudest parents,' Mrs Stone said, 'Everything we'd been through seemed like a distant memory' Two weeks after the procedure in which Mrs Stone's fertilised embryos were dipped in special glue, a test confirmed she was pregnant. Pictured is a scan of Sophie Elsie-May . They decided to fund private treatment themselves by missing out on holidays and trips out to save the cash to pay for treatment. They had two failed attempts, costing a total of nearly £5,000 each before the final successful effort which cost more than £7,000. Self-employed builder Mr Stone worked extra hours to help raise the money and family members also chipped in to help them. 'Money was never an issue we said that would give ourselves the best hope of having a baby no matter what it cost,' Mr Stone said. 'We went without holidays and stopped going out as much. We just said ""It's either a holiday or a baby"" - and it was no contest.' 'There was a lot of tears and heartache after the first two attempts failed. We had decided that with the third attempt it was all or nothing. 'We've gone through a lot over the last six years, but it has all been worth it in the end and we have our perfect little girl,' Mr Stone said . 'Basically we were given a list of the things we could do to give us a better chance and the price list. 'Nicola had been all internet forums and discussion groups and everybody was saying how successful the 'glue' option was so we asked for that as well. 'When Nicola did her first pregnancy test and it was positive we didn't dare believe it. 'During that week she must have used seven or eight pregnancy testing kits and we still didn't really believe it until the first scan confirmed she was pregnant. 'We've gone through a lot over the last six years - particularly Nicola, but it has all been worth it in the end and we have our perfect little girl.'

"A Massachusetts woman imprisoned for more than 20 years after killing her two-year-old daughter is now pleading for her freedom. On August 15, 1988, Nancy McGeoghean, then 20 years old, allegedly strangled her two-year-old daughter, Sarah, and smothered her after a night of drinking with friends, according to court documents. McGeoghean didn't remember a thing, according to the Boston Globe, and woke up that morning to find her daughter unresponsive and blue strapped in a car seat on the living room floor. A jury found the mother guilty and sentenced her to life in prison. Pleading: Nancy McGeoghean has been in a state prison for more than 20 years for killing her two-year-old daughter and is now pleasing for her freedom . That was 26 years ago. And now, at 45-years-old, McGeoghean is pleading for her freedom. Rare in the state, McGeoghean is being given a chance to persuade the Massachusetts Advisory Board of Pardons to recommend that she be eligible for release from the Framingham prison, something that hasn't been done in more than 15 years, according to the Globe. In the Dec. 29 hearing, McGeoghean spoke about killing her daughter and not remembering committing the crime, even though  she initially denied killing her daughter in the 1989 trial. 'I am ashamed of myself. I am disgusted with myself,' McGeoghean reportedly said in the hearing. 'I loved Sarah. She was the only thing in the whole world that was mine.' McGeoghean earned the rare shot due to her behavior in prison, Board officials said. According to the Globe, McGeoghean trained service dogs and counseled other prisoners during the unusually long sentence. The decision to recommend is now up to Governor Deval Patrick. If he agrees to the commutation of McGeoghean's sentence, her case will go to the Governor's Council for a vote, the Globe reports. If the Council votes yes, McGeoghean will be eligible for parole. Vote: The decision to recommend McGeoghean for commutation is now in the hands of  Governor Deval Patrick (photographed) However, according to the state's website, a commutation is not forgiveness for the 'underlying offense.' 'It simply means that the period of incarceration served for the offense has been reduced.' Born to abusive, alcoholic parents, McGeoghean had Sarah at 18 years old and was addicted to drugs and alcohol. She and Sarah were living in a 'flea-infested' apartment in Cambridge at the time of the murder, according to Patch. A psychiatrist who examined McGeoghean at the time said she was undergoing withdrawal after heavy use of cocaine and 'just snapped.' However, court documents state that prosecutors said McGeoghean killed Sarah with 'deliberate premeditation and malice aforethought.' Court documents also state that McGeoghean 'inflicted cigarette burns on Sarah's chest' in the months before her death. Though initially McGeoghean said she didn't believe she was capable of killing her own daughter, she said in the hearing that there is 'no other explanation.' 'I believe I killed her,' McGeoghean said. A board member asked McGeoghean at the hearing why she thinks she did it, according to the Globe. McGeoghean shook her head and cried. 'Not remembering is torture to me,' she replied.","Nancy McGeoghean, 45, is pleading for her freedom after receiving a life sentence for killing her two-year-old daughter more than 20 years ago .

"Police Federation chairman Steve White said many victims of crime do not call police because they feel 'nothing will be done' Many victims of crime do not bother to call the police because they feel ‘nothing will be done’, a top officer admitted yesterday. Thousands of offences are going unrecorded as people ask themselves ‘what’s the point?’ said Police Federation chairman Steve White. Mr White, who represents more than 130,000 rank-and-file officers, said forces are not sending out police ‘as they once would’. And he said repeated Government claims that crime is falling are false because many offences are instead simply falling below the radar. He also condemned comments made by the head of the police watchdog this weekend that police may pursue offences that ‘matter most to people’ above offences such as shoplifting. In an unusually outspoken response, Mr White branded Sir Tom’s comments as ‘disgustingly offensive’ and ‘extraordinarily ignorant’. He said they are founded on the mistaken belief that there are fewer crimes for police to deal with and that forces will inevitably shrink. ‘Crime isn’t falling,’ he said. ‘Many people don’t report crime now because they feel nothing will be done and they are right. What’s the point? I have every sympathy with them. ‘Forces have to decide on their local priorities because they don’t have the resources or time to deal with everything. ‘That means officers are not being sent out to deal with incidents as they once would have been. ‘Officers are being forced not to turn up to crimes because they have no time to deal with them. This is not what they signed up to do. ‘And while I do agree, some crimes are less serious than others, this is not the case for the victim. It is disgustingly offensive to suggest that one victim deserves a better service than another.’ Mr White has personal experience of the phenomenon of unrecorded crime after his daughter, a university student in Manchester, was robbed before Christmas. She did not dial 999, despite being targeted by a cycling robber who snatched her bag, as she knew others had also been targeted and police seemed powerless. Mr White said: ‘She told me: ""It happens all the time around here. They [the police] can’t do anything. I didn’t get a look at the man and there is no CCTV so what’s the point?"" ‘The point is that unless you record the crimes the police do not know what has happened and they cannot do anything about it. He said repeated Government claims that crime is falling are false because many offences are instead simply falling below the radar (file picture) ‘This is something that is reflected not just among students and universities but up and down the country from shed break-ins to vandalism.’ Sir Tom described Mr White’s comments as ‘regrettably intemperate and wholly misconceived’. Defending his understanding of the pressures on police, the watchdog denied suggesting some victims deserve a better service than others. He said: ‘It is important that the police service, policing institutions and those who represent police officers work together to ensure that policing is improved. ‘That requires a debate conducted in a dignified and intelligent fashion.’ Sir Tom, who was knighted in the New Year honours list, also said police facing stringent budget cuts will need to ‘work smarter’. The Chief Inspector of the Constabulary suggested forces must analyse demand and target more serious crimes such as drugs, violent offences and the sexual exploitation of children. Mr White also branded comments made by Sir Tom Winsor (pictured) as 'disgustingly offensive' He said: ‘Any crime that is reported to the police has to be taken seriously, however there are crimes that are more serious than others. ‘Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people …’ The row comes as forces continue to feel the impact of substantial budget cuts which led to them shedding more than 30,000 officers and staff. Further job losses are expected as chief constables warn they have stripped back administrative and other costs to the bone. Last month Lincolnshire Chief Constable Neil Rhodes said his force will effectively go out of business within three years if funding is cut further. In November forces covering nearly half the population of England and Wales were criticised for failing to investigate crime properly. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said forces are stuck in the past, using out-dated methods to deal with modern-day offences such as cybercrime. The watchdog said investigations are sub-standard in 18 of the 43 police forces covering 28 million people including cities such as London, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. The failures were laid bare a week after forces were criticised for ‘indefensible’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappear from official figures.","Steve White said forces are not sending out officers 'as they once would'

"Separating your delicates from your everyday clothes, and having to wash them at different times could soon be a thing of the past. LG has unveiled a washing machine with two washers that lets people save time and energy by cleaning double the amount of clothes simultaneously. Plus, homeowners can control the temperature and length of cycles, and set them to start, while they're out of the house using an app. Scroll down for video . LG's latest washing machine uses a Twin Wash system to clean two loads simultaneously. The machine has a main washer above a smaller washer in the pedestal beneath (pictured). LG said the the mini washer is perfect for items that need specific settings, and it can also be fitted to any of LG's front loading machines . The Twin Wash System was announced during LG's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It is powered by the mini washer, which LG calls the 'world's first compact washer in a hide-away pedestal, generating a whole new set of washing options.' For example, muddy gym wear can be separated from whites, or silk underwear can be washed at the same time as towels on a hot wash. When not in use, the mini washer acts simply as the pedestal for the main washer, but it can also be combined with any of LG's front loading washers. The system is Wi-Fi and NFC enabled and is fitted with LG's SmartThinQ technology. This means users can program cycles using an app, including the temperature and length, while they're at work, or on their way home. LG also showcased its latest 'Door-In-Door' fridge.Shelves are built into the first set of doors, which then open around a second set of doors, and the main fridge compartment. LG claims it stops up to 47 per cent of cold air escaping each time the fridge is opened, which saves energy and keeps food fresher for longer . While the NFC tagging technology, means users can download pre-programmed wash cycles to their smartphones, and start them by touching the phone on the machine. It also has a Smart Diagnosis feature that helps users to quickly identify issues and faults. The South Korean tech giant also used the event to announce its next-generation flexible phone, called G Flex 2. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 64-bit octa-core processor, with 2GB of RAM. The 5.5-inch full HD curved display has a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and a 403 Pixel Per Inch density. It runs Android Lollipop and the whole device is said to be 30 per cent more durable than the original model. These machines additionally have LG's TurboWash technology that uses twin nozzles at the front of the washer to spray a concentrated detergent solution directly onto the clothes. A high pressure nozzle above the drum then sprays water particles through the clothes during high spin cycles for quick and effective rinsing. This speeds up the washes further. Prices and a release date for the Twin Wash system and machines has not yet been announced. 'One might be tempted to call the LG Twin Wash System disruptive, as it's a completely new concept in appliances,' said Seong-jin Jo, president and boss of the LG Electronics Home Appliance and Air Solution Company. 'The addition of a mini washer underneath the main washer translates to greater flexibility, convenience and efficiency. 'It's also another big leap forward in our commitment to using cutting-edge technology and innovative ideas to make life better for consumers around the world.'

Shelves are built into the first set of doors, which then open around a second set of doors, and the main fridge compartment. Called Model LPXS346C, the new Door-In-Door fridge model has 34 cubic feet of space, and LG claims it stops up to 47 per cent of cold air escaping each time the fridge is opened. This is because the whole fridge isn't opened each time, which saves energy and keeps food fresher for longer.

"From curses etched in lead to lucky rabbit feet, magical charms have long given insights into the superstitions of ancient cultures. Now, a 1,500-year-old amulet has been unearthed in southwest Cyprus that bears a palindrome inscription, that reads the same backwards as it does forwards. Its discovery suggests that some people continued to place their faith in ancient gods and superstitions in a bid to protect themselves, despite old beliefs being quashed by the Romans. A 1,500-year-old amulet has been unearthed in southwest Cyprus that bears a palindrome inscription (pictured), which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. It translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine’ The amulet was found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos and the inscription translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine,’ Livescience reported. It is not the first ancient artefact bearing a palindrome to be discovered. Similarly, Roman lead ‘curse tablets' have been recovered in Bath, for example, which include magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Palindromes were possibly used with a similar intention. As well as the inscription, the amulet features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, and Harpocrates, the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool. The protective charm also has a mythical dog-headed creature called a cynocephalus etched into it, who is mimicking Harpocrates. The amulet was found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos (ruins are pictured) in the agora, an ancient meeting place. Its discovery suggests that some people continued to place their faith in magic and ancient gods in a bid to protect themselves, despite old beliefs being quashed by the Romans . As well as the inscription, the amulet features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, Osiris, and Harpocrates (depicted here on a Roman pillar), the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool . The inscription on the amulet, found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos in Cyprus, translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine.’ It was written as a palindrome, which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. There are two small mistakes in the inscription. The 1,500-year-old amulet also bears unusual drawings on the other side.

The protective charm also has a mythical dog-headed creature called a cynocephalus etched into it, who is mimicking Harpocrates. It is unclear exactly why the images or precise words were chose, but amulets were believed to protect their owners from harm. It is unclear exactly why the images or precise words were chosen, but amulets were believed to protect their owners from harm. The unusual object was discovered in 2011 in the ancient agora – a meeting place – in Nea Paphos, by archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. Professor Joachim Śliwa, of the university, wrote that there are two small mistakes in the palindrome, in the study published in the journal, Studies in Ancient Art and Civilisation. The scribe accidentally wrote ‘p’ instead of ‘v’ on two occasions. At the time the amulet was made, Cyprus was part of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire. Its official religion was Christianity and pagan practices were increasingly clamped down upon. Despite this, people, such as the owner of this amulet, carried on practicing old believes and superstitions. A mosaic dating from the seventh century AD was also found to have pagan elements in it. Leader of the excavation, Professor Ewdoksia Papuci-Wladyka, said that it seems that Christian and pagan religions coexisted in Paphos. However, the pagan drawings on the amulet suggest that its scribe was not over familiar with the mythological animals that he drew.

Drawings on the amulet suggest that its scribe was not over familiar with the mythological animals that he drew. Professor Śliwa wrote that details may be based on Egyptian sources, but are not drawn with much skill. One of the images shows mummified Egyptian god, Osiris (pictured here in a frieze dating to 1,275BC . Professor Śliwa wrote that the animals may be based on Egyptian sources, but are not drawn with much skill and have unusual details. For example, he explained that Harpocrates should be sitting on a lotus flower, not a stool, while cynocephalus should not be mimicking the god of silence. He told LiveScience: ‘[In] the classic version, the cynocephalus faces Harpocrates with paws raised in adoration.’ Cross-hatched lines across the two character’s bodies, also suggests that the scribe thought they were mummified, which is incorrect in the case of Harpocrates. A collection of 130 ancient 'curse tablets' featuring gruesome messages of revenge was added to the World Heritage register in June 2014. They include wishes that thieves should go blind and mad, while cheaters become as 'liquid as water.' The nasty messages – known as curse tablets - were written on pieces of lead by victims of theft or wrong doing, and were tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset. Artefacts bearing palindromes have been discovered in the ancient world. Similarly, Roman lead ‘curse tablets' (pictured) have been recovered in Bath, for example, which include magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency . Some messages included magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Others were pierced with nails to achieve a similar result. A total of 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the Roman Baths have been deemed so precious they have been added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) 'Memory of the World' register of outstanding documentary heritage. In what could be the Roman version of modern-day trolling, the authors poured bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways. One tablet asks for an adversary's intestines to be ‘quite eaten away’, while another one reveals that the victim of a theft of a bronze vessel wanted the cup to be filled with the thief’s blood. The curses, which date back between the 2nd and 4th century AD, are mostly written in Latin on pieces of lead and pewter and are addressed to the goddess Sulis Minerva. They were cast into the hot springs at Bath, where they were left for the goddess, who was worshiped by Celts and Romans and believed to dispense justice.","Amulet was found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos, southwest Cyprus .

"Sarah Ferguson was once given £15,000 from paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein to pay off her debts. The deal was struck in December 2010 after months of negotiations with the disgraced tycoon who insisted on helping with her financial troubles. It came within days of the Duke of York flying out to visit Epstein in New York, fuelling speculation he had smoothed the path for his ex-wife to take the money just 18 months after he was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from under-age girls. The Duchess of York later claimed her judgment had been 'clouded' by her desperation to get out of her £5million debt and vowed to repay the money. But when asked today whether she had paid back the cash, her spokesman told MailOnline: 'No comment'. Fergie's relationship with Epstein has been thrown into the spotlight once again amid the furore over claims Prince Andrew had sex with an under-age girl 'procured' by the disgraced tycoon - an allegation the prince 'emphatically denies'. Sarah Ferguson was given £15,000 by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (right) to pay off her debts . Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein pictured strolling through Central Park together during a four-day break in New York at the start of December 2010 within days of the billionaire giving Fergie the £15,000 payment . Prince Andrew was expected to hold crisis talks with the Queen today as he returned to Britain from a holiday in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Verbier with his ex-wife, their daughter, Princess Eugenie, and friends including Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. It is understood he will reassure his mother at the earliest possible opportunity that the claims he faces are false. The prince – who looked sombre as he left his luxury £22,000-a-week Swiss ski chalet yesterday – is today also expected to meet with his most senior aides and lawyers in his mansion close to Windsor Castle. The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a U.S. civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 – a minor under U.S. law – and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. The sexual allegations were robustly denied by Buckingham Palace in an unprecedented four public statements, which describe them as ‘false and without foundation’. Sources close to the prince admitted he had been 'guilty of a poor choice of friend', with one saying: 'I don't think anyone, not even the duke himself, would defend that friendship.' There were also questions last night over the extraordinary legal deal that it is thought to have resulted in Prince Andrew – as well as other associates of Epstein – having immunity from any future prosecution. Solemn: Fellow skiers watch as Prince Andrew leaves his £22k-a-week Swiss chalet yesterday, bound for Britain amid the growing furore over claims he had sex with an under-age girl . Retreat: The royal, above, did not leave the chalet for the last two days of his holiday after the scandal broke . Crisis talks: The royal, above, is expected to speak with his most senior aides and lawyers . FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’ SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’ SATURDAY EVENING: In response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’ SUNDAY EVENING: Miss Roberts' father claimed his daughter had been introduced to the Queen - again denied in a statement by the Palace before reiterating the sexual claims are 'without foundation'. It has been reported that Prince Andrew met Epstein through Sarah Ferguson and Epstein's companion Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell. Epstein went on to enjoy a close relationship with the family - including on one occasion flying to the Bahamas to meet Fergie and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. It  later emerged that Fergie had been in negotiations with the disgraced American financier for nine months in 2010 over plans for him to pay off her debts. The deal was eventually struck in December of that year as her ex-husband holidayed with Epstein for the first time since 2006, sources confirmed at the time. It was the clearest sign that Andrew had smoothed the path for his ex-wife to take Epstein's money. The two men were pictured strolling through Central Park together during a four-day break at the start of December, after the Duke of York abandoned plans to stay at the exclusive Carlyle Hotel in favour of Epstein's Manhattan mansion. Epstein threw a cocktail party in his honour - attended by Woody Allen and CBS News presenter Katie Couric – and then the first installment of £15,000 cash was paid to Johnny O'Sullivan, the duchess's former personal assistant. O'Sullivan and Epstein fell out so no further money was ever transferred. At the time, the duke's office repeatedly refused to comment on suggestions that he brokered a deal, but the Duchess of York admitted that Andrew 'and his office' – four staff funded by the Queen – had been 'more than marvellous' and 'sorted out my debts'. In an interview with . Geordie Greig, then editor of the Evening Standard, in 2011, the duchess later attempted to shoulder the blame on behalf of her ex-husband and claimed . her judgment had been 'clouded' by her desperation to get out of . £5million debts. 'I personally, on behalf of myself, . deeply regret that Jeffrey Epstein became involved in any way with me,' she said. Allegations: Prince Andrew pictured with Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell, right, in 2001 . 'I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know . that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. 'I am just so contrite I cannot say. Whenever I can I will repay the money and will have nothing ever to do . with Jeffrey Epstein ever again... 'The . duke is a man who does not know how to tell an untruth or behave . dishonourably. There have been errors of judgment but nothing . substantive has been done wrong by him, ever... 'He . is a first-rate father; he's a first-rate man, the finest that I know. I . will not have his name tarnished by me yet again. Look at all that he . has done for the country. He works tirelessly.' She equated the gravity of her latest error with her . cataclysmic fall from grace in the preceding May, when she was secretly recorded . taking £27,000 in cash from undercover reporters in return for . guaranteed access to Andrew. She . said: 'Once again my errors have compounded and rebounded and also . inadvertently impacted on the man I admire most in the world, the duke. 'He has supported me and come to my rescue again and again and there is absolutely nothing that I would not do for him. 'It . is in times of difficulty that character shows itself. I am fiery Irish . redhead and I am to remain strong, fight strong and try to do what is . right.' Fergie's latest venture has seen her once again attempting to become a commercial success in the US – this time with an extraordinary film plugging a range of products including the bizarrely named 'Fusion Xcelerator' food emulsifier . The duchess was thought to have also been terrified that the wholesome image she was trying to rebuild – together with a series of lucrative deals in the US – could be damaged. After her divorce from Prince Andrew 19 years ago, the Duchess took on a string of endorsements in the US, including a deal with WeightWatchers. However, in 2006 the company set up to capitalise on her image in the US collapsed with debts of more than £1 million. Unperturbed, Fergie has recently filed her trademarks, which could enable her to endorse products including heated hair brushes and a line of farm produce. Friends say she will launch a range of up to 17 speciality teas in the next few weeks. Her latest venture has seen the Duchess of York once again attempting to become a commercial success in the US – this time with an extraordinary film plugging a range of products including the bizarrely named 'Fusion Xcelerator food emulsifier. Called Duchess Discoveries, the 28-minute 'infomercial' is scheduled to air on American television early this year. Saleswoman: Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson in an advert for her Fusion Xcelerator 'food emulsfier' Described as a 'powerful micro-emulsification system', the seven-piece machine costing $99.99 (£65) also comes with the Duchess's meal plan. Manufacturers claim the processor breaks down food into a 'micro-cellular pre-digestive state' and 'captures all of the essential vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and phyto-nutrients' to ensure the healthiest smoothies. On camera, the Duchess claims the food processor accelerates weight loss, boosts energy and strengthens the immune system. It is understood she has been using the juicer for 14 months to aid her weight loss. However, Sioned Quirke, a leading British dietician and obesity specialist, told The Mail on Sunday: 'Any blender can break down food. This one uses several jargon terms to make it sound superior when it probably isn't. 'Breaking food down to a pre-digestive state is the job of your stomach and it does it well. You don't need anything to help it do its job. 'And no juicer or blender can enhance how much nutrition your body will actually absorb.' A friend said: 'Sarah would never endorse a product unless it worked for her. She's in a really good place at the moment. 'She keeps saying 'This is me time' and 'This is my time to blossom'. In England she will always be the Duchess of Pork. But in LA or New York she's still a Royal and the Americans love that.'

Severely injured: Rudy the horse, who was left for dead in Oklahoma City this New Years, is now on the road to recovery after receiving more than $16,000 in donations towards his care . Oklahoma City Animal Control is currently pursuing charges against the man who called them last Thursday night saying he wanted Rudy removed  from his property. 'They didn't even go out there to check on him to see if he was alive. 'They didn't call a vet to come out and help or anything like that, and I think that's the most distressing thing,' one of Rudy's rescuers told News 9. When authorities arrived to collect Rudy they found him in a state of distress covered in blood and mud but still breathing. He was transported from his paddock on St. Bernard Street to Blaze's Tribute Equine Rescue center.

"‘I thought strokes only happened to elderly people,' said Angharad Lloyd-Thomas, who suffered a stroke . Waking up one cold December morning two years ago, Angharad Lloyd-Thomas felt so weak that she couldn’t get out of bed. ‘I eventually managed to slide out but I fell over because the whole of my left side felt weak,’ says Angharad, now 22. ‘I crawled to the bathroom, but I couldn’t work out how to tear off the toilet paper. I just stared at it.’ It was 7.30 am and, convincing herself she was just overtired, she dragged herself back to bed and fell back to sleep. She woke 20 minutes later feeling fine and went to have a shower. ‘But when I got in, I couldn’t figure out what the tap was for,’ says Angharad, who was then studying primary education at university in Carmarthen, Wales. Alerted by the sound of Angharad crying, her flatmate Beth ran in and found her on the floor, completely hysterical. ‘I thought I was shouting for Beth, but no words were coming out,’ says Angharad. ‘Beth rang my mum, who works five minutes away as a practice nurse. 'As soon as she arrived, she knew something was seriously wrong and took me straight to A&E.’ In the car and waiting room, Angharad continued to have odd episodes of struggling to get any words out and weakness, lasting a few minutes each. In fact, these episodes were transient ischaemic attacks, also known as mini strokes. These can be a sign a major stroke is about to occur — and Angharad suffered a large stroke less than an hour after arriving at hospital, while sitting in the waiting room. ‘The left side of my face suddenly drooped, my left side was paralysed and I couldn’t utter a word,’ she recalls. Brain scans confirmed a stroke, and that her brain showed an area of dead matter, but Angharad was surprised to learn of the diagnosis. ‘I thought strokes only happened to elderly people.’ She was wrong. In fact, strokes are becoming more commonplace among the young — and women especially may have additional risk factors that increase their chance of having one. Strokes occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, and there can be various causes for this. The most common is an ischaemic stroke, which is responsible for 85 per cent of cases and occurs as a result of a blood clot or clump of fat blocking a blood vessel in the brain. Another example is a haemorrhagic stroke that is caused by a bleed in the brain. About 152,000 strokes happen in the UK a year. Some 30,000 women a year in England and Wales die as a result of a stroke — three times the number who die from breast cancer. For men and women, strokes are most common in over-55s, but disturbingly the number of under-55s having a stroke is on the rise. In England, the number of cases rose from 9,321 in 1998 to 16,415 in 2010. So why is this happening? Scroll down for video . ‘The left side of my face suddenly drooped, my left side was paralysed and I couldn’t utter a word,’ said Angharad, who suffered a large stroke less than an hour after arriving at hospital . ‘It’s thought that the rise is down to an increase in eating salty, fatty foods and obesity,’ says Caroline Watkins, professor of stroke and older people’s care at the University of Central Lancashire. Having a high salt intake is the single biggest risk factor for stroke because it increases blood pressure and causes artery walls to harden and narrow — making a blood clot more likely. Smoking, being overweight and drinking excessive amounts of alcohol are also stroke risks because they, too, increase blood pressure. High-fat foods are also a problem as they can lead to the build-up of fatty plaques in your arteries. And a high-sugar diet can also increase your stroke risk, says Professor Watkins. Sugar damages the arteries and can lead to diabetes, which leads to raised blood sugar levels. These can trigger fatty deposits or clots on the insides of the blood vessel walls. Yet women have other risk factors too. Doctors suspected that Angharad’s stroke was brought on as a result of being on the combined pill (which contains both oestrogen and progestogen). This, along with pregnancy and taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), can increase women’s chances of having a stroke because they raise risk of clots and high blood pressure. ‘Oestrogen can increase the likelihood of the blood clotting and this may increase your risk of ischaemic stroke,’ says Dr Kate Holmes, deputy director of research at the Stroke Association. In 2000, a large analysis of research studies published in the medical journal JAMA found that there was an increased risk of stroke associated with taking the contraceptive pill, although pills that contain smaller amounts of oestrogen had less of a risk. And in February, the European Medicines Agency reported how women taking so-called ‘third generation’ contraceptive pills, such as Yasmin, Femodene and Marvelon, were nearly twice as likely to develop blood clots that can trigger strokes as those on older varieties and six times more likely than women on no pills at all. It’s thought that it is the particular types of synthetic oestrogen these newer pills contain, such as gestodene, desogestrel, drospirenone, etonogestrel and norelgestromin — that increase the risk. However, these contraceptives are popular because they have fewer side-effects than traditional forms. ‘The risk of stroke caused by the contraceptive pill is low, but it’s higher if you have other risk factors,’ says Dr Holmes. The combined pill should be used with caution if you have any of the following risks and not used at all if two or more apply: you’re a smoker or stopped less than a year ago; you have high blood pressure; you’re over 35 and a smoker; you have a family member who has had a blood clot under 45; you’re overweight; you’ve had a clot or stroke in the past; you have diabetes with complications; you have migraines. Angharad had none of these. ‘I knew the Pill increased risk of blood clots, but not stroke,’ says Angharad. ‘I came off it immediately after my stroke and now use a coil.’ Despite the extra stroke risks for women (men have an overall higher risk of stroke, but women have more risk factors), a recent poll from the Stroke Association found one in eight women are unaware that they could suffer a stroke. The charity described the finding as ‘extremely worrying’ and adds: ‘This should serve as a wake-up call to women of all ages to be aware of the steps they can take to reduce their stroke risk’. After her stroke, Angharad stayed in hospital for a week and was put on an anti-coagulant, which reduces the likelihood of a clot forming, and a statin, which lowers cholesterol. ‘After a few days, I could walk slowly to the toilet with help. 'I started speaking after the stroke, but very slowly and I struggled with certain words, like please and thank you. 'I could see them in my head, but just couldn’t get them out. ‘My left side was still very weak and I couldn’t wash myself, so Mum did it for me. I felt overwhelmed.’ She set her mind to getting better quickly and, six weeks after her stroke, returned to university to study, while continuing to have physio. Six months later, Angharad collected her degree — on time — while her proud parents wept in the audience. For men and women, strokes are most common in over-55s, but disturbingly the number of under-55s having a stroke is on the rise (file picture) She is now studying to become a primary school teacher, but tires easily; her left side is also a little weaker — ‘I always carry my shopping with my right hand,’ she says — and she struggles to find the right words when she’s tired. Yet she’s grateful she had a stroke. ‘It’s made me so much more determined to succeed,’ she explains. Angharad’s story underlines the fact that stroke symptoms should never be ignored, regardless of age. A 2013 study found that women arrived at hospital, on average, 27 minutes later than men, but minutes can make a difference for getting the best treatment. ‘Don’t wait until later, tomorrow or next week if you notice symptoms — it could be too late,’ says Professor Watkins. ‘And pay attention to what others say, as you may not always feel a stroke or mini-stroke symptom yourself. ‘For example, if a friend comments that your face drooped for a few seconds, don’t ignore it. 'You may not have felt it, but it could be a sign of an impending stroke.’ For more information, visit stroke.org.uk/women .","Angharad Lloyd-Thomas, now 22, suffered a large stroke two years ago .

"A six-year-old boy has touched the heart of dozens of firefighters battling it out in South Australia by donating his beloved birthday cake. Jackson Newman had his birthday party cancelled over the weekend after his family were forced to evacuate their Birdwood home, just north east of Adelaide. His Transformer themed birthday cake, made and decorated by his mother Melissa Newman, became part of the dozens of products donated to the Country Fire Service (CFS). Scroll down for video . Six-year-old Jackson Newman donated his birthday cake to the firefighters battling the bushfires in South Australia . 'We were evacuated and came back on Sunday afternoon – the house was still quite smoky then – and some friends on Facebook said they were taking some stuff to the CFS,' Ms Newman told Daily Mail Australia. 'I put some things together and asked Jackson ""well, what about your cake? We can't eat all of that cake should we give it to the firefighters?"" and he said ""yep, that'll make them strong because it's a transformer cake"".' Ms Newman described her son as having a big heart and a good personality, adding that despite his age he processed things well. She said that although her son didn't get to share his cake with the firefighters, they were so touched by his donation that they visited him to return the favour with a gift of their own. CFS member and NSW Rural Fire Service worker Michael El Khoury (right) described how Jackson's touching donation brought him to tears. Mr El Khoury and over a dozen other firefighters visited Jackson (left) to thank him for his touching gift . 'I was so overwhelmed when I got the phone call to say 'can we meet him?' she said. 'I expected maybe one fire truck to come out, but there were six trucks that came, including a double cabin truck, and people were coming out of it left right and centre. 'They presented him with a hat as a present and he was very overwhelmed.' CFS member and NSW Rural Fire Service worker Michael El Khoury described how Jackson's touching donation brought him to tears. 'Little Jackson made me cry yesterday morning when I saw the cake! After meeting him and seeing his smile, I felt like I won the lotto!!! Long live the service I serve,' Mr El Khoury wrote on Facebook. Although he had to have his birthday party cancelled due to needing to evacuate his home, which was at risk of going up in flames, Jackson (pictured in the fire truck window) was overwhelmed by the six trucks filled with volunteers who came to visit him and present him with a hat . Firefighters expressed how Jackson's gift moved them on social media . Shaun Doughty was also touched by the sentiment, declaring that gestures like this were 'the reason I am a volunteer'. 'Some people might not think it is much but to me this better than any pay cheque,' he wrote. However the Newman family are yet to unpack their bags after their first evacuation, with conditions expected to escalate over Tuesday and Wednesday as temperatures soar. Over 12,500 hectares of land and 38 homes have been destroyed or badly damaged as well as 129 other buildings such as farm sheds and businesses, with the number expected to rise. Jackson's support is just one of many unique donations being made by South Australian locals, with fruit market owner Justin Golding delivering 65 kilograms worth of fruit to his local fire station on Saturday to show his appreciation.

"A chilled glass of Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay may look white, but has more in common with red wine than you might imagine. Scientists have discovered that white grapes contain the same pigments that give red wine its colour, suggesting that ‘white’ wine may not really exist. The presence of the pigments, called anthocyanins could explain why producers of white wine using white grapes are sometimes surprised to see a pinkish tinge in bottles. Scientists have discovered that white grapes contain the same pigments that give red wine its colour. Called anthocyanins, they may explain why producers of wine using white grapes are sometimes surprised to see a pinkish tinge in bottles . Anthocyanins originate from the skins of grapes and combined with other chemical compounds, are responsible for the majority of red wine’s colour. The precise colour of red wine is dependent on the acidity surrounding anthocyanins in wine and in alkaline solutions, they give a blue colour. Until now, most wine experts believed that white grapes didn’t have anthocyanins in them, explaining why white wine is almost clear, Panagiotis Arapitsas of Italy's Edmund Mach Foundation told New Scientist. Anthocyanins originate from the skins of grapes(Chardonnay are pictured) and combined with other chemical compounds, are responsible for the majority of red wine’s colour . If global temperatures continue to rise, the taste of wine could either drastically change, or the drink could be off the menu completely. A wine expert has warned that  wines such as Pinot Noir, are having their flavour significantly altered due to climate change. And, as a result, vineyard owners are ditching these grape varieties in favour of those that are better equipped to handle the increases in global temperature. The effects are said to be most prominent in France, Italy and Spain - although parts of America, including California, would also be affected. The primary reason is that the grapes are growing faster than before due to increased temperatures - an effect more prominent for wines such as Pinot Noir. This is making it hard for vineyard owners to know when to pick the grapes at the right time to maintain a wine’s particular taste. In her study, wine industry consultant Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden, wrote: ‘Climate change is beginning to affect the singular flavours that people expect from different wines - the experience you come to know and trust from your favourite reds and whites.’ She continued: ‘As the atmosphere warms, the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season.’ ‘The optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar-to-acid ratio and the ideal flavour.’ She also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster. But using mass spectrometry to analyse Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling grapes, which are used to make white wine, his team discovered that these grapes so in fact contain anthocyanins. The concentrations of anthocyanins found in white grapes are several thousand times smaller than in red grape varieties such as Merlot, according to the study, published in Food Research International. Mr Arapitsas believes that the discovery may explain the long-standing mystery of why wine producers sometimes end up with white wine that looks pink like rosé. Anthocyanins are known to give blackberries and raspberries their colour, as well as autumn leaves, according to Bournemouth-based Andy Brunning, who writes the blog Compound Interest, . He explained that red wine is a complex mixture of between 800 and 1,000 chemical compounds. Compounds called tannins and phenolics make up just 0.1 per cent of a bottles of red wine, but have the biggest impact on its colour and flavour. 'As wines age, molecules of anthocyanins can undergo a wide variety of reactions to form larger ""complexes"", which can also contribute to the red colouration of the wine,' Mr Brunning explained. 'As a result, although the concentration of anthocyanins in a bottle of wine will constantly decrease... the red colour will still remain.' Tannins - small molecules joined together to make a long chain - dictate a wine's 'dryness' and bitterness, reacting with the proteins of a drinker's saliva to create the sensation of dryness. They can also contribute to the colour by combining with the anthocyanins.

"Donald Trump's youngest son Barron made a rare public outing with his famous father over the weekend, proving that his uncanny resemblance to the billionaire is still just as strong as ever. The lookalike pair attended the annual Trump Invitational Grand Prix on Sunday, alongside Barron's mother - and Donald's third wife - Melania. Eight-year-old Barron, who is Donald's fifth child, but his first with 44-year-old Melania, showcased a sophisticated style, wearing a crisp white polo shirt, navy blue shorts and suede loafers, while his father opted for his trademark navy suit, which he paired with a bright yellow tie. Scroll down for video . Suited and booted: Donald Trump's eight-year-old son Barron, has obviously inherited his father's fondness for wearing smart atire . Family outing: The trio enjoyed a rare public outing at the Trump Invitational Grand Prix on Sunday . Flashing the same wide smile at the cameras, the duo happily posed alongside each other for the waiting photographers, who were no doubt overjoyed to see young Barron making an appearance at the event. Clearly Barron is a big fan of the annual event; it is thought that it was at last year's Trump Invitational, which takes place every year at the businessman's luxury Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, that he was last photographed. In April 2013, proud mother Melania, who was born in Slovenia, revealed that her young son is not your average 'sweatpants child' and prefers instead to stick with the same smart style favored by his father. 'He's not a sweatpants child,' she told ABC News. 'He doesn't mind putting on [a suit] - but not every day - and he likes to dress up in a tie sometimes like Daddy.' 'He's not a sweatpants child': In 2013, Melania revealed to ABC News that her son prefers sharp suits to casual loungewear . Proud father: Donald seemed thrilled to be spending the day with his family at the event, which took place just hours before the newest season of his reality show Celebrity Apprentice aired . But when it comes to his grooming regime, Barron appears to have inherited his mother's fondness for more pricey skincare products. According to the former model turned beauty guru, the youngster enjoys using the $100 Caviar Complex C6 moisturizer from his mother's own skincare range, after his nightly bath. 'It smells very, very fresh,' the businesswoman explained. 'I put it on him from head to toe. He likes it!' The family's attendance at the sporting event, which sees 35 of the world’s top riders compete in an FEI world ranking competition in the hopes of winning the $125,000 prize, came just a few hours before the premiere of season seven of Donald's reality series Celebrity Apprentice. In the episode, which also saw Donald's daughter Ivanka seated with her father at the judging table, alongside guest judge Piers Morgan (Daily Mail Online's Editor-at-Large and the 2008 Celebrity Apprentice champion), the contestants were create a sell a selection of pies. Baby of the bunch: Barron is Donald's fifth child, and his first by third wife Melania . Devoted dad: Donald has always proven himself to be an incredibly dedicated father to Barron . The first casualty of the season was actress Keshia Knight Pulliam, former star of The Cosby Show, who was criticized by the judges for failing to contact her former co-star Bill Cosby to ask him for a donation to their cause. While firing her from the show, Donald told Keshia: 'You are an amazing person, but you were the project manager. 'You didn’t make one call that I really believe that if you’d called that gentleman he would have helped you, even if you hadn’t spoken to him in years.' Immediately after the show's premiere episode aired, Trump was quick to point out that it had been filmed before any women came forward with rape allegations against Cosby.","The family attended the annual Trump Invitational Grand Prix at 68-year-old Donald's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach .

"Interstellar director Christopher Nolan has revealed that he does not use basic day-to-day technology - because he 'can't be bothered' His £105m space epic took audiences on a breathtaking ride into outer space and even helped spawn scientific discoveries. But Christopher Nolan, the visionary filmmaker behind the sci-fi spectacular Interstellar, has revealed he does not use basic day-to-day technology - because he 'couldn't be bothered'. The British director, who also directed Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy, opts not to have email because he does not believe it 'would help me with anything I'm doing'. Nor does he own a mobile phone - which he says gives him time 'to think'. He told the Hollywood Reporter: 'Well, I’ve never used email because I don’t find it would help me with anything I’m doing. I just couldn’t be bothered about it. 'As far as the cellphone goes... I’m never two feet from a cellphone. 'It’s very easy to get in touch with me when people need to. I actually really like not having one because it gives me time to think. 'You know, when you have a smartphone and you have 10 minutes to spare, you go on it and you start looking at stuff.' The 44-year-old also told how few people had mobile phones when he moved to Los Angeles to start making films in 1997. He said: 'I've been very fortunate to be working continuously, so there's always someone around me who can tap me on the shoulder and hand me a phone if they need to.' The director of the Batman films - which are packed with gadgets - has previously referred to mobile phones as 'just toys for grown-ups'. Warner Bros did previously assign Nolan with an email address but he only realised several years later - by which time there were thousands of messages in the inbox. Interstellar, which has taken £426m globally, stars Anne Hathaway (left) and Matthew McConaughey (right) He has since made the studio close the account. Interstellar has so far taken £426m around the world. The master storyteller wrote the screenplay for the film with his younger brother Jonathan a decade after they first won acclaim for their dark reboot of the Batman franchise. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine.","Christopher Nolan, 44, does not believe having email would help his work .

"On a cold Monday in February 2012, 46-year-old Merseyside police officer Mike Cawson became a tragic statistic — one of hundreds of NHS patients injured or killed each year when medical devices fail. PC Cawson, who was suffering from heart failure, was being rushed by ambulance from Royal Liverpool University Hospital for life-saving surgery in a specialist cardiac unit at Manchester’s Wythenshawe Hospital. He never made it. His failing heart was relying on a special pump — a portable version of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inserted into his main artery. In 2013, there were 13,600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) — these were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries . Such pumps, which inflate and deflate a balloon in the artery, are used as temporary support for the heart in patients who are awaiting urgent cardiac surgery. But half-way through the 40-mile drive to the hospital where the specialist team was on standby to perform an emergency operation, the battery powering his pump failed. Internal hospital documents obtained by Good Health reveal that the battery, which had been fully charged before the ambulance journey, was faulty. With no spare battery on board, the transfer team from the Royal Liverpool were helpless and the ambulance was forced to divert to nearby Warrington Hospital, where the balloon had to be removed (an inactive balloon can quickly cause blood clots to form). Later that day PC Cawson was sent on to his original destination, but died the following day. An inquest into his death heard from a consultant cardiologist from the Wythenshawe who said it was ‘highly unlikely’ that the failure of the pump had contributed to PC Cawson’s death. The Royal Liverpool also reiterated to Good Health that its patient had experienced ‘no clinical adverse effects’ but had ‘sadly died after a sudden deterioration in his condition’. There is no doubt, however, that the failure of the pump did mean that PC Cawson was not able to have the life-saving surgery he was meant to have. Furthermore, after his death, the trust issued advice to all teams transferring patients with intra-aortic balloon pumps to carry a spare battery. It can be of no consolation to PC Cawson’s loved ones to learn that many other families’ lives have also been shattered when medical equipment failed patients. The official figures for the number of NHS patients injured or killed each year by faulty medical equipment are shocking. In 2013, there were 13,600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) — these were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries. The numbers are rising: over the past decade there have been almost 100,000 reports of failed devices, involving 2,300 deaths and 22,000 injuries. It's difficult to shake the impression that medical devices are being rushed onto the market . But these official figures could be just a fraction of the true human cost of unreliable medical equipment. For in a stunning admission to Good Health, the MHRA says it fears the true toll could be more than five times as bad. Its experts have told us that, based on global research and work carried out following the scandal over the PIP breast implants (which were made using industrial silicone with a high risk of rupture), they believe reporting of such incidents to be less than 20 per cent of the real figure —and possibly as low as 10 per cent. If this is true, this would mean in 2013 there were actually a shocking 68,000 adverse incidents, with 25,000 injuries and 1,545 deaths. Applied to the past decade, this produces a shocking tally that almost beggars belief: almost 500,000 incidents, 11,500 deaths and 110,000 serious injuries. Asked if it would be reasonable to extrapolate the figures in this way, Tony Sant, the watchdog’s manager responsible for adverse incident reporting and medical devices, said: ‘There’s nothing new with that kind of analysis. The question is, of those incidents: were the serious ones reported?’ There was, he adds, no way of knowing. One of the reasons for this is an extraordinary culture of secrecy embedded in EU law. Under Article 20 of the 1993 Medical Devices Directive, ‘all the parties involved in the application of this Directive are bound to observe confidentiality with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks’. In other words, the MHRA can’t breathe a word. ‘We can’t give you which trusts and which medical device manufacturers were involved,’ explains Mr Sant. ‘We are prohibited.’ That’s why the MHRA never named the manufacturer in an earlier death linked to a failed battery in an intra-aortic balloon pump. Yet these two incidents were neither the first nor the last time this type of device has failed. On March 24 last year, Maquet, a division of Swedish medical technology giant Getinge, urgently recalled more than 12,000 of its intra-aortic balloon pumps. It had received more than 100 reports that a simple design fault — a misshapen ring — was causing the device to shut down ‘without any visual or audible warning’. This could result in a sudden and potentially fatal loss of blood pressure. A patient died as a result. Getinge issued a previous urgent recall for the same device in 2010 when it discovered the screens indicating the pump’s performance tended to go blank. Kornelia Rasmussen, the communications manager for Getinge, told the Mail: ‘Our products, by their very nature, are used in life-threatening and critical care environments countless times each day. 'If we believe that any are not safe, or do not meet our specifications, we institute immediate corrective action and we will continue to do so.’ Getinge is not alone: each year the MHRA receives approximately 1,000 safety notices from manufacturers alerting the watchdog to problems with their products. Yet while the MHRA is not allowed to name the manufacturers, it was able to reveal that the most frequent failures have been in expensive, high‑tech equipment being used in critical situations, such as operations and in intensive care. The MHRA is also allowed to name names and products when a reported failing could have widespread safety implications, issuing a Medical Device Alert. The MHRA has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients . But here, too, the figures are far from reassuring. In 2014, 49 such alerts were issued. The most recent was on December 18, warning of a risk of serious injury to babies in an infant warmer made by Fisher & Paykel Healthcare. A faulty retaining nut meant the heater unit ‘may partially detach’. In the past year, device manufacturers, including some of the biggest names, have issued close to 1,000 so-called field safety notices. They make for hair-raising reading. At one end of the scale was a wheelchair that might suddenly tip its seat backwards and an instrument for orthopaedic surgery so badly designed that it couldn’t be cleaned properly, exposing patients to the risk of infection. More obviously life-threatening were faulty defibrillators, which are increasingly in the hands of inexperienced community volunteers. Last year, the MHRA issued an alert for one ‘smart’ defibrillator which advised life-savers to use too slow a rate of chest compression. Another defibrillator incorrectly displayed a ‘Do not touch the patient’ icon — which, according to the MHRA’s masterful understatement, ‘could affect patient outcome’. Grave faults were also highlighted in pumps that automatically administer drugs to patients, a ventilator used to aid breathing during surgery and a software program for analysing CT scans. The number of European patent applications for medical devices doubled between 2002 and 2012, outstripping applications from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors (there are already 500,000 different types of medical devices being used in the NHS). And it’s difficult to shake the impression that these devices are being rushed onto the market insufficiently tried and tested. This is reinforced by the shocking number of times the MHRA has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients. In 2013 alone, manufacturers were ordered to give 1,129 ‘undertakings to improve designs, manufacturing processes and quality systems’. And between 2011 and 2013, production ceased on 143 products, said a spokesman, ‘partly or wholly because of MHRA intervention or because a company felt it didn’t want to make the necessary changes for commercial reasons’. The MHRA is prevented from telling us which ones. A spokesman for the Association of British Healthcare Industries (ABHI) rejected any suggestion products were being rushed out, saying they were ‘put onto the market with processes backing them up to ensure they meet the correct standards’. Furthermore, monitoring the products after they’ve been launched ‘enables manufacturers to learn lessons from any field reports — if there is a situation identified by MHRA or others where improvements need to be made, then manufacturers will respond to that’. The number of reports of faulty medical devices involving new joints . And this is perhaps the most shocking thing of all. For the regulation of medical devices is a bit like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. Under EU law, private companies, known as ‘notified bodies’, ‘assess medical devices for quality, safety and [check] that they work’. They then hand out the CE mark allowing these devices to be marketed in Europe. Thereafter, ‘post-market surveillance’ — essentially, waiting to see if something goes wrong — is used to identify any problems. In other words, everyone from the manufacturers to the MHRA and the notified bodies seems to accept that device failures are inevitable — with patients serving as guinea pigs. The MHRA says it is working urgently with NHS England to eradicate the problem of under-reporting. In the meantime, following the MHRA experts’ revelations to Good Health, the watchdog now says that its investigations have whittled down the number of deaths associated with device failures in its most recent official report from 309 to just 86. It is an extraordinary U-turn on its own published official figures. There is no doubt that the system is fundamentally — and potentially dangerously — flawed. ‘Two things are certain,’ says Peter Walsh, chief executive of the patient charity Action against Medical Accidents. ‘Far too many people are needlessly dying or being harmed as a result of faulty devices or poor use of devices, and the reported incidents are still an understatement of how big the problem is.’ What we do know is clearly just the tip of the iceberg.","Over past decade there have been almost 100,000 reports of failed devices .

"Prince Andrew was tucked away with his closest friends and family in an opulent £22,000-a-week Swiss chalet when the sex scandal broke. The Queen's son heard news of the serious challenge to his reputation while staying in the exclusive ski resort of Verbier with his former wife Sarah Ferguson and their younger daughter Eugenie. Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas, a close friend of Eugenie, and Eugenie's boyfriend, nightclub boss, Jack Brooksbank were also staying with the family. Located in one of the most exclusive and remote parts of Verbier, the chalet boasts seven bedrooms, its own heated indoor swimming pool with an opulent entertaining area and a sauna. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew  was staying at a £22,000-a-week ski chalet when news of the sex scandal broke. He was seen leaving the mountain retreat with his daughter Eugenie yesterday afternoon ahead of his flight back to Britain . Princess Eugenie and boyfriend Jack Brooksbank were seen leaving the luxury holiday home yesterday. Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, has  been staying because she remains a  friend of Eugenie's . The Duke has used the chalet to host his own birthday parties in previous years and it is also the location where Prince Harry romanced Miss Bonas. The 54-year-old Duke of York is understood to have paid for the hire of the chalet out of his own private fortune. Looking pensive and deep in thought, he left the chalet yesterday afternoon and was driven to a nearby airport where he boarded a private plane back to Britain with Eugenie, 24, and her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. During Prince Andrew's most-recent stay, the royals were guarded by five protection officers – funded by taxpayers – who regularly drove them to the ski lifts and to restaurants. The grand, old-fashioned wooden chalet hired by the Queen’s son boasts an extensive terrace area with stunning views of the Swiss Alps. The master bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom and is draped in fur throws. It also boasts a sumptuous living room, littered with antiques and artworks, in which a roaring fire is lit each afternoon to welcome guests home from a hard afternoon on the slopes. Afternoon tea and cakes are provided by the property’s on-site chef. In February 2013 Prince Harry was spotted hugging Cressida on the nearby ski slopes and the pair are understood to have shared a room at the chalet. Harry splashed out £300 on a pair of designer snow boots for Cressida during that trip. Prince Andrew was staying in this luxury chalet in the  Swiss ski resort of Verbier  when the sex scandal broke . As well as a sauna and party room, the huge chalet boasts a swimming pool with windows onto the snow . Interior pictures of the wooden ski lodge show it is decorated in an Alpine style, with a large fireplace . The Canadian-made Manitobah Mukluks Aboriginal grey boots are made from suede and rabbit fur and lined with sheepskin shearling. And although the pair have since split, Cressida was invited back for the most-recent trip because she remains a close friend of Eugenie’s. The chalet where the group stayed also has its own ski changing room so visitors can ski from the slopes to the privacy of their own home, without mixing with hoi polloi. The piece de resistance, however, has to be its 650 foot square pool room with floor to ceiling windows offering unrivalled views out over the mountains. This stunning room has its own bar where the royals have held several lively house parties on previous visits. In the same year Sarah Ferguson lost more than two stone during a 12-week stay at the chalet. The Duchess of York showed off a svelte figure after embarking on a relentless regime with her personal trainer Josh Salzmann. The 55-year-old stuck to a strict diet of blended foods and intensive workouts, including daily running and mountain hikes. At the time the mother-of-two said: ‘I went up to the mountains, and I ran every day. That’s how I got fit.’ Prince Harry has often visited the chalet and was spotted there with ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas last year . The former couple were spotted hugging and laughing together as they mucked about on the ski slopes . The Duchess is understood to have stayed behind at the chalet after Andrew and Eugenie left yesterday. Like her former husband, she too has kept a low profile since the under-age sex scandal broke on Friday. Prince Andrew and Fergie married in 1986 but separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. But they have remained on good terms and have brought up their daughters together. Commenting on their relationship earlier this year, Andrew said: 'I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your circumstances are.' Princess Eugenie is believed to have met long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank while stating at the Swiss ski resort four years ago. The son of an accountant, Jack was educated at £10,000-a-term Stowe school in Buckinghamshire and at one point considered a career in the City. But, with the support of his parents, he chose to work in hospitality. He took a job at Chelsea’s Admiral Codrington, a pub and private dining room, before being poached by Piers Adam to work at The Markham Inn, also in Chelsea, where he spent three years . He recently took a job helping to manage the tropical island-themed Mahiki in Mayfair. Royal protection officers had been taking Princess Eugenie (left) and her family to the slopes. Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson (pictured, right, at the resort during a previous visit) was also at the chalet .

"As Mexican drug cartels pump cut-rate methamphetamine into the U.S. at increasingly alarming rates, the DEA has reported record seizures of the drug at the California-Mexico border. 14,732 pounds of the drug were seized by the San Diego field office in the last fiscal year, ending September 30, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports. That's a whopping 63 per cent of all reported seizures by both land, sea, and air ports across the nation. As Mexican drug cartels pump cut-rate methamphetamine into the U.S. at increasing rates, the DEA has reported record seizures of the drug at the California-Mexico border . 'The Mexican cartels are flooding the U.S. marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine,' Gary Hill, the special agent in charge of the DEA's San Diego operations, told U-T San Diego. 'We have seen the trend of the price of meth decreasingly tremendously since 2008,' he added. Once produced mostly stateside, regulations on many of the precursor chemicals used to make the addictive synthetic drug have pushed manufacturing to Mexico, where labs now account for an estimated 90 per cent of production. A pound of meth can be purchased by undercover agents for $3,500 as opposed to the $11,800 it would cost for an equal amount of cocaine. 'The overhead is tremendous for cocaine,' Hill said. But for meth, 'the overhead is minimal. They oversee the manufacturing. There is no middleman.' The Sinaloa cartel and the Knights Templar are the groups doing the most business, producing the drug and overseeing smuggling routes into California. A pound of meth can be purchased by undercover agents for $3,500 as opposed to the $11,800 it would cost for an equal amount of cocaine . 'That’s our supposition,' Hill told U-T San Diego said. 'They control the gateway at San Diego and they seem to be the ones who are most involved in manufacturing the methamphetamine, so it kind of goes hand-in-hand.' Once into the West Coast, the drug is spread using distribution hubs to the north. Agents find meth shipped from Los Angeles making its way to Atlanta, Chicago, New York, North Carolina, Seattle, San Francisco, Montana, and even Canadian cities. 'What we noticed first was an increase in smuggling among teens,' said Joe Garcia, the interim special agent in charge for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. 'Initially it was marijuana, then there was a shift to hard narcotics, where meth was the main hard narcotic being smuggled.' The smuggling is done in fairly small quantities, hidden in sealed food cans, spare tires, engine compartments, and even strapped to the bodies of pedestrians. Not all of the smuggles are Mexican. In one June case a 21-year-old U.S. citizen was discovered hiding three pounds of the drug under her clothing. A 62-year-old U.S. citizen was arrested in April concealing meth inside of cheese. Bob Hood, the CBP's assistant director for the San Ysidro Port of Entry says the trend has been pedestrians with drugs on their person. The Sinaloa cartel and the Knights Templar are the groups doing the most business, producing the drug and overseeing smuggling routes into California . As meth can be liquified and hidden into gas tanks, windshield wiper fluid, and juice bottles before being reconstituted in labs, DEA agents are having to search deeper into vehicles into difficult places to search. There has been a 300 per cent increase in seizures of the drug at California entry ports since 2009. In turn, prosecution has jumped, with more than 60 cases of meth seizure at ports of entry involving one kilo or more in 2014 prosecuted by the San Diego District Attorney's office compared to only eight cases in 2013. Meanwhile over 2014 marijuana, cocaine and heroin seizures dropped. 'We're seeing as much if not more meth than marijuana,' Hood said. There has been a 300 per cent increase in seizures of the drug at California entry ports since 2009 . And that increase has led to serious repercussions across California, says Meth Strike Force coordinator Angela Goldberg. 'We are seeing a lot of health consequences, such as big increases in meth deaths and emergency room visits, along with public safety consequences, such as more arrests and more people in jail who test positive for meth,' she said. 'It’s very hard to get past these drug cartels. They’re very good at what they do.' There were 267 meth-related deaths in 2013 according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office: 190 overdoses, 22 motor vehicle accidents, 21 homicides with victims who tested positive for the drug, and 23 suicides.","More than 14,000 pounds of the drug were seized by the San Diego field office last year .

"'Was the dream worth it?' Richard Branson has admitted that he seriously questioned whether to continue with his space travel project after the fatal Virgin Galactic crash in October . Richard Branson has admitted that the fatal Virgin Galactic crash forced him to re-evaluate whether he should continue with his dream of civilian space travel. The company's SpaceShipTwo rocket plane disintegrated over the Mojave desert in October, killing one pilot and injuring the other. In a New Year's Day blog posting, the Virgin Galactic founder revealed how he was riddled with doubts about the multi-million-pound venture as he flew to California hours after the crash. He wrote: 'I found myself questioning seriously for the first time, whether in fact it was right to be backing the development of something that could result in such tragic circumstances. 'In short — was Virgin Galactic and everything it has stood for and dreamt of achieving, really worth it? 'I got a very firm answer to that question immediately when I landed in Mojave. 'From the designers, the builders, the engineers, the pilots and the whole community who passionately believed — and still believe — that truly opening space and making it accessible and safe is of vital importance to all our futures.' Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says cockpit video showed that Mr Alsbury prematurely pulled a lever that unlocked the feathering system which is designed to slow the craft's descent before landing. But when the action was taken moments after the plane's rockets had fired, it generated huge aerodynamic forces that tore it apart. The NTSB has not yet reported their conclusions on the cause of the crash or its recommendations for Virgin Galactic's future operations. Branson continued on the blog: 'I heard the same, heartfelt message at the incredibly moving memorial service for Mike Alsbury a week later and I heard and saw it in the thousands of messages that poured into my office from all around the world – and in one case, even beyond the world, from the astronauts on the International Space Station. 'I also heard, and saw, and felt it, from our Future Astronauts in an outpouring of support and solidarity which was at once humbling and uplifting.'

The Virgin Galactic project, which has signed up 700 customers for sub-orbital trips at $250,000 a seat, is pressing ahead with the venture while the National Transportation Safety Board continues its investigation into the disaster. WhiteKnightTwo, the aircraft that took SpaceShipTwo up for launch, was taken out for a practice flight by pilots before the Christmas break, company's vice president for special projects, Will Pomerantz, told NBC News. A second SpaceShipTwo plane is also under construction. WhiteKnightTwo (above), which took SpaceShipTwo up for launch, was taken out for a practice flight by pilots before the Christmas break, the company's vice president for special projects, Will Pomerantz said . Branson concluded his posting with a message for the future.

"A collection of bawdy sketches have been found in attic storage and will be sold to the highest bidder this month. The preparatory pencil illustrations are by the late Donald McGill, the forefather of the cheeky postcard industry, and provided the basis for many of his designs. The 18 drawings feature all manner of characters from big breasted young women to fat old ladies and gawping middle-aged men. Collection of drawings by the late Donald McGill discovered in attic and due to go on sale this month . His signature humour was risque double entendres, typical of the art work, and McGill became known for his astute power of social observation and artistic skill. His  cartoons, most often sold in seaside towns,  pushed the boundaries of decency, shocked the establishment and he faced prosecution several times for breaking the Obscene Publication Act 1857. (Left) 'Too busy to write, I'm having a smashing time' and (right) 'Can you come, Mrs Briggs - Muvver's just had triplets?' The 18 preparatory pencil illustrations provided the basis for many of McGill's seaside postcard designs . McGill was one of the first artists to venture into the risque genre of saucy postcards in the early 20th century. A private collector owned the sketches for many years but has only recently dug them out of his loft and will put them up for sale at auction in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Examples include a drawing of a female gardener exposing her flush underwear as she bends over to tend to a flower in front of two men, with one of them praising her 'display of pinks'.

(Left) 'Pardon me Miss - could you possibly turn SIDEWAYS!' and (right) 'Keeping cool at both ends' Another shows a male lift operator instructing a young woman with a large chest to turn sideways so he can close the doors. And one particularly near-the-knuckle sketch shows a woman telling a misunderstanding butcher she would prefer a 'nice, fat cock.' At the height of his fame he only earned three guineas a design, but today his original artwork can fetch thousands of pounds. These drawings are expected to sell for £150 each.

"A late afternoon ocean swim for a mother and her children turned into a complete nightmare which almost cost her young son his life. Raelene Murphy and her two children Ruth, 9, and Sebastian, 6, were enjoying the 'warm bath water' at Wellington Point beach, Brisbane, at about 4pm on New Year's Eve. But it wasn't long before Raelene realised she had been stung by a creature and when Sebastian came towards her in the knee-deep water he began to scream in pain. Paramedics revived the young boy on the way to the hospital after he lost consciousness, the Brisbane Times reported. Raelene Murphy and her son, Sebastian, thought they were going to die after being stung by a rare jellyfish . Sebastian, 6, with his burn scars from the irukandji morbakka fenneri that he encountered in the water . 'I took off my reef shoes and pulled the tentacles off my feet,' Raelene told Daily Mail Australia. 'The tentacle that was wrapped around my shoe was about 50cm long in total.' She said her son must have walked straight into the creature as he was only about a metre away from her as he walked towards his mother after she was stung. 'Then I asked people nearby to take care of Sebastian and make sure he was OK because I was having problems breathing and I had pains in my chest,' she said. Raelene was convinced that she was having a heart attack as the unbearable pain spread to her lower back, legs and arms. 'I thought I was dying and my son said he thought he was dying too,' she said. 'The first ambulance took my son who was vomiting, frothing at the mouth and his lips had turned blue.' Sebastian needed three shots of adrenalin and one shot of morphine before being monitored in hospital for the night. While Raelene received two shots of morphine for the excruciating pain to begin to subside. 'Sebastian is a very healthy and fit kid but if it was someone half his size - it would have been a very different situation,' his mother said. 'Initially we were terribly worried as he is quite a talented pianist and cellist, however, he will make a full recovery.' Sebastian with a small part of a tentacle of the creature that almost killed him on New Years Eve . More evidence of the highly-potent jellyfish that caused him to vomit, froth at the mouth as his lips turned blue . Royal Life Saving Society national medical adviser Professor John Pearn and world marine stinger expert Lisa-ann Gershwin were sent a sample of the creature's tentacles and identified it as an irukandji morbakka fenneri, which is coincidentally the species Gershwin discovered in Moreton Bay and named in 2008. 'The specimen that stung Sebastian was unusual and the second most potent I've ever seen,' Dr Gershwin told the Brisbane Times. This incident follows, Dr Gershwin's warning back in August that the dangerous creatures were around Broadwater beach on the Gold Coast and that the numbers would increase as the earth warmed. Dr Gershwin said the Morbakka species was responsible for a diver being put on life supports off Cairns in 2000. 'In this case the woman saw the critter whack into her while she was diving, and then the specimen was captured by her dive buddy so the ID was pretty reliable,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin. A lifelong Wellington Point resident who has swum at the beach since she was child, Raelene wanted to share her story to warn others about the dangers of the beach as she had never heard of this specific creature ever sighted in the area. 'I don't want anyone else to go through it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would never have taken my son into the water and put him at risk if I had have known. 'I don't think we were unlucky we were stung, we are lucky to have survived and gained an appreciation of the sea and have been able to warn others.' Redland council erected warning signs at Wellington Point within hours of being notified about the incident and were unaware of the species ever being sighted along the council's beaches. The creature has been described by an expert as: 'unusual and the second most potent I've ever seen'","Raelene Murphy and her son Sebastian were both stung by a rare jellyfish .

"Edward Snowden's father has said that he thinks his son will return to the United States so long as the Attorney General agrees not to detain him before his inevitable trial. A clip of an interview with Lonnie Snowden aired on The Today Show Friday morning where the NSA leaker's father confirmed that he sent a list of demands to the Department of Justice that he feels will pave the way for his 30-year-old son to return from Russia. The elder Snowden came up with the list with the help of his lawyer but with no consultation from Edward since the two have not spoken since April, two months before Snowden released classified intelligence documents. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Paternal support: Lonnie Snowden spoke with NBC and confirmed that he sent a letter to the Attorney General's office with a list of conditions he feels will allow Edward to return on his own accord . 'At this point I don't believe he's committed treason,' Lonnie Snowden told NBC's Michael Isikoff. 'He has in fact broken U.S. law in the sense that he has released classified information and if folks want to classify him as a traitor- in fact he has betrayed his government but I don't believe he has betrayed the people of the United States.' In his letter, Mr Snowden reportedly wrote that Edward was likely to come back to the United States on his own so long as the Justice Department agree not to subject him to a gag order, allow him to pick where his trial will take place, and make sure that he is not detained before said trial. It seems unlikely that the federal government will meet the demands, as they have already filed a number of charges against Edward including several under the Espionage Act. On the run: Edward Snowden is currently believed to be in a transit terminal of a Russian airport as he waits for asylum papers from Ecuador . During a press conference on Thursday in Senegal, President Obama said that he won't engage in any 'wheeling, dealing and trading' to get Edward extradited from Russia to the United States. A spokesman for the U.S. Army has said that they have blocked access to The Guardian's website following their publication of leaked NSA documents. Gordon Van Vleet, a spokesman for the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, told The Monterey Herald on Thursday that they are filtering 'some access to press coverage and online content about the NSA leaks.' 'We make every effort to balance the need to preserve information access with operational security, however, there are strict policies and directives in place regarding protecting and handling classified information,' he wrote via email. For their part, editors and reporters for The Guardian are publicly revelling in the ban. Writer Glenn Greenwald, who published the initial Snowden article on June 5, called the move 'flattering'. 'I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29-year-old hacker,' the president said of the whistleblower. The younger Snowden, who turned 30 last week, fled to Hong Kong last month ahead of leaking details about an NSA surveillance program. He is now in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow. The hacker's father has also cast some doubt on the intentions of WikiLeaks, the group who has come to the aide of Edward while he is in hiding. 'I love him. I would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him. I don't want to put him in peril, but I am concerned about those who surround him,' Lonnie Snowden told NBC. 'I think WikiLeaks, if you've looked . at past history- their focus isn't necessarily the Constitution of the . United States. It's simply to release as much information as possible . and that alone is a concern for me.' Snowden's . future remains unclear, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has said . that they have no plans to extradite him since there is no existing . extradition treaty between the U.S. and Russia. The former consultant is said to be seeking asylum in Ecuador but the process will take months to complete. 'It . took us two months to make a decision in the case of Assange, so do not . expect us to make a decision sooner this time,' Ecuadorean Foreign . Minister Ricardo Patino told reporters. Defiant: Speaking on Thursday during his trip to Senegal, President Obama said the U.S will not be 'scrambling jets' to seize Edward Snowden, saying Russia should hand him over through proper legal channels .","Edward Snowden's father Lonnie has not spoken to his son since April .

"A spot of game hunting ended in disaster on Friday evening when a 72-year-old bowman was hurt by the prey he had shot. Authorities say the unidentified hunter wounded a deer in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, when the animal turned around and attacked him. After being struck in the leg by the doe's head, the man was rushed to hospital by ambulance.

"Nigel Farage has called for access to the NHS to be limited to British citizens, despite more than one in 10 health staff coming from overseas. The Ukip leader claimed 'the National Health Service is here for British citizens' as he boasted £3billion could be spent on healthcare if Britain left the European Union. He also argued the 5million foreign citizens living in the UK should be banned from taking part in any referendum on severing ties with Brussels. Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed 'the National Health Service is here for British citizens', raising the prospect of people like his German wife Kirsten being excluded . It raises the prospect of his German wife Kirsten being denied the vote and barred from using the NHS. Mr Farage, who has advocated an insurance-funded model for the NHS in the past, was again forced to insist Ukip is now committed to a health service that was free at the point of delivery. But he said the service was struggling because of the 'massive increase' in the country's population. He called for measures to crack down on health tourism and said people studying for medical subjects should be exempt from tuition fees to reduce the NHS's reliance on migrant workers. Mr Farage sparked a storm of controversy last October when he suggested migrants with HIV should not be allowed to enter Britain. He said he wanted to control the ‘quality’ of immigration into Britain and suggested this should include the medical condition of incomers. But he went much further, and suggested only British citizens should be allowed to use the NHS, despite foreign nationals paying tax in the UK and thousands working in the health service themselves. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), show that 12 per cent of people working in the NHS and community health services are not British. Among qualified clinical staff the figure is 14 per cent, and for doctors it is 26 per cent. The British Medical Association has warned that ) to observe that without non-British staff, 'many NHS services would struggle to provide effective care to their patients'. But Mr Farage suggested they should be banned from using the health service themselves. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I very much take the view that it is a National Health Service, and to open ourselves up - whether it's to HIV treatment, whether it's to maternity services or whatever it is - to the rest of the world, doesn't make sense. 'It is costing us at least £2 billion a year, the National Health Service is here for British citizens. He added: 'We want the NHS to be better run, we want it to be more efficient. We think it's ludicrous that middle management has grown by 48 per cent, we think the fact that health tourism is costing £2billion a year is wrong and the fact that one in five new nurses being taken on have to come from abroad says to us 'let's make sure there are no tuition fees for people who are taking medical degrees'. 'We want a National Health Service that is free at the point of delivery and funded through taxation. 'But the one thing nobody dares say is the reason we have an NHS crisis right now is because of a massive increase in the population in this country.' Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), show that 12 per cent of people working in the NHS and community health services are not British . He announced Ukip would promise an extra £3 billion a year for the NHS 'funded out of the fact that we will not be paying daily membership fees as members of the European Union'. However, the Tory promise of an in-out referendum before the end of 2017 means it could be several years before Britain could leave the EU. Ukip has also been damaged by comments made by party secretary Matthew Richardson that the NHS is a 'waste of money'. Footage emerged from 2010 of Mr Richardson attacking the health service at events in the US. Speaking at the Young Americans Foundation conference in Washington he said: 'When I was younger a trillion was an astronomic number. Now when I look at our national deficits, and your national deficits, actually it is an economic number. 'A number I couldn't possible imagine when I was younger is now the amount of money that is owed by my country, and soon more than that by your country, to other countries, paying for wasteful socialist programmes. And of course at the heart of this, the Reichstag bunker of socialism is the National Health Service.' Mr Farage, pictured, has faced a string of dire headlines, including the defection of an MEP to the Tories and the party secretary branding the NHS a 'waste of money' David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain’s membership, clawing powers back from Brussels and clamping down on welfare abuse, before staging an in-out vote by 2017. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he would be willing to back a Tory government after the election, but wanted the referendum, held soon with only Briton’s allowed to take part. He said: ‘I would say I want a referendum, I want it now. I want a referendum with good rules – namely the spending limits for both sides are the same. 'And I want a guarantee that in this referendum the only people that can vote are British citizens because at the moment you know there are 4 million or so EU citizens living in Britain who I do not think should be allowed to vote in that referendum.’ At the Conservative Political Action Conference in the same year he said: 'This socialist government wastes money like you can't imagine. They have started doing every wasteful scheme under the sun ... The biggest waste of money of course in the United Kingdom is the NHS, the National Health Service.' Mr Farage said Mr Richardson 'made those comments as a Conservative and he was very critical of hundreds of millions of pounds being wasted through middle management'. He went on to complain about Ukip policies come under attack from rivals. 'Once again we have a General Election campaign being fought on American terms where it's all negativity. 'It's artillery shells being lobbed between Labour and Conservatives and now of course towards Ukip.' Labour frontbencher Jon Trickett said: 'Either Nigel Farage supports this or Mr Richardson cannot stay in post. Nigel Farage cannot simultaneously defend these comments and claim that his party stands for the NHS free at the point of use. 'The man chosen by Nigel Farage to control UKIP's image has compared the NHS to Hitler's Nazi bunker. This is UKIP's real agenda on the NHS. 'Today Labour is shining a light on Nigel Farage and his party's true views on the future of the NHS. They claim to defend the service we cherish, but they want to dismantle its foundations. 'UKIP can no longer attempt to fool people. They are a party of Tory people, Tory money and they want to extend the worst Tory policies, which would have horrific effects on working people.'","Nigel Farage declares: 'National Health Service is here for British citizens'

"It was plauded by movie critics and hailed by activists for its championing of gay rights. But marketing gurus have been forced to 'straight-wash' 2013 British film Pride - so that it appeals to a wide US audience. The DVD cover of the movie, based on the campaign of a gay and lesbian activist group, has been altered - with any reference to the film's focal theme of homosexuality removed. Scroll down for video . Original version: In UK promotional material a banner reading 'lesbians and gays support the miners' is seen behind the marching crowd . In UK promotional material, a banner visible behind the marching crowd of campaigners appears to read: 'Lesbians and gays support the miners.' On the US version this banner has been digitally removed, and the synopsis has eradicated any hint of homosexuality - vaguely referring to the film's protagonists as 'London-based activists'. In Britain, this had been written as 'a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists'. The designers of the US DVD cover have been accused of putting the film back in the closet, with some critics dubbing the move a 'straight-washing'. 'Straight-washed': The DVD cover of the US release of Pride has digitally removed the banner reading 'gays and lesbians' while also deleting references to homosexuality in the synopsis . The film, aired in cinemas in September, is based on the true events of the LGBT activists who marched in solidarity with coal miners during their strike in 1984. The movie, which stars Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy, was released on DVD in the US shortly before Christmas by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, after the rights to the film were bought by CBS Films. Ben Roberts, of the British Film Institute, told The Independent: 'I'm not surprised that the US distributors have taken a decision to sell more copies by watering down the gay content. 'I'm not defending it - it's wrong and outmoded - but I'm not surprised. 'It's an unfortunate commercial reality both here and in the US that distributors have to deal with. LGBT material is largely marginalised outside of rare hits like Brokeback Mountain.' Critically acclaimed: The movie, released in cinemas last year, starred Brits (L-R) Andrew Scott, Faye Marsay and Bill Nighly, pictured at the UK premiere in September . Gay author Matt Cain also criticised the move, saying it went against the spirit of the film. But Mr Cain, who is the former culture editor of Channel 4 News, said it will be a positive thing if it means more people buy the DVD and watch it. Pride was not a huge hit at the box office, but was plauded by critics and has already won a series of awards. In the US, it is nominated for a Golden Globe in the category of best comedy or musical film - with the ceremony taking place on Sunday. Slammed: Many people have taken to Twitter to criticise the decision to remove references to homosexuality on the DVD cover of Pride released to the US market . It was also named best film at the British Independent Film Awards in December. Accepting the top award of the night, Pride director Matthew Warchus told the BBC: 'We're getting reports from up and down the country of audiences standing up and applauding. That doesn't really happen in British cinemas. It's just extraordinary. It's a real tribute to the source material.'","Pride was hailed for championing gay rights after its September premiere .

Aerial footage shows the teenager fleeing from police on the back of the high-powered vehicle during the 30-minute chase. West Midlands Police had tried to stop the youth after a family dialled 999 after nearly being run over by the bike in Druids Heath, Birmingham. The footage, caught on a police helicopter, shows a 13-year-old boy on a motorbike leading officers on a high-speed pursuit on a motorbike in Birmingham . After dropping off two passengers, the teenager on the white Yamaha bike spots the police helicopter . He can then be seen dropping off two of his passengers who were also on the back of the white Yamaha bike after glancing up and spotting the police helicopter. The teenager then speeds off down the estate swerving onto pavements and driveways while narrowly avoiding collisions with oncoming cars. Moments later he falls from the bike after skidding on a patch of grass and is quickly chased on foot by a police officer.

"A couple who made a staggering £350,000 selling stolen make-up and perfume on eBay have been jailed. Dariusz Suski and Joanna Lazarska from Southsea, Hampshire, listed designer perfume and skincare on the online auctioneers, taking bids from all over the world on the stolen luxury goods. The couple, aged 32 and 33 respectively, have been jailed for four years after a trial heard how they operated the illegal business round the clock. Dariusz Suski and Joanna Lazarska have been jailed after making £350,000 by selling stolen goods online . Police found 11,000 individual products at their home in Southsea, Hampshire, including expensive Clinique and Crem de la Mer face creams . Portsmouth Crown Court heard how the couple sourced stolen goods including Tom Ford perfume, Clinique moisturiser and Creme de la Mer face creams, from people they met on eBay. They then listed the products on their own auction pages and invited bidders to buy them at discounted prices. When searching the couple's home, police found 11,000 individual products shelved in packaging. The pair denied conspiring to handle stolen goods, but were found guilty of a jury. Sentencing Judge Sarah Munro QC said they had become 'obsessed' with the illegal trade. 'You were both obsessed with this business and operated, at times, 24 hours a day. 'The sum of money flowing through your eBay, Paypal and bank accounts was huge. 'Your offending was both sophisticated and carefully planned and executed. 'If anything Miss Lazarska, you were the more accomplished businesswoman. 'Some of your suppliers had access in such large quantities that they must have been stolen. 'You were clearly both extremely knowledgeable of the nature of the products.

'Your knowledge was extraordinary and in some ways more than the security manager of Estee Lauder.'

The 36-year-old stole 40 to 50 items from factories every day, pocketing £62,000 from the scheme. He is due to be sentenced next month. Others including Richard Powell, 45, and Ramszesz Harangoza, 35, were jailed for their roles in the operation. Detective Sergeant Anton Gaita of Hampshire Police said: 'The couple stored and sold on hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stolen beauty products. 'The pair were motivated by financial gain and made about £350,000 in online sales marketing the products as discounted factory goods only slightly below the normal retail price. 'All the beauty products had been taken out of the supply chain, so there’s no way of knowing whether they’d been stored in the correct conditions or whether they’d been exposed to contamination.'","Dariusz Suski and Joanna Lazarska sold hundreds of stolen items online .

"West Ham midfielder Stewart Downing is still hopeful of an England recall, but the winger believes he will have to wait until current manager Roy Hodgson has departed for that to happen. Downing won the last of his 34 caps in a 1-0 win against Norway in May 2012, Hodgson's first game as England coach, and was also a non-playing part of Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad. But Downing told the London Evening Standard he does not expect the former Fulham manager to pick him again. Stewart Downing looks on for England against Norway in 2012, the last time he played for his country . Downing (right) has started this season brightly and scored in West Ham's 3-1 win against Crystal Palace . Roy Hodgson celebrates England's win over Switzerland earlier this month and has ignored Downing . He said: 'I'd never say my England career was over but, if I am realistic, I don't think I will get a chance while Roy Hodgson is in charge. 'The only thing I can do is keep playing well and if injuries happen, you never know, he might change his mind. 'If he doesn't pick me that's fair enough, it's his opinion. He did pick me for the Euros but didn't play me and after that I didn't get selected again. He hadn't really seen me but maybe I didn't fit into his systems or he wanted to go for younger players - I honestly don't know. 'I'm still only 30 and maybe if I don't get an opportunity under this England coach, it could still happen further down the line. It's not only me. I thought Mark Noble would have been in the last England squad. With respect to Fabian Delph, Mark has played consistently well in the Premier League for a number of years. 'James Tomkins is another one who would maybe be disappointed not to have been called up but, like Mark, he's young enough to get his chance one day, if he keeps playing well.' Hodgson  picked youngsters like Aston Villa's Fabian Delph for the qualifier against Switzerland . Downing has begun this season brightly, scoring in a 3-1 win over Crystal Palace before the Hammers were beaten 3-1 at home  by Southampton. Sam Allardyce's team take on Hull City at the KC Stadium on Monday, and Ecuador striker Enner Valencia, a £12million summer signing, is expected to make his first Premier League start, while Alex Song is set to make his debut following his  loan move from Barcelona. Downing was pleased with West Ham's summer signings, but knows his side are in for a tough match against Hull. West Ham face Hull on Monday, with Tigers manager Steve Bruce  keen on replacing Alan Pardew as Newcastle boss . He added: 'The transfer window was good for us. We have good competition in all places now whereas for large parts of last season the team was basically picking itself. 'The pleasing thing now, although it might be a headache for the manager, is picking the team. He has options in all positions now but I'm sure he would rather have it this way than having to play people out of position, as he was forced to do last season. 'The players, particularly the strikers who have come in, are different to what we've had in the past though and I believe that the team, as a result, has to change the way we play. 'Hull will be a tough game though. They've bought well and Steve Bruce is a good manager.'","Stewart Downing believes England boss Roy Hodgson will not pick him again .

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes has expressed sympathy for under-pressure Newcastle boss Alan Pardew, but is ready to turn the screw again. Pardew has faced vehement protests from Magpies fans calling for him to be sacked following the club's wretched start to the season as they are currently bottom of the Barclays Premier League with no wins and just three points from five games. At one point during Saturday's home clash with Hull, the exit door was staring Pardew in the face as his side trailed 2-0 with 17 minutes remaining. Mark Hughes has sympathises with Newcastle boss Alan Pardew, but is ready to turn the screw . Alan Pardew has come under increasing pressure as manager at St James' Park this season . Newcastle hit back, though, to force a draw before following up with an extra-time victory in the Capital One Cup at Crystal Palace on Wednesday to ease some of the strain on Pardew. Despite understanding his opposite number's plight, Hughes is ready to add to Pardew's pain going into the league clash between the teams at the Britannia Stadium on Monday. 'It's a difficult business we're in and you don't like to see a fellow manager under pressure like that,' said Hughes. 'But Alan's a very experienced Premier League manager. He's been there a long time in charge of a big club with big demands and big expectations. 'I seem to recall he's been through similar periods before and he's come out the other side, so it shows he has the capacity and ability to turn the situation around. 'They've started doing that by coming back from a difficult situation in the league, and then they had a great result in midweek, so their confidence is probably higher than it was two games ago. Some supporters have protested against Pardew and the ownership of Mike Ashley recently . 'From our point of view it's a bit of a shame they will have had that turn in confidence with those two performances. 'We will have to be mindful of that, but we just want to take care of our own business. 'If that adds to the pressure Alan seems to be under he understands that's what we have to do.' Hughes senses whilst the fans may be against Pardew, his players at least are with him. 'It seems he's shaping the team and there have been a lot of changes which he's had to deal with,' added Hughes. 'But his team has shown a lot of character in these last couple of games, they seem to be playing for him, and as a manager you want to see your players still doing that. 'There's no reason why they shouldn't be doing that because he's a good, experienced manager at this level.'","Stoke host Newcastle at the Britannia Stadium on Monday .

Wright wouldn't go away though with both players exchanging points to finish with honours even. There was no absence of drama though, with Taylor seeming unimpressed when Wright played up to the crowd before his failure to knock off 62 with his three darts to finish off the match.

Two days later they were due to head off on their honeymoon. Reaction: Mr Whitbread said he was sad about his break-up but wasn't willing to 'mope' and wanted to enjoy his holiday . Prize: The winning bidder, as long as it is a woman, will get to spend two weeks with John here at the Blue Bay Villas Hotel in the Dominican Republic . But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him. With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him and the top bid now stands at £51. John describes himself as a slim, 5'9, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh. His advert reads: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'. Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry in just five weeks' time on Valentine's Day, John says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee. Plea: The jilted boyfriend said there is  nothing 'sinister' about his plan and is looking for a 'new friend' to join him on his rip of a lifetime . He said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty. 'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by. 'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, 'No, I wanted to go on this holiday'. 'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page. 'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet. 'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before. 'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday. If the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too. 'I really thought that I would only get about £100 on ebay - enough to pay the £50 name change fee and a bit of spending money. 'I can't believe how well it was going. So if you're up for a laugh and fancy a fantastic holiday - let me know!' After being overwhelmed with the response, John has pledged to donate any money over £1,050 to testicular cancer research. He added: 'People have said I've got real balls to do this so I thought I might as well try and make some money for charity if I can to.' His ex-girlfriend Amy said today she 'didn't feel ready to get married. She said: 'I just didn’t feel ready to get married and John wasn’t my soulmate. Obviously it’s difficult for John, I’m finding it hard too. 'It’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later. 'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it. 'Fair play to John. I’m pleased that he’s doing something positive.' The flight leaves Manchester for Peurto Plata on Monday, February 16 at 9.45 and arrives back at 05.35 on March 3, 2015. Accommodation is four 14 nights at the four star Blue Bay Villas in Playa Dorado and interested bidders can find the ebay auction HERE .","John Whitbread, 32, wants a new woman to join him on February holiday .

"The number of Islamist extremists fighting for ISIS could double after al-Qaeda's 15,000 strong offshoot in Syria is said to have pledged allegiance to the militant group. The merger is believed to have taken place in Albu Kamel - on the border of Syria and Iraq, where all of the crossings are currently in the hands of Sunni militia, many of them members of ISIS. In April the al-Nusra Front pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who has previously condemned ISIS' brutal attempts to establish an Islamic state in the Middle East as too extreme, so the development points to a new split within al-Qaeda's ranks. Scroll down for video . Merger: Images shared online appeared to show al-Nusra's alleged leader in the Albu Kamel region, Abu Yusuf al-Masri, shaking hands with ISIS fighters after apparently taking an oath of allegiance to the group . Sealed with an embrace: The 15,000 fighters al-Nusra is believed to have under its control could now switch to ISIS. This would double the number of militants ISIS previously claimed to have under its command . Blast: A suicide bombing today at a checkpoint manned by Kurdish security forces in Kirkuk killed two members of the Kurdish security forces as well as killing and wounding dozens of others . News of the merger between ISIS and the al-Nusra front were made by both the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and an Islamist website this afternoon. Images widely shared by ISIS supporters online appeared to show al-Nusra's alleged leader in the Albu Kamel region, Abu Yusuf al-Masri, embracing ISIS fighters after apparently taking an oath of allegiance. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the overall leader of al-Qaeda, has previously disowned ISIS and proclaimed the al-Nusra Front as its official Syrian affiliate. ISIS which seized Iraq's main northern city . Mosul on June 10, has since marched virtually unopposed towards Baghdad . and is in control of major border posts on the frontier with Syria. Only today violence continued, as a suicide bombing at a checkpoint in Kirkuk killed two members of the . Kurdish security forces as well as killing and wounded dozens of . others. The group also controls large parts of eastern Syria, where it has both clashed with rival rebels groups - including al-Nusra - and has occasionally fought alongside them. Manpower: The al-Nusra Front (pictured) is considered al-Qaeda's representative force in Syria. It is believed to have between 15,000 and 20,000 active fighters . Condemned: Ayman al-Zawahiri (right), who took overall control of al-Qaeda following the death of Osama bin Laden (left), has previously disowned ISIS after branding their brutal campaign in the Middle East too extreme . U.S. intelligence warned of the growing threat posed by Sunni insurgents in Iraq at the start of the year but the advice was ignored, a senior official has claimed. The allegations, made by an unidentified official and reported by Fox News, contradict claims made by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday that ISIS' growth could not have be foreseen. In a briefing, the official claimed the U.S. had given 'strategic warnings' to Iraq about the threat posed by Islamist groups. 'We routinely highlighted [ISIS'] growing threat in Iraq, the increasing difficulties Iraq’s security forced faced in combating [ISIS], and the political strains that were contributing to Iraq’s declining stability,' he said. Yesterday John Kerry, who has been in the Middle East this week, gave an alternative account of the threat, claiming 'people were surprised everywhere' by ISIS' progress in the country. The . U.S. and Iraq did not sign a formal agreement allowing troops to stay . in the country past 2011, so 'we didn't have eyes in there,' he said. 'But the Iraqis didn't even have a sense of what was happening [either]' Kerry added. The cycle of creation and breakdown of these loose alliances has complicated the three-year-old insurgency against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as rebel infighting led to thousands of deaths and allowed the government to reclaim territory. The fact al-Nusra has now pledged allegiance to ISIS almost certainly suggests the latter has emerged as the dominant rebel group. An internal report of ISIS' activities last year put its total number of fighters in Iraq and Syria at 15,000. With al-Nusra boasting a similar sized or possibly even larger force, today's merger could double the total number of militant Sunni Islamists fighting under the ISIS banner in the Middle East. Speaking of the merger, Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory of British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: 'It is very important because Nusra is strong in Albu Kamal'. This afternoon Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki rejected calls for a 'salvation government' to save Iraq from the growing threat of ISIS. Speaking in his weekly television address, Maliki said growing calls for him to step aside to allow others to counter the Sunni insurgency represented a 'coup against the constitution and an attempt to end the democratic experience'. Maliki's defence of his abilities come in response to appeals - led by the U.S. - for Iraq's government to to rise above ethnic divisions and form a united front against rebel forces. Defence forces: Iraqi Shi'ite men parade their weapons in Karbala, central Iraq this morning. They have volunteered to protect the holy city from ISIS forces . Anti-ISIS: Hundreds gathered in Iran's capital Tehran this morning to protest against the Sunni insurgency in neighbouring Iraq . The . developments come as ISIS continue to try to take control of Balad . Airbase, Iraq’s largest airfield - which still contains dozens of . military aircraft left over from the U.S. occupation. There are also said to be Russian-built surveillance planes and helicopters on the site. Although . the majority of the aircraft are not in working order, many of them . could easily be fixed - and with an estimated £1.2billion in ISIS' hands, the group are more than capable of covering the cost. As . the country has no real air force, Iraqi officers say without foreign . air support they are on an equal footing with ISIS fighters. If ISIS . were able to assemble some semblance of an air force of their own, this . would give them a distinctive advantage in the battle for control of . Iraq. By Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . Islamist jihadists will sweep through Afghanistan as ruthlessly as in Iraq and Syria if the West fails to ‘wake-up’ to the danger, a former head of the military has warned. Brutal extremists could capture huge swathes of the war-torn country when UK and US troops leave in December after 13 years of war, said Lord Richards of Herstmonceux. He said it would be a ‘tragic waste’ if insurgents seized control of the battle-scarred nation. In total, the conflict has cost 453 British lives and around £20billlion of taxpayers’ money. Prepared: A member of an Iraqi volunteer force holds a weapon during training in the Shiite holy city of Karbala . Warnings: A Kurdish peshmerga fighter takes his position behind a wall on the front line with militants from the al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Tuz Khormato, a town in an oil-rich part of Iraq . General Lord Richards, who retired as Chief of the Defence Staff last year, spoke out as fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) terror group, whose barbaric tactics and cold-blooded executions have provoked international outrage, edged closer to Baghdad. Nato has a current strength in Afghanistan of more than 52,000 soldiers, including some 5,300 British personnel. It plans to keep a slimmed down force - including 500 UK personnel - there after 2014 to train and advise local forces. But there are fears the reduction in troops will spark a security crisis, raising the prospect of the Taliban re-seizing power. General Lord Richards warned events in Iraq could be repeated in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of international forces unless the government in Kabul was given the support it needed. He told Sky News: ‘We should say “What do you need?” and, collectively with other nations, provide what that is for fear that if we don't we will see what is happening in Iraq happening there in nine months’ time and that will be a tragic waste because it's not necessary. ‘What I am very clearly saying is, please finish off Afghanistan properly and meet our commitments made in good faith. That may need a bit more than governments are currently contemplating but Iraq is a wake-up call. Battle: Kurdish peshmerga fighters behind a wall on the front line against ISIS in northern Iraq . ‘I fear what we are seeing in Syria and Iraq could happen in Afghanistan next year and the thing we should be focusing on now is containing this crisis.’ He said Afghan forces did not need help from combat forces, but the ‘more sophisticated parts’ of an armed forces – logistics, aircraft and command and control. General Lord Richards has said militant jihadism is the ‘biggest threat confronting the free world’.He said it was vital to give political, economic, financial and security support to countries, such as Nigeria, that were under threat from Islamist radicals. His remarks were at odds with those made by Defence Minister Mark Francois at a conference staged by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank on Wednesday. Giving a keynote speech, Mr Francois said coalition forces had done a ‘hugely impressive job’ in Afghanistan. He said it was now a country with a ‘capable Afghan security force – able to provide security for their own people… a country that is neither a safe haven nor a launch-pad for those terrorists who seek to attack our way of life.’ General Lord Richards said the crisis in Iraq had been fuelled by the West’s botched attempts to back the moderate opposition forces in Syria without providing decisive assistance to toppled President Bashar al-Assad. Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a humiliating Commons defeat over authorising military action against the tyrant. The Peer said: ‘If you're going to act to help a cause in another country, you have to do it properly. What we did in Syria collectively was enough to keep the war alive but not enough to solve it. Now it has spread into Iraq.’ He also said the invasion of Iraq by British and American forces was a ‘strategic error’ directly responsible for the crisis now threatening to tear the country apart. He said: ‘There's no doubt Saddam Hussein was a very brutal dictator but what it did was liberate a whole load of other forces and we're seeing that play through today.’","Al-Nusra Front is said to have pledged allegiance to ISIS on Iraq border .

"The whole of Britain would be better run if Scottish Nationalists sat in the Cabinet with Labour, Nicola Sturgeon claimed today. The SNP leader said the majority of Scots want Labour to have to share power after May's general election, which she said would lead to 'more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK'. She boasted that she wanted to make sure 'Scotland's voice is heard loudly at Westminster.' A string of opinion polls suggest the SNP will make big gains on May 7, robbing Ed Miliband of an overall majority and forcing him into a Westminster coalition with Miss Sturgeon's party. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the majority of Scots want Labour to have to share power after May's general election, which she said would lead to 'more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK' A huge row erupted last week when the SNP announced its MPs planned to vote on laws which only affect England, including the running of the NHS. Miss Sturgeon claimed her MPs in Westminster would take part in any votes which had an impact on Scotland, claiming the repeal of NHS reforms imposed by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition would have UK-wide repercussions. Tory defence minister Anna Soubry branded the remarks 'complete twaddle' and warned Ms Sturgeon was putting the Union at risk again. But Miss Sturgeon today vowed that the SNP will vote on English tax issues and claimed a Labour government dependent on SNP support would be fairer for the whole of the UK. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'If you look at polls in Scotland, as well as showing a substantial SNP lead they show that the most popular outcome in Scotland in the general election is a Labour government dependent on SNP support,' she said. 'Because I think people recognise that would lead to better decisions that were not just, perhaps, in the interests of Scotland but more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK.' Miss Sturgeon, who took over as Scottish First Minister after Alex Salmond stood down, said she will also seek alliances with parties such as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party to be a 'progressive force in the House of Commons'. 'I think the Westminster establishment really needs some progressive forces at its heart,' she added. 'I want Scotland to become independent, you have probably noticed that over the past wee while, but that will only happen when a majority of Scotland want that to happen. 'In the interim, what is really important is Scotland's voice is heard loudly at Westminster.' A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer to see a deal between Labour and the SNP . The latest IpsosMORI opinion poll suggests the SNP could will an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out . An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News last week found 52 per cent of Scots are planning to vote SNP in May. That would give the Nationalists an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out. It would shatter Labour's hopes of an overall majority, and would leave Ed Miliband reliant on SNP votes to pass laws - including those which only affect England. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy has not ruled out working with the SNP after the general election. But the East Renfrewshire MP said 'it would be wrong' to back the abolition of the Trident nuclear deterrent in exchange for SNP votes. His deputy Kezia Dugdale MSP she said she would 'no qualms whatsoever' about going into partnership with the SNP after the May election. Speaking on the BBC's Politics Scotland, Mr Murphy said: 'I think it's important that parties work together, it happens all across Scotland in local authorities, but what Kez is talking about is the same thing that I've been talking about which is that we're not expecting, we're not planning, we don't want, and we don't need a coalition with the SNP. 'The fact is that come the UK election here in Scotland in May it's really a choice of whether David Cameron hangs on to power or whether we can get David Cameron out of Downing Street, and by voting SNP, unfortunately, a lot of Scots if they do so, run the risk that by accident they ensure that David Cameron holds onto power.'","SNP leader boasts how most Scots want SNP to share power with Labour .

"We all know how well a beer goes down with a bhuna - but according to Marks and Spencer we should be asking for a wine list when we sit down to a curry. The supermarket has created the three wines to provide customers with authentic pairings for their favourite Indian curries. Produced in India's prestigious Sula . Vineyards, the blends for the red, white and rosé were created in a new . partnership between M&S winemaker Jeneve Williams and Indian . winemaker Ajoy Shaw. Marks and Spencer have created three unique wines especially designed to compliment the spices of the nation's favourite curries . Jeneve Williams said that she was looking for a wine that wouldn't be overpowered by deep Indian flavours. 'My goal . was to bring wines to the UK that can pair authentically with Indian . food. It's tricky to craft a wine that can stand up to such a wealth of . spices and flavours, so Ajoy and I aimed to blend fruit forward, fresh . wines with great varietal expression. 'For . example, the Jewel of Nasik Sauvignon Blanc was created with coconut . milk-based curries in mind, so crispness and citrus fruit flavours were . crucial.'

The Jewel of Nasik Tempranillo Shiraz 2013 has been created to be bold enough to stand up to the spice of a hot rogan josh, and the Jewel of Nasik Zinfandel Rosé 2013 has the fruitiness and aromatic intensity to accompany tandoori chicken . The Nasik region home to the Sula Vineyards, in Maharashtra, west India, is an area known for its torrential storms, with the first two months of the monsoon season seeing an astonishing 513mm of rainfall. The adverse weather conditions have forced winemakers in the area to adopt unusual winemaking practices in their struggle to deal with the five months of intensely heavy rain that could obliterate their crops. The wines are completely authentic having come from the Sula vineyard in western India . Jeneve says that the Indian winemakers take many extra precautions to ensure that their produce is the best quality wine despite the wet weather. 'Winemaking in the face of monsoon season is a unique challenge, but the winemakers here understand the weather and put the vines into dormancy to delay harvest until the dry season in January. 'It's a remarkable feat, and just one example of the effort that goes into producing wines in extreme climates like that of Nasik's.'
