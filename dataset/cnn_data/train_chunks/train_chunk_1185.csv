"Ben Phillips, NATSEM’s principal research fellow, said youth unemployment was up because of the weak labour market in Australia at the moment . Shocking new research has revealed that young Australians are four and a half times more likely to be unemployed. Experts have blamed the disappointing outlook on a 'weak labour market' and young people not having enough experience when they are looking to get on the career ladder. The financial services company AMP and National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling Work It Out report has been released today. Youth unemployment is at 27 per cent compared to overall unemployment in Australia at six per cent. Ben Phillips, NATSEM’s principal research fellow, told Daily Mail Australia: 'It's fairly startling. 'Youth unemployment goes up and down in relation to how the economy is doing. 'The economy in Australia has not been as strong as years past so it is not surprising that those struggling to get jobs are those young people who are less educated and with less experience. 'They are competing against more experienced workers in the job market and they are going to lose that battle. 'Youth that are unemployed are always the ones that struggle, the numbers are pretty nasty at the moment. It is concerning to have young people who have fallen through the cracks. 'The government needs to focus their policy on the young and make sure they are getting the right training. Times are tough: The report says Australians under the age of 20 are finding it tough to get jobs . 'The concern is that if they stay unemployed for a long time it can lead to more serious troubles. 'There are many young people who have just graduated and not all of them manage to get a job in their desired field. 'Australia has got a reasonably weak labour market and graduates are competing against people from other universities, it is a difficult time for graduates. 'There is not a huge amount that the government can do in a weak economy because there are lots of people looking for jobs. 'The best thing governments can do is to ensure young people have the best education they can get and they get the experience they need, we need to get the youth in those training years.' The numbers of 15 to 19-year-olds looking for full time work has soared in recent years . The report uncovered that double the number Australians in their twenties who hold a degree, are still working as sales assistants or in hospitalities, than any other age bracket, reports news.com.au. Paul Sainsbury, AMP’s Chief Customer Officer said 'it's a tough environment for many young people looking to get their foot on the career ladder' Statistics in the report show that unemployment for 15 to 19-year-olds who are hunting for full time jobs has soured to a high of 27.1 per cent in September this year, this is up from 16.6 per cent in 2008. Paul Sainsbury, AMP’s Chief Customer Officer, told Daily Mail Australia 'it's a tough environment for many young people looking to get their foot on the career ladder'. He added: 'As the report shows it’s can be a catch-22 because employers are looking for people with experience, yet young people can’t get that experience without a job. 'It’s quite staggering when you look at how many young people are out of a job compared to the rest of the workforce.'","The report says Australians under the age of 20 are finding it tough to get jobs .

"Inquiry: Care minister Normal Lamb said the number of cases was 'unacceptable' Ministers yesterday ordered an . independent inquiry into why hospitals have been paid to hit targets for . numbers of patients dying on the Liverpool Care Pathway. The new investigation will examine how . hospitals have received tens of millions of pounds to implement the . controversial system for care of the dying. Care and support minister Norman Lamb . said there had been too many cases of patients dying on the pathway . while their families were told nothing about the withdrawal of . life-saving treatment. ‘This is simply unacceptable,’ he added. Mr Lamb said the inquiry would . ‘consider the value of locally set incentives, and whether they are . leading to bad decisions or practice’. The decision to order an independent . investigation follows deepening concern over the LCP, which is thought . to be used in the deaths of 130,000 hospital patients each year. The method, first developed in a . Liverpool hospital and widely in use across the NHS for the past four . years, aims to ease the suffering of dying patients. It commonly . involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs, and the removal . of tubes providing nutrition and fluids. But in the past few weeks, a string of . relatives have contacted the Mail expressing concern about the LCP, . saying patients have been put on it without their knowledge. Many have . recovered fully after being taken off the pathway. Medical critics have said there is no . scientific method of predicting when death will come, arguing that the . pathway amounts to a self-fulfilling prophecy, that many patients die . before they should, and that the system is used to free beds and get rid . of difficult patients. Ministers have made a series of . concessions to critics over the past month, including the establishment . of an inquiry led by the same palliative care doctors who have been . instrumental in promoting the use of the Liverpool Care Pathway. They . have also changed NHS rules to put a legal obligation on hospitals to . tell families when a relative is put on the pathway. One of too many: Cancer patient Thomas James, 90, pictured with his daughter Debbie Croston, was put the Liverpool Care Pathway at his home without any consultation with his family . Yesterday’s decision to launch a full . independent inquiry followed a summit between ministers, doctors in . favour of the LCP, and their  critics, at the Department of Health in . Whitehall. The internal medical inquiry into the . LCP will now be taken over by the independent chairman, who is yet to be . picked. Critics of the LCP said the review should be overseen by a High . Court judge. The decision to call an independent . investigation is understood to have been heavily influenced by the Tory . MP for Congleton, Fiona Bruce, who was at the meeting. Mrs Bruce, a . mother of two who is an evangelical Christian, said she had refused to allow her father to be placed on the LCP and he is still alive in a nursing home six months later. After the meeting, Mr Lamb said the independent inquiry would report back to him in the New Year. On ‘bribe’ payments, first revealed by . the Daily Mail, which have seen at least £30million given to hospitals . that hit targets for numbers of patients who die on the pathway, Mr Lamb . said: ‘We are doing an analysis to focus on the circumstances under . which these payments have been made. ‘I don’t want any payments to be made for anything other than to improve the experience of death. ‘Payments must not be made unless it . is absolutely clear that it’s genuinely improving the end of life and is . not just a payment for putting people on a list or a register.’ One of . the leading medical figures at the summit was Professor Patrick . Pullicino, consultant neurologist at East Kent Hospitals University NHS . Foundation Trust, who rang alarm bells over the LCP in the summer in a . speech arguing that it had become a euthanasia pathway. Prof Pullicino said the independence of the . inquiry would depend on who was in charge of it. ‘If it is a palliative . care doctor, it means zero, but if it is a member of the judiciary it . will be very good,’ he added. Among those at the summit who defended . the Liverpool Care Pathway was John Ellershaw, professor of palliative . medicine at the University of Liverpool and one of the leading figures behind its design.","Several cases have been reported where patients have been put on Liverpool Care Pathway without their family's knowledge .

"Britain’s economic recovery is being put at risk because too many school leavers cannot write properly, add up or even wear appropriate clothes for work, a leading business group has claimed. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which represents nearly 200,000 companies, said a chronic shortage of the most basic skills by school leavers means companies are losing out to foreign competition. FSB’s Mike Cherry said: ‘We have been trailing behind in business globally for far too long because of the skills shortage.

The low standard of numeracy and literacy skills is a huge problem, as is employability. Many are not prepared for the workplace in their attitude or dress.’ The FSB is not alone in bemoaning a lack of skills. Last year the British Chambers of Commerce said many employers had been left ‘disheartened and frustrated’ by poor levels of literacy, numeracy, communication and time-keeping among school leavers and graduates. It warned an over-emphasis by schools on sitting exams and hitting targets meant children had not developed social skills needed at work.

"Former children's TV presenter Floella Benjamin said she did not know how to protect our children from pornography found online . Former children’s TV presenter Floella Benjamin has warned of an ‘epidemic’ of violent online porn, which is leading youngsters on a ‘seemingly unstoppable march into a moral wasteland’. Baroness Benjamin – who sits as a Lib Dem peer in the Lords – said girls were becoming increasingly sexualised while more and more boys were treating them as little more than ‘sexual objects’. In an impassioned speech to mark today’s International Women’s Day, she said boys were pressurising girls into degrading behaviour. ‘I believe we have opened a Pandora’s box and I have no answer as to how we can reverse the trend of the sexual objectification of women and how to protect our children against its influence,’ she said. The former Play School and Play Away presenter said violent pornography was ‘only a mouse click away’ and was a ‘pan-global epidemic’. Too many children were growing up believing happiness could be gained purely by using sex as a commodity, she warned. The Daily Mail has been calling for tough restrictions on web porn to protect youngsters. David Cameron has promised protections whereby all new computers will be automatically fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them. But no timetable has been put in place to implement such a scheme. The NSPCC has revealed that more than 5,000 under-18s have been questioned by the police over sex offences over the past three years .

"Gross misconduct: Det Supt Steve Fulcher faces a hearing into his failure to read a murderer his rights .

Figures show that errors in paperwork, failure to read suspects their rights or mistakes in the way officers conducted interviews have meant at least 200 suspects a year walked free without charge. Since 2008, these have included 262 suspected violent criminals and 21 sex offenders, three of whom were suspected rapists and one of who was accused of sexually abusing a young boy.

"It is a British tradition that has brought joy to millions of families for more than 150 years. But now a council is trying to ban customers from eating fish and chips wrapped in paper. Instead, people would have to consume the meal in a more dignified fashion - using a plate and a knife and fork. Banned: Liverpool City Council wants to ban customers at 'pavement cafes' from eating fish and chips wrapped in paper. Instead, they would have to consume the meal in a more dignified fashion - using a plate, knife and fork . The new rules, proposed by Liverpool City Council, aim to prevent customers from dropping used paper in the street - leading to a pricey and time-consuming clean-up. If approved, they would apply to shops and businesses with outdoor seating areas, known as 'pavement cafes', in Liverpool city centre. Nick Small, the council's . enterprise chief, said: 'We don't want people buying chips, eating them . outside and then dropping their litter.' Prevention: The new rules aim to prevent customers from dropping used paper in the street . But today, locals spoke out against the 'ridiculous' rules, which they claimed would 'kill off' an age-old British tradition. Builder Peter Bostock, 57, said: 'Eating fish and chips in newspaper outside with a simple wooden fork is . one of those joys I remember from childhood and have enjoyed with my . grandson. 'Why does the council want to be killjoys and take these simple pleasures away? It makes no sense to me to even be thinking about it.' Meanwhile, retired nursery nurse June . Haslem, 63, said: 'It is ridiculous. Of all . the problems with council cut-backs, they are wasting valuable resources . thinking about this.' And student . Jack Longden, 19, said: 'If we are having a night out we just grab the . fish and chips and sit down outside and eat it. I don't really want a . full plate, knife and fork to be honest.' Other locals in Merseyside have taken to social media to hit out at the controversial proposals. Des Coffey wrote: 'It will put the price up because the plates will cost more,' while Louise Lacy said: 'I despair sometimes. Just provide a bin!' However, Amy Cartwright claimed: 'If it stops littering, I support it.' Under the proposed rules, new businesses bidding for a pavement cafe licence could be ordered to serve food on plates with cutlery - rather than in . newspaper packaging or polystyrene trays. The move would mainly affect fast food outlets, chippies, kebab houses and takeaways. Cllr Small said: 'We can see the benefits of pavement cafes being there, we just want them to up their standards.

'If people have a plate and cutlery, this won't happen. For any new business with a pavement cafe, we are going to make sure they give out plates and cutlery.'

"Sarcastic humour, heavy drinking and miserable weather are among the most common complaints made by expats living Britain, a study has found. More than half of foreigners find British people fit their international stereotype to some extent - with many saying a tendency to drink tea rang true. While expats appreciate British manners and the ability to queue, almost half said the excessive drinking culture was their least favourite trait in people and 31 per cent regarded British sarcasm as unpopular. Bad habits: Britons' excessive drinking habits is one of the main problems expats have with living in the UK . The study, conducted by a visa application help website, polled 1,402 expats living in Britain who had originated from various parts of the world, as part of research into opinions on the British way of life. Downpours: Britain's damp weather was another popular moan among foreigners living here . The expats were asked if they liked living in Britain and 68 per cent said they did, but almost a third said they did not. The most common reason for those who disliked living in Britain was the weather, with 38 per cent of expats agreeing on that. Almost a third did not like British culture and more than a fifth said they did not like British cuisine. Expats were asked for their opinions on the British populace, and the majority said that generally speaking they did like British people. The remaining 23 per cent said 'No, not really'. Liam Clifford, from GlobalVisas.com, . the website that conducted the research, said: 'Moving to a new country . poses many challenges. 'You . might think you know all about a place from holidays and previous trips . there, but actually living in a country puts an entirely different . perspective on it.

"Three British women have undergone a revolutionary new operation to fit a 'bra' underneath the skin to combat sagging breasts. The 'internal bras' comprise a fine hardened silicone cup placed under the breast tissue, and fine silk straps screwed into the patient's ribs to lift the breast. They are invisible under the skin and will enable women to go bra-less. Three women have undergone a revolutionary new breast lift operation at London's Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital. The procedure involves a surgeon implanting a silicone cup underneath the skin and screwing fine silk straps into the rib cage to life the breast tissue . More importantly, it is claimed they will not leak - welcome news after the recent PIP scandal. The 45-minute operations, carried out at London's Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, cost £6,000 - around £1,000 more than standard breast . implants. Leading breast surgeon Professor Jian Farhadi carried out the first three trial operations at the hospital last week. The procedure is likely to be free to NHS patients who have had medical breast reductions and breast cancer patients, and could be routine by next year, The Sun reports. But experts have urged caution, welcoming the new operation while calling for extensive clinical trials to examine the long-term effects on women. Professor Kefah Mokbel of the London Breast Institute told MailOnline the procedure, which has been in development since 2007, is an 'exciting' development. But he said it is vital that full trials are carried out to highlight any potential side-effects for patients. He said: 'This procedure may prove to be an effective alternative. 'This procedure is exciting but we must look at its efficacy and safety in the long term' - Professor Kefah Mokbel of the London Breast Institute . 'It will have a real impact, I think. But people should understand it is not a quick fix. 'We don't know the long-term side effects yet. There is a need for clinical trials with adequate numbers and follow ups to prove the efficacy and safety in the long term. It is very important. 'One of the things to be looked into is if fixing silk straps to the ribs will have side effects. 'In a standard breast operation the silicone implants are inserted behind the breast to minimise the risk. 'These cups go under the skin, so the question is do we know the long-term effect to women, will they develop scaring and will the internal bra affect the shape of the breast in the long term? 'It is premature to say it is a solution to the issue of sagging breasts.' He added that the operation may not be suitable for all women with sagging breasts. 'It has been marketed as a magical solution to address saggy breasts with very little scaring,' he added. Experts have welcomed the new operation but called for extensive clinical trials to prove the long-term efficacy and safety of the procedure . Standard breast uplift surgery involves removing excess skin from underneath a patient's breast, or from around the area of dark tissue surrounding a woman's nipple, the areola. Surgeons tighten the skin and breast tissue, moving the nipple to a higher position to give a firmer appearance. Breast enlargement or reduction surgery can be carried out at the same time. Uplift surgery can take two to three hours, depending on the exact procedure. It can take around four weeks to make a full recovery, but it can vary depending on the individual patient. Typical side-effects include soreness, swelling and bruising as well as permanent scars. Some patients can experience reduced nipple sensation. As with all procedures the opertaion comes with warnings of complications, including infection, bleeding under the skin and unevenness in size and shape. 'But many women with saggy breasts do not just need their breast tissue lifting, they require surgery to address their skin. 'This procedure can be used alongside standard surgery when the breasts are lifted to reduce the risk of a occurrence of sagging. 'Sagging breasts depends on many factors, a women's biological constitution, the size of their breasts, their reproductive history and other factors. 'If a patient has had a proper breast lift and is concerned about the occurrence of sagging, this operation could prove effective. 'But it is unlikely to be effective on its own. It is important that a women has procedures to address the skin as well as the breast tissue itself.' Professor Mokbel said while the new device has CE marking - which denotes it complies with EU safety, health and environmental requirements - the accreditation only refers to the actual product itself. He said: 'CE marking only refers to the safety in the sense of the materials itself, the actual product. 'But it does not mean the procedure is safe.' He said the operation need Food and Drug Accreditation (FDA), which looks at the efficacy of the procedure, not just the materials used. 'Yes, this procedure is exciting but we must look at its efficacy and safety in the long term.'","Three patients have undergone revolutionary 'internal bra' operation .

"A schoolgirl who spotted grammatical 'mistakes' in her English exam has written a letter of complaint - to Education Secretary Michael Gove. Eagle-eyed Rebecca Lee, 10, a pupil at Christ Church Primary School in Clifton, Bristol,  noticed commas 'missing' from two questions in her SATs last Tuesday. The Year Six pupil says she was so 'annoyed' by the basic punctuation errors that she wanted to take her complaint to the top. Rebecca Lee, 10, from Bristol, wrote to Education Secretary Michael Gove over punctuation errors in her SATs . So she wrote to Mr Gove saying: 'I understand that you are very keen for us to all learn our complex sentences and use of accurate punctuation. 'I believe that your department should also use the correct punctuation in all SATs tasks.' The schoolgirl said she hoped to hear back from Mr Gove. Rebecca, from Clifton, said: 'The exam wording should be setting an example and I was annoyed. I had to write. 'I've not heard back yet and am still waiting - Mr Gove's busy but I do hope to get a response back.' The 'mistakes' were in a section of the exam on complex sentences - and had commas 'missing' from two sentences. Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, and the letter he was sent by Bristol schoolgirl Rebecca Lee, right . One sentence read: 'If there is not enough rainfall this month there will be a drought' and 'As he was the chief of the tribe the final decision was his.' This afternoon a spokesman for the Department for Education defended the lack of commas in the exam paper. He said: 'The commas here are a matter of choice. They can be used to mark out clauses that appear at the beginning or the end of a sentence, but they are not necessary. 'We decided to use commas sometimes and not at others to make the tests more like real life where people will have their own styles. 'The only clauses that must be surrounded by commas are those in the middle of a sentence.' The same sentences - featuring commas in the correct places - had appeared in an earlier part of the exam on grammar. Around half a million pupils around the country took the same exam last week. Bright spark: Rebecca Lee discussed the errors in her exam with schoolfriends before writing to Mr Gove . Rebecca's mother Jo Lee, 40, a town . planner, said: 'A group of children were discussing in the playground . that there had been a mistake and that it wasn't right. 'Rebecca . said she thought she should write to whoever was responsible and found . that it was Michael Gove. I helped her write the letter and we emailed . it. 'It's great that she . decided to do it. Generally, I encourage her to do these types of things . - to stand up to the people who are supposed to be setting an example. I'm fully behind her.' The Government's Standards and Testing Agency is meant to check if exams are up to scratch before pupils take them, but a spokesman insisted that using commas in complex sentences was 'a matter of choice'. Rebecca's teacher Barney Braithwaite said many of his pupils noticed the mistake when they undertook the new spelling, punctuation and grammar test. He said: 'I laughed my head off when I had heard that Rebecca had sent the letter. She obviously felt moved enough by the mistakes.' Susie Dent has advised Countdown contestants (and hosts) on linguistic matters since 1992 . Susie Dent, the resident word expert on Countdown, says that while adding a comma into the two sentences Rebecca Lee complained about would help them flow better, it is not essential in either one. Mrs Dent, 45, who has sat in the Channel 4 show's Dictionary Corner adjudicating on linguistic matters since 1992, told MailOnline the comma 'serves as a signpost, helping us to understand what lies ahead and, in many cases, removing ambiguity'. She added: 'Each of these two sentences has a subordinate clause (a combination of words that do not form a complete sentence and which require another to complete the thought: 'If there is not enough rainfall this month', and 'As he was the chief of the tribe' both need more information before the sentence is complete). 'Adding a comma after each clause in these cases would make the sentences and their style flow smoothly, slowing them down almost to the rhythm of natural speech. 'However, in these particular instances, the comma is not essential and is more a matter of style than necessity; the reader will understand what is being said without them. 'A comma in the wrong place, however, can change the meaning entirely: 'If there is not enough rainfall, this month there will be a drought). Oxford-educated Mrs Dent is the longest-serving member of Countdown's on-screen team, and has appeared with presenters including the much-loved Richard Whiteley, Des Lynam, Des O'Connor, Jeff Stelling and current host, Nick Hewer. Mrs Dent, who studied modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford, before studying German at Princeton, worked as a language teacher and in publishing before going to work for the Oxford University Press. She has written several reports on language for the Oxford University Press, and lives in Oxford with her husband and two daughters.","Rebecca Lee, from Bristol, was 'annoyed' by two 'missing' commas in SAT .

"Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has branded the prime minister's remarks in front of the world’s leaders on Saturday ‘weird and graceless’. After Tony Abbott attempted to take control of the G20 heavyweights at a meeting at Queensland’s Parliament House in Brisbane – telling them they should call each other by their first names – the Labor leader hit out. Mr Abbott cited his own difficulties with the Australian budget - particularly in gaining support for proposed higher education changes and the $7 GP co-payment - as examples of the need to persist with important reforms . Mr Shorten said the lunchtime discussion was a missed opportunity to promote Australia's position as a global leader. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott has met with all the G20 leaders at Queensland's Parliament House today . Opposition leader Bill Shorten, seen here at the G20 with the Spanish Prime Minister, slammed Prime Minister Tony Abbott's speech . ‘This was Tony Abbott's moment in front of the most important and influential leaders in the world and he's whinging that Australians don't want his GP tax,’ Mr Shorten said in a statement to AAP. Mr Abbott gave leaders from around the world a set of conversational protocols to adhere and asked them to 'speak from their hearts' as they arrived in Brisbane to figure out how to boost global economic growth. Ahead of an Aussie BBQ lunch made up of Queensland's finest produce at the 'leaders retreat', Mr Abbott and the G20 powerhouses sat in a circle to discuss economic issues. Mr Abbott instructed the likes of President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin to 'only speak for five minutes' at a time. World leaders have gathered in Brisbane to discuss economic growth, free trade and climate change . US president Barack Obama spoke at the opening of the G20 conference . Tony Abbott, seen here with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto (C), has met with all the G20 leaders at Queensland's Parliament House . He said he wanted a 'very candid and very honest discussion on where our countries can and should go.' The G20 heavyweights are this weekend attempting to create a plan to achieve a 2.1% boost in global economic growth by 2018. 'I would like the discussion to focus on the politics of economic reform... in the end though this is your retreat it is open for you to raise any subject that you wish,' he said. 'If we can speak from our hearts not from a script please,' he asked. 'We have a heavy responsibilities all of us, the world is looking to all of us right now to try to demonstrate. 'We know what we are doing and have a plan for growth and for jobs and that's our challenge - to leave this G20 meeting in 48 hours time having installed confidence in the people of the world that there is a better and brighter future for all of us,' he said. 'We all know what we would like to do,' Mr Abbott said. President Obama at at the University of Queensland in Brisbane . President Barack Obama waved to crowds in Brisbane as he drove to Parliament House . He knows better than many presidents and prime ministers about the perils of trying to get economic reform through parliament. His 14-month-old government has been frustrated by the Senate blocking billions of dollars in budget measures. He said deregulating universities and the $7 GP co-payment were examples of important reforms which in some G20 countries would not be unusual, but in Australia had been 'massively difficult'. As US President Barack Obama arrived in his own vehicle - The Beast - for the BBQ at Parliament House and climbed out of his the armoured car he asked waiting reporters: 'Hey! How are you?' US President Barack Obama arrive at Queensland's Parliament House in his own vehicle, The Beast . Obama's security team are seen in action as The Beast drove through Brisbane's deserted streets . Russian President Vladimir Putin also seemed to be in good spirits, flashing a small smile for the cameras. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, dressed in a suit and blue tie, pulled up just after 9am. He had earlier on Saturday held bilateral meetings with Italy's Matteo Renzi, Brazil's Dilmah Rousseff, and Spain's Mariano Rajoy. Over the course of the G20 weekend there will be 100 chefs and 600 wait staff working 14 hours a day to provide 100,000 meals to the 7,000 delegates and official media. G20 organisers are unwilling to divulge the exact menu that the political heavyweights will dine on over the weekend because of security reasons. Two of the world's most famous leaders arrived for the G20 conference together today . Slightly windswept: David Cameron (L) and Tony Abbott (R) flew into Brisbane together on Saturday . Mr Cameron and Mr Abbott pose together before the start of the summit . However, earlier this week executive chef at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre Martin Latter told the ABC that Mr Abbott's favourite meat could be served up. Porterhouse steak is reportedly going to be cooked on the BBQ and Penfolds wine - one of Australia's oldest labels, founded in 1844 in Adelaide -  has also been requested. Mr Latter explained that 80 per cent of the produce will come from Queensland and planning for the meals began over a year ago. 'Every lunch and dinner will showcase different Australian meals. Everything will be the very best you can get in the country,' Mr Latter said. The BBQ was an opportunity for the leaders to mingle without the presence of their many aids. Tony Abbott, right, and Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi meet prior to the start of the G-20 leaders summit in Brisbane . President of Spain Mariano Rajoy Brey, left, also met with Mr Abbott on Saturday morning . Mr Abbott tweeted: 'It was great to welcome @marianorajoy to #G20Brisbane for his first visit to Australia' Elsewhere, Treasurer Joe Hockey, who chaired the final meeting of finance ministers on Saturday, said he was confident the G20 could achieve its target of two per cent growth by 2018. 'My finance minister colleagues and I are resolute in our determination to use all policy levers to generate growth and jobs,' he said. Among the country plans were 1000 individual measures to lift infrastructure investment, increase trade and competition, cut red tape and lift labour market participation. Mr Cameron and Mr Abbott flew into Brisbane on a Royal Australian Air Force plane . It is understood the final communique will show plans for a 2.1 per cent rise in growth, slightly better than expected in earlier talks. Earlier, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters that while the growth target was welcome, the employment created needed to be 'decent' jobs. 'We must pursue an agenda that advances sustainability, addresses inequalities and generates decent jobs, especially for young people,' he said. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said any employment created needed to be 'decent' jobs . Mr Ban said he understood climate change would also be on the G20's two-day meeting agenda, despite reports to the contrary. He urged other countries to follow the lead of the US, China and Europe by bolstering their carbon emission reduction targets and contributing to a global fund. Meanwhile, in Brisbane, some pedestrians have reported having to wait more than 40 minutes to cross city roads. Non-G20 traffic was also going nowhere fast as the motorcades traversed the city.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott kicked off the leaders retreat ahead of a BBQ .

"Thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money is being spent investigating the psychological state of asylum seekers – triggering furious complaints by some mental health campaigners who have seen their own budgets stretched. Refugees held in Dover are being asked questions such as ‘do you hear voices?’ by NHS staff. Last night one campaigner said that the news – at a time when mental health provision for the rest of the town is becoming severely strained – made her ‘blood boil’. Fury: Critics say money is being wasted on asylum seekers after it was revealed that thousands of pounds is being spent on investigating their psychological state . A local MP added it was ‘yet another’ drain on resources caused by a malfunctioning immigration system. The NHS staff have gone into the Dover Immigration Removal Centre, which is run by the prison service to hold failed asylum seekers while the authorities attempt to deport them back to their native countries. The centre, which is housed on a site fortified since Roman times, holds 300 people. Most are removed after two months, but some stay for substantially longer if they mount a legal challenge to the decision. The centre says its purpose ‘shall be to provide for the secure but humane accommodation of detained persons in a relaxed regime with as much freedom of movement and association as possible... while respecting in particular their dignity and right to individual expression’. Dr Al Aditya Khan, who is in charge of the project for the Oxleas NHS Trust, says the aim of the scheme is to identify occupants who ‘hear voices or have abnormal beliefs’, and ensure those who do have access to professional help. But Tracy Carr, of Talk It Out, a support group in Dover, said locals with mental health problems resented the fact that more money was being ploughed into the centre while they struggled to receive the help that they needed. Refugees held in Dover are being asked questions such as ‘do you hear voices?’ by NHS staff - but the revelation has sparked complaints from mental health campaigners, whose own budgets are stretched . ‘It makes my blood boil that money is being spent in this way when provision for locals is so overstretched,’ she said. And she revealed there was a growing problem with ‘crisis teams’ – health professionals who are called if a patient is deemed to be at risk of self-harm and are expected to react quickly. ‘I have three or four members of my group who have recently had to call out the crisis team and it’s been hours before they came. I worried it would be too late,’ she said. ‘It has definitely got worse in the last two or so years. I’ve had first-hand experience of these situations and it feels as if no one cares.’ Other critics say conditions in the centre are harsh, with some detainees forced to sleep six to a room. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said: ‘Already millions are wasted keeping asylum claimants in detention for years. This is yet another waste of taxpayers’ money. The Oxleas NHS Trust, says the aim of the scheme is to identify occupants who ‘hear voices or have abnormal beliefs’, and ensure those who do have access to professional help . 'Many asylum claimants eat their papers to hide where they are from. The cash would be better spent tracking down where people are from and speeding up the asylum claim and deportation process.’ A spokesman for Oxleas NHS Trust said: ‘As part of our contract with NHS England, we are commissioned to provide mental health services to prisons across Kent including the Dover Immigration Removal Centre. 'Part of this includes contributing research to the national evidence base.’","NHS staff have gone into prison-run Dover Immigration Removal Centre .

"Kentucky Sen. Ran Paul went on the attack against former Secretary of State and potential 2016 rival Hillary Clinton on Friday night at a dinner in his home state. Paul reportedly blasted Clinton for not doing more to prevent the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, two years ago and made jokes at Clinton's expense about her personal wealth. 'I certainly wish that maybe she becomes preoccupied with something else because I don't think she's fit to lead the country,' Paul said of Clinton's presidential prospects, according to the National Journal. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was full of jokes about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's money problems this weekend . Speaking about Benghazi later in his remarks, Paul again attempted to discredit Clinton, saying it was irresponsible of her not to read the messages that late Libyan ambassador Christopher Stevens sent the State Department in the days leading up to the terrorist attack. Clinton has . claimed numerous times that she couldn't have possibly read all of the . cables sent to State every day nor would it have been a proper use of . her time as the department head. 'If you don't read the cables from one of the most dangerous spots on earth, frankly, you preclude yourself from ever being our commander in chief,' Paul stated. The Republican lawmaker also claimed that Clinton gave the Benghazi outpost the same level of deference 'as if it were Paris.' 'Benghazi's not Paris. Benghazi is a lot like Baghdad,' he reportedly said. Perhaps the State Department could have . afforded more security at the Libyan consulate if it hadn't spent $100,000 on an electrical charging station at the embassy in Vienna, Austria, or $700,000 on landscaping for the . embassy in Brussels, Belgium. 'Rand Paul voted to shut down the . government, wants the U.S. to retreat from our responsibilities around . the world, opposes commonsense legislation like the Violence Against . Women Act and equal pay legislation, and thinks employers ought to have . the right to discriminate. With that record, he's got no credibility on . the issue of who is fit to lead,' Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin told the National Journal. Paul joked that he had lost sleep over the financial woes of Clinton, who was spotted this weekend outside the Carlyle Hotel in New York City. 'I hope she can deal with only 100 million,' Paul said, referring to Clinton and her husband's estimated net worth . Paul also took shots at Clinton's comments that her family was 'dead broke' when Bill's presidency ended in 2001. After asking the audience to observe 'a moment of silence' for Clinton, Paul joking said, 'Somebody must have been praying for her because she's now worth 100, 200 million.' 'I tell you it was really tough giving those speeches,' he said, referring to the large pot of money Clinton has made on the speaking circuit since resigning as Secretary of State in early 2013. Clinton often charges $200,000 or more to appear before groups and has made an estimated $6 million off the arrangements. She and her husband have an approximate combined net worth of $100 million, as Paul mentioned. 'I hope she can deal with only 100 million,' Paul said, playing off his previous joke. Mocking Clinton's admission in January that she hasn't driven a car since 1996, Paul said at least 'she had her limo driver with her for the last 17 years to commiserate.' At the beginning of his remarks, Paul said in jest that he'd been losing sleep over Clinton's money problems. Paul was full of jokes this weekend. At an annual picnic in Fancy Farm, Kentucky, the following day Paul recited a poem about fellow Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell's opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Grimes is running against the Republican leader in the general election that will take place in November. 'There once was a woman from Kentucky, who thought in politics she’d be lucky. 'So she flew to L.A. for a Hollywood bash. She came home in a flash with buckets of cash,' Paul said, per Politico. 'To liberals, she whispers: coal makes you sick. In Kentucky, she claims coal makes us tick. 'To the liberals, she sells her soul — the same ones who hate Kentucky coal. 'One thing we know is true, one thing we know is guaranteed, she’d cast her first vote for Harry Reid,' Paul said, name dropping current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who will have to run for re-election as a party leader when the new Congress convenes next year. 'Grimes’ real pledge is to Obama; her first vote is to Reid; as for Kentucky, if that happens, it’s too bad indeed,' Paul concluded. After an eventful weekend in Kentucky, Paul traveled to all-important presidential primary state Iowa, where he plans to attend events for the next several days. Congress is recess until September, giving possible presidential contenders who serve at the federal level five uninterrupted weeks to test out their campaign apparatuses before officially announcing their candidacies next year.","Paul said Clinton had precluded herself 'from .

During his remarks Paul also held a mock 'moment of silence' for Clinton .

"Very soon, all customers could need to withdraw money from an ATM is their mobile phones . Bank cards in Australia could soon become obsolete, with the second of the big four banks introducing cardless cash withdrawal options. Commonwealth Bank was the pioneer of this service, introducing their system which only requires an iPhone to get money out from one of their ATMS. Already more than $1 million has been withdrawn in more than 15,000 transactions since the new technology was released in May. The next bank to roll out the concept is Westpac, set to launch a similar system called 'emergency cash', according to news.com.au. The chief product officer for Westpac David Lindberg told the website the bank is introducing the system this month, which will allow customers to withdraw up to $1,000 per day. The maximum amount per week is $2,000, and is designed for customers caught off guard without their card. They are sent a six digit code to their mobile phone after calling the bank, which customers can then punch into an ATM. It is believed the bank will eventually make this service available via an app. Commonwealth Bank has already done this, and users are sent an eight-digit code and four-digit pin to their iPhones following a request on the app. The Commonwealth Bank was the first to introduce the system for it's customers . These details are then entered into an ATM and used to withdraw cash, though customers are only entitled to $200 per day. Commonwealth Bank’s executive general manager of cards, payments, analytics & retail strategy, Angus Sullivan said the bank already have more than 2.5 million people using the app. 'There’s a population of really early adopters who are using the phone to pay and they’re now using the phone to get cash out,' he said. Westpac will be the next of the big four banks to roll out a cardless cash withdrawal method . The transactions are as safe as any other method of cash withdrawal or payment, strategic relations firm RFi research director, Alex Boorman told the site. 'You have to be able to log into the app and there’s a $200 maximum on the withdrawals which is another thing to help address any security concerns consumers have.' He assured users it's a reliable method and removes any chance of their cards being skimmed.","Commonwealth Bank introduced cardless cash withdrawals this month .

"Nearly half of high-flying 11-year-olds fail to go on to get five good GCSEs in core subjects, secondary school league tables show. Of the 160,000 pupils who gained good SATs results when they left primary school,  84,000 failed to achieve a C-grade or higher in the ‘English Baccalaureate’ subjects of English, maths, science, history or geography and a language. The figures will reignite the debate about mixed-ability classes which Labour and the Conservatives have both pledged to crack down on since 1997. Critics say the lack of sets and streams in schools holds back the most able students. Almost half of academic 11-year-olds fail to get five or more C grade GSCEs in academic subjects . Some 420 schools or sixth form . colleges were also unable to produce a single student who gained three . A-levels with grades of AAB or above in subjects preferred by leading . universities. The worrying trends emerged in official figures which . showed the number of under-performing schools has been slashed since the . Coalition took power. Of . the 3,200 state schools in  England, 154 fell short of a government . target for at least 40 per cent of pupils to get five good passes in . GCSEs including English and maths – leaving them at risk of being closed . or converted into academies. Of the 160,000 pupils who gained good SATs results when they left primary school,  84,000 failed to achieve a C-grade or higher in core subjects . But . the figure was 61 fewer than the previous year, despite the benchmark . being raised from 35 per cent of pupils. The improvement means 50,000 . fewer children are trapped in sub-standard secondaries compared to last . year, or 244,000 since 2010. Education . Secretary Michael Gove said the results were a ‘credit to the . professionalism and hard work of teachers’. Tony Blair effectively . admitted mixed-ability teaching was a failure when he dropped the . party’s historic support for the  practice in 1997. Education . ministers backed the line, saying separating pupils according to . ability would ‘raise standards’. David Cameron also called for changes . while in opposition, saying every comprehensive should have a ‘grammar . stream’. But inspectors at . the schools watchdog have found just 46 per cent of state school classes . are divided into sets or streams – only a one percentage point . improvement in 17 years. Tory . MP Graham Brady, who  supports selective education, said: ‘All of the . evidence indicates that teaching by ability works best. That’s true . whether it’s within a school through sets or streaming or between . schools as a selective system.’ The . league tables are based on data provided by the Department for . Education and show how more than 4,000 schools and colleges in England . performed at GCSEs, A-levels and other academic qualifications. The . top-performing school for GCSEs was co-educational Colyton Grammar . School in Devon, which had the best results for the second year in a . row. The figure is 61 less than last year - an achievement Education Secretary Michael Gove said was a 'credit to hard work of teachers' The analysis also . showed that 202,000 pupils were entered for the EBacc compared to . 130,000 in 2012, showing schools are heeding government calls to ditch . soft subjects such as drama and sociology for those better suited to . higher education and the jobs markets. Teachers’ unions dislike league tables because they claim they do not accurately . show how a school is performing and encourage staff to ‘teach to the . test’. But Simon Burgess, . professor of economics at the University of  Bristol, said: ‘League . tables play an important role in school standards. Removing league . tables reduces average school performance and raises inequality in . attainment.’","About 84,000 out of 160,000 schoolchildren failed to get a C or higher .

"The first bad Santa of 2014 has dropped in on an Australian Post Office - and filled his own sack with money.

Two female staff thought at first he was just a friendly old Santa passing on some early Christmas cheer. 'When they saw his red sack, they thought he was dropping by to hand out lollies to give to children who came in,' said Detective Senior Constable Bryan Strangman. 'But when they realised this was a robbery they became quite terrified.' CCTV footage shows the bad Santa thumping his sack down on the counter and demanding money to be handed over from the till.

Two female staff thought at first he was just a friendly old Santa passing on some early Christmas cheer . He told the staff to open the safe, but when that did not produce a response the robber jumped onto the counter and pulled out all the cash from the small post office's register.

"Anthony Trollope's novel The Duke's Children was published in 1879, but he was forced to cut 65,000 words – a quarter of the original text . He's one of the best-loved novelists of the 19th Century, whose work has been read and studied by academics and an army of fans, including Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes. But remarkably, none of them has been getting the full story of Anthony Trollope's work – until now. A novel 'butchered' at the time of its original publication has been restored after 135 years, and is being hailed as virtually a whole new book. When The Duke's Children was submitted for publication in 1879, Trollope was forced to hack away more than 65,000 words – a quarter of the original text. But now the sixth and final instalment in his series of novels about the Palliser family is to be published as he intended. Last night Lord Fellowes said: 'I couldn't be more pleased. The truncated version is an ineffective conclusion to the Palliser novels but this is tremendous and does justice to the series which came before.' The new version, which comes out next year – the bicentenary of Trollope's birth – picks up the story of former Prime Minister Plantagenet Palliser as he struggles to cope with the loss of political office, the death of his wife Lady Glencora, and the liaison of their son Lord Silverbridge with American heiress Isabel Boncassen. The novels were adapted into a highly acclaimed 1974 BBC series, The Pallisers, which starred Philip Latham, Susan Hampshire, Anthony Andrews and Lynne Frederick. The series was repeated earlier this year. But at the time Trollope finished the manuscript, aged 64, his reputation was at a low ebb. The literary magazine All The Year Round agreed to serialise the story only on condition of heavy cuts being made. The firm that then published it as a book used the cut version. Michael Williamson, chairman of the Trollope Society, said it had been 'butchered', and added: 'The book has always had its fans but it has also been considered one of Trollope's weakest because of the cuts. I have been blown away by the new book.' The restoration was done by American academic Professor Steve Amarnick, who spent ten years studying Trollope's manuscript, which is in Yale University. His team examined 1,000 pages of handwritten text to try to differentiate between the changes Trollope made himself as he worked on the book and the drastic edits which were forced upon him. The novels were adapted into acclaimed 1974 BBC series, The Pallisers, starring Lynne Frederick as Isabel Boncassen and Anthony Andrews as Silverbridge . Their task was made all the harder by the fact that because Trollope wrote the novel towards the end of his life, his handwriting was almost illegible. Prof Amarnick said: 'There were times when we'd see something and couldn't figure it out. But we'd look again a year or two later and it would suddenly click.' He added that the new version is 'far richer, more complex and ultimately more Trollopian'. But author Joanna Trollope, who is a distant relative of Anthony, said fans of the original should not feel cheated. She explained: 'Anyone who read the usual edition shouldn't feel they have missed out on the essentials. It is significant though. It is also peculiarly heartfelt about paternal love and, like The Way We Live Now [another of his novels], presciently modern.' lThe Duke's Children will be published by the Folio Society in April.","Anthony Trollope's novel The Duke's Children was published in 1879 .

"The United States accounts for just 5 percent of the world's population, but incarcerates almost a quarter of the prisoners around the globe. With 2.2 million people in state and federal institutions, the sheer overcrowding in prisons has become so severe that the White House is prepared to listen to any solution, no matter how unusual, to lower the number of inmates. Warden Rick Ven Wickler, of New Hampshire's Cheshire County Correctional Facility believes he has the answer, allowing his prisoners unrivaled freedoms, pets and crucially, no perimeter fences. No fences: New Hampshire's Cheshire County Correctional Facility resembles a school more than a high security prison . Van Wickler is of the opinion that while punishment is his primary role, the number of repeat offenders in American jails is simply too high. He advocates an incarceration that encourages rehabilitation, which will reduce the number of inmates nationally and ultimately, lower costs. The 54-year-old is in charge of 230 prisoners and runs what has been described as the most liberal prison in the country. It took Van Wickler 13-years to secure the funding to build this new facility which houses male and female prisoners and during that time he toured prisons nationwide, trying to understand how to operate a more enlightened jail. Open planned: Inmates and correctional officers interact together in the clean and well lit open spaces - removing territorial disputes . Asked by Vice Magazine what some of those innovations were, Van Wickler replied that his best changes are cosmetic. 'Well, the first thing, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, is that there’s no perimeter fence.,' said Van Wickler. 'That’s the idea. Nobody wants a jail in their neighborhood, and we didn’t want to make it obvious. Most people don’t even know it’s a jail. They think it’s a school.' 'That’s the problem with corrections today. They say, ‘We need more fences. We need more cameras. We need more sensors.’ Well, if you just f***ing stay awake and do your job, you don’t need any of that. 'They’ll say, ‘We need a fence to catch escapees.’ Well, how about you don’t let them escape in the first place? Games: Two female inmates play scrabble - in the New Hampshire facility that is trying to change how the United States incarcerates its prisoners . Little competition: Amanda (left) and Maria (right) enjoyed a friendly game of Scrabble inside the New Hampshire jail . Relaxing: Amanda and Maria playing the game allows for a more convivial atmosphere inside the high security facility . 'But here’s the primary reason that I don’t want a perimeter fence: Children come here to visit mom or dad. It’s scary enough for adults to go through concertina wire. Imagine a four-year-old.' Some inmates are allowed to keeps pets, such as one woman who had a cat named Polo. 'He’s from the Humane Society,' the warden said. 'We have this agreement that the women will take care of the pets until they’re adopted. It’s been very good for the pets, and it’s been very good for the women.' Claiming to have never had an escape, Van Wickler explained that art and craft projects at the 94,000 square-foot institution are another essential tool in rehabilitation as inmates discover hidden talents. Security at the modern facility is provided by a huge array of surveillance camera's operated out of a room dubbed 'the secret squirrel room' High tech: In the absence of fences, the security is provided by a huge network of surveillance cameras manned 24 hours a day by correctional officers . Security: Every aspect of the prisoner's lives is monitored to prevent any indiscretions and for the safety of the inmates . Eschewing the traditional prison mantra of control, Van Wickler believes his inmates are better served by being managed. Pointing out that this is not splitting hairs, Van Wickler told Vice that he outnumbered. 'It’s 64-to-one in most cases. The only way that you can successfully run a jail is with the offenders’ cooperation,' said Van Wickler. 'If they want to overrun you, they will overrun you. It would seem that the best thing to do is to gain voluntary compliance. The question is how do you do that?' Another modern innovation at the prison is to have a much more open planned design, with corrections officers, mingling more with the inmates. Bare: Solitary confinement is still regarded as a severe punishment in Cheshire County Correctional Facility, but is not as harsh as at other prisons . Clean and bright: The prison is also designed to be a positive working environment for the staff as well as the inmates . 'Under that old style of architectural design, the inmates would behave as though the area where they lived was their real estate,' said Van Wickler to reporter Roc Morin. 'So, when you went in to bring them meals, or to do a head count, you were encroaching on their territory, and they gave you that sense: ‘You’re in my house.’ 'Well, the way we do things here, we’re in their area every day. That takes away their sense of ownership over real estate.' Respect is a two-way street for the prisoners and corrections officers. Inmates are referred to by their names and not as inmate and prisoners call the prison staff by their names too and not as officer. The future? Experts all agree that the United States prison population is too high to continue at current levels . 'Also, when they do a room search, they fold our blankets back up,' said inamte Maria. 'They don’t toss everything.' Indeed, Van Wickler wants working conditions for the corrections officers to be to a high standard, also. 'I always say, ‘Remember that this is a place of employment as well. There are 80 employees here, and aren’t they entitled to a decent workspace? Aren’t they entitled to a little bit of color?’ Pointing out their solitary confinement cells, Van Wickler said that even under that extreme a punishment, inmates are allowed out to shower or to make a phone call for one hour a day. They are also only allowed to be placed in solitary confinement for no more than 15 days. 'They can have two books, but no photographs, no radio, no TV, nothing. Fifteen days can be a very long time,' said Van Wickler. Controversially, Van Wickler says that the most important change to the prison system would be to not imprison, nonviolent drug offenders. 'I’ve seen people come into this institution for drug violations,' the warden explained. Visionary: Warden Rick VanWickler has controversial theories regarding the future of the American penal system . 'I’ve seen the cost, not only to the taxpayer, but the social costs—the costs of parents being away from their children. 'Contrary to what a lot of media has portrayed and what law enforcement believes, not every person in jail for drug possession is a bad parent.' 'Half a million people die every year in the U.S. from tobacco, and yet nobody’s talking about banning cigarettes. 'The most they’ll do is slap a warning label on the box. A hundred thousand people die per year from alcohol. 'Three hundred thousand die from obesity. A hundred thousand die from prescription medicines. Then you look at the number of all illicit-drug deaths combined and you get 16,000. 'And many of those deaths occur from people using impure drugs, since there’s no quality control on the street.'","New Hampshire's Cheshire County Correctional Facility house 230 male and female prisoners .

"Thailand's military junta has blocked MailOnline today after the site revealed a video of the country's Crown Prince and his wife partying. The clip of the decadent event, which was shot at the . Thai Royal Palace in Bangkok, shows Princess Srirasmi – a former waitress . – cavorting in just a tiny G-string as she feeds a pet dog cake, apparently to celebrate its birthday. It is thought publishing the video yesterday has breached lese majeste laws which outlaw offending the Thai royal family. The country's new military junta which took power last week is thought to be keen to enforce such laws strictly. Today's clampdown came as hundreds of protesters took to the streets in the Thai . capital today defying the junta's warning against anti-coup demonstrations. Scroll down for video . The story that has offended Thailand's military junta and led to MailOnline being blocked . Blocked: How MailOnline appears when accessed from Thailand . The senior . general who staged last week's coup, Prayuth Chan-ocha, responded by telling people to . avoid rallies, saying normal democratic principles cannot be applied at . this time. He also defended detaining dozens of politicians and activists, including former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, most of them associated with the ousted government. The new block on MailOnline also then followed. One user on a Thai visa forum said: 'The site is blocked due to military coup. That's the info that comes up when trying to access the site. Was accessible a few hours ago.' Another asked: 'How far will censorship under the coup go?' In recent months authorities have filtered out a number of sites deemed offensive to the Thai royal family and linked to pornography, piracy and gambling. So far there has been no official statement from Thailand's ICT Ministry on today's clampdown and the Royal Thai Embassy in London was not available to comment. However, the British minister of state responsible for South East Asia, Hugo Swire, told MailOnline: 'I am extremely concerned at the deterioration of the democratic environment in Thailand. 'Arbitrary detentions, restrictions on local and foreign media, and limitations on freedoms of expression and assembly undermine trust in the intentions of the military leaders. The offending video: Crown Prince Maha and his topless wife entertaining Foo Foo . Raunchy: The video is sure to intensify concerns about Prince Maha's fitness to succeed his father . 'I urge the Thai military authorities . to provide a clear timetable for the restoration of civilian government . by means of elections, in line with democratic values, and to respond . proportionately to peaceful protest and dissent. In view of these . negative developments, the UK is reviewing the scope of its cooperation . with Thailand.' Thailand is . one of the world's worst countries when it comes to censoring the . Internet. According to the Asia Sentinel, in 2010 Thailand had over . 103,000 websites blocked. Since then Yingluck Shinawatra's government was believed to have blocked around 200,000 websites. Facebook, YouTube, Blogger and Twitter, have been periodically . blocked in Thailand depending which comments are offensive to the Thai . government. Some web pages on the BBC, CNN and Human Rights Watch have also been blocked. Under .

Controversial: Princess Srirasmi cavorted in just a tiny G-string . Anyone can file a lese majeste complaint, and police are duty-bound to investigate it. And under Thailand's computer crime law, introduced in 2007, acts of defamation and posting false rumours online are punishable by five years in jail. Recent cases have sparked fierce debates, including over a 61-year-old man who was jailed in November 2011 for 20 years for sending text messages deemed insulting to the monarchy.

Journalists are being required to register by the new military authorities. Today, Pravit Rojanaphruk, an outspoken columnist for English-language daily The Nation, tweeted that he was reporting to the junta: 'On my way to see the new dictator of Thailand. Hopefully the last.' The military, which is already holding most of the cabinet ousted in Thursday's coup in secret locations, said it would keep former prime minister Shinawatra and others in custody for up to a week to give them 'time to think' and keep the country calm.

Starting tomorrow, those in detention who have arrest warrants or face criminal charges will be handed over for prosecution, deputy military spokesman Colonel Winthai Suvaree said. He also said that the general 'urged every group of citizens to avoid joining the anti-coup protests because at the moment the democratic principles cannot be executed normally'.

"Two care assistants face jail after being found guilty of mistreating a dozen severely disabled patients in their care. In a series of vicious attacks James Hinds, 59, and Susan Murphy, 43, slapped people around the head, physically dragged someone to the toilet, and even locked one woman in a cupboard, Sheffield Crown Court heard. The pair worked at the  Solar Centre at St Catherine’s Hospital in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, where patients who were blind and physically disabled were abused and tormented. Court: Susan Murphy (left) and James Hinds (right) have been found guilty of abusing a dozen disabled patients . Hinds was found guilty of 10 counts of ill-treating patients and Murphy was found guilty of 15 counts. Hinds and Murphy were ill-treated 12 different outpatients between them at the centre. Hinds was acquitted of nine further charges and Murphy was cleared of . five further charges after the jury of five men and seven women . deliberated for two days. After a month-long trial Judge Rosalind Coe told them they will be sentenced on June 14. She said: 'You are both fully aware that custodial sentences are the likely outcome.' Both were given conditional bail but were remanded in custody until . their passports could be brought to the court and surrendered after the . judge heard they had been living in Spain. Another care assistant, Julie Burge, 48, was cleared of all charges she faced as was physiotherapy assistant Michael Barnard. Shameful: The attacks happened at the Solar Centre at St Catherine's hospital in Doncaster, which should have been a safe haven for users . All those involved are extremely vulnerable adults, with limited communication abilities and a range of physical disabilities including blindness. Many of the attacks involved patients being slapped and hit around the head. Hinds threw one man into a wheelchair, dragged another to the toilet and hit another with a microphone. Wrong: The pair were guilty of a combined 25 counts of abuse, which included the pushing, hitting and dragging of patients . Murphy locked one woman in a cupboard, the court heard. Prosecutor Sarah Wright told the court at the beginning of the trial: 'James Hinds also smacked Michael Kime around the face and head after Michael Kime had hit out at him. 'He pulled him up by his hair and dragged him across the floor. Miss Wright told the jury that Hinds would regularly grab the cheeks of Robert Kirsopp and slap him. Mr Kirsopp, who is in his 40s, has Down’s syndrome, autism and dementia. The court heard that Hinds also pricked Mr Kirsopp with a needle during a Christmas stocking-making session. All the incidents happened in a period between January 2005 and March 2007. Miss Wright told the jury the patients at the Solar Centre exhibited a range of challenging behaviour and had severe problems. She said: ;They were vulnerable and not able to stand up to those who abused them.' The prosecutor said a number of patients suffered 'physical assaults, threats, improper handling and degrading treatment'. Miss Wright said Hinds and Murphy created an atmosphere at the centre which was intimidatory. She said Hinds in particular was a 'very dominant character who came across as a bully' and who talked about 'sorting them out' in relation to the patients. The police were called in after one member of staff decided to leave in March 2007 and made formal allegations about the mistreatment of patients. The Solar Centre is run by Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust (RDaSH). Scene: Both worked St Catherine's Hospital in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, were they hurt the vulnerable people they were meant to care for . Outside court, Dr Nav Ahluwalia, executive medical director for RDaSH said: 'We fully apologised to service users and their families at the time of the incidents and we apologise again today for the actions of the individuals that have been found guilty. 'The trust took immediate action as soon as we were made aware of the situation in 2007 and worked with South Yorkshire Police in their investigation into this matter. 'The trust has implemented improvements to the learning disability service at this centre to minimise the risks of such incidents happening again. 'We will not tolerate staff mistreating service users and have reinforced our channels of communication to ensure that staff, service users and carers report suspected abuse so that we can take action.' Dr Ahluwalia added: 'We have a number of ongoing civil claims, which are confidential, and so the trust is not making any further comments.'","James Hinds, 59, and Susan Murphy, 43, abused a dozen in their care .

"This is the underground bare-knuckle boxing club where men risk bloody noses and broken bones for a shot at the $40,000 prize. The real-life Fight Club, which keeps moving locations, cropped up last in Wilimington, Delaware. Organizers and competitors openly admit that the fights are illegal - but this does nothing to stop scores of spectators paying $100 for a ticket to watch the carnage and gamble on the outcome. Combat takes place in a ring on the ground marked by masking tape. The only rules are that biting, kicking and holds are banned, and that it is illegal to attack an opponent who is on the floor. Scroll down for video . Fight club: Two competitors go toe-to-toe in a dimly-lit arena, competing for a $40,000 prize . Impact: One contestant is left with a bloody nose as part of the underground competition - this fight was held in Wilmington, Delaware . The organization is known as Genco.tv - a nod to the owner's ambitions to stream the bouts live to an online audience, according to the News Journal. Danny Provenzano, 50, who has appeared on the Real Housewives of New Jersey, is the nephew of a New York gangster. He himself has served jail time for racketeering. He told the paper he has been organizing fights around Delaware for as many as a dozen years without alerting the authorities. But a match from this spring was filmed for an episode of investigative cable show 60 Minutes Sports, unveiling one of the brutal fights. Heads down: Then men go toe-to-toe, or closer, in the unlicensed bouts, which could attract hefty penalties should the law get involved . Fans: Spectators pay $100 a piece to get inside the bout - and from there can place wagers on fighters . Location: One of the bouts took place upstairs in this warehouse, above a car repair shop - but the building's owner isn't keen for a repeat performance . In the footage Bobby Gunn, a retired Canadian boxer, takes to the ring and walks away with $40,000 in prize money. The fighting bears some resemblance to the 1999 Brad Pitt film Fight Club. Though clearly the oft-touted 'first rule' that the club be kept an absolute secret is not adhered to. A perhaps accidental similarity is that the Delaware city where the fights now take place shares a name with Wilmington, California - which was the real-life filming location for parts of the film. Provenzano said that the bouts have been unveiled in a bid to make his enterprise legitimate. He claims to be in discussion with state authorities - though he would not say which one - to get a permit for the fights. According to Delaware state laws, any unlicensed 'combative fighting' event carries risks of prosecution for all those involved. Anyone who fights, as well promoters, organizers, judges and referees are liable, and could be hit with $1,000 fines for violations. Friendly start: Two men bump fists before doing their best to knock one another out . Unhappy finish: One brawler was left cut and bloodied after his time in the ring was over . One neighbor told the News Journal: 'It's kind of odd that you live here and don't even know something like that is going on,' she says. 'It's a problem just waiting to happen.' The fight filmed for 60 Minutes Sports was held in an empty room above Blueprint Motor Sport, a car repair shop. The owner let For his part, Blueprint's Tamar says he agreed to let the fights be held at his business after a friend called asking for a favor because the first location fell through. He says the night was more of a hassle than he anticipated with spectators having to walk through his showroom to use his bathrooms, passing Maseratis and Ferraris under the watchful eye of Tamar's employees. The owner Provenzano use the space as a favor - but says the event was so much hassle that he wouldn't agree to it again.

"CONCERNED: The Princess Royal has spoken out . The Princess Royal is demanding a crackdown on the transport of live horses from Britain to European slaughterhouses – fearing the illegal trade is causing unnecessary suffering to hundreds of animals every week. Unscrupulous dealers are getting around the ban on exporting live horses for slaughter by claiming the animals are being sent to the Continent as pets or for work or riding, when in fact they are destined for dinner plates. Some horses change hands several times and often endure horrific four-day journeys in trucks before slaughter in an Italian or French abattoir. Princess Anne, president of World Horse Welfare, called for greater checks at ports and a national database to protect vulnerable horses. She said: ‘There should be a clear understanding that horses don’t travel live to slaughter from the UK overseas and that is something we should be able to maintain and stand by.’ The charity has found dealers flouting the rules because there are no routine checks on lorries transporting horses from British ports. Princess Anne suggested that many owners who have sold a beloved horse believing it would become a cherished pet could find that the animal had instead been sold for its meat. ‘I suspect there are a lot of innocent victims who think they are selling their horses appropriately... but they are going to market where slaughter buyers do attend,’ she said. Thousands of horses are sold as meat throughout Europe. The trade came under scrutiny last year when horsemeat was found in burgers and lasagnes sold as beef in British stores. If horses are to be sold for meat, World Horse Welfare argues that they should be slaughtered in British abattoir to prevent them suffering lengthy journeys. Princess Anne, a former British eventing champion, said: ‘I really hope eventually that technology will make a difference. If we had a better form of identification it would give confidence to owners and dealers alike that they know where their horses were going.’ Thousands of unwanted horses a year are sold at UK markets such as Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire and Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire. Dealers can pick up a pony for as little as £5 but sell its meat on the continent for up to £250. A larger horse may sell for less than £75 but the meat can make £600. WELFARE: Campaigners are worried about horses enduring long lorry trips; some trips last four days . In two days last year, World Horse Welfare found 900 horses being transported through Dover alone. It is not known how many ended up slaughtered. Charity chief executive Roly Owers said: ‘We are delighted the Princess supports our campaign for more checks at British ports to prevent horses suffering long journeys and maybe not getting a humane end to their lives.’ The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We have a rigorous system of inspections and checks to make sure that horses are healthy and fit for transport. Any evidence of illegal practice in relation to the welfare of horses is investigated with a view to prosecution.’","Princess Anne fears illegal trade is causing horses 'unnecessary suffering'

"Spoken out: Mike Barton, Chief Constable for Durham Constabulary, has been flown out to Copenhagen's notorious 'shooting galleries' by the BBC as research . A senior police officer has been given a platform by the BBC to call for heroin to be given out free to drug addicts. Mike Barton, the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary, argues that heroin users should be given drugs paid for by the taxpayer to ‘take money out of drug dealers’ pockets’. He says it ‘isn’t practical’ for the police simply to arrest drug addicts and says he is ‘proud to be a social worker’ as well as a law enforcer. Mr Barton was flown to Copenhagen to make a short documentary for the programme, Inside Out. In the piece, he visits drug consumption rooms - also known as shooting galleries - where drug addicts are given free needles and can take their drugs without fear of arrest. He tells viewers: ‘We should provide the heroin, the state should provide the heroin, and we take the 600 pounds out of the drug dealers’ pocket. ‘I know there will be those in high office who will be angry at me saying this, but I don’t want to be the former Chief Constable or the retired Chief Constable who says this. ‘It’s time a serving Chief Constable spoke out.’ Last night anti-cannabis campaigners criticised his comments and attacked the BBC for commissioning the programme. Mary Brett, from Cannabis Skunk Sense, said the Chief Constable’s comments ‘beggar belief’ and were ‘condoning’ drug use. She said there were huge problems with police giving away heroin - including addicts blighting communities while hanging around waiting to be given their next fix. She also argued the criminals who currently make money from drugs would simply switch to other illegal ways of making money. Mrs Brett criticised the BBC for paying to provide a platform for Mr Barton’s views, and accused the Corporation of deliberately chasing controversy to boost ratings. In a short documentary he will look at facilities like this Swiss one that gives addicts free heroin in a controlled room . She told the Mail: ‘This is what the BBC does. The BBC just wants its controversial programmes and high profile programmes to get people to watch and listen.’ The row came amid figures showing police are already taking action against fewer people for using cannabis. In 2012, the Mail revealed how senior police had decided to adopt a ‘less robust enforcement approach’ on possession of the Class B drug. Over the course of the year to September 2013, the number of formal warnings issued for cannabis use fell from 72,171 to 65,969 - a fall of nine per cent. In 2009, almost 100,000 warnings were issued. Mrs Brett said it was the an indication the police were ‘no longer bothering’. Last year Mr Barton hit the headlines when he said the war on drugs had ‘comprehensively failed’ and compared it to failed prohibition-era efforts to ban alcohol. In the new documentary, he says only a fifth of his work is law enforcement and crime fighting, and around half is ‘concern for safety’. Anti-drugs campaigners have blasted Mr Barton's appreciation for these schemes which 'condone' drug use . ‘So when you accuse me of being a social worker I’m proud to be a social worker as well as a tough law enforcer,’ he says. He is questioned by anti-drugs author and journalist Peter Hitchens, who calls for the police to actively pursue drug users to deter them from buying and taking more drugs. ‘I’m advocating the pursuit of the possessors of drugs rather than the pursuit of the dealers of drugs,’ Mr Hitchens says. ‘If anyone is caught in possession arrested prosecuted and if found guilty they are punished in a deterrent fashion to deter them from future action and to deter other people from possessing drugs.’ But Mr Barton says there are 1,700 registered addicts in his force area and only 1,200 police officers. ‘You can’t just say to cops ‘go out there and arrest people until it stops’ because that isn’t practical.’ He adds: ‘I know what I’m saying is controversial and some politicians don’t like it.’","Durham chief constable Mike Barton flown to Denmark's 'shooting galleries'

"Emails from a secret listserv of two former Hillary Clinton aides angling to run her next presidential campaign were published online Friday, creating a yet another media headache for the 2016 frontrunner before she's even announced her candidacy. Calling themselves the 'mafia,' the list is reportedly run by Democratic operatives Robby Mook and Marlon Marshall, both of whom worked on Clinton's 2008, as a way to stay in touch with former colleagues. The colorful emails, released today by ABC News, reveal Mook calling on his friends to 'smite Republicans mafia-style' and Marshall encouraging them to 'punish those voters,' in addition to other unflattering statements. On the left is special assistant to the president and principal deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Marlon Marshall. To the right is Democratic operative Robby Mook. Today ABC News released their colorful emails, sent to a private listserv, after a confidante of the Hillary Clinton alum backstabbed them in an effort to keep them from being chosen to manage Hillary Clinton's possible 2016 presidential campaign . Mook is pictured here with President Barack Obama and other administration officials in the Oval Office on April 1, 2014 . Mook, 34, is a veteran of several high-level campaigns, including John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. In 2008 he managed several state-based operations for Clinton before she dropped out the Democratic primary before running New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's campaign. He's since worked as the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and last year he managed Clinton ally Terry McAullife's successful bid for governor of Virginia. Marshall, on the other hand, when to work for Barack Obama in 2008 after Clinton suspended his campaign, a role he resumed in in 2012, when he served as deputy national field direction of the president's reelection efforts. He's also worked in the DCCC in the past and now serves as a special assistant to the president and principal deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. In addition to Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman Guy Cecil, Mook and Marshall are considered top candidates to oversee Clinton's 2016 operations, if she runs. The best buddies were betrayed  this week by one of their own friends eyeing a job with Clinton in an attempt to hinder the duo's chances of being hired for top jobs with the Democratic star. According to ABC News, 'the person who provided the emails is, like the vast majority of those on the listserv, supportive of Hillary Clinton, but does not support the idea of Mook or Marshall holding leadership roles in a second presidential bid.' While none of the emails are especially damning, they certainly don't paint the two portray the two potential campaign managers in a positive light at times, either, and provide an unnecessary distraction from both their credentials and their candidate's. As former John McCain adviser John Weaver said on twitter today: 'The infighting to be Hillary's 1st (& 2nd) campaign manager/leader will be more negative than GOP presidential nomination fight.' Neither Mook nor Marshall responded to ABC News' request for comment. In announcing the creation of the so-called 'Mook Mafia' listserv in November 2009, an email that ABC News believes to have been written by Marshall mocks Hillary Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. 'The Mafia has finally built a bridge to the 21st century,' Marshall fictitiously qoutes Clinton as saying. 'This is even more exciting than walking through the back of the Bellagio.' In an email sent just a few months later in January of 2010, Marshall wrote: 'F U Republicans. Mafia till I die.' The same email encourages the 'mafia' clan to get on a phone from home program and make calls for then-Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha Coakley, who was competing against Republican Scott Brown to fill the late Ted Kennedy's seat. 'If you have just a few minutes, hop on that activate and punish those voters!' Marshall wrote. In 2011, when Marshall was moving to Chicago, Illinois, to take a new position, Mook announced a going away party for him and wrote, 'It's true: Marlon Marshall is leaving our fold. Today is the day the grownassman [sic] grows up and leaves for America's Second City. 'I know this prodical [sic] son will return to the mafia manger soon enough to smite Republicans mafia-style,' he added. 'If you can't be here in person, join me in spirit by sending your words of love and encouragement to the Most High Grown Ass Reverend Marlon D as he embarks on his pilgrimage. Please believe and obey the beard.' The most recent emails sent to the group, according to ABC, were last week on Election Day. One, written by Mook, includes a private comment from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 'TEAM! I was just at the DCCC last night for the GOTV [get-out-the-vote] rally, where we were in the middle of GOTV calisthenics when Nancy Pelosi walked in and said we looked like the Village People. Some things you can’t make up,' he said. The same day Marshall wrote to all their friends on campaigns 'crushing it mafia style and 'busting their tails for all that is right in the world' to tell that their annual reunion would 'be held early next year, January or February, and likely in New York for a weekend.' The location has led to increased speculation that Hillary Clinton, who lives in New York and would likely base her headquarters in the state, will formally announce her candidacy in the next two months. Hillary Clinton poses with a young fan as she takes a back door exit out of the Glamour 2014 Women Of The Year Awards at Carnegie Hall in New York on Monday. This weekend Clinton and her family are in Little Rock, Arkansas, celebrating the 10th anniversary of her husband's presidential library . Virginia Gov. McAullife, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who served as chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, told U.S. News and World Report on Thursday that he, too, believes Clinton will make an announcement soon, though the Clinton confidante professed ignorance on her intentions. 'She’s got to make that decision, and she’s got to spe, nd the next 60 days making that decision,' McAuliffe said. 'She’s going to make up her own mind,' he said, adding, 'I tell you, I hope she runs. The emails shining a light into the minds of Clinton's possible campaign hands came as alumni of the Clinton political operation, donors and friends descended on Little Rock, Arkansas, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bill Clinton's presidential library. The three-day gathering began today and features speeches from Hillary and Cheleaa Clinton tomorrow. It will be followed by a New York meeting of some of Clinton's top donors at the behest of the Ready for Hilary Super PAC that has been organizing support for a Hillary 2016 campaign for the past year and a half, per a report from MSNBC. Hillary Clinton herself has acknowledged that she is considering another presidential campaign and she will make her decision known sometime next year. Democrats are becoming more and more anxious for her to go public sooner rather than later, however, so that other Democratic hopefuls can get a jump on fundraising if she does decide to bow out. A handful of their Republican competitors have been quietly building up their campaign operations for months and could begin officially launching their campaigns any day now.","Calling themselves the 'mafia,' the list is reportedly run by Hillary Clinton 2008 alums Robby Mook and Marlon Marshall .

"Modern England comes as a shock to most Westminster persons. The former Tory MP Matthew Parris was so appalled when he visited Clacton that the resulting article was used in Ukip propaganda in the by-election there. Mr Parris appeared to be looking down a very long nose indeed at that town’s people and their lives. It didn’t seem to cross his mind that he – as a politician, broadcaster and influential journalist – might have helped to make it like that. At first glance, Rochester is not much like Clacton. It is an ancient cathedral city you might have glimpsed and wondered about as you took the Eurostar to Paris, or the M2 to Dover, and saw its Norman keep and ancient spire in the middle distance. Its High Street is a glory of old-fashioned Englishness, a chapter from Charles Dickens in brick, stone, timber and plaster. Almost every enterprise is named after a Dickens character. At this time of year, when the dusk begins to fall quite early, and the yellow lights come on behind the small panes of glass, it is so moving and evocative I almost stopped breathing at the sight of it. BYGONE AGE: The town of Rochester looks like something out of a Dickens novel . But then Dickens and his books are real to me. The place must be as mysterious as Japan to most modern English people, for whom Dickens is a firmly closed book. It is also, like so much of picturesque England, a museum where you can buy and eat the exhibits. Strood lacks these luxuries. While Rochester is marinated in history and literature, Strood is just there, an unremarkable place where the English have lived in reasonable prosperity and freedom for centuries. It is possible Dickens was thinking of Strood when he named his last, unfinished book The Mystery Of Edwin Drood (which rhymes with Strood). But he actually set it in Rochester. It certainly has a past. Its people must have seen the smoke and heard the guns in 1667 as the Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway to nearby Chatham and burned or seized the pride of the British Navy, a national humiliation now almost completely forgotten, but once considered a grave warning to any British government which neglected the Navy, as Charles II did then and we are doing now. Cross the now-peaceful Medway to Strood and you are in the real world of fast food, cut-price supermarkets, charity shops, a pound store, amazing numbers of hairdressers (does Britain have enough hair to go round all these establishments?) the usual riot of architecture-free concrete shops, anti-pedestrian fencing and wide, fast highways whose pelican crossings are so slow to change that you could easily forget why you wanted to cross the road in the first place. This is just standard semi-urban southern England, a few ghostly older buildings surviving amid the post-1960s modernisation which turned so much of the country into a pallid and unsuccessful copy of the less appealing parts of the USA, with a hint of East Berlin thrown in. In Rochester, the Ukip office had been full of optimism and busy-ness. People were coming up to Ukip candidate Mark Reckless in the street to offer encouragement. But in Strood, despite the autumn sunlight, I found a curious angry apathy. A few weeks ago, in Scotland, everyone I spoke to about the referendum had an articulate opinion on ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. All planned to vote, none resented the process. CAMPAIGNING: In Rochester, the Ukip office had been full of optimism and busy-ness. People were coming up to Ukip candidate Mark Reckless in the street to offer encouragement . In Strood, my wholly unreliable and unscientific sample was the polar opposite. They were a very English sample – not a Pole or a Somali to be seen. After a while I began to dread asking anyone his views, and to wonder if I was the victim of an elaborate trick, and they were all actors hired by Downing Street to confuse me. Almost everyone I talked to in Strood (I took up station close to KFC and not far from Morrisons) was disillusioned to the point of cynicism. I can’t disapprove of this on principle. I am a hardened non-voter, and can’t remember when I last bothered to cast a ballot in the safe Labour seat where I dwell. But if I lived in Rochester or Strood I should certainly vote next week, because it seems to me, on this rare occasion, it would make a difference. If the Tories can’t hold Rochester, politics in this country will change deeply and forever. If they do hold it, politics in this country will remain the same. That’s quite an incentive to vote – whatever way you feel. I’m still amazed by the Prime Minister’s direct appeal to Labour supporters to vote Tory, which they are as likely to do as they are likely to tandoori and eat their grannies. But in many cases, this is a crossroads that ordinary human beings aren’t even interested in visiting. People told me they were sick of immigration, sick of low wages, sick of false promises. I said that in that case Ukip was their ideal party, but they said that no, it wasn’t. They had heard of it. They knew what it was, but they didn’t trust it. Some thought the whole election was a waste of money. Others were just hopelessly confused, the most perplexed being an enthusiastic Green Party supporter who suddenly launched into a diatribe of dislike against Eastern Europeans. UNCHANGED: Its High Street is a glory of old-fashioned Englishness, a chapter from Charles Dickens in brick, stone, timber and plaster; Almost every enterprise is named after a Dickens character . It was a reminder that, for many people, politics is as baffling, distant, pointless and uninteresting as sport is to me. Now, I respect opinion polls. They are generally right, provided you read them carefully and remember that they are a device for influencing opinion much more than a way of measuring it. And I respect the judgment of political professionals on the spot, whose unvarying view is that the Tories are not doing well in Rochester and Strood. So I expect Ukip will win, not least because I personally will be glad if they do. I am amazed it has taken so long for ordinary Tory supporters to see through their party and particularly through David Cameron, an unusually transparent snake-oil salesman, even for these times. But the polls can’t really cope with the kind of people I talked to in Strood. These are the great unmoved, the people who neither speak nor vote – the biggest political party in Britain, if anyone could mobilise them. I am surprised that they remain unstirred. Yet others are stirred. If Ukip win on Thursday, it will be first because the Tory circle cannot be squared. The Tories cannot win new voters without driving away just as many old ones. And they cannot shake off the hatred which clings to them from the Thatcher years. Second, it will be because those who pinned false hopes on Margaret Thatcher in 1979, and then pinned equally false hopes on Anthony Blair in 1997, are turning once again to someone who looks and sounds as if he knows what to do about a country in deep trouble. If that is so, then next May’s General Election will mark the boundary between the long, settled Labour-Tory era and a new period of groping and uncertainty. Political parties take a long time to die, and they can still kick and bite quite hard while they are expiring. Rochester and Strood won’t mark the end of this long process, but it might well accelerate it quite sharply. I daren’t go further than that. I have no great expectations. But as all readers of Dickens know, such expectations can turn out to be deeply misleading, or worse.","Those living in Rochester and Stood urged to vote to make a difference .

"A Romanian scrap yard worker has provoked fury by claiming it is his 'right' to move his family to Britain so he can claim up to £25,000 of benefits. Father-of-five Nicu Popescu, 30, moved to Birmingham from Bucharest two years ago and says he now plans to bring over his wife and children in order to top up his low income and take advantage of its easy handouts. His plans have been widely condemned by MPs as an 'abuse' of Britain's weak benefits system and an example of why immigration routes should be tightened. Scrapyard worker Nicu Popescu (pictured) claims British benefits will top up his low income . Mr Popescu said the benefits in Britain were significantly better than Romania and he hoped his family would be given a three or four bedroom house once they arrived, the Daily Express reported. 'In Romania the healthcare is very bad and here they offer you free treatment. It will be a dream new start for my family. 'It's my right to claim benefits.' His unashamed plans to take advantage of the country's soft benefits system provoked outrage as commentators claim Britain has become a 'holy grail' for immigrants because of its generous handouts. Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the Popescu family's attitude epitomised Eastern European attitudes towards Britain and showed how its system was open to abuse. Many are waiting to see what effect a landmark European Court ruling will have on preventing benefit tourism. Five days ago European judges gave Britain the green light to block welfare claims from European Union nationals - stating jobless migrants cannout move around the continent living off state handouts and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves. Pictured is Mr Popescu's family, including his wife Luliana, with their children from left Hagi, 11, Peter, 7, and Marta, 5 . There were 38,580 migrants from the EU claiming Jobseekers Allowance in the UK in February this year . The decision was ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers. It is believed the ruling will provide a basis in European law that can reinforce reform attempts in Britain. David Cameron has heralded the ruling. He said: 'This is good news and a step in the right direction. The right to go and work in another European country should not be an unqualified right. There should be rules about restricting benefits.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is an excellent ruling and supports our view that people coming to the UK who don’t have sufficient resources to support themselves and would become a unreasonable burden should not be able to access national welfare systems. ‘The case underlines that free movement is not an unqualified right and will have a major impact on the way the Commission interprets law in future.’ EU migrants who come to Britain are banned from claiming jobseekers’ allowance for the first three months they are here. For the subsequent six months they are allowed to claim, if they can prove they are actively looking for work – although this is to be reduced to three months. After that, they must produce compelling evidence they are going to get work or they can be refused benefits. In January, ministers announced they were banning jobless migrants from claiming housing benefit.","Nicu Popescu wants to move his family to Britain to claim £25k in benefits .

"Life may really be out there. Astronomers have found the first evidence of habitable planets outside our own solar system. The discovery of the shattered remains of an asteroid which once contained huge amounts of water - crucial for life - has left scientists ‘incredibly excited’. It suggests that hundreds of millions of years ago, the distant system may have harboured Earth-like planets. An artist's impression shows a rocky and water-rich asteroid being torn apart by the strong gravity of the white dwarf star GD 61.She shattered remains of the asteroid have been discovered 150 million light years from Earth . But any potential inhabitants would be long since left the region - either extinct or mastering space travel - as their sun blew up and then collapsed into a ‘white dwarf’. Now all that remains are rocky bodies orbiting the dead star. Scientists believe it is a glimpse into the distant future of our own corner of the universe, after the Sun finally burns out. But there is no need for alarm - the end is still several billion years away. Professor Boris Gänsicke of the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick said: ‘It is the first time we have found a rocky body that also contains water outside our solar system. ‘Those two ingredients - a rocky surface and water - are key in the hunt for habitable planets outside our solar system, so it’s very exciting to find them together outside our solar system. ‘What this means is that we have the . building blocks of what makes planets like Earth.’ He said it was too . early to speculate if the region supported alien life, and that if it . had existed, it would be long departed following the collapse of the . sun. The images, captured by the Hubble space telescope, are said to give a glimpse into the distant future of our own corner of the universe, after the Sun finally burns out . ‘At this stage in its . existence, all that remains of this rocky body is simply dust and debris . that has been pulled into the orbit of its dying parent star,’ he said. ‘However . this planetary graveyard swirling around the embers of its parent star . is a rich source of information about its former life. In these remnants . lie chemical clues which point towards a previous existence as a . water-rich terrestrial body.’ The research, which appears in the journal Science and was made using Nasa’s Hubble telescope, looked at the light emitted by GD 61. The region located 150 light years away from the Earth. Astronomers detected an abundance of . ‘rocky’ elements such as magnesium, silicon and iron, and also found . oxygen in quantities that indicated a large amounts of water. Only a water-rich massive asteroid, or minor planet, can explain the observations, they claimed. The discovery suggests that hundreds of millions of years ago, the distant system may have harboured Earth-like planets . Earth is essentially a ‘dry’ planet, with only 0.02 per cent of its mass made up of surface water. Our oceans only formed after the planet was formed, likely a result of water-rich asteroids or comets crashed into us. The latest findings suggest something similar could have happened in this distant solar system. Lead author Jay Farihi, from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, said: ‘The finding of water in a large asteroid means the building blocks of habitable planets existed - and maybe still exist - in the GD 61 system, and likely also around substantial number of similar parent stars. ‘These water-rich building blocks, and the terrestrial planets they build, may in fact be common - a system cannot create things as big as asteroids and avoid building planets, and GD 61 had the ingredients to deliver lots of water to their surfaces. Under the weather: Kepler-7b is the first exoplanet to have its clouds mapped. ‘Our results demonstrate that there was definitely potential for habitable planets in this exoplanetary system.’ Scientists believe that the universe could be teeming with planets that are able to support life. Latest NASA estimates suggest that there could be as many as 60 million habitable planets. Data taken from the Kepler telescope, which has spent several years exploring exoplanets outside of the solar system, had suggested that there could be at least one planet that is capable of supporting life close to each red dwarf. But that theory has since been revised as NASA scientists now also believe that cloud cover could potentially help a planet support life. In order for life to occur on a planet, it needs to be within the habitable zone of a star - that is close enough for water on its surface to stay in its liquid form. The great beyond: NASA have discovered dozens of exoplanets, including the extremely hot WASP-12b and its host star, pictured. But this is the first time that they have found the basic ingredients for a habitable planet . If a planet is too close to its star, the water vapourises as it is too hot. But if it is too far away, the water freezes. Thanks to exploration from telescopes such as Kepler and the Spitzer telescope, scientists' knowledge of planets outside our solar system is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Last week NASA released the first ever map of cloud cover on an exoplanet - Kepler-7b. The image offered a first look at clouds on hot Jupiter-like planet Kepler-7b which is some 1,000 light-years away from the Earth. The Kepler telescope has discovered more than 150 confirmed planets outside the solar system. The telescope's problematic reaction wheels prevent it from hunting planets any more, but astronomers continue to pore over almost four years' worth of collected data from the planets already discovered. It is hoped that the same cloud-mapping techniques can be used to observe smaller Earth-like worlds.","Shattered remains of asteroid discovered 150 light years away from the Earth .

"Scam: Jamie Winter outside Hull Crown Court, where she pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud after administering botox when lying about her qualifications . A beautician was sentenced to 150 hours’ community work yesterday for lying to Botox clients that she qualified at Harley Street. Customers thought they were getting a bargain price at £90 a session but in reality Jamie Winter was using cheap Botox that she had bought on the internet. To reassure some she showed them a certificate which they believed proved her credentials. Hull Crown Court heard the cosmetic fillers industry is still unregulated and Winter was not breaking the law by giving the injections – her offence was fraud for misleading her clients that she was qualified to do so. She was exposed when one woman, who complained of a bad reaction, went to police. An assault charge relating to this client was dropped as it could not be proved the Botox caused her swelling. Winter, 35, pleaded guilty to five fraud offences relating to treating ten women and two men in the Scarborough area over 18 months, for which she was paid £1,000 in total. Judge Simon Jack said she would have faced prison had she caused her clients damage. Assault charges, relating to the woman who suffered swelling around her eyes after injections, were dropped because the Crown ‘couldn’t prove’ the reaction was caused by the Botox treatment. Outside court she said she got the Botox through a supplier in the US and had done some training ‘online’. ‘It’s not a regulated industry,’ she said. ‘I would never have done the treatment if it was illegal.’ She said she is currently working as a beautician doing eyebrow treatments. Judge Simon Jack told her she would have been facing prison had her work caused damage to her clients, who she visited at their homes in the Scarborough area. He said the potential consequences of her actions were ‘serious’. He added: ‘Having Botox injected into you is something most people would want done by a qualified and experienced practitioner.’ The charges she admitted to involved payments for the anti-wrinkle treatments totalling around £1,000. Her clients ran up bills ranging from £180 to £360 and word spread around the locality about the cut-price service she was offering. Guilty: Judge Simon Jack, sitting at Hull Crown Court, pictured, told Winter that she would have been facing a prison sentence had her work caused damage to her clients . Richard Thompson, defending, told the court the case involved an industry that was ‘not regulated at all’. He said Winter gained experience by carrying out treatments on herself and then on friends. ‘She provided a service at a lower price than one would ordinarily expect to pay but people were not told the truth about her experience,’ he added. Publicity surrounding the case forced her to move away from Scarborough, the court heard. Previously just a celebrity luxury, there has been a surge in the rise in popularity of Botox, with the most recently available statistics showing there were 370,000 Botox injections administered in 2010. But this has also led to a rise in patients suffering from disfiguring side effects. Earlier this year, the EU published a draft guideline advising that injections should be carried out by doctors, dentists and prescribing nurses in designated treatment rooms in a bid to cut down on cowboy practices.","Jamie Winter, 35, bought Botox online and charged £90 a session .

"Killer: Dano Sonnex was found guilty of murdering two French students while at large despite having been recalled to jail . More than 400 wanted criminals, including murderers, paedophiles and rapists, have been at large in Britain for more than five years. The dangerous offenders should have been returned to prison after committing fresh crimes or breaking the rules of their early release. But they have evaded the police and are instead walking the streets. Critics said the criminals posed a ‘tremendous risk’ to the public. A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that 413 offenders ‘unlawfully at large’ at the end of last year had been wanted for more than five years. They included 48 violent offenders, comprising 13 convicted murderers, one other killer, three who attempted to kill, 17 guilty of wounding or other serious assaults and 14 of lower level violent crimes. Nine were guilty of rape, three of gross indecency with children and 11 of other sexual offences. The total also included 37 robbers, 44 convicted burglars and 97 drugs offenders. Thirty-seven were thieves or were caught handling stolen goods and there were 66 fraudsters. The remainder committed motoring or unclassified crimes. The criminals came from across England and Wales, with more than 200 on the Metropolitan Police’s list and 41 wanted by the West Midlands force. The extent of the problem emerged in 2009 when the Labour Government released numbers of offenders thought to be ‘unlawfully at large’. But the new figures will raise concerns that police officers are failing to get to grips with the issue. Peter Cuthbertson, chief executive of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘These shocking figures suggest that we should scale back the release on licence of serious offenders. ‘Too many dangerous criminals are taking it as an opportunity to escape and avoid justice for years. Public safety should come first. ‘Releasing so many killers and sex offenders on licence puts the public at tremendous risk. ‘Every year, a certain number abscond, wasting police time capturing them – or worse, they remain at large. Keeping serious offenders behind bars is important both for justice and for protecting the public.’ Recall: More than 400 criminals who should have been returned to prison after committing fresh crimes or breaking early release rules have been on the run for more than five years . In the most serious cases, police should return the individuals to custody within three days in a process known as ‘emergency recall’. With less dangerous cases they have up to six days. But the figures show a number of the offenders have been missing for a long time. Most cases are from the last 14 years, but 21 go back to between 1984 and 1999. Allowing recalled prisoners to remain at large can have disastrous consequences. In 2009 Dano Sonnex was convicted of the murder of two French students, Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, in south-east London. It emerged during his trial that he was at large despite having been recalled to jail. In the past, police forces have refused to name the individuals they are searching for, citing data protection. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the authorities were working ‘tirelessly’ to track the offenders down. ‘Over the last ten years, more than 99 per cent of offenders recalled to custody have been successfully returned to prison,’ he said. ‘Public protection is our priority and the authorities will tirelessly pursue such cases to help ensure these offenders are brought to justice. ‘Where an offender has died we are unable to remove them from the list until we receive a death certificate. Where an offender has fled the country, every effort is made to return them to face justice.’","13 murderers, nine rapists and 17 people guilty of wounding at large .

"IT provides us with instant answers to almost any question imaginable. But our reliance on Google for fact-checking and finding basic information has made us forgetful, say scientists. It was also found that many individuals view internet search engines as an extension of their own intelligence, rather than a separate tool. As a result they still regard themselves as being clever even when they need the internet to find answers. Our growing reliance on the Internet for fact-checking and other basic information has resulted in growing levels of forgetfulness, according to scientists . In a series of tests, researchers found that participants were more likely to recall information if they believed it had been erased from a computer. Those who thought it was stored were more forgetful, even if explicitly asked to keep the information in mind. In another experiment, the Harvard University team asked students to answer trivia questions with or without Google, and then asked them to rate their own intelligence. They found those who used the internet had a significantly higher view of their own brain power, even compared with individuals who got the questions right through their own knowledge. ‘Using Google gives people the sense that the internet has become part of their own cognitive tool set,’ the Harvard University researchers concluded. And rather than sharing information, people are more likely to save it electronically if they want future access to it, rather than relying on someone else’s memory, the researchers found. Psychologists Daniel Wegner and Adrian Ward, wrote in the journal Scientific American: ‘Our work suggests that we treat the internet much like a human transactive memory partner [a person we share personal details with]. 'We off-load memories to “the cloud” just as readily as we would to a family member, friend or lover.’‘It seems that the propensity for off-loading information to digital sources is so strong that people are often unable to fix details in their own thoughts when in the presence of a cyberbuddy,’ the researchers added. 'They said that having the internet ‘undermines the impulse to ensure that some important facts get inscribed into our biological memory banks’.

"Deformed: Isabel Gonzalez, pictured, was butchered by the facial injections that were supposed to make her look radiant . A Florida woman's dream of looking younger turned into a nightmare recently when she was left deformed after a trip to the day spa. Isabel Gonzalez, of East Fort Lauderdale, paid $890 for 'facial rejuvenation' injections at Viviana's Body Secrets Spa in Doral, Florida. But she walked out with her face swollen, itchy and infected. The Miami-Dade Health Department shut down the business on Thursday and arrested its owner Edna Viviana Ayala. The 39-year-old has been slapped her with a raft of charges including practicing medicine without a license. Gonzalez told police that on July 1 Ayala gave her vitamin injections in between her eyebrows, on the corners of her lips and on both sides of her lower chin. But when she hadn't noticed any change two weeks later, she called Ayala who gave her a another round of injections. This time the unlicensed beautician used a thicker needle, NBC Miami reported. Soon after the second procedure, her face turned bright red, swollen and itchy and a painful infection developed. According to police, Ayala brought medications to Gonzalez's house and also brought her to a doctor for treatment. But the spa owner soon stopped answering the woman's calls or returning her messages. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Injections: Gonzalez, pictured, was told the injections would make her look younger .

'At no time did Ms Ayala ever use or inject any substance whatsoever, including vitamins into Ms Gonzalez,' Milena Abreu told NBC. Viviana's Body Secrets Spa website is still up and running, and includes video demonstrations of Alaya massaging clients and performing other treatments. The site boasts: 'We offer numerous facial and body treatments that will bring a smile to your face, when you see and feel the results. Your love ones will definitely notice a difference in you.' View more videos at: http://nbcmiami.com. Vitamin injections have become increasingly popular and last year Simon Cowell admitted to taking an intravenous cocktail of vitamins C, B12 and magnesium to make him look and feel young. According to the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery vitamin jabs for the face usually feature a mixture of vitamins and amino acids. Placenta extracts and organic silicon can also be added. The aim of vitamin jabs is to replace the minerals,vitamins and amino acids that decrease in the skin with aging. It is said that they help maintain firmness and reduce lines and wrinkles . The shot is injected into selected areas beneath the surface of the skin and each treatment takes up to 20 minutes. For those who experience pain, a local anesthetic cream can be applied. The results are not permanent, and many patients are instructed to return for injections every three months. Risks include allergic reactions and bruising.","Isabel Gonzalez's face left red, swollen and infected after brutal 'facial rejuvenation' injections .

"Single-parent families are now so common that couples living with their children are the minority in some parts of the country. Data shows there are seven Parliamentary constituencies where single-parent families make up the majority of households. There are close to 2million single-parent families in the UK and we have the highest proportion of children brought up in one-parent families of any major European country. Single parent families make up the majority in some of the country's biggest cities, including London, Manchester and Birmingham . The seven areas where single-parent families are the majority are in the urban hearts of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. In one constituency, Lewisham Deptford, 58 per cent of households with children are headed by lone parents. At the other end of the spectrum, in the rural district of South Northamptonshire just one in every 20 family units is headed by a single parent. The figures, from a Freedom of Information request to the Office for National Statistics, were greeted with concern yesterday. Jill Kirby, a social policy expert and former director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘Children need input from both parents in order to thrive. ‘Research shows children growing up in fatherless homes are much less likely to do well at school and are at twice the risk of getting into problems with drink or drugs, or involved in crime. The UK welfare system has been partly to blame, by providing a substitute breadwinner rather than encouraging parents to stick together.’ Two years ago a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents industrialised nations, exposed Britain’s shocking record on broken homes. It found we have more children living in one-parent families than any other European country and more of our single mothers are unemployed and on benefit than anywhere else on the Continent. The study revealed 23 per cent of British children up to the age of 14 live in single-parent families, behind the US on 26 per cent. And 48 per cent of single mothers in Britain are unemployed, the highest rate in the OECD apart from Turkey. Britain's broken families . The Parliamentary constituency with the highest proportion of lone-parent families is Lewisham Deptford in South East London, which includes such places as New Cross, Brockley and Honor Oak. There are around 8,000 lone-parent families in the seat – represented by hard-left Labour MP Joan Ruddock – making up 58 per cent of the total. Next comes Lewisham East and Liverpool Riverside, both on 56 per cent. Manchester Central and Vauxhall are on 54 per cent, while Birmingham Ladywood and Leeds Central are on 53 per cent. The area where children are most likely to live with two parents is South Northamptonshire, which covers small towns such as Brackley and Towcester. Just 5 per cent of families in the seat, represented by the Tory Andrea Leadsom, are headed by a lone parent. North East Hampshire and Wycombe are next on 7 per cent, while Devizes and South Norfolk are on 8 per cent.","Seven constituencies in the country constitute more single-parent families than couples .

"Sophie Brannan died after she was knocked down in a hit-and-run in Glasgow yesterday evening . An 11-year-old girl has died after she and her friend, 10, were making their way back from the shops and hit by a car, which sped off. Sophie Brannan was hit by a black Vauxhall Astra in the Maryhill area of Glasgow when it mounted the pavement yesterday evening. She had been visiting the nearby shops with her 10-year-old friend and her friend's uncle, who were also mowed down, and rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill in Glasgow. The driver did not stop at the scene at about 7.40pm on Friday, but the car was later found abandoned in a street close-by. Sophie died today in hospital, where her friend, who suffered serious head and leg injuries, remains. The 36-year-old man is still being treated at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. Detective Inspector Colin Hailstones said:  'This was an horrific incident. Sophie, her friend and her friend's uncle, had been out to the local shops when the incident happened. 'Sandbank Street and Maryhill Road are very busy and there were a lot of people about - many of whom tried to help at the scene. 'We have spoken to them and a number of people who were in the area and are currently checking CCTV to identify the person responsible for this dreadful incident which has left her family devastated.' He added that the driver of the car was described as white, aged between 25 and 35, of medium build and with short shaven hair. DI Hailstones added: 'He was wearing a dark coloured jacket, dark denims and white trainers and was last seen running off towards the canal path after abandoning the car in Lochburn Street. 'Somebody out there knows who this person is and I would appeal to them to contact police regarding his whereabouts. 'I would also say to the man himself to hand himself in - it's only a matter of time before we track him down.' Detectives and specialist road policing officers are continuing to carry out extensive enquiries, while the road remained closed for most of the day. Police are urging anyone who may have been travelling in the area at the time or who may have witnessed the incident to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 anonymously. Sophie had gone to the shop with her 10-year-old friend and her friend's uncle in Maryhill area of Glasgow when all three were struck down by the car after it mounted the pavement on Friday evening .

"She's the flame-haired make-up artist who is credited with transforming the likes of Penelope Cruz, Millie Mackintosh and Cara Delevingne. So it's fair to say that Charlotte Tilbury, who is Kate Moss' go-to make-up artist and best friend, knows a thing or two about beauty. The make-up maestro, who has created the looks for the glossiest of Vogue covers and starriest red carpets, has released a short tutorial for her mature fans called 'a youth-boosting, naturally glamorous make-up for the 60 plus woman'. Makeover: Charlotte Tilbury, right, has created a tutorial on how to achieve a youthful look for over 60s - and called on her 65-year-old mother Patsy, left, to help. Here is the finished look . With a little help from her 65-year-old mother Patsy, Charlotte provides a step-by-step guide to creating a youthful look. 'Women who don't make the effort and stop wearing make-up literally age overnight,' explains Charlotte as she whips out an arsenal of her best products to use on her mother. Charlotte preps Patsy's skin with her 'magic cream', which she describes as a secret mix of patented anti-age ingredients, a hyaluronic acid booster plus floral extracts that lift and transform the skin. As she applies a primer and foundation, she explains that her products are packed with retinol, which is extremely important for over 60s skin. 'It's really youth boosting and plumps the skin up and makes it look really glowing. That's what you lose as you get older. 'And as we know, too much sun ruins your skin, it's beauty suicide,' she explains. She then uses a retouching pen to take out any age spots, unwanted freckles and blemishes before sweeping powder over the skin and creating a defined brow. 'The brow defines the face, it's the pillar of it,' she says before using an eyebrow pencil she created with the help of good friend and client Cara Delevingne. Youth boost: 'Women who don't make the effort and stop wearing make-up literally age overnight,' explains Charlotte as she whips out an arsenal of her best products to use on her mother . 'Cara really brought back the brow,' she adds before telling her mother how important eyelash curlers are for opening up the eyes. Charlotte then uses a smudger brush to create a soft smokey eye inspired by the 'golden goddesses of Ibiza' and adds a subtle slick of eyeliner and lots of coats of mascara. 'Pop bronzer onto your forehead and onto your cheekbones as the sun would naturally hit you and some highlighter onto the C-section of skin, which paints a sort of candle light onto the skin,' she says. Before and after: Charlotte's mother Patsy was treated to a 'glamorous goddess' makeover, which she often recreates on Kate Moss and supermodel Gisele . Charlotte also emphasises the power of lipstick. Patsy muses: 'If I was . stranded on a desert island, I would want a lifetime supply of lipstick . to look glamorous when I was rescued.' 'As you get older, your lips shrink and your face begins to collapse,' says Charlotte as she shapes Patty's lips with lipliner and shades it with a natural pink hue. The final stages involve blushing your cheek in what Charlotte calls a 'swish and pop' movement before defining your jaw line with powder. Friends in high places: Charlotte recently gave Wolf Of Wall Street star Margot Robbie a makeover for an event at Buckingham Palace . 'This . is a golden goddess look I would use on Gisele and Kate Moss,' says Charlotte. 'It's designed for 17-70-year-olds and proves that by . using modern, pretty colours, it instantly makes you look younger and . softens you.' Charlotte, 40, has been working as a make-up artist for 20 years and is regularly called on by the likes of Adele and J-Lo to help them get red carpet-ready. Most recently, she made over Sienna Miller and Cara Delevingne, as well as Kate Moss, for the supermodel's Topshop launch party and gave Poppy Delevingne her wedding look. Best pals: Charlotte created Kate Moss' look for her Topshop launch party - and even created a lipstick in her honour .

"Armed police in Germany launched a terrifying raid on a family's home to seize their four children after they defied the country's ban on home schooling. A team of 20 social workers, police officers, and special agents stormed the home of Dirk and Petra Wunderlich because they refused to send their children to state schools. The youngsters were taken to unknown locations after officials allegedly ominously promised the parents that they would not be seeing them again 'any time soon'. Seized by the state: The Wunderlich family with Mike Farris, chairman of the Home Schooling Legal Defense Association. The children aged seven to 14 were taken away after their parents defied a ban on homeschooling . The only legal grounds for the removal of the children, aged from seven to 14, were the family's insistence on home schooling their children, with no other allegations of abuse or neglect. According to court documents obtained and translated by the Home Schooling Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), officials did not even allege that the parents had failed to provide an adequate education. The raid took place on Thursday morning at 8am at the Wunderlichs' home near Darmstadt, 25 miles south of Frankfurt, in south-west Germany. Citing the parents’ failure to cooperate 'with the authorities to send the children to school', the judge even authorised the use of force 'against the children' if necessary, according to court documents cited by the HSLDA. Describing the moment police arrived at his home, Mr Wunderlich said: 'I looked through a window and saw many people, police, and special agents, all armed. 'They told me they wanted to come in to speak with me. Attack: Social workers, police officers, and special agents stormed the home of Dirk and Petra Wunderlich in Darmstadt after they refused to send their children to state schools (file photo) 'I tried to ask questions, but within seconds, three police officers brought a battering ram and were about to break the door in, so I opened it.' He went on: 'The police shoved me into a chair and wouldn’t let me even make a phone call at first. 'It was chaotic as they told me they had an order to take the children. At my slightest movement the agents would grab me, as if I were a terrorist. 'You would never expect anything like this to happen in our calm, peaceful village. It was like a scene out of a science fiction movie. 'Our neighbours and children have been traumatised by this invasion.' The Wunderlichs have, over the past four years, moved from country to country in the European Union looking for a place to where they could freely homeschool their children. Although they found refuge from homeschool persecution in France, Mr Wunderlich was unable to find work, and last year the family had to return to Germany. Within days of the family registering their presence in Darmstadt, authorities initiated a criminal truancy case, and just months later city's 'Youth Welfare Office' was granted legal custody of the children. They were allowed to remain with their parents after it was judged that they were being well treated, but authorities seized the youngsters' passports to stop them again leaving the country. Mr Wunderlich said that he and his wife had been left devastated by the authorities' decision to take their children. He said that his 14-year-old daughter Machsejah had to be forcibly taken out of the home. 'When I went outside, our neighbour was crying as she watched. I turned around to see my daughter being escorted as if she were a criminal by two big policemen,' he said. 'They weren’t being nice at all. When my wife tried to give my daughter a kiss and a hug goodbye, one of the special agents roughly elbowed her out of the way and said — ""It’s too late for that"". 'What kind of government acts like this?' Mrs Wunderlich said her heart was 'shattered'. 'We are empty. We need help. We are fighting, but we need help,' she said. Mike Donnelly, HSLDA's director for international affairs, accused German authorities of acting in a way reminiscent of a 'darker time' in the country's history. 'My question to the political leadership of Germany is: How long will you permit these kinds of brutal acts to be perpetrated against German families?' he said. 'Why is it so important to you to force people into your state schools? The echo of this act rings from a darker time in German history. 'When will leaders stand up and make changes so that brutality to children like the Wunderlichs no longer happens because of homeschooling? 'Isn’t there any German statesman willing to stand up for what is right anywhere in Germany?' No German officials were available to comment on the case.","Youngsters aged from seven to 14 taken from their home in Darmstadt .

"It's the one topic Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been trying to steer well away from during this weekend's G20 summit. But with temperatures in Brisbane set to hit a scorching 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit) it seems that the topic of climate change will be unavoidable. World leaders and their staffers will be forced to put up with the near-record heat, but police are especially worried about how the sweltering weather will affect protesters and the thousands of police manning the city streets on Sunday. Scroll down for video . President of the Peoples Republic of China H.E. Xi Jinping (left), Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott (centre) and  United States' President Barack Obama (right) at Parliament House . Protesters including this 'bikini reporter' have gone to extreme lengths to stay cool over the hot weekend, with temperatures hitting 32.2 degrees Celsius on Saturday and expected to exceed 40 degrees on Sunday . Police and members of the public hold water bottles to their necks and use fans to help stay cool . Deputy Commissioner Ross Barnett said police had a comprehensive plan to make sure they were kept well hydrated. 'We'll just have to manage that as best we can, but we certainly could have done without a 40 degree day,' Mr Barnett said. The heat wave is being driven by northwesterly winds, which could also pose a problem for firefighters who are battling a number of blazes across the state. Brisbane's November record of 41.2 degrees dates back to 1913. Sunday's temperature is expected to fall just short of that. This comes after U.S. President Barack Obama gave a landmark speech at the G20 Summit on Saturday where he called for immediate action on climate change.

Temperatures are set to hit near-record levels of 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday . Some members of the public chose to stay hydrated by eating ice blocks . Mr Obama piled pressure on the Abbott government to act on emissions, declaring that natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef were under direct threat from climate change. The U.S. President said today that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena. 'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit,' he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause. 'I want that there 50 years from now.' While the Australian government has attempted to keep the focus of the Asia-Pacific leaders' summit on economic growth and jobs, Mr Obama steered the focus back to climate change, following a historic U.S. deal with China to slash emissions. While Australia has not made climate change a formal part of the 2014 G20 agenda, the final communique is expected to call on leaders to make clear their new carbon emission reduction targets before the Paris climate summit in December 2015. Protesters march through the streets of Brisbane on Saturday . Police are especially worried about how the sweltering weather will affect protesters and the thousands of officers manning the Brisbane city streets on Sunday . British Prime Minister David Cameron also urged Mr Abbott to take out more insurance against climate change even if he doesn't believe in the threat. Mr Cameron told Britain's Sky News on Saturday that at the next climate change talks in Paris every country had to bring something more to the table. 'But obviously countries that have so far done the least need to think about what more they can do and I've had good and friendly conversations with Prime Minister Abbott about that.' When asked if Mr Abbott's scrapping of the carbon tax and cuts to renewable energy went against the trend of climate change action, Mr Cameron said Australia had set a cut in carbon emissions of some 5 per cent. He said the Australian government saw that as an actual cut of 19 per cent if Australia had carried on with business as usual. Mr Obama addresses an audience at the University of Queensland on Saturday . Mr Abbott greets United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron at Parliament House in Brisbane . 'I hope they'll do everything they can in the coming months to look at what more they can deliver because when it comes to Paris, if you want to get a global agreement, everyone's going to have to bring something to the table.' Mr Cameron said it made sense to insure against climate change. 'I always say, think about it like insurance, even if you don't believe in the nature of this threat, isn't it better to insure against it? 'You might think there's only a 10 per cent chance of your house burning down but even if it's that percentage chance wouldn't you do something to try and make sure you can save your world, your environment for your children and your grandchildren?' Mr Cameron said he had already had that conversation with Mr Abbott.","Weather in Brisbane to hit  41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit)

"'Buy fewer clothes' is hardly the cri de coeur you'd expect from a woman who has made her name - and her career - from selling them. But today Dame Vivienne Westwood made exactly that extraordinary plea - and directed it particularly at 'poor people'. The eccentric designer sat among celebrities and fashion journalists in the front row for her s/s14 show at the German Gymnasium in north London, instead of waiting backstage as usual. It meant she had pride of place for the dramatic opening, which saw supermodel Lily Cole performing an interpretative dance while wearing a flowing, Grecian-style gown. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Dame Vivienne Westwood advised people to buy less clothes at her Red Label show during London Fashion Week SS14 yesterday . Speaking after the show, Dame Vivienne pleaded: 'Buy less. Choose well. Make it last. Quality, not quantity. Everybody’s buying far too many clothes. 'I mean, I know I’m lucky, I can just take things and borrow them and I’m just okay, but I hate having too many clothes. And I think that poor people should be even more careful. 'It doesn’t mean therefore you have to just buy anything cheap. Instead of buying six things, buy one thing that you really like. Don’t keep buying just for the sake of it. 'I just think people should invest in the world. Don’t invest in fashion, but invest in the world.' Act: Lily Cole said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut, which she had devised with the help of a friend, but said collaborating with Dame Vivienne was 'not even work' Dame Vivienne also urged people to take more of an interest in culture, saying: 'The first thing they can do, if they live in a town, is they can go to art galleries. 'Start building different values, where you engage with the past, with the human race.' The Vivienne Westwood Red Label collection for spring/summer 2014 saw models, their faces caked in black and white make-up, wearing the designer’s trademark tartan, embellished with oversized corsages. Eco-friendly: Vivienne Westwood often uses clothes to make political statements, as in this instance . There were also English country garden prints and T-shirts printed with the phrase: 'Climate Revolution', the designer’s political and environmental message making its mark on the catwalk. Those watching included Hollywood actress Anna Kendrick and singer Paloma Faith. Cole said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut, which she had devised with the help of a friend, but said collaborating with Dame Vivienne was 'not even work' as she enjoyed it so much. 'I’m doing it for the love of it... and to try to communicate the values we both believe in,' said Cole. 'I also did it because it scared me. I’ve never danced live before. I think it’s important to challenge yourself in life.' Wearable: Despite the climate change message, Westwood offered up a positive vision for S/S14 .

"It looks like an ordinary Range Rover – but it bristles with enough gadgets to make James Bond envious. The new armoured vehicle, dubbed the Chelsea tank, is designed to cope with small-arms fire – and even a chemical weapons attack – to foil would-be kidnappers. With thick armour plating, gun ports and electronic jammers, the £300,000 vehicle is designed for security- conscious celebrities who don’t want to stand out in city streets. The Range Rover Vogue has been modified by STOOF for safety-conscious celebrities to keep trouble at bay. Detailed above are some of the many features the company installs on vehicles . Stoof, the German company which has adapted the Range Rover Vogue, confirm it has also sold armoured cars to the Foreign Office and other Government agencies. Its latest vehicle, to be launched next month at the Transport Security Expo in Olympia, is also fitted with sensors which detect a gas attack, close down the air conditioning and supply fresh oxygen. The vehicle weighs in at five tons – with its suspension and brakes upgraded to cope. Among other vehicles serviced by the company are limousines and off-road trucks, with references to safety in conflict zones appearing throughout its website. Armoured cars have become a must-have accessory for safety-conscious celebrities, some of whom have spent £200,000 on modifications to keep attackers at bay.

"Created: . 14:07 EST, 10 February 2014 . A man battered his ex-girlfriend to death with a rolling pin to ensure he had custody of their baby girl, a court heard yesterday. Jilted Adam Singer, 30, is said to have stolen the murder weapon from his work as a galley assistant on a Royal Navy base. The prosecution claims he then used it to launch a 'cold blooded and extremely brutal attack' on Sally Ann Harrison, 24. Adam Singer, 30, has gone on trial accused of beating his ex-girlfriend Sally Ann Harrison (pictured) to death with a rolling pin after she threatened to move out of their home and take their daughter Isabella with her . She suffered fatal head injuries during the onslaught in their maisonette in Devonport, Devon which they shared despite no longer being a couple. Bristol Crown Court heard that Singer ‘rehearsed’ the killing, asking workmates at the HMS Drake base if they thought a rolling pin would kill and whether it would be better to hit someone on the side or top of the head. Court heard that Singer 'rehearsed' the killing at the galley kitchen where he worked, asking colleagues whether a blow from a rolling pin could kill . Simon Laws, QC, prosecuting, told how Singer was determined to ‘get his way’ after the couple split following a five-and-a-half year relationship. They continued living with each other despite finding new partners but Sally was planning to leave, taking their 21-month-old daughter Isabella with her. Mr. Laws said: 'Sally was killed in a cold-blooded and extremely brutal attack which left her with head injuries she could not possibly survive. 'The evidence in this case shows that Adam Singer killed her. He and Sally had been in a relationship and they had a child together. The relationship was at an end and he wanted custody of the child. 'Sally was not going to agree to that under any circumstances, so he killed her to get his way.' He added: 'His thoughts had turned to custody of Isabella. That was what he wanted and he knew he was not going to get it by other means. 'He is a large and powerful man, he was armed with a weapon and Sally stood no chance.' The court heard the pair met in November 2006 and moved in together in May 2010. Their daughter was born two months later, but early in 2012 the couple split up. In the days before the murder the court heard how Singer brandished a rolling pin and asked workmates about killing Sally and also spoke of killing himself. Mr. Laws said: 'He was holding up one of the four rolling pins in his hand and he was waving it around. 'By accident he caught the peak of Keith Johnson’s cap and this gave him a shock. 'He asked Mr Johnson if he was alright, and the next thing he remembers him saying is this, ""do you think this would kill someone?"" 'Mr Johnson replied that he thought it would, and he was right. Mr Singer continued, ""how would you hit someone? Would you hit them on the head or to the side?""' Mr. Laws added: 'It was, in effect, a rehearsal. There are some moments in a case when the truth is plan for all to see. 'There Adam Singer contemplated the murder or Sally Harrison and identified the weapon from his work place. 'A day or two later the very implement was used to kill Sally by striking her to the top of the head and to the side.' Bristol Crown Court heard that Singer confessed to a friend he had 'stood at the end of Sally's bed with the rolling pin but did not have the balls' to carry out the attack . Mr Laws said Singer originally denied taking the rolling pin and tried to trick police by leaving their home after the murder and returning around 3am to 'play the part of the bereaved boyfriend'. He later changed his story to admit taking the cooking utensil but told officers he took it to do some baking with Sally and his daughter. Friend Simon Gotham told police Singer had 'stood at the end of Sally’s bed with the rolling pin but did not have the balls' to carry out the act, the court heard. Singer, of Salibsury, Wilts., denies murdering Sally on April 4 2012 and the trial continues.

"With the website crashing under demand for tickets and prices soaring to hundreds of pounds, a seat at the BBC Proms is a coveted prize. But for a fortunate group of ‘Prommers’ – made up of celebrities, politicians and the Corporation’s bosses – their place at the world’s largest classical music festival is all but guaranteed. It has been revealed that the BBC spent more than £23,000 on tickets and hospitality for this year’s events, with guests as varied as Homeland star Damian Lewis, Home Secretary Theresa May, Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, and presenter Sir David Attenborough rubbing shoulders at the licence fee payer’s expense. The BBC spent more than £23,000 on tickets and hospitality for guests to attend The Proms this year . And BBC bosses also handed out tickets to family members, with Diane Coyle, at the time Acting Chairman of the BBC Trust, bringing her husband – BBC Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones – to two shows and James Harding, Director of News and Current Affairs, bringing his wife to one. Campaign groups have criticised the practice of using the licence fee to fund tickets for BBC staff and celebrities, claiming it will ‘stick in the throat’ of normal people. The First Night at the Proms was the most popular concert for guests to attend, with the BBC spending £6,993.36 – including £264 on programmes – for 97 people to listen to the rendition of Elgar’s The Kingdom. Information obtained through a Freedom of Information request reveals that those in the crowd at The Royal Albert Hall hosted by the BBC included Mr Lewis, Shadow Cabinet Minister Harriet Harman and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander. Others were also there on the request of specific BBC executives. Helen Boaden, the corporation’s Director of Radio who has responsibility for overseeing the Proms, ensured tickets for five people including the pop star turned vicar Reverend Richard Coles, while Mr Harding hosted a further three, including Newsnight presenter Allegra Stratton. The next most popular event was Daniel Barenboim and the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra performing a selection of pieces as part of a ‘Spanish-flavoured evening’ of music. Home Secretary Theresa May (left) and Eric Pickles (right) were among guests of the corporation at the Proms . A total of 17 people secured tickets thanks to Miss Boaden and Mr Harding – who gave one of the tickets to his wife – at a cost of £1,021.22, although eight of these tickets – including for presenter Jeremy Vine – were complimentary, so cost the BBC nothing. However, those who did have their tickets paid for by the corporation included former cricketer Michael Atherton, playwright Sir Ronnie Harwood and Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks. Despite being one of the most vaunted events, the Last Night of the Proms, saw only a handful of complementary guests, with even one of the tickets being left unclaimed of the day. However, for the 12 people who did attend – including Miss May and her Cabinet colleague Mr Pickles and former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey - the BBC forked out £1,440 on tickets, £64 on programmes and £659.80 of hospitality. Given his previous job as chief executive of the Royal Opera House, one might expect Tony Hall – who is paid £450,000 as the BBC’s Director General – to take full advantage of the chance to see some of the world’s top classical musicians. However, he was only hosted by the BBC for the opening night and then hosted guests himself for two other concerts. The first of these was for a performance by Rufus Wainwright, which he enjoyed with a group of six, including Sir David Attenborough, Sir Kenneth Branagh and Doctor Who and Sherlock writer Steven Moffat, at a cost to the BBC of £858.20. Helen Boaden (left) the corporation's Director of Radio, ensured tickets for five people while News and Current Affairs editor James Harding (right) brought his wife to one of the shows . Violinist Janine Jansen, conductor Sakari Oramo, singer Paloma Faith, television presenter Katie Derham and Joey from War Horse were part of the celebrations. The BBC spent £6,993.36 on the First Night of the Proms . He then also hosted a further six guests, including Mr Vine, Miss May and Baroness Stowell of Beeston for the festival’s closing night. Miss Boaden, who earns £340,000, was the BBC boss most liberal with her distribution of complimentary tickets, hosting guests at a total of 23 concerts, at a total cost of nearly £7,000. However, over 120 of the tickets she handed out were to guests she did not directly invite. It is unclear who these guests were and who invited them. Andy Silvester, Campaign Manager for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Licence Fee payers will be furious that the Corporation is using their cash to host politicians and celebrities in luxury boxes. ‘These kind of tickets for the Proms are way out of the reach of hard-pressed families chased for every penny by the Licensing Authorities, and it’ll stick in the throat to see the Licence Fee used in this way. ‘The BBC needs to do away with this kind of spending and focus on delivering real value, or sympathy for the £145-a-year TV Tax will continue to wane.’ A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC Proms is the world’s largest classical music festival and a major cultural event managed and broadcast by the BBC and money raised from tickets and programmes goes towards the running costs of the festival. “The BBC works hard to ensure value for money for its licence fee payers. The cost of providing this hospitality has been strictly controlled by corporate guidelines and the average cost was approximately £300 less per event than last year.”","Corporation spent thousands on tickets for celebrities and politicians .

"One is a toddler who desperately needed an operation to walk, the other an aspiring topless model who wanted a ‘boob job’ to look more like Jordan. And there are no prizes for guessing which case the NHS deemed the more urgent. The health service was yesterday accused of showing a ‘skewed sense of priorities’ after it emerged that Oliver Dockerty, a two-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, has been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk. Priorities: Little Oliver Dockerty, left, was refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while aspiring model Josie Cunning, right, had her breasts enlarged to 36DD at a cost of £4,800 to taxpayers . Yet just a few miles away, 22-year-old . Josie Cunningham has been given size 36DD breasts at taxpayers’ expense . because she convinced doctors her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. The two cases from Leeds have emerged . after Oliver’s mother spoke out about how he has been denied the . potentially life-changing procedure. The toddler, who relies on a frame to . move around, can have the operation only if his single mother Claire can . raise £25,000  to have it performed privately. Miss Dockerty, 30, said: ‘Oliver has . splints on his legs, a flexi-stand as he hasn’t got any balance, and . uses a walking frame to get around. ‘He wants to be jumping in muddy . puddles like Peppa Pig. He wants to be kicking a football and he can’t . jump on a trampoline. I’d love to see him walking unaided for his first . day at primary school. ‘I’m a single parent and I don’t have . that kind of money. Even if they look again at the decision, there’s . going to be a big backlog of children like Oliver waiting to have this . done.’ Turned down: Oliver, who has cerebral palsy, with mother Claire, needs a metal frame to walk . Oliver, who lives with his mother in Manchester, was referred . for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, which specialises in the . procedure, known as  selective dorsal rhizotomy. But when a surgeon applied to NHS . England for funding, he was turned down because the procedure is not yet . routinely covered by the health service. The case seems particularly cruel when . compared to that of Miss Cunningham, who had a breast enlargement on . the NHS at nearby St James’s University Hospital, which is also part of . the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery . should be funded only in rare circumstances when a local trust deems it . is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’. Outrage: Claire Dockerty, whose son Oliver, two, needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame, slammed the NHS for refusing to pay for the operation . But Miss Cunningham, who works in . telesales, convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her . emotional distress. After funding was recommended by her GP and approved . by her local primary care trust, she had a £4,800 operation, increasing . the size of her breasts from 32A to 36DD. She now says she has the ‘confidence’ to pursue her dream of topless modelling and hopes to emulate former . Page 3 girl Katie Price, also known as Jordan. The unmarried mother from Leeds plans . to leave her children, Harley, five, and Frankie, two, with her parents . while she chases her dream. She wrote on Twitter: ‘I have no regrets. My . body is the start of my new life.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be stupefied that the . same system  which funded a boob job for  an aspiring glamour model will . not allow treatment that would enable a little boy to walk unaided. ‘It . certainly suggests that the NHS has a skewed sense of priorities.’ A spokesman for NHS England said . funding was granted for the operation recommended for Oliver in only . ‘exceptional cases’, adding that proposals are being considered to offer . it more widely later in the year.’ A spokesman for the Department of . Health said: ‘Any treatment provided by the NHS needs to be clinically . justified, but the local NHS is best placed to make these decisions.’ Meanwhile, Claire is determined to fund the operation for her son herself and has launched her own charity page at justgiving.com/oliverwantstojoinin . Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need. This decision is taken at a local level, by local clinical commissioners under the new NHS reform, on the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors. Commissioners set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community. For cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the commissioners must decide there is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded on the NHS. Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough. Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website. They include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face lift). It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria. The criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity. Rare cases, however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its individual merits.

"Britain's most feckless father  is behind bars today after failing to turn up at court to face a charge of assaulting an ex-girlfriend and stealing from her. Keith Macdonald has nine children with eight different women and was due to appear before court in June after he headbutted Stephanie Jubb in an argument over a cheese toastie, leaving her with a bloody nose. Sunderland Magistrates' Court heard how he then snatched £80 and Miss Jubb's mobile phone and fled the house they shared in Meadow Street, East Rainton, County Durham. Keith Macdonald, left, was jailed after he failed to turn up at court to face a charge of assaulting ex-girlfriend Stephanie Jubb, right, and stealing from her . The terrified 24-year-old fled to neighbour Paul Gascoigne's house to call 999 and said she had been 'angry and upset' since the incident which occurred on March 1 this year. Miss Jubb had been previously in an on-off relationship with Macdonald which ended in 2009, but heard from her ex again at the end of 2011 where he said that he was 'getting older' the pair began living together in February this year. Giving evidence in June, Miss Jubb said: 'He came back and I could smell alcohol on his breath and his eyes were quite bloodshot. 'He was fine he was chatty, he made himself a toastie and went to go upstairs to eat it. 'I told him 'you're not eating that upstairs, I've just hoovered. 'He then threw the toastie and the plate on the kitchen table and shouted 'F**k it!'' She confronted Macdonald and ripped out the plug of his X-Box console, and in retaliation he ran downstairs, threw her Nintendo Wii across the room and assaulted her, leaving her with two black eyes. Former love: Keith with one of his ex-girlfriends, Kelly Bonner . But Macdonald, 28, failed to turn up for a trial at the court on June 13, where he was convicted of assault, stealing the money, a Sony Ericsson mobile phone and causing criminal damage to a Wii games console. He was brought before city JPs yesterday after handing himself in to police. Macdonald admitted a charge of absconding. Prosecutor Lee Poppett said: 'Four months have passed and he had not handed himself in until he was arrested at some point today or yesterday.' Show-off: Keith Macdonald shows off Claire Bryant's engagement ring . The court heard Macdonald already had one conviction for assaulting Miss Jubb and another for kicking ex-partner Rebecca Wright and grabbing her mother Brenda. Defending, Gavin Sword said Macdonald, who was living in Stoke, had intended to travel back to Sunderland for the trial, but lost his train ticket and could not afford to replace it. He added that Macdonald had called his office a number of times since June to say he was intending to come back to the North East. Baby trail: MacDonald, with Rebecca Wright who gave birth to his child, Clio in 2011 . Chairman of the bench John Scott ordered Macdonald to remain in custody two weeks while Probation Service prepared a pre-sentence report, and was warned that they will examine all options, including jail. The jobless 25-year-old, who met most of his conquests at bus stops, has convictions for violence against one of his ex-girlfriends. In 2008, he was given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to undertake an anger management course after assaulting Bec Wright, now 21, and her mother while living at their home. Miss Wright gave birth to his daughter, Clio, in the same year. He has a series of previous convictions, including a prison sentence for hitting another man with a pint glass. Macdonald, who spends his money on lager and fruit machines, has also had restraining orders taken out against him by two of his children’s mothers and spent time in jail for breaking one of the orders. In 2011 Keith was caught out on Panorama when he could not remember the names of all his children.","Keith Macdonald has nine children with eight different women .

"Oftsed chief Sir Michael Wilshaw: Two-fifths of teachers quit within five years because the job is too tough . Thousands of newly qualified teachers are being ‘left to flounder’ in schools each year because of their inadequate training, England’s chief inspector warned yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw said it was a ‘national scandal’ that teachers were arriving for work completely unprepared for the job. The Ofsted chief inspector said 40 per cent quit the profession within five years of qualifying because they found it ‘too difficult’ and were ill-equipped to deal with unruly pupils. Sir Michael claimed teachers were being tutored by people with little ‘up-to-date’ experience and left to ‘flounder’ in schools with senior staff doing nothing to support them. In future, he added, Ofsted would be cracking down on course providers. He also took a swipe at unions for portraying the teachers  they represent as ‘perpetual victims’. About 30,000 teachers are trained each year, suggesting that some 12,000 of those switch careers after a short period of time. The average cost of training is around £10,000 – meaning tens of millions of taxpayers’ money is being squandered annually. Sir Michael said: ‘How many times have heads said to me their trainees had been tutored by people with little or no up-to-date school experience or a record of outstanding teaching? ‘Trainees have been sent into schools  inadequately prepared to deal with poor behaviour. Even worse, how many times have I heard they were left to flounder because they received little or no support from senior and middle leaders?’ The amount of new teachers leaving the profession was a ‘national scandal’ given the money invested in their training, he said. Sir Michael insisted there has 'never been a better time to be a teacher' despite the two largest unions, the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT, holding a series of strikes over pay and conditions (pictured) He added: ‘I think most of them leave because of misbehaviour. They find it far too challenging, far too difficult.’ There are several routes into teaching, including postgraduate certificates and school-based training including bursaries. Speaking at an education conference in Nottingham, Sir Michael said from September inspectors will ask newly qualified teachers if they ‘well supported, particularly in dealing with pupil behaviour’. If they were struggling, Ofsted will check who trained them – with the threat this could affect the institution’s inspection grade. He went on to insist there has ‘never been a better time to be a teacher’ – despite the two largest unions, the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT, holding a series of strikes over pay and conditions. ‘I find it extremely frustrating when teachers are portrayed, sometimes by their own representatives, as victims who have little control or say over their own professional lives,’ he said. ‘[They] risk infantilising the profession and depressing recruitment.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw said 40 per cent quit the profession within five years .

Inspector also swiped at unions for making teachers 'perpetual victims'
Discipline tsars would be introduced in every school under a Labour government to crack down on misbehaviour, education spokesman Tristram Hunt said yesterday. The ‘behaviour experts’ – either new members of staff or specially trained teachers – would help claw back control of classrooms from unruly pupils and allow teachers to do their jobs, he said."
"Surrogate Tara Sawyer is so addicted to pregnancy that she won’t stop until her 'womb falls out'. The 37-year-old has given birth to seven children, four of whom are her own, and is at her happiest with a bulging baby bump. When she isn’t expecting, Tara feels empty and broods for a pregnancy - but not for a baby. Scroll down for video . Big brood: Tara Sawyer pictured with husband Matthew, and children Rebecca (14), Harrison (12), George-Layton, and 4 yr old twins Jack and Noah (in blue), is so addicted to the 'buzz' of being pregnant that she has babies for strangers and has no plans of ever stopping . In the past two years, Tara has handed over three children to two couples, and has no plans to stop having babies for other people. And despite surrogacy laws stating that she is entitled to £15,000 in expenses, Tara is content purely with the 'thrill' and refuses to take any payment. 'Surrogacy is very addictive,' said Tara. 'It’s a huge rush from the moment the test comes back positive. 'It’s an amazing feeling to hand over a child to someone who desperately wants it, and I feel at my best whilst pregnant.' Tara, who previously worked supporting people with learning disabilities before becoming a full-time mother, started planning her next pregnancy just weeks after giving birth to twin boys in January, and hopes to be pregnant again by the end of the year. Yearning: When she isn't expecting, Tara feels empty and broods for a pregnancy. She has handed over three children to two couples, and says she'll continue to have babies until her 'womb falls out' - luckily, she  doesn't get stretchmarks . Shockingly, the first surrogate baby that she gave birth to two years ago was biologically her daughter, but Tara didn’t feel any maternal love for the infant. Tara said: 'I don’t feel like I’m giving up a baby, I feel like I’m giving it back. 'I don’t feel sad handing over a child that was never mine to keep.' Tara started craving pregnancy when her twin boys Jack and Noah, now four, were still newborns. Tara had given birth to the boys at just 29 weeks by caesarean section after they developed Twin to Twin transfusion syndrome, where the placenta is shared unequally by the babies. She said: 'I felt really deprived of the pregnancy. I didn’t want anymore children but I was desperately craving the pregnancy.' Tara, who was adopted as a child, had previously considered surrogacy to give parents like hers the opportunity to have a family. Double trouble: Tara had given birth to Jack and Noah at just 29 weeks by caesarean section after they developed Twin to Twin transfusion syndrome, where the placenta is shared unequally by the babies . Feeling good: Despite surrogacy laws stating that she is entitled at least £15,000 in expenses, Tara, from Wimblington, Cambridgeshire, is content purely with the 'thrill' of being pregnant and is happy to do it for free - she says she feels at her healthiest when carrying . She won't stop! In the past two years, Tara has handed over three children to two couples, and has no plans to stop having babies for other people . 'Surrogacy seemed like the perfect solution,' said Tara. 'I would get my pregnancy and a couple would get their baby.' Surprisingly, Tara’s husband, Matt Sawyer, 37, a truck driver, was supportive of her decision to carry strangers’ children. 'He didn’t take a lot of convincing,' said Tara. 'He knew I was feeling broody for the pregnancy and he knew that there was a hole that I needed to fill. 'He was more concerned about whether I’d be able to hand over the baby at the end but he was behind me 100%.' With Matt’s support, Tara logged onto Facebook and started scouring surrogacy pages. Within a few weeks she had met a gay couple that were desperate for help having a child. Thrillseeker: Tara, who was adopted as a child, had previously considered surrogacy to give parents like hers the opportunity to have a family and says she loves the 'thrill' of being pregnant . At her best: Tara's says she feels at her best physically when she's pregnant and takes vitamins, swims, does yoga and eats healthily . Tara, who is also mum to Rebecca, 14, and Harrison, 12, donated her own egg to the couple and artificially inseminated herself at her home in Wimblington, Cambridgeshire, using a plastic pipette. Tara said: 'From the moment I found out I was pregnant I was totally hooked - it was such a rush. 'It was an amazing experience from start to finish. 'When the baby was born there was no rush of love like when I had my other children. 'But handing her over to her dads was a feeling like no other.' Tara isn’t worried about the effects of pregnancy on her body, and says she is in better shape now than she was in her twenties. Bundle of joy: Tara says she hadn't made as much effort with her own pregnancies but the responsibility was bigger with someone else's child. Plus, she loves having a bump and people cooing over the precious little gift inside . Within days of giving birth, Tara was missing being pregnant. She said: 'My husband was worried about me at first but it wasn't the baby I was missing - it was the bump' When Tara suggested another surrogacy a few months after, Matt was once again willing to support his wife . Tara says that when she's not pregnant, she feels empty and only a baby can fill that void...so she keeps getting pregnant . Tara's husband, Matt Sawyer, a truck driver, is supportive of Tara's decision to carry strangers' children . 'I feel at my best physically when I’m pregnant,” said Tara. “I take vitamins, go swimming, do yoga and eat healthily. 'I hadn’t made as much effort with my own pregnancies but the responsibility was bigger with someone else’s child. 'I love having a bump and people cooing over the precious little gift inside. 'I don’t even get stretch marks - it’s like I was made to have babies.' Within days of giving birth, however, Tara was missing being pregnant. She said: 'My husband was worried about me at first but it wasn’t the baby I was missing - it was the bump.' And when Tara suggested another surrogacy a few months after, Matt was once again willing to support his wife. Support system: Tara's husband was more concerned about whether she'd be able to hand over the baby at the end but he was behind her 100 per cent and they began scouring the internet for surrogacy options . Again Tara logged onto Facebook and met a couple who were unable to carry children full term. On January 4 this year, she gave birth to twin boys for the couple, but she has no plans to stop yet. Tara said: 'I’ve been talking to another gay couple and I hope to be pregnant for them by the end of the year. 'I know that when they are older the children will want answers, especially my biological daughter. 'We’ve all decided that being open is the best approach and I’ll answer any questions they might have - but I’ll be clear that I’m not their mum. 'When I’m not pregnant I feel empty and only a baby can fill that void. 'I’m addicted to the buzz of pregnancy and if I can help childless couples at the same time it would be insane not to. 'I won’t stop until my womb falls out.' Big plans: Tara's already been talking to another gay couple and she hope to be pregnant for them by the end of the year . Honesty is the best policy: Tara says that being open with the surrogate children is the best approach and she will answer any questions they might have - but she'll be clear that she's not their mum .

"A California school district has apologized for a video spoof that ended with a security officer pretending to shoot students from a rival high school with a toy gun. The video shows school administrators at Buhach Colony High School in Atwater, including the principal, dressed in superhero costumes and pretending to kick and punch students at the rival school. It ends with a school security officer pretending to shoot the rival students. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The security guard from Buhach Colony High School in Atwater, California, who has not been identified, is seen holding the toy gun during the spoof shooting video . Opening fire: She then starts shooting at the students as they are running alongside the school buildings . Aftermath: One of the final scenes shows some of the children from the rival school lying on the floor, pretending to be dead . The Merced Union High School District declined comment, but released a statement Thursday afternoon. A spokesman said: 'Merced Union High School district immediately addressed the release of the school rivalry video posted by Buhach Colony and had it removed from the media site. 'We apologize for the impact the video has had on the community and want to ensure everyone that the district does not support or endorse school violence. The issue is being addressed through the personnel office.' The roughly six-minute video was posted on YouTube. It was posted with the description: 'Go Buhach! teach those Atwater falcons not to come into our territory.' Principal Steve Hobbs declined to identify the school administrators in the video or say who came up with the idea. Still, he apologized, the Merced Sun-Star reported. 'At no time was there intent to glamorize or endorse school violence,' Hobbs told the newspaper. 'Would I do it again? Obviously not. I apologize for the impact it had on the community.' Board of Trustees Acting President Dave Honey told the newspaper that simulating a campus shooting was a mistake and showed poor taste, especially considering the number of people nationwide who have died in actual campus attacks . The female guard then finishes the shooting and gets back into her cart. The six-minute video was taken off the school's site after local officials intervened . 'I was very upset,' Honey said. 'In this day in age of school shootings, this was totally inappropriate and lacked sensitivity. The video also should have not been posted to the school online site, which has gone nationwide. This was all made worse by the administrators in the video.  We have great students at Buhach, Atwater and all our schools.  I apologize to all (to whom) this has had an effect.' Johnson told the Sun-Star that the video took the rivalry between the two high schools too far. She suggested that district officials approve any videos that are to be posted to the web. Atwater High School Principal Alan Peterson said he felt the video spoof got too much attention, especially given all the great things happening in the schools. Some Atwater students, however, were upset. 'I think Buhach needs to know that what they did was offensive,' said student Sebastian Cervantes, 17. 'They make it seem like it's cool, and I hope they learn the difference between right and wrong.'

"Natalie Eckert, the 37-year-old mum of five from Stoke-on-Trent, who is aiming to become the first person to complete a marathon wearing high heels says she will complete it in under five hours. In fact, the five-inch heels she intends to run in will be a walk in the park compared to the seven-inch shoes she wears in every day life. In navigating the 26.2-mile course, Eckert hopes to set a Guinness World Record for her daughter and raise money for a good cause. Every inch counts: Natalie Eckert is hoping to run the 2015 London Marathon in high heels . Well heeled: Natalie has been wearing five-inch high heels while preparing for the marathon . Natalie came up with the idea after her daughter found an entry in the record books about German Julia Plecher, who ran 100 metres (nearly 330ft) in 14.531 seconds in a pair of high heels. She said: ‘My daughter suggested that I was little bit more hard-core and should do a marathon in high heels. ‘I’ve been running for about 12 years for pleasure but with regards to training for this I’ve been running about two months since I applied to Guinness and I’ve been running in five-inch heels.’ Ambitious: Natalie Eckert is confident she will be able to finish the marathon in under five hours . Tough slog: The 37-year-old mum was inspired by a German woman who ran 100 metres in heels . Rigorous training: Natalie Eckert performs an ankle strengthening exercise . She added: ‘It’s not been too difficult running in heels. I’m used to wearing seven-inch heels for 12 hours a day every day, so five inches is actually quite a nice break for my feet.’ Natalie hopes to raise £5,000 for Asthma UK and a charity for bereaved children called Winston's Wish and although she has never run a marathon before she is confident she’ll be able to complete the race in under five hours. She once ran a half marathon in two hours and 17 minutes. She said: ‘If I wasn’t running in heels I’d be looking at under four hours. I think five hours is a reachable target, but it’s also going to be quite a challenge to do it in heels.’","Natalie Eckert was inspired by a woman who ran 100 metres in heels .

"Beaten: The woman teacher was knocked out in the attack and magistrates say she nay even give up the profession for good (picture posed by model) A schoolboy who punched a woman teacher unconscious in a ‘sustained’ classroom assault must pay just £100 compensation. The 15-year-old was spared a custodial sentence after he admitted throwing a textbook at her, then punching her repeatedly in the face. When she fell to the floor, he continued punching her and she lost consciousness. The teacher suffered a cut and bruising to her head, loosened teeth and a swollen face which required hospital treatment. Magistrates said she 'may not continue teaching'. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given a six-month referral order to work with the youth offending team by magistrates at Burnley Youth Court in Lancashire yesterday. The school and the teacher can also not be named. The child said the attack came after he was subjected to a long period of verbal bullying by other students. He punched the teacher after she saw one of her teaching assistants was 'having problems' getting him to do a task during lesson time. When the teacher told the boy to . complete the tasks, he swore at her and threw a textbook at her. She . asked him to leave the room because of his behaviour. At this point the boy walked up to the . teacher and punched her on the left eye with his right fist, then again . on the side of her face. She was punched 'two or three' times as she lost consciousness. Two teaching assistants and a number of . other pupils witnessed the incident, which took place at around 1.30pm . on November 6 at a school in Burnley. The boy was arrested later that day and has since been expelled from the school. He admitted the section 47 assault in an interview with police and blamed his behaviour on the bullying he had been subjected to. The boy’s defence team said he had . admitted responsibility from the outset and that he knew his actions . were wrong, and he was on the waiting list for psychological help. 'You have brought shame on your family. You have put this teacher in fear and she may not continue teaching. I hope you can turn your life around.' They also explained how the boy’s father had been to visit the teacher and her family to apologise on his son’s behalf. In sentencing, the magistrates said . they had taken into account that the attack was ‘out of character’ and . told him to ‘start afresh’. They . said: 'This was a particularly nasty and sustained assault. You knew it . was wrong and that the way you went about dealing with your problems . was not right. 'I hope this . is the last we see of you in court. It has been very upsetting for your . parents and has brought shame on your family. Let’s start afresh. 'You have put this teacher in fear and she may not continue teaching. 'I hope you can turn your life around.' The boy’s father must pay £100 compensation plus a £15 victim surcharge.","Teacher beaten unconscious in attack in front of other pupils by boy in Burnley school .

"Instincts: Couples should go with their gut feelings if they want to live happily ever after, a new study claims . If you want to know whether you and your partner will have a happy marriage, you should not let your heart or your head rule, it seems. For the secret to predicting the chances of long-term marital bliss is down to basic gut instinct, a study claims. Scientists have found we are better able to predict the long-term success of our relationship on a subconscious level, with lurking doubts a good indicator that trouble lies ahead. Psychologists conducted tests on 135 newlywed couples, then checked their progress over  four years. They found the feelings participants expressed when answering a questionnaire about their marriage had little bearing on their consequent satisfaction with their relationship. But their gut instincts, revealed in series of tests, accurately mirrored their future level of happiness. ‘Although they may be largely unwilling or unable to verbalise them, people’s automatic evaluations of their partners predict one of the most important outcomes of their lives – the trajectory of their marital satisfaction,’ said lead researcher Dr James McNulty of Florida State University. The study, published in the journal Science, looked at emotions buried under the surface and whether they affected an individual’s responses. Photos of volunteers’ spouses were flashed on a computer screen for  a fraction of a second, followed by a positive word such as ‘awesome’ or  a negative one such as ‘awful’. Participants had to choose whether they viewed the word as positive or negative. ‘People who have really positive feelings about their partners are  very quick to indicate that words  like awesome are positive words and very slow to indicate that words  like awful are negative words,’ said Dr McNulty. Analysis: Couples' sub-conscious feelings for each other were tested . The opposite was also true, the . researchers said, with participants who had negative feelings about . their partners taking longer to respond to positive words and less time . to respond to negative ones. This was the case even when the individuals were not conscious of their conflicting emotions. The couples were questioned about their level of relationship satisfaction every six months afterwards. Those who had revealed negative or . lukewarm feelings towards their partner reported the most marital . dissatisfaction four years later. ‘Everyone wants to be in a good . marriage,’ said Dr McNulty. ‘And in the beginning, many people are able . to convince themselves of that at a conscious level. ‘But these automatic, gut-level responses are less influenced by what people want to think. ‘You can’t make yourself have a positive response through a lot of wishful thinking. ‘If they can sense that their gut is . telling them that there is a problem, then they might benefit from . exploring that, maybe even with a professional marriage counsellor.’","Couples' sub-conscious feelings for each other were tested in a new study .

"Americans are more skeptical of climate change than people in other leading countries, according to an international survey. Global Trends 2014, a survey of more than 16,000 people in 20 countries, also revealed how divided Americans are over the cause and treatment of global warming. When asked if climate change is largely man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking last in the international poll and ten points lower . than the next lowest countries on the list, Britain and Australia. However in China, 93 per cent of respondents believe the climate change we are witnessing is largely the result of human activity. Skeptics: When asked if climate change is mainly man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking them last in the poll of countries including Russia, Poland and India . Disbelief: Just 57.3 percent of American respondents believe that we are headed for environmental disaster if we don't change our behavior or habits . The survey, conducted by British market research company Ipsos MORI, also found just 57.3 percent of Americans agreed that we're heading for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly. This compares with 91.1 percent of Chinese and 84.2 percent of Italian respondents, who accept that behavioral and attitudinal change is needed to stem the effects of global warming. Half of American interviewees believe the government is using climate change as a way to raise taxes, a view that is shared by the majority of respondents in nearly all the countries polled. However, there appears to be global consensus on the role of companies in addressing climate change. About 65 per cent of Americans surveyed don't think companies pay enough attention to the environment - second last among 20 nations surveyed. Natural disaster: The remnants of the Jet Star roller coaster in Seaside Heights, New Jersey are pictured after Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 . Environmental Defense Fund spokeswoman Keith Gaby told CBS News that although American opinion is divided, other polls have found a large proportion believe some type of action is needed against global climate change. 'But it is true that a very loud minority has made action on climate change more difficult. I think that's because the issue - which should be judged on science - has gotten caught up in partisan politics,' he said. 'We need to [reopen] a productive, [bipartisan] dialogue about solutions that will help our environment and our economy.' In April, an Associated Press-GfK poll found only 33 percent of Americans were extremely confident that global temperatures are rising due to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. In Gallup's annual environmental poll, 42 percent of respondents said reports of climate change are exaggerated. These views persist despite mounting evidence showing climate change is already affecting coastal flooding to global food supplies. 'Climate change is happening, the signs of it, the impacts, are detectible already,' Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, lead author of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. 'If you live in a city, if you live along the coast, or if you eat to live, this is a problem you have to worry about.'","16,000 people in 20 countries interviewed for Global Trends 2014 survey .

"Astronomers have, for the first time, detected in X-rays a planet outside our solar system pass in front of its parent star. The image was taken of a planet in HD 189733- a system which is 63 light-years from Earth - using Nasa’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency’s XMM Newton Observatory. Up until now, exoplanets had only been observed passing in front of their parent stars using optical light in a process known as transiting. Scroll down for video . Using Chandra and XMM-Newton, astronomers have detected an exoplanet passing in front of its parent star for the first time in X-rays. The image was taken of the HD 189733 system which contains a Sun-like star orbited by the blue HD 189733b, an exoplanet about the size of Jupiter . ‘Thousands of planet candidates have been seen to transit in only optical light,’ said Katja Poppenhaeger of Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ‘Finally being able to study one in X-rays is important because it reveals new information about the properties of an exoplanet.’ The planet, known as HD 189733b, is a hot Jupiter, meaning it is similar in size to Jupiter in our solar system but in very close orbit around its star. It is more than 30 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun and orbits its star once every 2.2 days. The planet is a huge gas giant and its atmosphere is scorching, with a temperature of over 1,000°C. The observations, made using Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory (pictured), could be the first time such a collision has been detected in X-rays . Type: 'Hot Jupiter' gas giant . Distance from Earth: 63 light years . Temperature: 1,000°C . Wind speed: 7,000 kilometres per hour . Conditions: Glass particles in the atmosphere give it its dazzling blue colour . Nasa believes it is the closest hot Jupiter to Earth, which makes it a prime target for astronomers who want to learn more about this type of exoplanet and the atmosphere around it. Last month, the Hubble Space Telescope determined the dazzling blue colour of the alien planet for the first time as a result of the scattering of blue light by silicate particles in its atmosphere. It found that it rains glass - sideways - in howling 7,000 kilometre-per-hour winds. The latest observations by Chandra have allowed researchers to learning about how the planet and the star can affect one another. This illustration shows HD 189733b, a huge gas giant that orbits very close to its host star HD 189733. The planet's atmosphere is scorching with a temperature of over 1000 degrees Celsius, and it rains glass, sideways, in howling 7000 kilometer-per-hour winds . Astronomers have known for about a decade ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the main star in HD 189733 are evaporating the atmosphere of HD 189733b over time. The authors estimate it is losing 100 million to 600 million kilograms of mass per second. HD 189733b's atmosphere appears to be thinning 25 per cent to 65 per cent faster than it would be if the planet's atmosphere were smaller. An X-ray image shows the main star (middle). The source in the lower right is the faint companion star. The source at the bottom of the image is a background object not contained in the HD 189733 system . ‘The extended atmosphere of this planet makes it a bigger target for high-energy radiation from its star, so more evaporation occurs,’ said co-author Scott Wolk, also of CfA. The main star in HD 189733 also has a faint red companion, detected for the first time in X-rays with Chandra. The stars likely formed at the same time, but the main star appears to be 3 billion to 3.5 billion years younger than its companion star because it rotates faster, displays higher levels of magnetic activity and is about 30 times brighter in X-rays than its companion. ‘This star is not acting its age, and having a big planet as a companion may be the explanation,’ said Ms Poppenhaeger. ‘It's possible this hot Jupiter is keeping the star's rotation and magnetic activity high because of tidal forces, making it behave in some ways like a much younger star.’","HD 189733b is 63 light-years from Earth and orbits its star every 2.2 days .

"CNN chief national correspondent John King could be ousted from the network in favour of new Chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper, MailOnline can reveal. King, 49, has already moved out of his office to make way for Tapper, 43, who was poached by new CNN boss Jeff Zucker from ABC. And now sources have revealed that King has not signed a new contract - and has instead signed an extension to his existing deal, leaving his future at the network unclear. Exes: CNN chief national correspondent John King with his ex wife, CNN's senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash at a White House bash in May 2009 . Popular: CNN's new Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper has already been given his own weekday show . Tapper, who debuted on CNN last week, has already been given his own weekday show by Zucker, most likely set to launch in March or April. Both Jake and John are uber forces in Washington and a source said: 'People are wondering what Jeff has planned for John. His own show didn't work and it was dropped, so where can he go? What would be the best place for him?' King disappeared from the airwaves and Twitter for nearly a month between December and January until Media Bistro reported he had been on an extended vacation with his family - a post-election break. The longtime CNN correspondent who hosted 'John King USA' until disappointing ratings forced it off the air last summer, signed a short-term contract extension at the end of last year. He split from CNN's senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash, 40, last March after four years of marriage less than a year after she gave birth to their son Jonah Frank King. The petite blonde is a favourite at the network. Tapper is now in King's former office - and the correspondent left him a bottle of Johnny Walker Black as a moving in gift. A CNN source told MailOnline: 'This was purely out of convenience. Jake's team are going to be based by that office, so it made sense. John has a got a new office, it's really gorgeous.' Tapper said he expects to take over the 4 p.m. hour currently occupied by Wolf Blitzer’s ‘Situation Room.’ Blitzer will be cut back to 5 to 7 p.m. If all goes well, it could be a prelude to Tapper breaking into the prime-time lineup and he told Media Bistro: 'It’s a little premature, but anything’s possible. Jeff says he wants to do a lot of different things. 'Everything’s on the table. But maybe 4 p.m. will ultimately be a great place to be. It’s when viewers start getting serious about news. It’s valuable real estate.' A CNN spokeswoman said: 'We never discuss contracts.' This week, Zucker - who was hired from NBC to shake up CNN after it suffered its worst rating slump in 21 years last summer - hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job. The first departuree was political power couple James Carville, the veteran political analyst, and his wife Mary Matalin, who have been with CNN since 2005. CNN network's managing editor Mark Whitaker then announced that he was going to quit as it emerged Tapper's former ABC colleague Chris Cuomo was coming over to start a new morning show. Shake-up: CNN's new boss Jeff Zucker, pictured left, has hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job. However, the former editor of Britain's Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, right, will keep his job . RedState's Erick Erickson will also be leaving and will reportedly be heading to Fox News, which recently parted ways with Sarah Palin, who, according to close sources, declined to sign a new deal with the network. But perhaps the biggest news of all is that the voice of James Earl Jones will once again speak the 'This is CNN' greeting. The Oscar nominee and voice of Darth Vader has not been featured on the network for years but Zucker asked that it be brought back on Monday to coincide with President Obama's inauguration - also his first day in the job. The former editor of Britain's Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, will remain in his position as host of Piers Morgan Tonight, which he began hosting on 17 January 2011, as ratings continue to grow. The changes show just how serious Zucker is about turning CNN around, but for so much to happen so soon has raised eyebrows. His actions also leave huge questions over others whose fate rests in his hands, namely Ann Curry who wants to leave NBC for CNN. Another who will be feeling anxious is Soledad O'Brien, who currently hosts the CNN morning show 'Starting Point,' which has struggled in the ratings despite being critically applauded. Gone: The first departure was political power couple James Carville, right, the veteran political analyst, and his wife Mary Matalin, left, who have been with CNN since 2005 .

Getting . Cuomo, the son of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, is quite a coup for . CNN as he is a former anchor on ABC's Good Morning America and is . extremely experienced. But . O'Brien will now have to renegotiate her role and try to avoid being . put on the dreaded 'special assignment' duty which will see her . consigned to graveyard slots and obscurity. A CNN spokesman said: 'Soledad is very important to the network, and we're discussing various options with her.' Carver's firing seems less controversial. He claimed that he was 'completely cool' with being axed and that it . was to do with the fact he lives in New Orleans and not Washington. Fate unclear: It's not clear whether Ann Curry, right, will be able to leave NBC for CNN and Soledad O'Brien, right, who currently hosts the CNN morning show 'Starting Point,' could be out . Switch: Erick Erickson, left, is out, but James Earl Jones, right, is rehired for the CNN jingle . He . told Politico: 'I was told that they wanted the contributors to be more . available -- essentially, closer to Washington. I'm not always . available, I don't live there.' Matalin told Politico in an email: 'Agree with everything James said. 'I loved my time in and out at CNN and more, the many lifelong friendships made there.' Whitaker, . a former Newsweek editor, left with a barb and sent out an email to . staff saying that he stepped aside because Zucker has what he called . 'forceful ideas.' Gone: CNN's managing editor Mark Whitaker has resigned . He then tried to smooth things over . and said: 'For him to succeed, I believe he deserves his own team and . management structure and the freedom to communicate one clear vision to . the staff. 'I have shared that conclusion with him and he has agreed to let me step down as Managing Editor and move on from CNN. Zucker . will in fact take over Whitaker's role overseeing editorial content at . CNN and there will no new managing editor appointed. Zucker said in a statement: 'I want to thank Mark for his service at CNN. We are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in the future.' Right-leaning Erickson has been with CNN since 2010 when he started as a contributor on John King, USA, which has already been axed, before becoming a contributor across the network. The worst affected by the switch seems to be his daughter and on his RedState blog he wrote: 'When I told my 7 year old I had decided to leave, she laid on the sofa for an hour crying that she'd never see Anderson Cooper again.' He also wrote that even though he was not an 'easy fit' at CNN and that the first month was 'tumultuous,' he was grateful for the chance to 'learn to be friends with people who I disagreed with.'","New CNN chief Jeff Zucker continues to make sweeping changes at network .

"An inventive pensioner has come up with a novel way to avoid washing up – by creating an edible spoon. Roy Webb, 77, believes that his invention will be particularly useful at picnics and parties but that it does have its flaws. Mr Webb thought of the idea after eating canapés served on small, disposable spoons at a party. Roy Webb, 77, has created a range of edible spoons that he believes are very useful at picnics and parties . He set about designing an edible product that could hold many picnic favourites, such as pâté, tomatoes, and strawberries. He made a spoon-shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pin. The grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown. He then layered them with different toppings including cream cheese, prawns and olives which he ate along with the spoons. He says that the four inch spoons can also be made from short crust pastry and covered in cream or yoghurt with fruit toppings, or dipped in chocolate and set in the fridge. Mr Webb, from Cheshire, said the snacks will reduce the amount of plastic cutlery that has to be thrown away after a picnic, as well as cutting out the washing up.

Mr Webb, a retired design engineer from Cheshire, said: ‘I have been to various parties and social gatherings where you are served with little assorted starters on ceramic spoons to go with cocktails and drinks. ‘The food was obviously eaten and the spoons where washed after use. ‘I thought why couldn't you make a spoon that can be eaten along with the canapé, it would look just as attractive and would require no extra washing up. He made a spoon-shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pin . The grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown . ‘So I designed a cutter that would fit the shape of the spoon and started to experiment with various pastries. ‘The problem I found using dough was that to be strong enough to hold a filling it was far too thick, and if it was thinner it was too weak and would not work. ‘After many tests I found that by rolling out bread with a rolling pin the compression of the bread gave it great strength and when baked became the perfect material. ‘I have been getting orders for the kits from all over the world such as Australia, Spain, Canada, Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and mostly from America. ‘The feedback has been very flattering.’ He then layered them with different toppings including cream cheese, prawns and olives which he ate along with the spoons .

"The boss of the Morrisons supermarket chain has slammed Britain's educational system claiming many school leavers who turn up at his stores asking for jobs can't spell or add up. Dalton Philips, 45, said he was concerned that UK schools were falling behind those in other countries and failing to teach basic numeracy and literacy skills. Last month it emerged that British teenagers had dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time and now lag behind those from countries such as Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland. Worrying: Morrisons boss Dalton Philips claims many school leavers who turn up at his stores asking for jobs can't spell or add up and he says it's holding them back. He's urged more people to take up apprenticeships . Mr Philips told the Daily Mirror: 'I worry about our schools system. When young people come on to our apprenticeship schemes we have to do remedial literacy and numeracy work with them and it's holding them back. 'I don't know where it's gone wrong. I would love to see young people proud to join an apprentice scheme and wear it as a badge of honour. 'University isn't for everyone and we need to give more encouragement to those who choose an apprenticeship.' The UK is now ranked 26th out of 65 countries and major economic regions by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Falling behind: British teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. In maths, the UK was 26th while in reading it was 23rd . In maths the UK was 26th – although researchers said a truer position would be 31st – while in reading it was 23rd. A slump in science took Britain from 16th in 2009 to 21st place now. In 2006, British children came 14th in science, 17th in reading and 24th in maths. The poor results come despite a near doubling of the education budget between 1997 and 2010 under Labour – from £50billion a year to £89billion. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the poor results showed radical reform was necessary in a ‘stagnating’ education system. Mr Philips was speaking at the launch of Morrison's new £200million online grocery service. It is a difficult time for the big supermarket chains with Tesco, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer all having announced humiliating Christmas takings. Morrisons saw festive sales down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago, and now says full-year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts, around £783million. Its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘quite awful’ by Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers. The  company’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service. By contrast, Aldi and Lidl’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success. The stores offered higher quality food and drink, from aged fillet steaks at £5 to award-winning mince pies and fresh turkeys.","Concerns Britain's schools are falling behind those in other countries .

Royal estate have really been the agents provocateurs in this, asking . the energy companies to come on board, not the other way around.’ Pub landlord John Jones, 66, who set . up the campaign group Save Llanllwni Mountain to fight the Bryn . Llywellyn proposals, said: ‘The developers have much more money than us . and a far greater say, and the Royals are happy to take the subsidies . even though they’ve never come out here and seen the mountain for . themselves.’ In Powys, . Gordon Dibbs, 73, bought and renovated his country cottage after . retiring from a career in publishing, only to be told a turbine would be . placed just 800 yards from his front door. He said: ‘This is the most beautiful view you could have and they want to spoil our countryside with these gigantic windmills.’ RES Energy's projections of what the Bryn Llywelyn wind farm in Wales will look like . It is unclear who is leading the drive for turbines, but a spokesman confirmed Prince Andrew met Crown Estate officers in September to discuss his interest in renewable energy, including wind power . The . Crown Estate has already allowed RWE to build nine turbines on its land . at Little Cheyne Court on Romney Marsh in Kent. It is the UK’s largest . onshore wind farm. It is unclear who is leading the drive to install turbines, but a spokesman confirmed that Prince Andrew met Crown Estate officers in September to discuss his interest in renewable energy, including wind power. Last year the Duke of Edinburgh attacked onshore wind farms during a frank exchange with the boss of a wind farm company. He said they were ‘absolutely useless, completely reliant on subsidies and  an absolute disgrace’, claiming they would never work and would need back-up capacity. The Prince of Wales is reported to regard wind turbines as a ‘horrendous blot on the landscape’. He was quoted by an unnamed official in 2004, although he is a passionate environmentalist and interested in other forms of renewable energy. Although he has never stated his opposition publicly, there are no wind farms on his own vast estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. The proposed wind farms will bring in around £20million a year for the operators and £1million a year to the Crown Estate. The Sovereign Support Act, to be implemented next year, changes the way members of the Royal Family are funded, replacing the 250-year-old Civil List with a system whereby they will live off around 15 per cent of the Crown Estate’s income. This sum will be around £34million next year. The Crown estate has agreed to lease land to these energy firms... The Estate, which posted annual profits of £231million last year, is one of the most coveted property portfolios in the world and includes interests from remote beef farms to shops and businesses in London’s West End. A spokesman for the Prince of Wales denied he was acting hypocritically and said that the Royal Family played no part in the running of the Crown Estate. He said: ‘The vast majority of the Prince’s official costs are met out of his private income from the Duchy of Cornwall.’ A spokesman for Prince Andrew said of the meeting last year: ‘It was a routine catch-up – the Duke sees renewables as an important opportunity for the UK.’ Robert Norris of wind trade group Renewable UK said:  ‘Everyone benefits from wind energy – not just the Royal Family. Home-grown wind power means we don’t have to import fossil fuels from abroad.’","Prince Philip has called wind farms 'useless' and a 'disgrace'

"Pupils have to wear hijabs in and OUT of class for the first time at a state-backed school in Blackburn. The cover-up was ordered at the 800-pupil Tauheedul Islam Girls' High School where students already have to dress in long purple tunics over black trousers to ensure flesh is not seen. Under the rules, pupils must 'wear the . hijab outside the school and home, recite the Koran at a least once a . week' and not have stationery which shows 'unIslamic images' like . pictures of pop stars. Order: Pupils at the Tauheedul Islam School in Blackburn, have been forced to wear a hijab in and out of class. Posed by model. File photo . Rules: Ten per cent of the sixth-form students at the Tauheedul Islam High School, pictured, already wear the niqab which covers the face except the eyes . Ten per cent of the students in the sixth-form wear the niqab veil which covers the face except the eyes. The voluntary-aided school is the flagship of the Tauheedul charitable trust which wants to open 12 Muslim free schools across the country. Three have been approved so far with one in Hackney opening this month, despite concerns raised by a former government advisor on the prevention of terrorism. Haris Rafiq told the Sunday Times: 'I think it threatens to create young British Muslims who are not able to integrate in the wider society, who are living in isolation and outside the wider community.' In a statement on the school website headmaster Hamid Patel said:'This story is wrong. It is totally incorrect to say that pupils are 'forced' to wear hijab outside of school. 'We are extremely sorry that despite repeated attempts by us to make sure the Sunday Times got their facts right, this newspaper chose to wilfully misrepresent our school.' Backing: Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show today, David Cameron said institutions should be free to rule on face-covering veils . Meanwhile, David Cameron said today the state should back institutions such as schools, courthouses and immigration centres which require individuals to remove face-covering veils. Hidden: A Muslim woman wearing a niqab walking in London . Mr Cameron said he did not believe there should be a ban on wearing the niqab - which conceals the whole face - in the streets. But he made clear he was 'happy' to look at the issue of whether the state needed to do more to back up institutions which choose to implement a ban. Mr Cameron told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'We are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private. 'But we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly. 'So for instance in a school, if they want that particular dress code, I believe the Government should back them. The same for courts, the same for immigration. 'I think we should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose.' Asked if he would respond to a judge's suggestion that there should be national guidelines on the wearing of the niqab in court, Mr Cameron said: 'I'm very happy to look at that. 'Obviously, in court the jury needs to be able to look at someone's face. I've sat on a jury, that's part of what you do. 'When someone is coming into the country, an immigration officer needs to see someone's face. 'In a school, it's very difficult to teach unless you can look at your pupils in the eye. 'It's a free country and I think a free country should have free and independent institutions. No plans for anything on the street, but if the Government needs to do more to back up institutions, then I would be happy to look at that.'","Strict rules for girls who already wear long purple tunics over black trousers so no flesh is exposed .

"Around £150million a year is to be ploughed into primary schools to boost sports provision and help develop the Olympics stars of the future, David Cameron said yesterday. The move follows criticism that the Coalition was neglecting school sports by imposing cuts. Just after the 2010 election, Education Secretary Michael Gove provoked an outcry by abolishing £162million of ring-fenced funding for the national School Sport Partnerships. Investing in the future: Ministers are set to announce up to £150 million of extra funding to help primary schools improve their sports . Now Mr Cameron has vowed to get sport . for children back on track. Every school will receive a lump sum . proportionate to the number of pupils. A primary school with 250 pupils . would receive £9,250 per year. This is the equivalent of around two . days a week of a primary teacher or a coach’s time – enough to make sure . every pupil in the school can do sport with a specialist. The funding . will be ‘ring-fenced’, meaning it can only to be spent on sport. Heads will decide what is best for . their children’s needs, from specialist coaching and teacher training to . after-school or weekend events. The Prime Minister said: ‘The Olympic . and Paralympic Games marked an incredible year for this country and I . will always be proud that we showed the world what Britain can do. ‘I want to ensure the Games count for . the future too and that means capitalising on the inspiration young . people took from what they saw during those summer months. Keeping the legacy alive: The move comes after calls for more investment in school sports to help build upon the legacy of the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics . ‘With this new approach to sport, we . can create a culture in our schools that encourages all children to be . active and enjoy sport, and helps foster the aspirations of future . Olympians and Paralympians. ‘Whether that is the future Jessica . Ennis, Ellie Simmonds or Mo Farah, or someone who will simply learn to . love sport and exercise for a lifetime, this investment will benefit a . whole generation of children for many years to come.’ Other changes include tougher . assessment of sport provision via Ofsted to ensure the funding is . bringing the maximum benefit for all pupils, with schools held to . account for how they spend the money. And teacher training will be overhauled to produce a cadre of primary teachers with a particular specialism in PE. This is being developed in conjunction . with sporting bodies and will start with a pilot covering 120 primary . teachers, with the first of these beginning work in schools in September . 2013. The announcement was welcomed by sports and education groups, and leading figures in the world of sport. The Prime Minister’s Olympic and . Paralympic Legacy Ambassador Lord Coe, who organised the successful . London 2012 Games, said: ‘When I stood up in Singapore in 2005 I spoke . of London’s vision to connect young people with the inspirational power . of the Games so they are inspired to choose sport. ‘Today’s announcement does just that . and by focussing on primary schools we have the opportunity to use sport . and physical activity to shape the daily lives of young people. I am . particularly pleased with the proposals around initial teacher training . and continual professional development because I know from my own . experience what an impact teachers and their engagement can have on the . lives of young people.’ Mo Farah, who one two golds at the . London Olympics, said: ‘It is great to see a commitment to funding . school sport and that it is something I passionately believe in. ‘I am very excited to know that lots . of children will be able to get involved in sport while at school and . get more help from teachers and coaches. It really is very important.’ Jess Ennis, another Olympic gold . medallist, said: ‘It is great to see initiatives that help to give . really young children the chance to take part in sport. ‘This latest funding for primary . schools sounds fantastic – so many of them have no funds for PE and . hopefully now whether in an inner city or small rural community young . kids will be introduced to fun ways to be active that will spark an . interest in taking part in sport as they grow up.’","Money will help children to have weekly access to specialist sports teaching .

"Millionaire fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood has suggested poorer people should 'eat less' so they can afford to buy organic food. The outspoken designer made the comments as she delivered a petition to Downing Street protesting about genetically modified food. When told that not everyone can afford to eat organic food she replied, saying: 'Eat less'. The outspoken designer claimed that people who cannot afford to buy organic food should 'eat less' Dame Vivienne Westwood made the remarks after delivering a petition to Downing Street warning British people of the dangers of GM food and farming . Her comments drew criticism from the food bank charity Trussell Trust, which works to ensure everyone has access to food. Chris Mould, Trussell Trust Chairman told MailOnline: 'Every day Trussell Trust foodbanks provide thousands of people who are facing going hungry with three days' nutritionally balanced food. 'The question for us is not about whether food is organic or not, it's about how we ensure that everyone has access to affordable, healthy food. 'At the moment there are far too many people who are struggling to feed their families full stop, that is the challenge.' But today, Ms Westwood told MailOnline that people should 'eat less' meat and junk food. She said: 'I'm deeply upset if anyone would think I don't care about starving people or don't understand the terrible situation some people are in, quite the opposite, I have spent years campaigning for social and human rights issues. 'My comments were related to eating less meat and junk food. 'People are eating far too much factory farmed meat and junk food which is bad for you and doesn't provide the nutrients you need. 'You can source good food and farmed meat for less.' Ms Westwood, who is an ardent environmental campaigner, made the controversial remarks in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live after delivering the petition to Number 10. She spoke over an interview with Labour MP Michael Meacher to suggest people should 'eat less' so they can afford organic food. She said: 'They don't have any choice that's the point. We have got all these processed food which is the main reason people are getting fat. 'They're not actually good for you - they don't give you strength, they give you weight. 'I eat vegetables and fruit. I don't eat meat. I believe meat is bad for me - I don't eat it. It's also bad for the animals. But if there was a movement to produce more organic food and less of the horrible food, then organic food would obviously be a good value price, wouldn't it?' The designer's flagship store in Conduit Street, London - she has six exclusively owned shops, four in London, one in Leeds and one in Milan . Ms Westwood, who is part of British fashion history best-known for pioneering the punk look, has previously said that food prices should be increased because they do not reflect the impact that food manufacturing processes have on the environment. Last month she said that ‘clothes should cost more’, adding: ‘Food should cost more too. Something is wrong when you can buy a cooked chicken for £2.’ Despite making her fortune from selling clothes, she added: ‘Fashion is a terrible thing, it’s all about tempting to buy. But they should buy less.’ She has also previously said that being a vegetarian can cure the disabled. Discussing the health benefits of choosing a veggie lifestyle, the fashion designer said people in wheelchairs have recovered due to a meat-free diet. She also argued she living proof of the apparently miracle diet, claiming that it healed rheumatism in her finger. 'There are certain clinics where it is really strict vegetarian and there are people who have been in wheelchairs who have recovered from this diet,' she said. 'It does cure all kinds of things if you have a vegetarian diet,' she added. 'I used to have rheumatism — and I have a crocked finger. 'But now I don't have any rheumatic pain any more.' Miss Westwood lives in a smart townhouse in Clapham, south London with her husband Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior. In a 1989 issue of Tatler, Vivienne Westwood appeared on the magazine's cover dressed in a suit she had made for then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Her flame-hair conservatively coiffed, beneath the designer's image were the word: 'This woman used to be a punk'. Westwood's appearance on Tatler reportedly infuriated Mrs Thatcher. The edition has been hailed as one of the best British magazine covers of all time. In 1992, Westwood was awarded an OBE, which she collected from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. At the ceremony, Westwood was knicker-less, which was later captured by a photographer in the courtyard of Buckingham Palace. Years later, she sent a model down the catwalk yielding a sign in support of the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. It read: 'Fair trial my a***! Justice for the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Reprieve' Slowing down climate change and preventing fracking are other causes dear to the designer's heart. Elsewhere she has been pictured at Occupy London protests and visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy. This year, she cut off her hair because, according to her spokesman, 'we must all wake up to Climate Change.' In September she used her packed London Fashion Week showcase to pledge her undivided support of the Yes campaign for Scottish independence. Sending models sporting Yes badges down the runway, the designer left a statement explaining her views on every seat in the packed venue. Later brandishing Better Together campaigners as 'frightened and stupid', Dame Vivienne said tearing the 307-year-old union apart could be 'the turning point towards a better world'.

"Mafia gangs are suspected of orchestrating an ‘international criminal conspiracy’ worth millions of pounds by passing off horsemeat as beef. Mobsters from Italy and Poland are believed to be behind the illegal trade which has led to British consumers eating horse when they believed they were buying beef. The gangs are said to intimidate vets and workers in slaughterhouses and food production plants into signing off cheap cuts of pork and horse as beef. Scroll down for video . Global: European mafia gangs are thought to be behind horsemeat ending up in beef products . Italy is Europe’s biggest consumer of horsemeat and Poland exports around 25,000 horses for slaughter each year, making it big business in both countries. Russian gangs and criminals operating in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are also suspected of involvement, industry sources suggest. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson as also raised concerns that a worldwide criminal network is behind the scandal. Europol, a European-wide agency . tackling organised crime and terrorism, has been informed, while the . Government is looking to bring in the Serious and Organised Crime . Agency. The Metropolitan Police has already begun investigating and is said to be working with other forces on the continent. Mr . Paterson said: 'I'm concerned that this is an international criminal . conspiracy here and we've really got to get to the bottom of it.' His comments come just days after frozen foods . company Findus UK revealed it had discovered horsemeat in its beef . lasagne and has suggested it was deliberately contaminated. The meat was supplied by French firm Comigel and is thought to have originated in Romania. Authorities in the country are investigating whether an abattoir there was the source of the meat. Global: Owen Paterson raised fears that a worldwide 'criminal conspiracy is behind the scandal' It has also emerged that wild horses in . Romania were slaughtered after suffering appalling cruelty, and there are fears that they were then . shipped to Britain as beef products. Investigators in the eastern European . country have been searching sales records following the  revelations that the stolen animals were mistreated on their way to abattoirs. In one case, more than 50 horses were . found inside a truck on its way to an abattoir in Saint Gheorghe, which . is understood to have exported meat. Four of the animals were dead and . others were barely alive, having been beaten with crowbars and starved . of food and water for 28 hours. They are thought to have been caught from the Letea Forest in the Danube Delta, where thousands of wild horses roam. A source close to the investigation . told The Sun: 'The meat from this racket would almost certainly have been . sent abroad and there's no telling where it would have wound up. 'You only have to look at the state . of the poor animals to realise that the meat would have been of terrible . quality and possibly unfit for human consumption.' Testing of processed beef products, including those . being supplied to hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons, was stepped up in Britain. Results from the testing for horse DNA will be published by the Food Standards Authority on Friday. Mr Paterson warned they could reveal further traces of horsemeat, but stressed there is no evidence that the scandal has become a public safety issue. He said: 'There may well be more bad results coming through, that's the point of doing this random analysis. Mr Paterson said retailers have agreed plans to improve their food testing, adding that they hold the 'ultimate responsibility' for making sure their products do not contain horse meat. He was speaking after attending an emergency meeting with bosses from leading supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, trade bodies and the FSA. Cruel: Wild horses abused and slaughtered in Romania may have been ended up in the UK (library image) A law banning horses from Romanian roads may be responsible for the surge in the fraudulent sale of horse meat on the European beef market, a French politician has claimed. Horse-drawn carts were a common form of transport for centuries in Romania, but hundreds of thousands of the animals are feared to have been sent to the abattoir after the change in road rules. The law, which was passed six years ago but only enforced recently, also banned carts drawn by donkeys, leading to speculation among food-industry officials in France that some of the 'horse meat' which has turned up on supermarket shelves in Britain, France and Sweden may, in fact, turn out to be donkey meat . 'Horses have been banned from Romanian roads and millions of animals have been sent to the slaughterhouse,' said Jose Bove, a veteran campaigner for small farmers who is now vice-president of the European Parliament agriculture committee. The scandal has seen chains Tesco, Lidl, Aldi and Iceland withdraw some products, and Mr Paterson said the industry has already begun plans to report test results on a quarterly basis. He said it is down to retailers to visit manufacturers and make sure they stick to the proper protocols to be sure themselves that the materials going into their products are what they are meant to be. They had also agreed that consumers should be compensated if they have bought withdrawn products with no questions asked, he said. Mr Paterson added: 'It's a question of either gross incompetence, but as I've said publicly and I'll repeat again, I'm more concerned there's actually an international criminal conspiracy here, and we've really got to get to the bottom of it. 'If there's a criminal act we will work with the authorities wherever they are to ensure the appropriate measures are taken. 'This is a conspiracy against the public. Selling a product as beef, and including a lot of horse in it is fraud.' Asked if there were any plans to test . for traces of other meats, such as dog, he replied: 'It may be very . isolated, it might be a small number of suppliers involved in the horse . trade we don't know. Investigation: Authorities are investigating of  Spanghero, at the centre of the horsemeat scandal . 'But I think that as we progress and we'll know more over the course of the next few weeks, we can decide what to do next.' He also said a ban on importing meat would not be allowed within the rules of the EU but could be brought in if beef contaminated with horse meat is found to be a health risk. Although no danger to humans has yet been found in eating the horsemeat so far detected, Mr Paterson said that if further tests find it does pose a risk he would 'take the necessary action'. Initial findings: Horsemeat from Romania was sold to a meat plant in South-West France owned by French firm Spanghero, which then supplied Comigel . The FSA said there is no evidence to suggest the horsemeat is a food safety risk but confirmed that tests have been ordered on products for the veterinary drug phenylbutazone as animals treated with 'bute' are not allowed to enter the food chain. Mr Paterson, appearing on BBC One's Sunday Politics show, said: 'This week obviously we'll be talking to counterparts across Europe, because ultimately this is European Union incompetence.' But asked if there should be a moratorium on meat imports in the EU, he said: 'That is not allowed within the European common market. 'If they find there is a product which could potentially be injurious to public health, emphatically, I will take the necessary action.' Asked if he would consider a ban if tests proved there was a food safety risk, he said: 'If there is a threat to public health that is allowed within the rules of the European market.' Prime Minister David Cameron described the matter as 'shocking' and 'completely unacceptable', while Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was 'appalling'. He added: 'I think people in the country will be quite shocked that horsemeat has been in the food that they have been innocently buying. The Government has got to get a grip on this situation.' The Trading Standards Institute has said the discovery of such high levels of horse meat suggests 'deliberate fraudulent activity'. Not hungry: Food minister David Heath (left) turns down a Findus meal from MoS man Nick Constable . Food safety experts have said there is no risk to public health. Findus said it carried out a full product recall on Monday, two days before DNA tests found that some of its lasagnes contained up to 100% horsemeat. The firm, which has its headquarters in London, tested 18 of its beef lasagne products, made by French food supplier Comigel, and found that 11 contained in the range of 60% to 100% horse meat. Comigel is supplied meat by Spanghero, also in France. Authorities in France have begun an urgent investigation into the two companies, and Findus is considering taking egal action against them . Food minister David Heath yesterday declined an offer from The Mail On Sunday of a Findus spaghetti bolognese ready meal. Mr Heath had insisted ready meals were safe following the withdrawal of the company's lasagne but said it would be 'bad politics' to follow former Tory Agriculture Minister Mr Gummer’s attempt to win public trust at the height of the 1990 mad cow crisis. Tesco and Aldi have also withdrawn a range of ready meals produced by Comigel over fears that they contained contaminated meat. Infamous photo call: Mr Heath said he wouldn't be 'revisiting' the John Selwyn Gummer saga who was photographed eating a burger and feeding some to his daughter Cordelia, 4, in an attempt to win public trust at the height of the 1990 BSE crisis . The GMB union said all hospitals, . schools and meals-on-wheels services should verify that horse meat had . not been served to vulnerable people. Responding . to fears that school dinners might be contaminated with horse meat, the . Department for Education said schools and councils were responsible for . their food contracts. A spokeswoman for the Local Authority Caterers Association said: 'We are as sure as we can be that this is not affecting the school catering area.' She added that there were 'strict guidelines' around food safety and supplying dinners in schools, including transparency and traceability of ingredient provenance, written into contracts.","Experts say beef is substituted for horse as part of multimillion pound scams .

"Jeremy Clarkson has denied posting a photograph of an 'entrance to slope' sign on Twitter following a backlash from his 4million followers. The Top Gear presenter, who was accused of using the term 'slope' to describe an Asian man while filming the programe earlier this year, said he did not compose the tweet which appeared on his account yesterday. The photograph, which has since been deleted, appeared on the 54-year-old's account accompanied with the caption: 'This is just obscene'. The photograph, which has since been removed, was posted from Mr Clarkson's Twitter account yesterday . It was retweeted more than 400 times before being removed from the social media site, and was published by the Daily Mirror today. Once it had been taken down from the site, Mr Clarkson told followers: 'Actually that last tweet wasn't from me.' He then  suggested someone had hacked into his phone, writing: 'It seems you can access a fingerprint iPhone using a number code. Must stay across these things.' In March the presenter was accused of using the word 'slope' in a racially offensive way to describe an Asian man while filming an episode of Top Gear in Burma. At one point in the programme, aired by BBC Two, Mr Clarkson stands with colleague Richard Hammond looking out over a makeshift bridge they built on the River Kwai. The presenter can be heard saying: 'That is a proud moment… but there’s a slope on it,' as a Burmese man walks towards them. Mr Clarkson denied posting the photograph himself, suggesting someone else used his iPhone to do so . The presenter was accused of using the term in a racially offensive way to describe a Burmese man an episode of Top Gear that was aired in March . Ofcom ruled the statement was was offensive, slamming the BBC for choosing not to edit out his comments. 'Jeremy Clarkson used the word ""slope"" to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge,' it ruled. Following a barrage of complaints, the programme's executive producer, Andy Wilman, apologised for the use of the term, saying it had been intended as a 'light-hearted word-play joke' and that the team had been unaware the term was considered offensive. Months later Mr Clarkson was embroiled in another racial row after being accused of using the word 'n*****' on camera. He apologised for any offence caused, posting an apology video online in which he admitted to being told by BBC bosses that he was 'drinking at the last chance saloon'. Mr Clarkson was not available for comment this evening. The BBC said that it was not commenting.","Jeremy Clarkson has denied posting a photograph of the sign on Twitter .

"It is a never-ending search. Even when the current residence is perfectly homely, the temptation to inspect neighbouring properties can prove hard to resist. High ceilings, big open living spaces, a remote location and good security are essential for that ideal des res. Thankfully, these house-hunters don’t have to worry about mortgage repayments or removal men - because they’re ants. On the move: Ants continually monitor their surroundings and will quickly up sticks if they find a more suitable place to call home . Scientists have found the insects continuously monitor surrounding real estate and will quickly up sticks and move if they find a more suitable home. The Bristol University research also showed rock ants will spend more time looking for that perfect location if their current nest is in poor condition and does not satisfy their needs, with the thoroughness of their research putting many human house-buyers to shame. Lead researcher Carolina Doran from Bristol University said: ‘This strategy of adjusting their information gathering according to their actual needs and the real value of higher rungs on the property ladder may help ants to evaluate their housing market in a measured and thorough way that puts many of us to shame.’ She added: ‘Previous research shows that ants will happily emigrate even if they don’t have to, if they find a nest that is nicer. The implication is that they are constantly monitoring their surrounding environment. Quick to move: Ants will redouble their efforts if their nest is disturbed or in poor condition . ‘Our study proves this to be the case, but also finds that the worse the current state of their nest, the more energy they put into house-hunting for a prospective new home. ‘You can compare their behaviour to staying in a range of hotels. Guests can choose a 1-star hotel, which will provide basic accommodation such as a clean bed and dry roof, but no luxuries. 'So individuals are more likely to head out and look for somewhere better to stay. The same with ants.’ The research, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, examined 15 ant colonies collected from Dorset. They found the creatures continuously scout their environment for available nest-sites even if their current one is intact. When assessing potential homes the ants looked for an open living space that can comfortably accommodate the entire colony. They also preferred good ceiling height, allowing them to stack their eggs, and a narrow entrance that is easier to defend. Dark homes were also desirable, as it means there are no other entrances, which could leave the colony open to invasion. Nests far from other ant colonies are favoured, a strategy that minimises the likelihood of disputes and increases the amount of food available through foraging. ‘The size of the nest they are looking for is directly linked to the size of the colony. The bigger the group, the bigger the desired home,’ said Miss Doran. ‘They also like a comfortable ceiling height so they can stack their eggs, although nothing too high which makes it feels cavernous. Not so picky: An insects search for a new home can be so thorough that it puts those perusing the human property market to shame . ‘Finally, there is a preference for small entrances, which makes the nest easier to guard. They prefer the dark, so no windows either. And as they do not get along with other colonies, they prefer to have their nests away from other groups of ants.’ Previous studies on rock ants, which nest among the rocks on the southern coast of England, also revealed that the creatures value a second opinion. When they do find a suitable nest they take a friend along with them to have a look at it.","Insects found to be more thorough than humans when looking for a home .

"President Barack Obama doubled down Thursday on his handling of the Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl prisoner swap, saying he makes 'no apologies' for releasing five Taliban terrorists in exchange for the safe return of an accused U.S. Army deserter. 'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents,' he said in Brussels during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron, 'and that the American people understand that this is somebody’s child and that we don’t condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back.' 'We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated, and we were deeply concerned about [him],' Obama told reporters about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'And we saw an opportunity and we seized it. And I make no apologies for that.' Hours later the Associated Press published claims that the administration told U.S. senators that they were kept in the dark about the hostage swap because the Taliban threatened to kill Bergdahl if information about the negotiations was leaked. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'I make no apologies': President Barack Obama spoke alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron during a news conference at the G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was returned to the United States by Taliban forces on Saturday after nearly five years in captivity, but the announcement that the Obama administration had secured his release was met with widespread criticism because five Taliban leaders were released in exchange . A jocular Obama addressed a wide variety of foreign-affairs topics, but got the most attention for his continued defense of the White House's actions in the Bergdahl affair . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited the crew of the USS Vella Gulf on June 5 in Constanta, Romania, taking time out to defend President Obama's decision to trade five terrorists for a U.S. Army sergeant accused od deserting his post . Keeping the negotiations secret because of a death threat, however, may not hold water and is already being described among congressional aides as a flimsy excuse. Congress was advised in 2011 and 2012 of two separate plans to make a similar deal, and nothing was leaked despite unanimous opposition on Capitol Hill. Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, was told in advance, and his staff didn't leak Obama's plans. 'I’m not sure I’m the only one,' Reid told reporters on Thursday. 'I mean, it's a big deal over nothing.' Saying he was unimpressed by concerns over the notification timeline in Congress, Reid channeled former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's famous one-liner about the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya. 'Is it Friday or is it Saturday?' he exclaimed. 'What difference does it make? What difference does it make?' The president also defended his decision in Brussels to appear publicly on Saturday with Bergdahl's parents in a press conference that has become an embarrassing feature of the deepening controversy. 'With respect to how we announced it, I think it's important for people to realize that this is not some abstraction,' Obama told reporters. 'This is not a political football.' 'You have a couple of parents whose kid volunteered to fight in a distant land, who they hadn't seen in five years, and weren't sure whether they'd ever see again. And as commander-in-chief of the United States armed forces, I am responsible for those kids.' Obama also pushed back against members of Congress – both Republicans and Democrats – for stirring up a hornet's nest of opposition to his handling of the prisoner swap. 'I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington, right?' he said. 'That's par for the course.' Hagel said Thursday that no one would have forgiven the U.S> if the White House had let Bergdahl die in captivity . Obama appeared with British PM David Cameron at the G7 meeting in Brussels, an event originally slated for Sochi, Russia but moved West because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine . Arizona Republican Senator John McCain and the 99 other U.S. senators received a private briefing Wednesday night from Obama administration officials about Bergdahl's release -- a move designed to quell anger on Capitol Hill from members of Congress who were kept out of the loop . A jocular Obama addressed a wide variety of foreign-affairs topics, but got the most attention for his continued defense of the White House's actions in the Bergdahl affair . Obama has . been widely accused of breaking a federal law that he signed in . December, by failing to notify Congress 30 days before releasing . detainees from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His . administration has justified the action by citing fears about . Bergdahl's health. Those concerns, according to a wide variety of news . reports, were first raised when the Taliban delivered a video to the . U.S. government in January showing a frail-looking Bergdahl apparently . in need of medical attention. However, . some believe that video appears to have been a ploy to accelerate . negotiations. In a subsequent video released by Taliban forces Tuesday . night, Bergdahl appeared strong and in good health when U.S. Special . Forces retrieved him from his captors. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel stood firm Thursday on concerns for Bergdahl's health, telling BBC News that 'it was our judgement, based on the information that we had, that his life, his health were in peril.' 'Can you imagine if we would have waited or taken the chance of leaks over a 30-day period?' he asked. 'I will tell you what I know and I made a judgement on this too – that would have seriously imperiled us ever getting him out.' Hagel added that the decision inside the White House to green-light the five-for-one hostage exchange was 'unanimous.' All 100 U.S. senators attended a private closed-door briefing Wednesday night with Obama administration officials, designed to quell anger on Capitol Hill among members of Congress upset about being out of the loop prior to the prisoner swap. Party canceled: Flags and balloons in Hailey, Idaho mark the release from captivity of local son Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, but town leaders have canceled a planned party for the accused deserter, officially citing costs as the reason . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) said he will file a bill in Congress next week that would block the Obama administration from releasing any more Guantanamo Bay prisoners like 'The Taliban Five' who were traded for Bergdahl . Some . senators said afterward that Bergdahl did not 'look good' in the . January proof-of-life video, which they were shown during the meeting. 'It . appeared that he was drugged and that he was barely responsive, in the . video itself,' Senate Intelligence Committee vice-chair Sen. Saxby . Chambliss, a Republican from Georgia, told reporters. Obama . referred to the Senate briefing on Thursday, saying that 'we’re now . explaining to Congress the details of how to move forward.' He said his administration had vaguely discussed with members of Congress the 'possibility that something like this might occur.' 'But . because of the nature of the folks we were dealing with and the fragile . nature of these negotiations, we felt it was important to go ahead and . do what we did.' A 2013 law . that Obama signed in December required Obama to provide chairmen of . congressional intelligence and foreign affairs committees with 30 days' notice before transferring Guantanamo Bay prisoners to foreign . countries. South . Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday that Obama will . face certain impeachment if he secretly released more prisoners in the . same fashion. And . Wednesday night on the Fox News Channel 'Hannity' program, Texas . Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he plans to introduce a bill formally . stopping the transfer of any more detainees from the military prison . camp.

"Warning: Khalid Mahmood MP has spoken of his fears that Muslim pupils are being indoctrinated by extremists at Birmingham schools . Extremist Muslims are trying to indoctrinate pupils at a dozen state schools in Birmingham, it has been claimed. Local MP Khalid Mahmood warned of the risk posed by religious radicals as it emerged that education authorities had widened their investigation into the allegations to include more than 12 different schools. In some schools non-Muslim teachers are reported to have been sidelined by Islamic extremists, who have allegedly imposed halal food in canteens and abolished sex education classes. The claims first came to light last month, when a letter referring to a 'Trojan Horse' plot to take over Birmingham schools was leaked to the Press, although its authenticity is unclear. Park View Academy was downgraded from 'outstanding' to 'inadequate' after allegedly being infiltrated by extremists, while the non-Muslim headmaster of Saltley School claims he was forced out of his job. Education Secretary Michael Gove is believed to have taken a personal interest in the investigation, which includes both faith schools and secular establishments. A source told the Sunday Times: 'Michael Gove has ordered an all-embracing investigation and has asked a number of department officials to drop everything and just focus on this. 'They will be going through financial records and interviewing staff members at more than 12 schools in Birmingham.' Investigation: Park View School is one of a dozen believed to be subject to an official probe . Mr Mahmood, the MP for Perry Barr in Birmingham, has called for a thorough investigation into the scandal. He said that some of the schools were run by members of the ultra-conservative Salafi sect, who may be 'trying to import their views into classrooms and the day-to-day running of the school'. Mr Mahmood added: 'The majority of kids are Sunni mainstream Muslims. It is an attempt at indoctrination. 'These are state schools, not Islamic. I am very concerned at the way non-Muslim staff have been dealt with and the effect on the children.' The Labour MP, who chairs the Tackling Terrorism All-Party Parliamentary Group, welcomed the intervention by the Department for Education and Ofsted. He suggested that education officials had previously steered clear of getting involved in disputes with Muslim schools for fear of being dubbed racist. 'Council officers were in a difficult position where they either went along with it or were portrayed as anti-Islamic,' Mr Mahmood said.","Department for Education widens probe to include 12 Birmingham schools .

"Cure-for-all: Botox has been officially approved as a treatment for 12 medical conditions . Botox is 25 this year – that’s how many years since it was  first approved for medical use. And although it’s best  known as an anti-wrinkle jab, last year just over half of its sales were for non-cosmetic uses. Its first use was as a treatment for eye spasms – the active ingredient, botulinum toxin, works by blocking the nerve signals that tell muscles to contract, temporarily paralysing them. Today, it’s widely used in children suffering from the limb stiffness of cerebral palsy, and this year it gained approval from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for treating ankle-movement problems after a stroke. Botox has been officially approved for 12 conditions, and it – or other botulinum toxins – are being investigated for more than 20 medical uses. Just this month, it was revealed that Botox may combat stomach cancer and trials are under way. ‘It really is a phenomenal drug,’ says Dr Mervyn Patterson, a cosmetic doctor who has been using Botox for more than 15 years. So, from top to toe, here are just a few of the more everyday  ailments Botox can treat. SWEATING . Hyperhidrosis, or extreme sweating, often can’t be controlled by antiperspirants. But multiple, superficial injections of Botox have been shown  in studies to reduce perspiration by more than  50 per cent in eight in ten patients. In half of patients, the effects last more than seven months. HOW DOES IT WORK? Botox temporarily blocks the secretion of the chemical responsible for switching on sweat glands. About 12 to 20 jabs are given in affected areas, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. JAB ME! Botox for hyperhidrosis has been approved and your GP can refer you for NHS treatment. It is also widely available privately from about £600. JOINT PAIN . Botox has been found to help knee, shoulder and hip pain caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In a study of patients with arthritis of the shoulder, a single Botox treatment improved pain in 38 per cent, compared with nine per cent who had a placebo injection. In separate studies, Professor Bazbek Davletov at Sheffield University has created a fusion of botulinum toxin with elements of the tetanus bug to create a new painkilling injection. HOW DOES IT WORK? Botox can block nerve signals that transmit pain messages to the brain. It can also ease muscle spasms and tightness around joints. The tetanus hybrid toxin appears to stop pain signals being sent from the spinal cord to the brain. JAB ME! The health company Allergan is conducting trials with the aim of seeking approval for arthritis treatment with Botox injections. The new hybrid drug is in preliminary studies. While research continues, proven treatment options – such as exercise, weight loss and medication – remain the focus of most arthritis treatment. Less of a sting: Although botox is best known as an anti-wrinkle jab, last year just over half of its sales were for non-cosmetic uses . INCONTINENCE . Many woman suffer incontinence, particularly after having children or the menopause. Women with a specific type called urge incontinence have trouble reaching the loo in time when they feel the need to urinate. Botox can improve symptoms in more than 90 per cent for up to a year . HOW DOES IT WORK? It’s thought that urge incontinence is due to spasming of the smooth bladder muscle –  Botox injected into the bladder wall reduces this activity without completely paralysing it, and increases its storage capacity. JAB ME! Botox for urinary incontinence is approved and available on the NHS for those for whom other drugs do not work. It is also available privately. FOOT PAIN . Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation on the sole of the foot that leaves sufferers unable to walk for months without pain. But a Mexican study found toxin jabs offered a speedy recovery. HOW DOES IT WORK? Six months after having injections, patients showed faster and better recovery than those who had steroid injections. JAB ME! More studies are needed before it becomes widely available. SCARRING . After . a wound from surgery such as a caesarean or an injury, some skin types . develop thick,  rope-like, keloid scarring. Dr Patterson says: . ‘Those . prone to keloid scarring generally know about it. Evidence has been . around for some time that if Botox is injected in and around a scar as . it is healing, the appearance is reduced.’ Helping hands: Different types of botox - botulinum toxins - are being investigated for more than 20 medical uses . HOW DOES IT WORK? ‘Reducing tensile force across a wound means less tension at the suture line, which translates into less scar tissue,’ explains Dr Patterson. ‘Tests on cells extracted from keloid wounds treated with Botox show less production of growth factors which stimulate scarring.’ JAB ME! Some cosmetic doctors are offering this treatment now. Cost varies greatly depending on size of wound but starts from £300. BACK PAIN . Back pain tops the league table of years lost to disability and costs the UK millions of work  days every year. According to Mr Robert Lee, consultant spinal surgeon at Spire Bushey Hospital (spirebushey.com) most back pain is caused by a muscular stiffness or spasms. Botox has been found in several small trials to relieve pain for up to four months in about 60 per cent of patients. HOW DOES IT WORK? Botox blocks communication between nerves and muscles so the muscle is not told to contract. Spasms stop or are greatly reduced. JAB ME! The studies so far have been small, and the treatment is not FDA or MHRA-approved, but it  is available at some BUPA hospitals on GP referral. Price on application. MIGRAINE . Patients who suffered an average of 20 days of migraine a month had injections into specific areas of the head and neck. After a year, 70 per cent had more than 50 per cent fewer attacks. HOW DOES IT WORK? No one knows quite how Botox works for migraine but it may reduce the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals in the brain that generate migraines. JAB ME! In 2010 both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – often considered a  gold standard – and the MHRA approved Botox for chronic migraine. Patients with chronic migraine with at least 15 days of headache of which eight are migraine, who don’t respond  to drug treatment, are eligible for NHS treatment. Patients should speak to their GP for referral. Private treatments are available and cost £500 to £600. TEETH GRINDING . Also known as bruxism – stress is thought to lead to involuntary clenching of the jaw muscles, typically in sleep. It can permanently damage teeth as well as causing headaches and jaw pain. Botox reduces grinding better than a placebo. HOW DOES IT WORK? Dr Patterson says: ‘Botox is placed in the masseter, the main chewing muscle. Relief is within days and works in the majority of people. Another injection is usually required three months later but the effect after this is often prolonged.’ JAB ME! Many cosmetic doctors and dentists offer this service, from about £300.","Over half of UK Botox sales in 2013 were for non-cosmetic uses .

The long-term goal is to get Vital’s intelligence to the stage where it can operate autonomously when making investment decisions. Eventually, the software is expected to get an equal vote on all financial decisions made by the company. ‘The variables involved in the long-term success of a biotechnology company are many and complex,’ said Deep Knowledge in a statement. ‘We were attracted to a software tool that could in large part automate due diligence and use historical data-sets to uncover trends that are not immediately obvious to humans surveying top-line data. ‘We plan to incorporate new information from prospective investments into the databases to compare the outcomes against our selected investments.’ The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years. But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims. A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness. He believes that integrated information can't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds, because the brain contextualises information. For example, when we see a red triangle our brains don't register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area, New Scientist reported. Instead we see it as a whole - a red triangle, we understand the 'wider picture'.","Robot was appointed by Hong-Kong venture capital firm Deep Knowledge .

"Most children wish for presents, candy and a party for their fifth birthday. But all Eliza O'Neill wants is the chance to live. The youngster, from Columbia, South Carolina, suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), a genetic and terminal disorder that means she lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function. The condition eventually causes a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Victims typically die before they are out of their teens. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making a wish: Four-year-old Eliza O'Neill (pictured), who suffers from Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A), will wish for the chance to live when she blows out the candles on her fifth birthday cake on Sunday, November 16 . Family: Eliza (pictured with her father, Glenn, mother, Cara, and brother) was born with the terminal disorder . Father and daughter: The youngster (pictured with her father) lacks an enzyme vital for normal cellular function, causing a lethal buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate -  which leads to leaning and behavioral problems . When Eliza's family launched a fundraising campaign to find a cure for the disease nearly a year ago, they said they expected her to lose her ability to speak by her birthday this weekend. And although the four-year-old can still talk, her father, Glenn O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. 'It's the disease beginning to catch up with her,' he told ABC News. 'This disease just kind of taunts you. You don't know when things are coming but you see them happening.' To celebrate her birthday on Sunday, Eliza will have a party with her father, mother Cara and brother in the family's backyard, where Mr O'Neill plans to dress up like a clown and juggle. At home and in hospital: When Eliza's family launched a fundraising campaign to find a cure for the disease nearly a year ago, they said they expected her to lose her ability to speak by her birthday this weekend . Sick: And although the four-year-old can still talk, her father, Glenn O'Neill said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things. Above, Eliza is seen in hospital with her mother . Campaign: To celebrate her fifth birthday on Sunday, Eliza will have a party with her family. But even the celebrations will not distract the O'Neill's from their fundraising efforts - they hope to raise $600,000 on day . But even the milestone celebrations will not distract  the O'Neill's from their fundraising efforts, with the family hoping to raise a staggering $600,000 on the day to help fulfill Eliza's wish to live. They have already gained more than $1.3million on a GoFundMe page, and another $400 elsewhere, in a bid to fund an upcoming clinical trial for a gene therapy they hope will cure Eliza. Sanfilippo Syndrome (Type A) is a genetic and terminal disorder that affects around one in 70,000 live births. Victims lack an enzyme that is essential for normal cellular function. The condition eventually causes a buildup of a toxic material - heparin sulfate - leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Sufferers typically die before they are out of their teens. There is no known cure. The funds - which have come from more than 26,000 donors from 70 different countries - means the family is close to their goal. Although there is no guarantee that the treatment will get approved or work - or that Eliza will get into the clinical trial - her father said he and his family had to try. 'If we don't get the trial funded, and we don't get it up and running, the guarantee is that she has no chance,' he told the news station. He added that the family has remained at home for the past six months to prevent Eliza from catching any viruses. Her mother, a pediatrician, has left her job, while her brother is being homeschooled.

"Matriarch: Christine Fitzgibbon, 60, trained her two sons Jason and Ian to build an untouchable crime empire in which heroin was smuggled into the UK from all corners of the world . A grandmother has been unmasked as an underworld matriarch who coached her two sons into building an international crime empire - while her family was shamelessly claiming £1,500-a-month in benefits. Christine Fitzgibbon, 60, schooled sons Jason and Ian as budding gangsters from their early teens, then lived off the proceeds of their global drug-dealing network. Secret recordings exposed how the grandmother-of-seven continued to keep a close eye on the violent pair, who regarded themselves as ‘untouchable’. One was told off for turning up at the family home in a brand-new Porsche, while she booked their flights to meet suppliers and even advised them on exchange rates so they weren’t ripped off by continental drug barons. Officers compared Christine to the domineering Violet Kray who brought up Ronnie and Reggie in East End of London. The tapes which finally brought the Fitzgibbon clan to justice also captured Jason, 40, boasting he was ‘ten times better’ at being a gangster than his 39-year-old brother and singing along to the Jessie J song ‘Price Tag’. Yesterday their mother was branded the company secretary of the feared ‘Fitzgibbon Plc’ crime family as the gang were jailed for a total of more than 44 years over a plot to flood the UK with drugs worth £64million imported from Turkey. She lived in an unremarkable detached house in Liverpool but enjoyed holidays at their luxurious €330,500 villa in Spain and had numerous overseas bank accounts. When police raided the house, they found another £180,000 hidden under the floor of one of the bedrooms, with more in a hollow table leg in the dining room. And yet Mrs Fitzgibbon and her husband were also claiming £1,500 a month in state handouts, including disability benefits. Groomed to be gangsters: Jason Fitzgibbon, left, and his brother Ian, right, operated a global drug-dealing network with their mother Christine acting as company secretary . Unremarkable: The detached home in Mossley Hill, Liverpool, from where the Fitzgibbon family built up a crime empire they thought was 'untouchable' Detectives from the elite Serious Organised Crime Agency sneaked an electronic listening device into the family’s three bedroom house in Mossley Hill and secretly bugged Mrs Fitzgibbon as she boasted of her son’s crimes. They finally rounded up the family after a series of raids last year having uncovered a plot by Jason and Ian to flood the UK with drugs imported from Turkey. The boys’ father, William, now 65, began his criminal career when he was just 14 with burglaries and car thefts, and their mother ensured they would follow in his footsteps. As young teenagers she oversaw protection rackets they ran to extort money from local businesses, later moving on to shoplifting and car theft. They grew up to be feared hardmen setting up drug deals in Holland, Spain and Colombia, living in modest houses but driving flash cars. But when one turned up at the family house in a brand new Porsche, his mother snapped: ‘You’re bringing unwanted attention to yourself - don’t go driving fast cars.’ In 2000 Jason and Ian were convicted of conspiracy to supply heroin and were jailed for eight and seven years respectively. Cash dumped: Police found £180,000 of drugs money stashed under the floorboards at the Fitzgibbon family home . No shame: Despite helping her two sons run a drugs empire, Christine Fitzgibbon was receiving £1,500 a month in benefits . After their release they were arrested in . Holland over a £1million heroin haul, but cleared over phone tap . evidence, returning to the UK convinced they were ‘untouchable’, . detectives say. Christine Fitzgibbon managed the entire network like a legitimate company secretary, according to police, booking multiple flights for each trip in a bid to throw detectives off their scent and even advising them on the latest exchange rates. In one family exchange bugged by police, she said to Jason ‘You’ve not done a day’s work in your life’, to which he replied: ‘You got us into this mum.’ A life of crime: Cash courier Neil WIlliams, left, was locked up for 21 months for his part in the conspiracy while enforcer Danie Smith, right, was caught in Turkey with £7million of heroin . In another, father-of-three Jason brags that he’s the more successful gangster, boasting: ‘Whatever he can do mum, I can do ten times better.’ He was also taped singing ‘It’s all about the money’ to the tune of Jessie J. When Jason was held in a police swoop over a £100,000 cash seizure, she was heard silencing Ian as he asked whether she thought his brother would ‘get away with it’. ‘It depends what they’ve hit him with, doesn’t it?’ she retorts, adding: ‘Just hope it wasn’t what I give him yesterday. It’s a good job I took that f****** thing out of the house, wasn’t it?’ The crime empire began to crumble in 2011 when officers from the Turkish police swooped on a drug deal and found 57kg of heroin worth £7million which was linked to the Fitzgibbons. Crumbling empire: The Fitzbiggons' operation began to unravel when the Turkish Army caught one of their associates with £7million of heroin in 2011 . Caught out: Daniel Smith, 26, was found with 57kg of heroin linked to the Fitzgibbons clan in Turkey . Busted: Smith was jailed for ten years for conspiracy to supply heroin . Jason had already been jailed for a separate punishment beating of a car dealer. At Manchester Crown Court yesterday, their mother admitted money laundering and was jailed for two years. Father of three Ian admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and Ecstasy and money laundering and was jailed for 14 and a half years, while Jason admitted conspiracy to import heroin and money laundering and received a 16 year sentence. Enforcer Daniel Smith, 26, was given ten years for conspiracy while fellow gang member Neil Williams, 32, also of Liverpool, was jailed for 21 months after admitting money laundering. The case against Neil Harrison, 40, was adjourned and laundering charges against William Fitzgibbon were allowed to lie on file.

Hub of the empire: The interior of the family home in Mossley Hill, Liverpool, from where the Fitzgibbons ran their drug-dealing business . Deals: Jason Fitzgibbon is pictured in a black t-shirt after arriving back from a trip to Turkey to buy drugs . Jailing Mrs Fitzgibbon, Judge Michael Henshell told her she was a ‘dominant figure’ in the criminal enterprise. ‘You knew precisely what you were involved in, you knew precisely where the money was coming from and you enjoyed the lifestyle that went along with it,’ he added. Afterwards Matt Burton, head of investigations at SOCA, said: ‘Christine was the matriarch of a crime family running a criminal business engaged in violence and intimidation. ‘She resolved internal disputes - in fact everything revolved around her. ‘The home was the hub for their enterprise - it was where the criminal enterprise was born and where they would conduct business.’","Christine Fitzgibbon, 60, schooled sons Jason and Ian as gangsters .

"Botox empire: Apprentice champion . Leah Totton . This year’s Apprentice winner has ‘totally inadequate medical skills’ for her plan to build a ‘Botox empire’ of cosmetic clinics, experts warned last night. Newly qualified doctor Leah Totton is ‘putting patients at risk’ and ‘using Lord Sugar as a marketing tool’, according to a leading cosmetic surgeon. The 24-year-old beat self-styled ‘business Barbie’ Luisa Zissman to win the BBC 1  show last night. After impressing Lord Sugar with her plan to open a series of Botox clinics offering wrinkle-busting facial fillers, Miss Totton won a £250,000 cash investment plus access to his business expertise. But consultant plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer, a former chairman of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, warned yesterday she lacked the requisite medical skills to carry out the procedures. He said: ‘At her level of training, she will have a basic knowledge of immunology and some knowledge of anatomy. ‘She may have done a few weeks’ training in aesthetic medicine, but that is simply not enough. It may not be quite as dangerous as putting a hairdresser in charge of cosmetic surgery, but it is still putting patients at risk.’ Miss Totton – labelled ‘Dr Totty’ by . some of her detractors – works in the A&E department of Newham .

Totton was labelled a WAG when it emerged she had a four-year . relationship with Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster until they split . earlier this year, but she insisted she was ‘work-driven’, adding: ‘I am . so serious. Literally Mrs Serious.’ She also boasted she had completed a course in ‘medical aesthetics’ at Harley Street in London. But . Mr Mercer, who is involved in drafting cosmetic surgery legislation . across the EU, said: ‘This result flies in the face of all that we have . been doing to keep patients safe. Totton wants to 'provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments' 'There is widespread agreement in the industry that doing a short course does not make you qualified to perform cosmetic procedures.’ He added: ‘She is using Lord Sugar as a marketing tool to get her business going. This industry is very saturated, and this show has just given her a big leg up.’ In the interview stage of the show, Miss Totton was accused of ‘potentially making money out of young girls maybe not feeling good about themselves’. But she defended her plan saying she wants to ‘provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments’.","Newly qualified doctor Leah Totton is 'putting patients at risk' and 'using Lord Sugar as a marketing tool', leading cosmetic surgeon claims ."
"Approximately 600,000 Americans work at least 50 miles from home and take at least 90 minutes to get there according to a newly recognized demographic by the U.S. Census Bureau called megacommuters. The agency found that the percentage of Americans who traveled at least 90 minutes to work daily has inched higher in the last two decades even as the number of people who work from home has soared by 45 percent. The biggest concentration of megacommuters is in California where the longest commute by the greatest number is also there, stretching a mean distance of 68 miles from San Bernardino County to Los Angeles County, at a time of 104.2 minutes. Scroll down for interactive graphic . Slog: WNYC turned the Census Bureau figures into an interactive graphic. The darker colors indicate the longest commutes . Easy ride: Workers living on Manhattan have a fairly easy commute, but the routes into Manhattan have some of the highest number of mega-commuters in the country. Gridlock: Unsurprisingly two counties outside LA have the longest megacommutes in the country . Most popular route: The longest commute by the greatest number of megacommuters stretches a mean distance of 68 miles from California's San Bernardino County to Los Angeles County, pictured . WNYC have taken the Census Bureau figures and turned them into a fascinating interactive map so workers can see how they compare to others around the country. In contrast the average one-way daily U.S. commute is 25.4 minutes and just one in four commuters leave their home counties for work the Census Bureau said, basing their finding on its annual American Community Survey. Just over 2 percent of workers in the San Francisco area are considered megacommuters, those who travel at least 90 minutes and 50 miles to work daily. Megacommuters make up less than 1 percent of U.S. workers. Three-quarters of megacommuters are male, and they are more likely to be married, older, make a higher salary and have a spouse who does not work. They also are likely to leave for work before 6 a.m., according to the study. Public transport is used by 23 percent of workers with long commutes, or those traveling 60 minutes or more, compared with 5.4 percent for all workers. The highest areas of commuters are seen here with the San Francisco Bay area taking the majority of riders . Sharing the road: Public transport is used by 23 percent of workers with long commutes, or those traveling 60 minutes or more, compared with 5.4 percent for all workers . 'The average travel time for workers who commute by public transportation is higher than that of workers who use other modes,' Brian McKenzie, the study's author, said in a statement. He said that for some workers, using public transit is a necessity. For others, public transit - even if it takes longer - is a better option than going by car and sitting in traffic. About 2.5 percent of U.S. commuters traveled 90 minutes or more in 2011, a percentage that has remained stable since about 2005 but is up from 1.5 percent in 1990. Even as long commutes remain a fact of life for millions of U.S. workers, the number of people who work from home rose to 13.4 million in 2010 from 9.2 million in 1997, the Census Bureau said. Home-based workers are concentrated in the western United States. The greatest percentage are in Boulder, Colorado, at 10.9 percent of the local workforce. Home-based work in computer, engineering and science jobs rose 69 percent from 2000 to 2010, to 432,000 workers.","Megacommuters make up less than 1 percent of U.S. workers .

Two of his security guards and one police officer were killed in the clash, while eight other alleged members of Orellana's gang were also arrested. After he was apprehended, Orellana was taken to the capital for his first hearing and now faces extradition to the US.

"Robert Lawrence was shot in the head while fighting in the Falklands War . Warfare is seldom out of the news nowadays. Yet very few of us have ever experienced the horror of it. Robert Lawrence is an exception. Robert, 54 – who is currently selling Bradshott Farm, his barn conversion near Selborne in Hampshire – won the Military Cross in the Falklands War when, as a Scots Guards officer, he took part in the assault on Mount Tumbledown. ‘I still love soldiering,’ he says, carrying a slight limp and a withered arm as he leads me across the gravelled boules court at the front of the barn complex. ‘I’d be back in Ukraine or Iraq now if I had the chance.’ It is a surprising admission, especially considering the full story of Lawrence’s last battle, on June 13, 1982, the final day of the Falklands War. After a fierce firefight, during which he shot 14 Argentine soldiers, he ran out of ammunition. Undeterred, he then stormed the enemy defences, stabbing three of them with his bayonet. As he stood on the top of Tumbledown Mountain, he turned to one of his men and shouted: ‘Isn’t this fun!’ At that moment a sniper’s bullet hit the side of his head, blowing away 43 per cent of his brain. Unsurprisingly, the following years involved some grim periods of rehabilitation – and also saw him write a bestselling book that became the Bafta-winning TV movie Tumbledown, starring Colin Firth as Robert. In 2002, Robert and his wife, Marion, 55, embarked on a demanding new project – which proved very therapeutic for him: they decided to site-manage the conversion of a derelict old barn. ‘It was not unlike a military exercise,’ Robert says. ‘It was something to get my teeth into with a bunch of men and it meant leading by example, making the right decisions quickly.’ It was an ambitious project. The U-shape Victorian barn that the couple bought for £680,000 was an ugly red-brick structure with oil tanks in the garden. Transforming it cost more than £2 million and took 11 months. Bad barn conversions lose control of proportions and scale – bits of spare space make rooms that have no obvious use, and open-plan design can create a furniture-store showroom effect. In 2002, Robert and his wife, Marion, 55, embarked on a demanding new project – turning a derelict Victorian barn into the beautiful home, above . The Lawrences’ conversion, however, is a mixture of cleverly planned, functional rooms – kitchen, study, snug and library – in the right portion of the main building, leaving space to the left for the real show-stopper, jokingly referred to as the ‘great hall’. The main problem posed by the barn was the absence of any interesting features. They set about adding their own. Today, Indian carvings serve as stanchions above the 17th Century Chinese doors in the kitchen. Gothic-style stone arches add an ecclesiastical tone. Price: £2.7 million . Location: Near Selborne, Hampshire . Bedrooms: Six (plus three in cottage) Unique features: Swimming pool, ‘great hall’, fish pond, 2.5-acre grounds . There is hand-painted wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom, where, incidentally, Robert keeps his medals. The book shelves dividing the landing from the snug have all been beautifully hand-crafted and there is a bed from a Far East opium den where you may have expected to find a sofa. The attention to detail in the hall must have driven the architect, Richard Ashby, to distraction. At first, British oak boards for the floor ‘looked too laminated’ – they wanted broad boards with more knots. French boards weren’t right. Eventually they found the perfect look in Germany. Who was behind such meticulous work? ‘We share it,’ says Marion, a former actor and designer. ‘Robert is amazing at visualising space and organisation. I’m the sourcer. I fine-tune the feel of the interior.’ The two wings to the barn also work well, as the bedrooms for the couple’s children, Conrad, 27, Court, 23, Max, 19, and Matilda, 17. There are yet more thoughtful touches – each bedroom has a mezzanine and the master bedroom opens on to a lovely little rose garden. The property stands in 2½ acres of grounds – and even and includes a separate detached cottage. Impressive: The spacious 'great hall' comes with a huge fireplace and British oak floorboards . Nowadays Robert, who has also worked in film production, mixes business interests in property with charity work: he gives talks to – and runs motivational expeditions for – injured veterans. The children flying the nest has prompted the Lawrences to look for somewhere smaller, and Robert refuses to be sentimental over the selling the barn, which is on the market for £2.7 million. However, just before I leave he shows me an email he has just received. It is from one of the Argentine troops he fought against in that war of 32 years ago, addressing him in the most glowing terms. ‘I feel more simpatico to soldiers like that than I do for some civilians I meet,’ he says. ‘I loved military life – the decision-making and the precision of it all. After that, the trivia of day-to-day life seems awful.’ It is hard to avoid the thought that wherever Robert Lawrence moves to next, Mount Tumbledown will never be far away.","Robert Lawrence was shot in the head while fighting in the Falklands War .

"The rodeo clown behind the President Barack Obama mask that outraged many claims he has received death threats for the ‘joke.’ Tuffy Gessling has received several death threats and was suspended for life from the Missouri State Fair after an August 10 stunt in which he dressed up as the president and was chased by a bull – a routine he says he has done for decades dating all the way back to Ronald Reagan. ‘I didn’t do this to do any hating on anyone,’ Gessling told KCTV, ‘I did it to be funny. I did it to be a joke. This clown bit has been around for generations.’ Scroll down for video . Not racist: Rodeo clown Tuffy Gessling swears this stunt was not racist . Caught on video and posted to social media, the act went viral and garnered national attention for what many saw was a blatantly racist jab at the nation’s first African-American president, a perception Gessling explained is misguided. ‘I didn’t think anything more of it than what we’ve done 15 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago when we’ve done it with Bush, Clinton and Ronald Reagan,’ he told the station. The fallout from the act was swift and brutal – a lifetime ban from the Missouri State Fair, scores of people accusing him of being a racist, criticism from locals, politicians and other celebrities. ‘I’ve had one lady spit in my face, [she] called me a dirty name, spit in my face and walked off,’ the rodeo clown said. Fan favorite: Gessling poses with unidentified children during previous rodeos . Gessling has even received five death threats. I’ve had somebody threaten to run me over, one of them wanted to burn the house down,’ a visibly shaken Gessling shared. The scorned entertainer believes the outrage over the act comes from Americans losing their sense of humor. ‘I actually think that a lot of people have lost their ability to laugh,’ Gessling told the station. Look at this country as a whole, there’s a lot more to be mad at than a rodeo clown, at a rodeo, trying to make somebody laugh.’ The rodeo circuit veteran insisted that he is not racist. ‘I never did anything because of anybody’s race, I don’t care what color somebody is – if they’re blue, white, green, polka dotted, striped, it doesn’t bother me one bit,’ said Gessling. Send in the clown: Gessler claims he will answer any and all questions from any politicians at his next rodeo . Gessling told the station that he has received far more support than derision, with celebrities and even a few country music stars sending him their well wishes and support, though he curiously did not name any and none have publicly spoken out in his favor. Telling the station that he may even do the bit again, Gessling declined to tell the station whether he was a Democrat or Republican, instead saying only ‘I am a rodeo clown.’ The accused racist told the station he has a rodeo coming up in Jefferson City, Missouri and has invited politicians to come out and ask any questions they may have – even President Obama. ‘If President Obama turns out, I’d be honoured to shake his hand.’","The August 10 stunt outraged many, with even politicians weighing in .

"Philae probe ran out of energy yesterday after it rested against a cliff or crater wall with little sunlight to recharge,  but only after radioing back results of first and probably last batch of experiments to scientists . It is a 10-year mission hailed as a huge advance in learning about the darkest recesses of the universe, but that didn't stop the Philae probe from running out of battery power after just two days. The pioneering robotic spacecraft shut down yesterday after radioing results of its first and probably . last batch of scientific experiments from the surface of a . comet, scientists said. Batteries aboard the European Space Agency's Philae comet . lander drained, shutting down the washing machine-sized probe . after an adventurous and largely unscripted 57-hour mission.

Photos and other data relayed by Philae show it finally . landed against a cliff or crater wall where there was little . sunlight to recharge its batteries. Racing against the clock, . scientists activated a series of automated experiments, the . first to be conducted from the surface of a comet. Philae's last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars towards the sun, its batteries may recharge enough for a follow-on mission to learn about the chemical composition of organic molecules .

Its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet . soars towards the sun, Philae's batteries may recharge enough . for a follow-on mission.

"Paul Periot allegedly botched an operation to treat genital blisters which saw his patient's penis amputated . Another of the doctor's patients lost his manhood after  a penile implant operation went wrong . Paul Perito has previously been accused of selling prescription drugs from his strip club . Snip: Dr Paul Perito has been accused of botching penis operation . A Miami urologist has been accused of mangling a patient's penis so badly it had to be amputated - and it is not the first time. Dr Paul Perito, 50, is once again facing a lawsuit after amputating a man's penis following a series of botched operations. The physician is already fighting an ongoing lawsuit by another patient who also claims to have lost his penis at the doctor's hands. The father has in the past also been charged with organised fraud and racketeering linked to PlayPen strip club in which he was a partner, reports the Miami New Times. The latest lawsuit comes from a man, known only as Hank, who was in jail for drink-driving when he developed blisters on his penis three years ago. This led to a series of botched operations, resulting in him having his penis amputated, according to the New Times. The doctor who he says is most responsible for robbing him of his manhood is Dr Perito. The 51-year-old Floridan has filed a lawsuit against the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) and six doctors, including Perito. After four penis surgeries with increasingly catastrophic results. Hank had to undergo a 'partial penectomy'. 'When I woke up, I had a hose run up inside me, and everything else was . cut off — completely amputated,' Hank told the New Times close to tears. Perito has denied any negligence in Hank's treatment, blaming the patient's 'actions or omissions', reports the New Times. Devastated: Enrique Millas and his wife Gloria, are taking action against the doctor after he removed Millas' penis following an alleged botched operation . Hank had spent two years at the Okeechobee Correctional Institution when he developed the blisters and was sent to South Miami's Larkin Community Hospital, where Perito examined him in June 2009. Hank told the New Times that the urologist 'debrided' the organ - stripping it of contaminated tissue - and then packed it with gauze and stitched it up. He attached three strings to pull the . packing out, like a tampon, within five days, reports the New Times. In an apparent bid by the DOC to cut . costs, Hank was sent from Larkin to Kendall Regional Medical Center where he claims doctors were confused by Perito's method and were unable to reach him. Maintaining innocence: Dr Paul Perito, 50, has denied any negligence in Hank's treatment, blaming the patient's 'actions or omissions' The gauze was not removed and it was not until nearly three weeks . later, on July 17, after Hank's penis  became infected a Kendall urologist treated him for gangrene. Within the next three weeks, Hank endured two more operations. On August 14, . Perito finally inspected what was left of his handiwork, and three days later Hank had the amputation. Asked by the New Times if he still experiences sexual urges, Hank breaks down. 'Sometimes I have dreams. But I'm in . so much pain, sex is the last thing on my mind. I don't think they have . enough money to pay me for what they've done to me. 'They can never replace it. They can't give me a rubber leg. I don't know what they'd put there.' Botched: The man developed blisters and was sent to South Miami's Larkin Community Hospital, where Perito examined him in June 2009 . Perito, who was first licensed in . Florida in 1994, runs a private practice - Perito Urology -  providing . of penile implants, which keep his patients permanently erect. In August 2007, he performed an allegedly botched penile implant operation on Enrique Millas, reports the New Times. The 62-year-old man's penis became gangrenous, so the doctor removed most of it. Millas sued Perito two years later claiming the . complications arose from his diabetes, which the doctor should have . foreseen, however Perito claims they were caused by Millas not following . advice and having sex . too soon. Accused: Perito faced charges related to the alleged sale of diluted or counterfeit prescription drugs from his Goulds strip club, Playpen South . In 2004 Perito faced dozens of counts involving the illegal sale of prescription drugs under federal RICO racketeering statutes, according to the report. But he entered a pretrial diversion program for only one minor charge: illegal possession of prescription drugs: he was ordered to have counseling, pay almost $3,000 costs and a $15,000 fine to keep his license, reports the New Times. Hank, who was released from  prison in March 2010, has also filed a suit against Larkin Hospital, and doctors  Carpio, Haridas Bhadja, Robert Hernandez, Pedro Kiliddjian, and Michael Mirander, who all deny negligence. The lawsuit claims Perito 'breached his duty of care... resulting in pain, disability, disfigurement, and mental anguish.' reports the New Times.","Paul Periot allegedly botched an operation to treat genital blisters which saw his patient's penis amputated .

"It is a tale of sheer determination in the face of almost unbelievable adversity - a mountain climber left for dead after breaking his leg and tumbling into a crevasse. Few who have read Joe Simpson's brilliant book Touching the Void, or seen the 2003 documentary of the same name, remain unmoved by the author's bravery and incredible will to survive. But the 1988 work appears to have struck an entirely different chord with dozens of teenagers tasked with studying it for their GCSE English literature exams. Survivor: Climber Joe Simpson hit back at GCSE students who bombarded his Twitter page with offensive posts about having to study his 1988 book Touching the Void . Decisively unimpressed with his gripping first-person account, the students took to Twitter, branding  Simpson a 'Crevasse W*****' and blaming him for failing their exams. But as fans of the author know only too well, he isn't the type to take things lying down, and he hit back with a series of tweets describing the sulking students as 'loathsome scroats'. Gripping: Simpson's incredible tale of survival has become part of mountaineering folklore . The hilarious exchanges have quickly became an internet sensation with Simpson gaining thousands of new followers in the space of a few days . One angry student had tweeted: 'Your book is the reason my entire year will fail our English exam!! Learn to write you illiterate fool.' Another ranted: 'You seem like a nice chap, but why the f*** did you have to write that book?' To which Simpson replied: 'To p*** you off.' One of the most lively exchanges was with Turkish student Orkun Kurtduman who tweeted: ‘hi joe! i wrote you a few months ago. i said i had an exam about your book. i failed because of you. you owe to me! To which Simpson replied:'Nope, you’re just crap at English.' But the student hit back writing: 'i am a student who learn english; but you are a stupid who fell down on the mountain.' Another student wrote: 'Your book is s*** and you should feel bad.' And another fumed: 'Three chapters of crawling didn't inspire me to write about your book in my exam. It was rather boring really.' Not all the students were as unimpressed with one writing: 'I really enjoyed the book, I think I did well in my english lit GCSE because of you :) thanks' But by Wednesday night the author appeared to be getting more than a little hacked off: 'A lovely day of children writhing in their hellish hormonal middens … good night vile innocents may you all seethe in bilious acid pus ...' And yesterday he declared: 'Ok bored of this now so I’ll either stop twitter or block all school kids – shame on the good ones – but the loathsome scroats can sod off!' Abuse: Some of the posts between Joe and the GCSE students . Mr Simpson told Mail Online that he had found the whole incident rather funny. He said: 'I suppose I deserve all the abuse I get. But I did find the term Crevasse W***** quite amusing. 'Every year when it gets to around exam time I start getting these abusive tweets. The funniest thing is that most of them have obviously only watched the film and not even bothered to read the book. 'I like using Twitter to talk to like-minded people but it's got to the point I'm having to block every child who tweets me. 'At first I thought it was a great honour to have the book used as a GCSE text but now it's becoming a pain in the backside.' In 1985, Joe Simpson and friend Simon Yates set out to climb the treacherous west face of the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. The already challenging ascent was beset with difficulties from the start as the climbers found themselves in a fierce storm and forced to tackle dangerous formations of soft powder snow. Nevertheless they successfully reached the 21,000 ft summit on the third day. But as they began to make their way down disaster struck; Joe slipped down an ice cliff smashing his knee and breaking his right leg. With no fuel left for their stoves the two men were unable to make any drinking water and with darkness drawing in they needed to climb down a further 3000ft to their base camp fast. Yates attempted to lower Simpson down the mountain by tying two lengths of rope together. But in the poor conditions he accidentally lowered him off a cliff. They found themselves in a terrifying predicament with Yates unable to see or hear Simpson or pull him back up and Simpson too weak and frostbitten to climb up the rope himself. After remaining in this deadlocked position for a while, it became obvious to Yates that the attachments holding him to the mountain would soon give way. If that happened they would both be pulled to their deaths. Yates was faced with the awful decision - either die on the mountain or sacrifice his friend in order to save his own life. He had no choice but to cut the rope causing Simpson to plunged 150ft into a deep crevasse. Incredibly, despite his broken leg, Simpson survived, landing on a small ledge inside the crevasse. When Yates reached the entrance to the crevasse he called out for his friend but, on hearing no reply, was forced to assume that he had died. Simpson eventually regained consciousness. He saw the rope had been cut and realised Yates would have presumed he had dead. Freezing, injured and alone somehow Simpson managed to abseil onto a thin ice roof a short way down the crevasse. From there he managed to climb back up to the glacier via a steep snow slope. But his ordeal had only really begun. From there he was forced to spend three days with no food and virtually no water, crawling hopping and clawing his way the five miles back to their base camp. Incredibly he made it back to the tents a matter of hours before Yates had planned to head back. His story has since become mountaineering folklore.","Climber Joe Simpson survived after being left for dead with a broken leg on the mountains of Peru .

"They've already been shown to ease arthritic joints and be beneficial to the developing brains of children. Now research has shown that fish oils can also help smokers kick the habit. Fish oils contain omega-3 fatty acids. Current medical advice is to eat two portions of fish a week, including one portion of oily fish such as tuna or mackerel. Omega-3s are also found in leafy vegetables, wholewheat bread and walnuts. So what can they do for you – and is a supplement sometimes better? EVE McGOWAN spoke to the experts to find out… . Scroll down for video . Current medical advice is to eat two portions of fish a week, including one portion of oily fish such as tuna or mackerel . A boost for brain power . THE CLAIM . Omega-3 supplements for children – the modern-day alternative to cod liver oil – help their developing brains. THE PROOF . Numerous trials have shown that they can improve the behaviour and learning of children with ADHD and learning disabilities. More recently, Dr Alex Richardson, at Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, studied underperforming children aged seven to nine. After taking daily supplements for 16 weeks, their behaviour and reading improved. SUPPLEMENT OR DIET? Dr Richardson says: ‘Almost all the children failed to eat enough fish so supplements are a reasonable option.’ Preventing a heart attack . THE CLAIM . Fish oils can do everything from lowering cholesterol to improving blood pressure and are an essential for heart health among at-risk groups. THE PROOF . Omega-3s are known to reduce the inflammation of the arteries which can lead to heart attacks, as well as being an anticoagulant that can improve blood flow. ‘There is also evidence that they can help in normalising irregular heart rhythms,’ says Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College, London. SUPPLEMENT OR DIET? Supplements are prescribed on the NHS to prevent heart-attack survivors from having a second attack, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. A study published in the journal Neurology earlier this year found that a diet rich in omega-3s can increase volume of the part of the brain responsible for memory and protect against dementia . Improving your memory . THE CLAIM . Omega-3s have been hailed as a cure-all for brain health, and there are a variety of supplements on the market, from pills to drinks, all promising to improve cognitive function. THE PROOF . A study published in the journal Neurology earlier this year found that a diet rich in omega-3s can increase volume of the part of the brain responsible for memory and protect against dementia. Omega-3s are also believed to reduce the formation of plaque in the brain, which has been linked to Alzheimer’s. SUPPLEMENT OR DIET? It is likely that omega-3s from diet alone may be enough to deliver benefits. Why the eyes must have it . THE CLAIM . The miraculous properties of fish oil can even extend to saving your eyesight in old age – hence the plethora of eye supplements aimed at those aged over 60. THE PROOF . Experiments carried out at Harvard University demonstrated that mice fed a diet high in omega-3s were less likely to suffer from retinal bleeding – the trigger for many cases of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. It may help protect against dry eye syndrome too. SUPPLEMENT OR DIET? ‘If you eat the recommended amount of fish you should derive enough omega-3s from your diet,’ says Dr Richardson. Aid stiff joints - with salmon . Pregnant women are advised to limit – but not stop entirely – their consumption of oily fish because of the concern over certain toxins . THE CLAIM . Fish oils help improve the aches and pains suffered by countless rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. THE PROOF . The anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s have been shown to benefit those with rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain and swelling in the joints. High doses over several months are usually needed. Milder joint inflammation is much more common, and this can be reduced by ensuring a good intake of fish and seafood. SUPPLEMENT OR DIET? A Swedish study involving 32,000 women found that eating salmon once a week can cut the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis by half. Reducing the risk of miscarriage . THE CLAIM . The dietary advice for pregnant women is constantly changing, but a range of supplements containing fish oils consistently promise to improve the health and wellbeing of expectant mothers and improve the brain development of their unborn child. THE PROOF . Research has found that fish oils taken in pregnancy can reduce depressive symptoms in the mother, while other studies have shown that levels of fish and seafood consumed by pregnant women even have an effect on the child’s IQ. Meanwhile, a recent Australian study of pregnant rats also showed that a diet rich in omega-3s may reduce the risk of miscarriage by reducing inflammation of the placenta. SUPPLEMENT OR DIET? ‘Pregnant women are advised to limit – but not stop entirely – their consumption of oily fish because of the concern over certain toxins. Some may feel a daily supplement is a safer way of achieving a beneficial dose,’ says dietician Lucy Jones, of the British Dietetic Association.","The current medical advice is to eat two portions of fish a week .

"The closure of two A&E units has caused chaos at nearby hospitals, leaving them with the longest waiting times in the country, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Despite assurances that shutting the Casualty departments in West London in September would not harm patient care, the newspaper has found that 25 per cent of patients at neighbouring Ealing and Northwick Park hospitals have now been left waiting more than four hours for emergency treatment. That is five times the maximum number who should have waited that long under Government targets. It is also more than twice the number of patients (11 per cent) who waited more than four hours a year ago – before the two other A&Es were shut. Ealing and Northwick Park have had to pick up the slack due to the downgrading of A&E units at Central Middlesex and Hammersmith hospitals. The revelations are a damning indictment of moves to close A&Es. Since the General Election in May 2010, 14 Casualty departments across England have been shut or downgraded to Urgent Care Centres, which may only be staffed by nurses at night and are generally not equipped to deal with the most serious cases. For more than two years, The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning against the closures, which can leave patients having to travel further or wait longer for life- saving treatment. Around a dozen more fully-equipped A&Es – including departments in the West Midlands, Manchester and London – are currently under threat. Last night, campaigners accused health bosses of going ahead with the moves despite warnings they could jeopardise patient care. Northwick Park hospital (pictured) and Ealing hospital have had to pick up the slack due to the downgrading of A&E units at Central Middlesex and Hammersmith hospitals . Two months ago, David McVittie, chief executive of London North West Healthcare NHS Trust – which covers Ealing and Northwick Park hospitals – confidently told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We do not expect a large impact on Northwick Park as a result of the closure of Central Middlesex and Hammersmith A&E units.’ But campaigner Colin Standfield said last night that Mr McVittie was ‘sticking his head in the sand’ and failing to look at the figures. A&Es across England have struggled this year to meet the Government target of treating at least 95 per cent of patients within four hours. Since mid-September, an average of 8.8 per cent nationwide have had to wait more than four hours – up from 7.4 per cent last autumn. But at the London North West Trust, this figure was an astonishing 25.2 per cent. Dr Onkar Sahota, a local GP and the Labour chairman of the London Assembly’s Health Committee, said: ‘The closure of two busy A&E units has left the remaining hospitals in West London breaking under the strain. It is now clear those closures have resulted in North-West London having one of the worst A&E waiting time records in the country.’ Northwick Park, earmarked to become one of area’s ‘super A&Es’, appears to have been worst affected by the closure of the units at both Hammersmith and Central Middlesex hospitals. A brand new 40-bay, £21 million A&E was supposed to open at the site in Harrow shortly afterwards. However, that has now been delayed twice – and there are fears the unit will not start taking patients before Christmas. Official predictions are that the department, recently lambasted in a Care Quality Commission report for having ‘inadequate staffing levels’, will have to cope with an extra 8,000 patients a year due to the closures. Downgraded: The closure of two A&E units, including at Central Middlesex (pictured) has caused chaos at nearby hospitals, leaving them with the longest waiting times in the country . But the NHS quango set up to push through the closures, called Shaping A Healthier Future, says shutting the A&Es at Hammersmith and Central Middlesex and replacing them with Urgent Care Centres is only the first ‘phase’ of its programme. It is widely expected that the A&Es at Ealing Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital in Fulham will lose facilities over the coming years. In a joint statement, London North West Healthcare NHS Trust and Shaping A Healthier Future said: ‘A number of A&E departments across the country and across London are dealing with an increase in activity at the moment – this is certainly not a situation unique to Northwick Park. Of course, no one should have to wait more than four hours, and we are tackling that problem. ‘The programme of change across North-West London means we are recruiting more A&E consultants and more nurses, Northwick Park and Ealing hospitals are getting significantly more beds, and we are investing in other local health services. Our new £21 million A&E department will open in December.’","Closure of two A&E units causes chaos at nearby hospitals in West London .

"It wouldn’t have been the first time an office party has got out of hand. But when BBC bosses planned a fond farewell to their headquarters, they probably didn’t expect the behaviour of staff and guests to degenerate quite so dramatically. A gathering to mark the closure of BBC Television Centre reportedly spiralled out of control with revellers heard having sex in an office and seen making off with souvenirs from the building. Guests watch Sara Cox (centre right) DJ during the BBC Television Centre farewell party . This picture of Sara Cox was among a range of BBC stars who went to the party to say goodbye to TV Centre . One guest posted an update on Twitter during the drink-fuelled gathering after hearing an amorous encounter in the building – affectionately known as the ‘doughnut’ because of its curved exterior and hollow centre. Producer Helen Williamson said: ‘At the BBC’s “goodbye TVC party”… did a  nostalgic walk of the donut & heard someone s******* in one of the offices. Sackable offence?’ Around 1,500 BBC employees were invited to the party last Thursday, held in three recording studios in the building at White City in West London.

"Trouble: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson blamed the badgers for the cull falling short . As the badger cull descended into chaos yesterday, the minister in charge was put on the spot. Why had marksmen shot fewer than half the original target number, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson was asked. And he was in no doubt as to who was to blame: The badgers. They had ‘moved the goalposts’, said Mr Paterson, explaining that their populations had shifted in unpredictable ways. He made the comment after it emerged only 850 animals were killed during the six-week pilot in Somerset, far fewer than the initial aim of 2,100. No data is yet available for the other pilot in Gloucestershire which ends next week. Campaigners branded the scheme a ‘farce’ and said the inability to meet the target could actually increase the spread of disease in cattle. Experts had warned at least 70 per cent of the animals in an area must be killed to limit bovine tuberculosis. But Mr Paterson insisted the trial had been a success by reducing local badger numbers by almost 60 per cent, and said the original target figure was simply set too high. He announced the cull target for Somerset now stood at just over 1,000 following new population estimates. For both pilot schemes, the other being in Gloucestershire, the bar has now been lowered from 5,000 badgers to just over 2,500 animals. Target: Thousands of badgers are being culled in pilots which ministers say will help curb the spread of TB in cattle herds . Asked if he had moved the goalposts, Mr Paterson said: ‘I am not moving anything. The badgers are moving the goalposts.’ He added: ‘The badgers are a wild . animal. They move their populations up and down according to weather, . according to breeding patterns and according to disease.’ He also confirmed the cull companies would be seeking up to a three-week extension to try to reduce numbers further. The . original 5,000 target was based on 2012 estimates of badger . populations, said Mr Paterson. But newer research showed numbers had now . fallen by around a third, because of flooding, food scarcity and . disease. Badger expert Professor Rosie Woodroffe said the failure to kill enough animals meant the trials should now be stopped. She . said: ‘When you kill badgers two things happen. The first is there are . fewer badgers, and for disease control that should be a good thing. ‘But . also you change the behaviour of badgers in ways which increase the . transmission of disease in badgers, so each badger is more infectious to . cattle... They are more likely to travel, and they are mixing more with . badgers from other social groups.’ Meanwhile, Gavin Grant, RSPCA chief executive, said: ‘Frankly this whole situation is a farce. ‘Whatever the figures, it is clear that the system has failed.’ Despite . widespread opposition, the Government has been committed to the . controversial scheme, which it hopes will help limit the spread of . tuberculosis in cattle. Opposition: Campaigners from the Somerset Badger Patrol looking for marksmen in the village of Monksilver, Somerset . National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall welcomed yesterday’s announcement. ‘The . knowledge learned from these two badger cull pilot areas will be . invaluable in helping to deliver future roll-out of badger control . operations in areas where the incidence of TB is rife,’ he said. ‘Our . absolute focus, and that of everyone involved, is disease control. More . than 38,000 cattle were slaughtered in Great Britain in 2012 because of . bovine TB.’","Marksmen told to kill 70% of badgers in two pilots to curb spread of TB .

"Reaching more than a thousand feet into the air, The Shard was hailed as one of the wonders of the age when it was completed. Yet Britain’s tallest building is almost entirely empty, as its owners struggle to find buyers and tenants for its offices and luxury flats. As our picture shows, London’s  72-storey skyscraper is largely dark in the early evening, while the surrounding buildings are bright with office lights. Dim prospects: Lights blaze out from the viewing gallery but almost all the rest of the Shard lies in darkness as evening falls last week - in stark contrast to surrounding businesses . Almost a year after it opened at a cost of £500 million, the building’s only occupants are a restaurant on the 32nd floor and a viewing gallery on the upper five floors, which offers visitors stunning views of the capital for £25. Not a single office in the 26 floors devoted to business use has been rented. High rents and economic stagnation have been blamed for the slow take-up – but other experts believe the problem is more fundamental: location, location, location. The Shard is to the south of the Thames, across the river from the financial institutions of the Square Mile who would be its target tenants. Under used: The building's only occupants are a restaurant on the 32nd floor and a viewing gallery on the upper five floors, which offers visitors views of the capital for £25 . Business sense: Not a single office in the 26 floors devoted to business use has been rented, with high rents and economic stagnation blamed for the slow take-up . A Room With a View: Britain's tallest building offers views across the capital, but experts believe it is struggling to find tenants because of its location south of the Thames . In contrast, in two other skyscrapers – nicknamed Cheesegrater and the Walkie Talkie – more than half the floor space has already been let, even though they are still under construction. But these both lie in the heart of the City. Julian Hind, an office leasing agent at estate agency Farebrother, said: ‘It’s been marketed as an iconic central London tower, priced like the City. 'For people to locate south of the river the developers are asking quite big rents.’ Contrasting popularity: London's newest skyscrapers nicknamed the Cheesegrater, left, and the Walkie Talkie, right . A 205-room five-star hotel will open in . The Shard in the summer, but it will still leave empty almost 600,000 sq . ft of office space on the first 28 floors. Ten luxury flats with price tags of up to £50 million also remain unoccupied, although the building’s Qatari owners say they will not be put on sale formally until the hotel underneath them opens. National Trust chairman Sir Simon Jenkins, who has been forthright in his criticism of the ‘egomaniacal architecture’ of The Shard, said the building was unsuitable for businesses because the offices were ‘the wrong shape’. The former editor of The Times said: ‘It is very inefficient per square foot, because of things like lifts and so on. 'They are not a very attractive proposition. Office blocks across London are empty. 'It’s entirely speculative, you hope one day it will be filled.’ He added that few super rich inhabitants would ever end up actually living in the apartments in The Shard. ‘They are just bank accounts in the sky,’ he said. ‘Nobody wants to live in these places, they are buying them as investments.’ However, letting agent Julian Hind believes that The Shard will be ‘in a better position’ to attract businesses once surrounding development work is also finished. Talks are currently under way that, if successful, will see at most a quarter of the space in the Shard being taken up. But although the empty floors may be embarrassing, the building’s owners have deep pockets and are believed to be comfortable about waiting until the City economy picks up. The building, at London Bridge station, . was financed by the oil-rich gulf state of Qatar, which has wide . interests in Britain, with stakes in Sainsbury’s, Harrods, the Canary . Wharf development and Barclays Bank, among others. Grand opening: The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, pictured with developer Irvine Stellar, cuts a ribbon at the opening of The Shard viewing gallery . Light show: The Shard has been marketed as an iconic central London tower, priced like the City . Daredevil: The Duke of York took part in a charity abseil down the building in September last year . The lack of tenants also gives developers Sellar another problem, as they will be liable for the annual business rates of up to £12 million due to Southwark Council, that would usually be paid by the businesses occupying the site. Sellar say they are in talks over the bill – as the council decides when to start imposing the rates. ‘Paying rates could be up to two years away,’ a Shard source insisted. In a statement, the company said: ‘The offices have not yet been rated. We are in discussion with the local authority as to when an appropriate . date will be determined for rating purposes. The rating value is not . confirmed.’ Under construction: A view of the Shard, taken in January last year while building was underway . Window to the world: The glass frontage being added to the core of the building, situated near London Bridge . The Shard is not the only Central London block to be struggling to find tenants. A building above Cannon Street station is only now on the point of signing its first deal, 18 months after it was completed. And it took a reported 15 years to fill 1 Canada Square, the tower at the centre of the Canary Wharf development, which was also built in the midst of a downturn, in 1991.

"Senators say Sgt Bowe Bergdahl did not ‘look good’ in proof-of-life video that they were shown at a meeting last night and may have been ‘drugged’ but did not appear to be near-death like the Obama administration claimed. ‘It appeared that he was drugged, and that he was barely responsive in the video itself,’ Senate Intelligence Vice-Chairman Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday. ‘I don’t think from a health standpoint there was any issue that dictated the release of these five nasty killers in exchange for Bergdahl,’ he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Tense: U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein talks to other Senators ahead of the meeting last night. Many came away feeling the video still did not justify ignoring Congress in making the trade . 'Proof'? Sen. John McCain was among those shown the 1 1/2 minute long video - . believed to have been filmed in December - at a briefing with Pentagon . and intelligence officials at the U.S. Capitol last night . ‘That did not sell me at all. The proof of life was basically five months ago. December? At that time he was impaired,’ Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told ABC. ‘That is not the person that was released here. He was not in that type of dire situation when he was released.’ The terms of the trade for Bergdahl, coupled with stories from former platoon-mates of the soldier’s erratic behavior in the days leading up to his capture and remarks about wanting to desert the army, have had the Obama administration on defense since the president announced last Saturday that Bergdahl had been released. Whatever the reason Bergdahl wandered off base alone, the U.S. has a commitment to rescue its men and women in uniform, the president and other administration officials have repeatedly said. 'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure that we get back a young man to his parents and that the American people understand that this is somebody’s child, and that we don’t condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back,' President Barack Obama said today during a press conference at the G7 Summit in Brussels. And when the Taliban provided evidence that Bergdahl’s health was deteriorating, cabinet-level officials made a ‘unanimous’ decision to strike a deal, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said today. ‘It was our judgment based on the information that we had that his life, his health were in peril,’ Hagel told BBC in an interview that aired this morning. However, a close friend of Bowe Bergdahl’s parents, Bob and Jani, told MailOnline that ‘Bob hasn’t said anything about Bowe’s health. 'Deserter': . Senior Dem Dutch Ruppersberger said Bergdahl's release (exchange . caught on video above) in the swap with five Taliban prisoners held at . Guantanamo put Americans at risk all around the world . Anger: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., center left, speaks with Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., as senators emerge from a closed-door briefing . ‘There was never any doubt in Bob and Jani’s minds that Bowe was coming home, they have been the most resilient people I have ever met,’ said Chip Deffe, owner of the bike shop where Bob Bergdahl works. ‘But they have never mentioned any medical concerns.’ Members of the U.S. Senate were shown a classified 1 1/2 minute long video at a briefing with Pentagon and intelligence officials at the U.S. Capitol last night that was supposed to prove Bergdahl was deathly ill when the president and his cabinet decided to rescue him without consulting Congress. But last night’s meeting did little to satisfy the concerns of the lawmakers, who say they still have unanswered questions about the trade. ‘There’s a lot to be answered here and there’s a lot of peculiar behavior that’s gone on between the family, this solider and his actions,’ Sen. Manchin said on Wednesday. ‘We all agree that we’re not dealing with a war hero,’ he said. ‘We’re dealing with a soldier who should be looked in more extensively.’ The executive branch is required to let members of Congress know 30 days in advance when it is going to release prisoners from the government’s detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In this case, it gave lawmakers only hours notice or no notice at all that it was planning to release five detainees with ties to the Taliban. ‘I don’t see how anybody can walk out of there with any kind of comfortable feeling that the administration from a notification standpoint, and I emphasize that, did what they should have done or what they had the opportunity to do. I mean, it was like they didn’t trust Dianne [Feinstein] and me,’ Chambliss told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren after the meeting. All in: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (pictured with with sailors aboard the USS Vella Gulf during his visit to Constanta today) said the White House had been unanimous in its decision to free Bergdahl . Chambliss told reporters earlier this week that he didn’t find out about the trade until it had already happened. The White House has since apologized to Chambliss and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic, for failing to notify them of the swap in a timely manner, calling the mistake an ‘oversight.’ Chambliss said on Wednesday that it’s too little too late, though. ‘My comment back to the administration is that I’m not going to believe anything they tell me from now on,’ Chambliss said. ‘They are willing to violate the law but even short of that, when they commit to us that they are going to give us 30 days’ notice and then they don’t do it, how in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us?’ Senators from both parties said they are still worried that the Taliban associates released from prison by the White House are a threat to national security. ‘We have a 29 percent re-engagement rate from Guantanamo and I would argue that the conditions upon which these five detainees will be held is a real troubling aspect of this whole thing because four of them, at least, are very high-level members of the Taliban,’ New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, told ABC on Wednesday night. ‘These are all high-level people. This is not low level,’ Manchin said. ‘These are people who basically have the ability to go back and hit the ground running, and we’re concerned about that.’ In releasing ‘five of the most dangerous individuals in Guantanamo, if not the five most dangerous,’ Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, ‘The president has now set a precedent that will encourage enemies of the United States to target American men and women in uniform, to capture them in order to carry out some other exchange in the future.’ Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, a Republican, admitted to Fox News that Bergdahl did not ‘look good’ in the classified video lawmakers were shown. ‘But there will be hell to pay if we find [the Taliban fighters] go on to kill Americans,’ he said. The meeting came after a tumultuous day on Capitol . Hill when Democrats joined the ranks of those expressing their anger . over the swap. Senior Democrat congressman Dutch Ruppersberger said it . was a 'dangerous precedent' that put the lives of Americans around the . world at risk. Putting on a brave face: Obama, pictured at the meeting of the G7 in Brussels overnight, has been taken aback by the level of discontent over the trade . The House is not in session this week, so lawmakers from the legislative branch’s other chamber have not yet had the opportunity to quiz administration officials. Members of the House Armed Services Committee will have their shot at questioning Secretary of Defense Hagel at a hearing next week.","Senators shown a video sent to the US by the Taliban in January that administration says forced them to override intelligence concerns and swap Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees in Guantanamo .

"Treasury officials claim Thea Rogers, pictured left next to Chancellor George Osborne, shouts and swears - leaving colleagues in tears after throwing tantrums when she is unhappy with their work . The glamorous aide behind George Osborne’s trendy new image has been accused of bullying in a real-life The Thick Of It-style Whitehall row. The Chancellor’s adviser, former BBC producer Thea Rogers, has been branded a ‘pitbull’ by Treasury officials, who claim she shouts and swears like TV spin doctor Malcolm Tucker, played by Peter Capaldi. They say she hurls four-letter insults and has ‘tantrums, rants and hissy fits’ when she is unhappy with their work, leaving colleagues in tears. Well-placed sources say the Treasury’s Permanent Secretary, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, has spoken to officials ‘bruised’ by Ms Rogers’s behaviour. Ms Rogers, a former producer to BBC political editor Nick Robinson, has been credited with transforming the Chancellor’s public image since he hired her two years ago. Mr Osborne’s dramatically reduced waistline, Caesar-style, close-cropped haircut and his high-profile tours of factory floors across the country have all been overseen by the aide. But a Treasury insider who claims to have witnessed ‘Thea the pitbull’ treating staff badly said last night: ‘She is confrontational and humiliates people who displease her – often in the middle of meetings. 'She has tantrums, rants, hissy fits and screams at people whose work she finds unacceptable. Some people were reduced to tears.’ The Mail on Sunday has been told Ms Rogers was accused of ‘astonishing rudeness’ in the run-up to a major speech by the Chancellor earlier this year in Tilbury, Essex, when Treasury aides struggled to find local bosses to join the audience. A female civil servant involved in arranging the Chancellor’s visits reportedly ‘reached the end of her tether’ with Ms Rogers. A Treasury insider said: ‘There is no way Osborne does not know about the way Thea behaves, though she is careful not to do it when he is present.’ The insider denied Ms Rogers’s critics were over-reacting, saying: ‘We know the Treasury is high pressure like No 10 and we’re used to working at full pelt. Treasury officials have likened Thea Rogers to real-life spin doctor Macolm Tucker, played by Peter Capaldi . ‘That does not excuse wild and unacceptable behaviour.’ Last night, a source close to Mr Osborne leapt to Ms Rogers’s defence, saying: ‘Thea may not take prisoners but that’s her style. ‘That may mean rubbing some officials up the wrong way but she was hired to get results and she has delivered. George is thrilled with her work. She has singlehandedly transformed his image and he is delighted.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We do not normally comment on personnel matters but there has been no formal complaint or investigation relating to any Treasury special adviser.’","Treasury workers say Thea Rogers shouts  and hurls four-letter insults .

"Are parents who opt for cosmetic surgery on their face unintentionally ruining their relationship with their children? Studies suggest that having Botox injections could alter the way infants perceive adults, leaving them unable to recognise emotion. This means that when an nip and tucked mother tries to empathise, the baby is left distraught as the adult seemingly appears unaffected by their behaviour. Is cosmetic surgery leaving babies emotionally detached from their mothers? Studies suggest that 'enhancements' such as Botox injections make it difficult for children to empathise with adults and recognise emotion in parents (stock image shown) Last year more than 50,000 cosmetic surgery procedures were carried out in the UK - a rise of 17 per cent on average from 2012. More than five in six people who have had Botox admit to having no idea what exactly was injected into their face. And new figures reveal today that more people than ever are seeking help after botched procedures. A shocking 84 per cent of youth-seekers . admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their . faces when under-going the procedure - or even if the injection . given actually contained key ingredient Botulinum toxin. The national research carried out by the Transform Cosmetic Surgery company has found that almost a third (29 per cent) of . respondents said they had their treatment done at a local beauty salon, . one in ten had one at home or a friend's home, and 3 per cent were . treated at a 'beauty treatment party'. And there doesn’t seem to be any signs of the trend abating. By 2015 the global value of the plastic surgery industry is set to rise to £3.6 billion ($6 billion), a rise of £1.3 billion ($2.2 billion) from 2010. A study carried out by Dr David Neal from the University of California in 2011 fouind that infants were unable to get an emotional response from adults who had had Botox injections. This left them distressed and upset as they lacked the ability to be empathetic with their parents. Dr Neal said that when infants were unable to mimic their parents’ emotions, such as showing sadness or happiness, they could sometimes be left confused. This suggests that, as more and more parents today turn to Botox to supposedly ‘improve’ their appearance in later life, they might be worsening their relationship with their children. This research has come to the fore again in recent days after a British artist spoke out against the use of plastic surgery in parents at the Hay Festival in the Brecon Beacons National Park. As reported by The Times, Jonathan Yeo said that cosmetic surgery was ‘homogenising the way we look’ in addition to the aforementioned negative effects on appearance. ‘What are the unintended long-term consequences of these things that we are doing casually for our own gratification? ‘Aside from the fact it is risky, it is painful, it is expensive, it is often quite obvious you have had it done.’ Yeo has himself studied cosmetic-surgery patients and their sometimes painful pursuits of achieving physical perfection. He says that, in the future, we may find the age of plastic surgery rather odd. ‘It is a funny time. I think we will look back on this time like we do on people using leeches and wonder why we did it,’ he said. ‘I think it is quite crazy. I want to document it. It is the big story of our era.’ Jonathan Yeo, pictured, discussed at the Hay Festival some of his own research into cosmetic surgery that suggests it emotionally detaches parents and children. He is known for portraits of several high-profile people including an infamous piece of President George Push made out of cuttings from pornographic magazines .","Studies suggest babies can't empathise with adults who have nip and tuck .

"Pulled out: US military personnel in a car leaves the Afghan Interior Ministry in Kabul after two senior officers were shot inside . Another seven American military advisers have been injured in Afghanistan as US casualties from protests at troops burning the Koran mount. The Americans were injured in the city of Kunduz when protesters threw a grenade at their base. It comes on the sixth day of violent protest in Afghanistan amid anger at American troops who threw a Koran onto a rubbish fire at Bagram air base last week. Two senior US officers, a lieutenant colonel and a major, were yesterday shot in the back of the head by an Afghan policeman as they worked at the interior ministry. That led to the pull out of all NATO staff from Afghan government buildings and Kabul is today on lockdown as authorities search for  Abul Saboor, a 25-year-old policeman suspected of being behind the attacks. He is thought to have shot the officers in the ministry's command and control centre, which would have been crawling with Afghan police. It comes as bitter protests - including the burning of effigies of President Obama - over the controversial actions enter their sixth day. NATO earlier issued a statement confirming the two deaths. It said: 'Initial reports indicate an . individual turned his weapon against International Security Assistance . Force (ISAF) service members in Kabul City today [Saturday], killing two . servicemembers.' NATO spokesman Lt. Col Jimmie Cummings said 'initial reports say it was not a Western . shooter.' He declined to provide further information. NATO forces have advisers embedded in many Afghan ministries, both as trainers and to help manage the transition to Afghan control and foreign forces prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014. The Afghan Interior Ministry oversees all of the country's police, so has numerous NATO advisers. Two Afghan officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the ministry shooting did not involve any Afghans. The Taliban, who have claimed responsibility for the attack, said 'a hero mujahid Abdul Rahman' killed four advisers over . the burning of Korans at a US-run military base. Fired up: Activists of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz burn an effigy of US President Barack Obama during a protest in Quetta after American troops burned copies of the Koran . In a statement, Taliban spokesman . Zabiullah Mujahid said the gunman was an insurgent named Abdul Rahman. He said an accomplice inside the ministry helped him get inside the . compound. He said the killings were a planned response to the Quran . burnings. 'After . the attack, Rahman informed us by telephone that he was able to kill . four high-ranking American advisers,' Mujahid said. The Taliban . frequently exaggerate casualty claims. Inevitably the latest shooting has . raised questions over security at what should be one of the most secure . compounds in the city. With the dangerous gunman still at . large, a massive manhunt is underway and all NATO personnel have been . recalled from Afghan ministries. Widespread protests: Afghans shout slogans during a protest against the alleged 'Koran burning' by the US troops, in Kunduz Afghanistan . General John Allen said the recall of advisers is . 'for obvious force protection reasons' but the alliance remains . committed to its partnership with the Afghan government. He said NATO is investigating Saturday's shooting and will pursue all leads to find the person responsible for the attack. 'The perpetrator of this attack is a coward whose actions will not go unanswered,' Allen said . The fatal shooting comes soon after three protesters were shot dead by Afghan security forces. The situation was already fragile as . NATO forces attempt to bring stability to the region before foreign . troops withdraw by the end of 2014.

Injured men receive medical treatment at a local hospital in Herat, Afghanistan . But it is not clear if this incident is connected to the ongoing protests now on their fifth day. An apology from President Barack Obama has failed to quell public outrage after it emerged that Qurans and other religious materials had been thrown into an incinerator used to burn garbage at Bagram Air Field, a large U.S. base north of Kabul. Despite a call for restraint from Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, renewed protests continued today. 12 people were killed and dozens wounded on Friday, the bloodiest day yet in demonstrations. At least 28 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since Tuesday. Muslims consider the Koran to be the literal word of God and treat each copy with deep reverence with desecration considered one of the worst forms of blasphemy. The Koran burnings underscore the deep cultural divide that still exists more than 10 years after U.S troops invaded to oust the Taliban and have deepened public mistrust of the West. Violent protest have continued across three Afghan provinces. One protester was shot dead in the Logar province, south of Kabul, after hundreds took to the streets - many chanting 'death to America' - and charged at police. Two others were wounded. A further three protesters were shot dead by Afghan security forces in the quieter northern Kunduz province, as they set alight shops and buildings, according to a senior police detective Ghulam Mohn Farhad.

"A row has broken out over school dinners after it emerged reception pupils were being given just one chicken nugget for their lunch. Infant pupils around the country are all entitled to a free hot meal every lunchtime under the government's flagship scheme brought in this month. But the quality of the food they are being given was called into question today when the measly meals being served up to the youngest pupils in Birmingham were revealed. Scroll down for video . Measly meal: Reception pupils in Birmingham are being given just one chicken nugget with their lunch . City Councillor Valerie Seabright said: 'I welcome free school meals, but I'm seriously concerned having been to see a school that was not the best quality. 'The rations and portions are not brilliant. In reception class, children get just one nugget, Year 1 get two and Year 2 get three or four. 'The whole point is to make sure that children get adequate meals with good nutrition. In one class I went to the children didn't get any fresh vegetables or fruit. 'This is serious. It is not working. I think we should insist that there is more training of staff. They need to know about sizes of rations.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg launched plans to give all under-sevens a free meal at lunchtime and the scheme started in schools earlier this month. But the idea has already suffered setbacks after it emerged some schools had to bus in meals and others were providing cold food for pupils. Birmingham city councillor Valerie Seabright said she was 'seriously concerned' by the size of the portions . Policy: Nick Clegg visited schools when he launched free hot dinners for all infant pupils earlier this year . Councillor Seabright said council-owned food provider Cityserve - which is responsible for meals at 92 per cent of the city's schools - was leaving youngsters short-changed. She added: 'It's all very well just saying 'We have free school meals', but you have to be able to implement that policy. 'The children obviously didn't just get the one chicken nugget, there was potato and vegetables on offer too, but I don't know if they should be given this processed food at all. The British Dietetic Association says boys aged 4-6 years need 1,715 calories a day and girls 1,545. A child's lunch should contain a third of their daily calories. They need two servings of vegetables a day and two of fruit, four of bread, cereal or potatoes, three of milk and dairy and two of fish or meat. In basic terms, children of this age should be a getting a plate of food comprising half a plate of vegetables/fruit, a quarter of a plate of protein and a quarter of starchy food such as pasta for their lunch. 'All the children are getting the same money per head so it's a bit naughty of the company to give the reception class less.' Others in the area pointed out that even if children were given more generous portion of nuggets, the food was unlikely to provide the nutrition children need. Labour's Barry Bowles said: 'These are processed foods. Why are we not giving them fresh food?' Birmingham City Council's children's boss has admitted the situation is 'unacceptable' and said bosses are investigating meals provided by Cityserve. Nutrition expert Mel Wakeman said the vague advice schools are given for dinners alow them to serve up inadequate meals. She said: 'The way the guidelines are worded, children could potentially have two portions of fried food and two pastry based meals a week, which would be too much. 'I don't think we should just get rid of all the food children like because we have to be realistic, they just won't eat what is put in front of them if it's really boring. 'But with things like chicken nuggets, I don't think they should have that kind of fried food more than once a week.' The new scheme came after a high-profile campaign by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver . The idea of free school meals for infant pupils was recommended in a review of school food by the Leon restaurant chain. Their inquiry found that packed lunches are usually much less nutritious than cooked meals, and said a better diet would improve children's performance in the classroom. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg launched the plan at last autumn's Liberal Democrat conference. The government has assigned £2.30 for each meal served to pupils and also says it is ploughing £150million into upgrading school kitchens. Previously, only students with parents earning less than £16,000 were entitled to the  food, but more than 1.5million children can now eat for free. But critics have said schools were given too little time and money to prepare for the changes. The National Union of Teachers also wants the policy to be extended to all primary pupils. General secretary Christine Blower says children 'do not stop being hungry at seven years of age'.","All under-sevens given free school meal as part of new government plan .

"Cosmetic surgery leaders have criticised Government pledges on treatment which they say represent a 'wasted opportunity to ensure patient safety' (file picture) New rules designed to protect patients undergoing cosmetic surgery have been described by experts as 'appalling' and a 'wasted opportunity'. Cosmetic surgery leaders said they were aghast at the the lack of proper regulation put forward by the Government's response to an independent review into the future of the sector. Ministers have failed to agree to a key recommendation from NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh, whose review followed the PIP breast implant scandal. He wanted to make injections or 'fillers' to plump up the skin only available on prescription. The Government said it supported the view but its hands were tied at an EU level, with work ongoing regarding such products. There will also be no compulsory, central register of practitioners - whether for surgical, or non-surgical procedures such as fillers - as recommended by Sir Bruce. In its response the Government said it did 'not believe that a new regulated profession is the only way of improving patient safety by practitioners of non-surgical cosmetic interventions'. Sir Bruce also called for patient consent to be obtained by the surgeon who will operate on them. The Government said consent could be obtained by any surgeon. Critics argued this meant a surgeon could fly in from abroad, carry out the surgery and fly out again, giving patients no continuity of care. Sir Bruce also called for 'socially irresponsible' advertising practices to be banned by professional codes of practice. These include time-limited special offers, cash inducements, buy-one-get-one-free deals or mother and daughter deals, refer a friend deals and offering surgery as competition prizes. In the review last April Sir Bruce Keogh (pictured) singled out criticism for the use of fillers . The Government said it agreed 'advertising and marketing practices should not trivialise the seriousness of cosmetic procedures' and socially responsible advertising needs to be included in practice codes. But it stopped short of agreeing that the special deals highlighted by Sir Bruce should be banned. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said it was 'business as usual' for the sector following today's announcement. Its president, Dr Rajiv Grover said: 'Frankly, we are no less than appalled at the lack of action taken - this review, not the first one conducted into the sector, represents yet another thoroughly wasted opportunity to ensure patient safety. 'With all the evidence provided by the clinical community, choosing not to reclassify fillers as medicines with immediate effect or setting up any kind of compulsory register beggars belief. 'Legislators have clearly been paying only lip service to the sector's dire warnings that dermal fillers are a crisis waiting to happen. The review last year warned that filler jabs were subject to 'no more controls than a bottle of floor cleaner' (file picture) 'Most shockingly of all, the fact that there is no requirement for the actual surgeon involved to provide consent for the procedure makes a mockery of the entire process. It's business as usual in the Wild West and the message from the Government is clear: roll up and feel free to have a stab.' Dr Grover said the Government's failure to create a compulsory register was a 'huge loophole'. He said: 'Patients just want to go to one place and see who is registered and who is not. This now will not happen.' And he criticised the fact the operating surgeon does not have to be the one gaining consent from the patient. 'Frankly, we are no less than appalled at . the lack of action taken - this review, not the first one conducted . into the sector, represents yet another thoroughly wasted opportunity to . ensure patient safety' - Dr Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons . 'Surgeons fly in and out of this country,' he said. 'You could be having a consultation with one person but another surgeon can fly into the UK and do your operation and fly out again. 'This means there is no continuity of care - and that is essential for patient safety.' Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents (AvMA), said: 'We are disappointed not to see all providers of cosmetic treatment having to register and be regulated by the Care Quality Commission, or a proper compensation scheme created for victims of the industry. 'The Government had promised its response by last summer and Sir Liam Donaldson's report in 2005 was ignored. We need to see action, not words, now. Overall, this is a case of too little, too late.' The British Association of Dermatologists said today's announcement represented a 'very small step forward'. While the Government had made the 'right noises', there was little in the way of robust enforcement. It has warned that no register will mean the public is 'prey to a two-tier system, with good practice by well qualified professionals on one level... and a cut-price, budget approach provided by untrained practitioners... on the other.' Health minister Dan Poulter said the package was 'the biggest reform the industry has seen' Consultant dermatologist Tamara Griffiths said: 'We had hoped to see a great step forward today, in terms of making non-invasive cosmetic procedures safer for the public. We have instead seen a very small step forward.' Health minister Dan Poulter said: 'This package is the biggest reform the industry has seen and it is completely misleading to suggest surgeons won't be part of the consent process. 'Patients will meet the surgeon operating on them to discuss treatment and they will now have to sign the consent form in the presence of a doctor, not a sales person, as has been the case in the past. 'EU legislation states fillers are not a medicine, so we cannot reclassify them. Instead we want to protect patients with new laws so anyone injecting fillers must be qualified and overseen by a doctor or other appropriate health professional who must see the patient to discuss treatment.' Sir Bruce's panel said in April that fillers to smooth wrinkles could go horribly wrong and were being treated as casually as having highlights done at a hairdresser's appointment. In its response, the Government said work was already under way to address the issue of ensuring proper training for cosmetic practitioners. It said Health Education England is leading a review of training for providers of non-surgical interventions, such as dermal fillers. And it said it wants to make it illegal for people without training to inject dermal fillers. Furthermore, a doctor or other appropriate health professional will also oversee anyone who injects dermal fillers. Ministers have previously announced the creation of a breast implant registry. Sir Bruce welcomed the Government's response, adding: 'Plans to bring in training and clear standards for both surgical and non-surgical procedures will go a long way to bringing the improvements we need to see, as will looking into the best way to protect people if their treatment in the private sector goes wrong. 'This is the beginning of a journey, not the end, but I am confident these changes will create a much safer and skilled cosmetic industry, which should reassure both consumers and practitioners.' Today's announcement comes after BAAPS figures released last week showed a 17% rise overall in the number of cosmetic operations in the UK in 2013, now reaching 50,122.","Ministers fail to agree on key recommendation of review on cosmetic surgery .

"Supreme Court judge Lord Wilson said a social worker wanted to stop a girl from being adopted by a couple as they were 'too Jewish' A social worker wanted to stop a girl who was a quarter Jewish being adopted by a Jewish couple because the household would have been too religious for the child, it was revealed yesterday. In a speech to lawyers, a Supreme Court judge said that politically correct race rules – introduced on the premise that adopted children need parents of exactly the same ethnic and cultural background – became 'discriminatory'. He gave the moving example of a case he had dealt with involving a three-year-old girl who was a quarter-Jewish, quarter-Scottish, quarter-Irish and quarter-Turkish. Lord Wilson said the social worker appointed by the court to speak for the child 'argued that the girl should be placed in a non-religious family in which exposure to her of the four elements of her ethnicity might evenly be developed. She said that the proposed couple were too Jewish'. He had ruled the adoption by the Jewish couple should go ahead. 'Less than four weeks afterwards, out of the blue, the adoptive father died,' the judge said. 'I felt terrible – I had overruled the guardian's objection and had caused the girl to be adopted by a grieving single parent. 'In the event however the adoption has worked out beautifully.' He added said: 'She is one of four children, adopted under orders made by me, with whom, even after all these years, I keep in touch.' Lord Wilson said: 'Most adopters are white so, while there was perceived to be a need for an ethnic match between them and their adoptive child, children of other, including mixed, ethnicities, were often languishing in foster care even if adoptable. A perception designed to obviate discrimination had become discriminatory.' He said of the reforms pushed through by former Education Secretary Michael Gove: 'I applaud the recent statutory dilution, albeit not elimination, of the aim of seeking to place a child with adopters of similar ethnicity.' In a speech to lawyers, the Supreme Court (pictured) judge said that politically correct race rules have become 'discriminatory'","Social worker wanted to stop a girl being adopted by a Jewish couple .

"When Prince Charles wrote passionately of protecting ‘beautiful landscapes with hedgerows’ and the ‘folly’ of losing farmland, he captured the public mood. However, his cover article for the latest edition of Country Life, has enraged farmers and nature lovers at the very heart of his Duchy of Cornwall estate. The reason? Just compare the following two photographs. PEACEFUL: The Duchy's Tregurra Valley last year when it was peaceful, rolling farmlands . UNRECOGNISABLE: The valley as a development consortium which will include a Waitrose supermarket . When Prince Charles wrote passionately of protecting ‘beautiful landscapes with hedgerows’ and the ‘folly’ of losing farmland, he captured the public mood . One shows the Duchy’s Tregurra Valley last year when it was peaceful, rolling farmland, lined with ancient hedgebanks and sown with maize to feed a 200-strong dairy herd. The other shows it today as a development consortium – which includes the Duchy – builds a Waitrose supermarket, housing estate, car park and recycling centre. One furious critic has described it as ‘hypocrisy with a capital H’. Cornwall Council approved the £40 million complex last year. It includes a ‘Cornish Food Hall’ and an EU-funded park-and-ride scheme aimed at cutting traffic through Truro’s historic streets. About a third of the 97 houses are to be ‘affordable’. The Duchy, which donated the 55-acre site and leased part back to the county council at peppercorn rent, says the authority asked it to provide a ‘sustainable’ solution to traffic congestion while easing a housing crisis. However critics, led by Truro City Council, say the project has delivered precisely what the Prince is railing against – the destruction of high- quality farmland and a precious rural landscape. They claim it will do little to ease either traffic or housing problems, and will compete with small food producers for business. For its part the Duchy can point to a judicial review which has dismissed the city council’s fears and backed planning approval. A spokesman said the Estate was asked by planners in 2005 to donate land for ‘the growing needs of the local community’. She insisted the site was not prime agricultural land and that 6,000 trees would be planted once landscaping was complete. PLEA: The article in Country Life's November 12 edition has enraged farmers and nature lovers . FURY: The protest sign at the Tregurra Valley, in the Duchy of Cornwall estate, was quickly ripped down . ‘The Duchy would not have become involved if it was not absolutely convinced of the sustainable benefits of the scheme,’ she said. In his Country Life article, Charles writes: ‘It would not only be a folly to lose agricultural land, it would be equally foolish to use it in ways that are not environmentally sustainable in the long-term.’ He describes the countryside as ‘that delicately woven tapestry’ and warns: ‘Start pulling out the threads and the rest unravels very rapidly indeed and is very difficult to put back again – no farmers, no beautiful landscapes with hedgerows and stone walls, no thriving rural communities.’ Ian Hibberd, founder of the Save Truro campaign, described the article as ‘truly breathtaking’, adding: ‘Charles writes of protecting and nurturing the very farmland his people are busy destroying in Cornwall. ‘He cares about farmers and the countryside only until they get in the way of his own financial interests. Then he pushes them out. ‘In this case a Duchy tenant farmer has had to sell his dairy herd because he can no longer feed them. Prime productive land has been lost and a beautiful valley destroyed.’ He said there were suspicions the Duchy and Waitrose, which has exclusive rights to sell the organic food brand Duchy Originals, had become commercially too close. Fellow campaign leader Hilary Keam said her protest sign – ‘This Valley Destroyed Thanks To Prince Charles and 11 Cornwall Councillors’ – had been quickly ripped down. ‘We had to keep rescuing it from the refuse dump,’ she said. ‘But we are mere mortals and powerless against the Duchy. The Duke of Cornwall’s comments in Country Life beggar belief. He is the destroyer of Cornwall.This is hypocrisy with a capital H.’ Among the formal objectors were the Helston and St Keverne Young Farmers’ Club. Secretary Frances Hosken said: ‘We felt this proposal was wrong. We need every bit of productive land we can get. We’re all young farmers. This is our future being sold off.’ Nigel Ekins, chairman of Truro Farmers Market, said that the Duchy-Waitrose partnership would hit city centre trade by 8 per cent. ‘They’re not looking after small farmers and producers,’ he added. ‘The so-called Cornish Food Hall is just another outlet for the big boys.’ Waitrose said: ‘We can confirm that we will be a tenant of the Duchy of Cornwall after originally being approached by Cornwall Council.’","Cornwall Council approved the £40million complex last year .

"Schools are being urged to go back to ‘chalk and talk’ teaching that was once widespread in Britain – in order to reproduce the success the traditional methods now have in China. Education Minister Nick Gibb said having a teacher speak to the class as a whole from the front was much more effective than children working on their own – the method which has become dominant in schools over the past 40 years. Mr Gibb’s intervention, which will infuriate many in the educational establishment, follows a Government scheme in which more than 70 maths teachers from British primaries went to Shanghai to study the teaching styles of their Chinese counterparts. Education Minister Nick Gibb has said having a teacher speak to the class from the front was more effective . Researchers have found that children in China achieve marks in maths up to 30 per cent higher than English pupils of the same age. In ‘whole class’ teaching, which was common in this country until the 1950s, the teacher instructs all the pupils together by using a blackboard, or its equivalent, while testing the children with questions. But progressive educationalists argued this was too authoritarian, and instead promoted the ‘child-centred’ approach that has been prevalent in primary schools since then. Under this system, pupils are encouraged to ‘discover’ knowledge by themselves, working at their own speed or in small groups, with the teacher offering them support. Mr Gibb told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I would like to see schools across the country adopt whole class teaching methods, particularly in maths and science. Research shows it is significantly more effective than other methods that concentrate more on personalised learning.’ He said Shanghai schools topped international league tables, with 15-year-olds there three years ahead of their English counterparts in maths. Mr Gibb added: ‘In Shanghai primary schools, whole class teaching with all pupils taking part in question and answer sessions is key to their success. All their pupils are taught the same curriculum and all are expected to reach the same high standard.’ In ‘whole class’ teaching, which was common in this country until the 1950s, the teacher instructs all the pupils together by using a blackboard, or its equivalent, while testing the children with questions . Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘English education was overtaken with progressive ideas in recent decades, which held it was better for children to learn by themselves and at their own pace. ‘This was clearly madness, and it has taken 40 years to realise this. ‘The trouble with the trendy methods is that the children are left to their own devices, including chatting to their friends, while the teacher is elsewhere. It is a very inefficient use of time and resources.’ Mr Gibb’s comments have been backed by recent research, which concluded that the success of pupils in the Far East is largely down to teaching methods. Maths tests taken by 562 nine and ten-year-olds in classrooms in Southampton and Nanjing in China found that the Chinese pupils scored between 20 and 30 per cent higher than the English youngsters. Classes in England, where pupils are often grouped in desk clusters, spent nearly half of their time in 'individual group work' compared with 28 per cent of those in China, research revealed . Researchers also used video to analyse what was going on in lessons and found that in the Chinese classrooms – where pupils sit in rows of desks facing the front – ‘whole class interaction’ was being used 72 per cent of the time, compared with only 24 per cent in England. By contrast, the classes in England, where pupils are often grouped in clusters of desks, spent nearly half – 47 per cent – of their time in ‘individual or group work’, compared with 28 per cent in China. The research, by Zhenzhen Miao and Professor David Reynolds of the University of Southampton, concluded: ‘Effective teachers spent longer time on interacting with the whole class rather than with individuals/groups or leaving pupils to independent seatwork.’ Prof Reynolds said he was disappointed that more schools were not increasing their use of the ‘whole class’ approach as it would improve results in most subjects.","Education Minister Nick Gibb said 'whole class teaching' is more effective .

"Many of the 7 million consumers who got insurance under President Barack Obama's health care law will see their premiums rise next year unless they switch to another plan, independent analysts said as the government released details Friday. The Health and Human Services department released a massive computer file of 2015 premiums one day ahead of the start of open enrollment. Those numbers will take time to fully analyze. Late Friday, the administration said some Healthcare.gov functions were to be turned off overnight in the transition to sign-up season. Spokeswoman Lori Lodes said consumers will be able to start enrolling for 2015 coverage sometime early Saturday morning. The Healthcare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, opens for business again on Saturday but renewals from 2014 might come with a new kind of sticker shock . Supporters of Covered California, that state's Obamacare exchange, have been on a promotional tour all week to raise awareness among Latinos and others who missed last year's first enrollment season . Premiums are the first thing most consumers look at. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers's Health Research Institute, the average premium will be around $344 before tax credit subsidies. That's an increase from 2014 of about 3.5 per cent. Premiums vary from state to state with some down 22 per cent and others up as much as 35 per cent. Most people who apply through exchanges will qualify for tax credits that reduce their premiums. For 2015, individuals earning between $11,670 and $46,680 qualify for a premium tax credit. For a family of four, the range is $23,850 to $95,400. But there is a catch if you already buy medical insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces: Your plan may no longer be the lost-cost benchmark in your community. In that case, you'll pay more unless you switch. 'Just because you enrolled in a low-cost plan this year is no guarantee that your plan will also be low-cost next year,' said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. He analyzed a 48-city sample of 2015 premiums from data available earlier this week. 'Last year's low cost plans will experience premium increases, meaning the majority of consumers will experience cost increases if they re-enroll in the same plan,' said Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a private market analysis firm. An early look by Avalare at premiums for a hypothetical 50-year-old nonsmoker in the benchmark plan found wide differences among states, from a 28 per cent increase in Alaska to a 19 per cent reduction in Mississippi. Most states saw single-digit changes. Consumers should be wary of national and even state averages, and instead focus on what's happening with their own plan, the analysis said. The shifts are due to the ups and downs of the market, and to cost-saving provisions written into the law. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidized private health insurance to people who don't have access to coverage on the job. Healthcare.gov and state insurance markets are launching their second annual sign-up season, which runs through Feb. 15. TROUBLE AHEAD: Despite an all-out push by the White House, the Obamacare law remains unpopular with less than 39 per cent of Americans saying the support it . This year, 85 per cent of their customers received tax credits to subsidize their premiums. Those existing customers will be renewing coverage for the first time. Some could face sticker shock. The following example uses actual premiums from Healthcare.gov, and was provided by the Kaiser Foundation: . Take a hypothetical 40-year-old retail salesperson in Miami making $20,000 a year. This year, she signed up for the benchmark low-cost plan in her area, the 'Coventry $10 Copay.' The full premium was $270 a month. Her government tax credit covered $184 of that, so her share was $86 a month. For 2015, Coventry is no longer the benchmark plan. Instead, it's the 'Molina Silver HMO,' with a monthly premium of $274. If the consumer switches to Molina for 2015, the government will pay $191 and her share will be $83. But if she wants to stay with Coventry, she'll see a 40 per cent increase. That's because Coventry increased its premium to $311 for 2015. And also, the federal share will be capped at $191 — what the government would pay for the benchmark Molina plan. The consumer would be on the hook for $120 a month. Part of the reason for such shifts is that the health care law was designed like a voucher system. Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist regarded as the 'architect' of the president's medical insurance overhaul law, is in hot water after a series of videos surfaced in which he suggested that the White House relied on 'the stupidity of the American voter' in order to get the law passed in 2010 . You get a tax credit for health insurance based on your income and on the premium for the benchmark plan in your area, called the 'second-lowest-cost silver plan.'  Plans are offered in four 'metal levels' of coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The benchmark silver plan can change every year based on bids submitted by insurers. If you pick a higher-cost plan, or if you stay in a plan that has lost its benchmark status, you are responsible for the entire difference in premiums. The idea was to create incentives that would force insurers to compete and keep premiums low. Competition is helping to drive down the price of the benchmarks, said Levitt, which is good for the federal budget. 'But competition is also messy, particularly for consumers.' Some Republicans saw the predicament as more fodder for their campaign against 'Obamacare.' 'Last year, many who liked their plan were surprised to learn they couldn't keep it,' said Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. 'This year, many who like their plan will likely have to pay more to keep it.' As the federal government and states launch a second round of enrollment under the Obamacare  law, plans will cover essential health benefits, pre-existing conditions and preventive care – but dental and vision benefits vary. Here are some questions and answers about individual coverage: . Q: How do I choose the right plan? A: Just like last year, there are five categories or metal levels of coverage including bronze, silver, gold, platinum and catastrophic. Plans in each category pay different amounts of the total costs of an average person's care. For a silver plan, your health plan will pay an average of 70 per cent, you pay about 30 per cent. If you expect a lot of doctor visits or need regular prescriptions, you may want a gold or platinum plan that have higher monthly premiums but pay more of your costs when you need care. If you don't expect to use a lot of medical services, you may want a silver, bronze, or catastrophic plan that cost you less per month, but pay less of your costs when you need care. Catastrophic coverage is available only to people who are under 30 years old or have a hardship exemption. Q: Is vision coverage available? A: Health plans don't have to include adult vision coverage, only pediatric vision coverage. If your plan doesn't include adult vision coverage, you can buy stand-alone plans for an additional cost outside the exchange. Insurers who provide stand-alone vision plans say it's unfair to keep them out of the exchanges because they are paying millions of dollars in additional taxes to support the health overhaul. Attempts to address the issue in Congress have proved futile, as did a recent attempt in the California Legislature. VSP, the nation's largest vision care company with 60 million members, had to pay $25 million by Sept. 30 in new federal taxes even though the company is not allowed to sell directly in most states. Q: Is dental coverage available? A: Health plans don't have to include adult dental coverage, only pediatric dental coverage. If your plan doesn't include adult dental, you can buy stand-alone family dental plans for an additional cost through their state exchange. Some consumers may be drawn to family dental plans if a dentist they prefer is not a provider in their health plan. Q: I have health insurance through work. Can I check out the exchange to see if that insurance would be better or cheaper? A: The exchanges are for people who don't have access to affordable coverage at work. If you lose your job and your health insurance, you can apply for coverage through HealthCare.gov or your state exchange at any time of the year. You'd be eligible for what's called a 'special enrollment period' available to people who experience certain life changes. Coverage through the exchanges is likely to be more affordable than continuing your employer's plan under COBRA.","Existing Affordable Care Act customers may find that the plans they selected last year are no longer  the 'low cost benchmarks' where they live .

"It was arguably the hottest sporting ticket of all time. And Britain’s high society stalwarts didn’t disappoint as they begged, borrowed and charmed their way into Centre Court yesterday to watch Andy Murray’s quest for glory. There was a prime minister, a former England football captain and even a Time Lord. But it was, perhaps inevitably, the impeccably dressed Middleton sisters who stole the show. Side by side, with their glossy brunette blow-dries styled to perfection, they were greeted with wolf whistles and cheers as they entered the Royal Box. Scroll down for video . It's all over now: Pippa Middleton and her sister the Duchess of Cambridge salute Roger Federer and Andy Murray during the trophy presentation . The Duchess of Cambridge waved excitedly to fans as she and her 28-year-old sister took their front-row seats. Kate looked as impossibly chic as . ever in a cream Joseph ensemble of the £480 ‘Nessie’ tweed jacket, which . debuted last year at the Epsom Derby, and a £275 crepe shift ‘Vanessa’ dress which she bought for last summer’s North American tour.

"They are nature’s fair-weather tourists. Following the summer heatwave and mild autumn, Britain has seen a huge influx of exotic moths and butterflies from North Africa and the Continent. Not only are the colourful species making the sea crossing in a record numbers, but some seem destined to overwinter on our shores, a feat that has not occurred in years. Exotic butterflies and moths from the continent have begun to colonise Britain following the heatwave, experts have said. The largest of the underwing moths, the Clifden Nonpareil (pictured) sports a striking blue wing flash to ward off predators . It is also the first time the European Long-tailed Blue has raised broods at sites across the south coast, with the butterflies spotted from Dorset to Kent. A surge in sightings of rare moths, including the Clifden Nonpareil and Rosy Underwing, across several southern counties suggests they could be colonising our shores. The largest of the underwing moths, the Clifden Nonpareil sports a striking blue wing flash to ward off predators. ‘These sightings suggest that all . three species may be attempting to colonise southern England,’ said . Richard Fox, of the Butterfly Conservation Charity. ‘It . is very exciting news, not only for the people lucky enough to see . these thrilling butterflies and moths in the wild but also for the . future. Increasing numbers of the rare migrants are believed to have been drawn to the UK by the spell of hot summer weather and warm autumn temperatures.

While the species probably won¿t survive the forthcoming winter, it seems likely that the stunning Clifden Nonpareil and possible even the Rosy Underwing (pictured), have already established footholds in southern England . ‘And that’s all set against the backdrop of a major migration of moths, which includes the Vestal and Death’s-head Hawkmoth.’ Conservationists claim this autumn has . seen the largest influx of Vestal moths for more than 50 years, with . the insects spotted as far north as Scotland and Northern Ireland. Higher . than average numbers of the exotic Crimson Speckled moth, which is . usually found in North Africa and Southern Europe, have also been . recorded. ‘We get an . annual autumn immigration from hotter parts of Europe, but this is just a . bumper year.

Conservationists claim this autumn has seen the largest influx of Vestal moths (pictured) for more than 50 years, with the insects spotted as far north as Scotland and Northern Ireland . ‘Immigration happens right across the south coast, with some moths and butterflies using the warm currents to fly hundreds of miles to make the trip. Some are certainly coming from Mediterranean if not North Africa.’ Dorset County Moth Recorder Les Hill has seen three separate Clifden Nonpareil moths in the past two weeks in the same part of south Dorset. ‘It is one of the most charismatic of British moth fauna and is on every moth recorders’ ‘wish list’,’ he said. ‘As the name nonpareil states, it is peerless and has no equal.

"Countries across Europe could soon ban plastic bags in a bid to meet ambitious new reduction targets. Previous international attempts to banish throwaway bags handed out at tills were blocked by British ministers who claimed the controls would breach free trade laws. But under new proposals, EU nations will have the power to either ban or impose charges on disposable carrier bags in a bid to reduce their use by 80 per cent. Britons could soon be banned from taking their shopping home in plastic bags after the EU set new targets to reduce their use . Two months ago Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced shoppers in England will be charged 5p for plastic bags in supermarkets and other large stores from 2015 onwards, in response to the Daily Mail's Banish The Bags campaign. The bags are often used for 20 minutes on average but take up to 1,000 years to degrade. Many are swept out to sea and have a devastating effect on marine and bird life, including turtles and gulls. Every year each EU citizen uses, on average, 200 bags with 8billion of them ending up in seas and rivers . The announcement will bring England in line with Wales and Northern Ireland, were similar charges resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of single-use bags given out. In March, British ministers were condemned as 'shameful' and 'devious' after they blocked European efforts to ban plastic bags. They used EU free trade regulations to overturn the Italian government's ban on thin plastic bags in their own country, infuriating environmental campaigners. On average, each European citizen uses almost 200 disposable bags a year, and 8billion of them ending up in rivers, lakes and seas. Now a new set of EU-wide proposals aim to cut our use of the one-use bags by up to four-fifths by 2017. They will also allow member states to adopt measures restricting the free movement of goods if needed to protect the environment, meaning national bans will be possible for the first time. Environment Commissioner Janez Potočnik said: 'We're taking action to solve a very serious and highly visible environmental problem. 'Every year, more than 8 billion plastic bags end up as litter in Europe, causing enormous environmental damage. 'Some Member States have already achieved great results in terms of reducing their use of plastic bags. If others followed suit we could reduce today's overall consumption in the European Union by as much as 80 per cent.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has already set a minimum 5p charge for plastic bags from 2015 in response to the Mail's Banish the Bags campaign . Officials estimate it will take 12 months for the rules to be approved, and then Britain and other EU nations will be given a further three years to implement them. The bags which litter our coastline can end up thousands of miles away, sealing the fate of turtles, whales and seals which mistake them for jellyfish, a staple part of their diet. Coastal birds such as seagulls are also at risk because they are carnivores whose diet consists of almost any food they can scavenge. A 2004 study of wildlife in the North Sea found 96 per cent of dead sea birds had fragments of plastic in their stomachs. Dr Laura Foster, the Marine Conservation Society's pollution programme manager, said: 'The EU has provided further weight behind campaigns such as Break the Bag Habit by announcing a proposal to reduce the annual 100 billion plastic bags used in the EU. 'Member states are required to adopt measures to reduce consumption of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns. 'This is superb news and is an excellent step to help reduce marine litter and litter in general across the EU states.' A Defra spokesperson said: 'Plastic bags are a blight on our towns and countryside which is why we announced earlier in the year that we're bringing in a five pence mandatory charge for single use plastic carrier bags from Autumn 2015.'","New EU target set to reduce plastic bag use by 80 per cent .

"James Bond author William Boyd landed himself in a row over product placement after accepting a six-figure sum from Land Rover. But the author has defended his decision to include a mention of the brand, saying authors have always written for commission, including Charles Dickens. In his latest novella, his protagonist - Alex Dunbar - sets off for Scotland in a battered, old Land Rover Defender. The car manufacturer commissioned the writer to pen The Vanishing Game - but he said he was given free reign and only told that it would be good if a Land Rover appeared somewhere in the 17,000-word story. Commission: Author William Boyd received a six-figure sum from Land Rover to pen The Vanishing Game . The writer said he agreed to the project for a low six-figure sum because Land Rover had made so few requests. He said: 'They said they wanted an adventure and they said, 'Somewhere in this adventure it would be good if a Land Rover appeared.' 'But it was left entirely to me the extent I concentrated on that or made it fleeing and passing. 'I invented the story, I invented the characters, I invented the locations.' He told The Times: 'If I was approached to write a Batman movie I would assume it would have to feature Batman. 'There's really no difference in this case.' But although fellow writers are on board with the idea of product placement moving from the cinema and television shows to fiction, publishing house Galley Beggar Press tweeted 'Oh jesus god no' in response to the news. Ken Bracht, communications manager for Land Rover North America, said Boyd was their preferred author early on. Inspiration: The protagonist in the story sets off for Scotland in a battered Land Rover Defender. File photo . Boyd received a lot of attention for writing a James Bond novel, called Solo, which was published last year . This was 'given his popularity, reputation for adventure type stories' and the attention he was receiving at the time for his Bond novel, 'Solo,' published in September last year. The Vanishing Game is available as a free eBook from Amazon and Apple as can be read from an interactive Tumblr page. While the literary community is not known for commercial endorsements, there are precedents. In 2001, Bulgari commissioned Fay Weldon to write 'The Bulgari Connection' and references to the jewellers were worked into the story. Julia Alvarez wrote a poem for Absolut vodka and several authors, including Elmore Leonard and Lisa Scottoline, contributed essays for a 1990s Coca-Cola campaign. William Boyd's novels have earned him critical acclaim all over the world . William Boyd grew up in Ghana and Nigeria before attending the universities of Nice and Glasgow as well as Jesus College, Oxford - where he gained a doctorate in English Literature. He was also a lecturer in English Literature at St. Hilda's College in Oxford in the early 1980s and was awarded the CBE in 2005. His novels, which include Stars and Bars, The New Confessions, Armadillo and Any Human Heart, have been published in thirty languages, with many of them receiving worldwide acclaim. A Good Man in Africa was the winner of the Whitbread Award and the Somerset Maugham Prize in 1981. In 1982, An Ice Cream War was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. In 1990, Brazzaville Beach was winner of the McVitie Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize . The Blue Afternoon was the 1993 Sunday Express Book of the Year  and also won the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Fiction, 1995. As well as writing novels, his screenwriting credits include 1992's Chaplin, directed by Richard Attenborough, and he also adapted Evelyn Waugh's Scoop for television in 1988. His own three-part adaptation of his novel Armadillo was screened on BBC1 in 2001 and on A&E in the US in 2002. He has written two original TV films about boarding-school life in England: Good and Bad at Games (1983) and Dutch Girls (1985). He adapted his own novel Any Human Heart into a four-part drama for Channel 4 in 2010, which garnered much critical acclaim. His ninth novel, Restless, was published in September 2006 and was the novel of the year at the Costa Book Awards. Last year, he turned his hand to writing for another author's characters and took Ian Fleming's James Bond to Africa in Solo. Now, with The Vanishing Game, he has again written from commission and incorporated car manufacturer Land Rover in his latest work.","Author penned a 17,000-word story commissioned by car manufacturer .

"People's brains are slower to realise when they have done something wrong than right, scientists say . While most of us are happy to take the credit when things go well, few of us are willing to take the blame when things go awry. Now scientists have figured out why. Rather than trying to hide our shame or embarrassment, experts found we are simply less aware when our actions result in a negative outcome. Our brains take longer to associate our actions with a bad result, according to the study, and our perception of such events are more remote. The research may explain why we often feel it hard to take the blame for our actions. ‘Our result suggests that people may really experience less responsibility for negative than for positive outcomes,’ said lead researcher professor Patrick Haggard of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London. ‘This is not merely a retrospective justification about how well we have done: the actual experience that we have changes, even in basic aspects like its timing.’ In a series of tests, participants were asked to press a key. A sound then followed, either disapproving, neutral or approving, and they were then asked to estimate the time between the action and when they had heard the sound. Researchers found individuals experienced different levels of responsibility depending on the outcome. They also discovered they were significantly slower to recognise if their actions had resulted in a bad consequence, compared to when they had done well. ‘Effectively we have found that we experience a negative outcome differently, not just retell it differently. We make a weaker connection when there is a bad result, and respond much more strongly when something good happens,’ said professor Haggard. ‘Everybody who has worked in a team, will recognise the scenario. When something goes right, everyone want to take credit and when things go wrong, nobody is interested in putting their hand up.’ Researchers at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London found participants experienced different levels of responsibility depending on whether what they did was right of wrong . The researchers said our brain is ‘very much concerned’ with reward as biologically good results are key to survival. But they warned that although our own perception of culpability is altered by the outcome, this does not provide a defence if we have done something wrong. ‘This mechanism may well explain why some people do things and don’t fell as responsible as they should,’ said professor Haggard. ‘Our experience of our own responsibilities can be misleading and can be strongly coloured by the outcomes of our actions. ‘But the way we experience an outcome is not the same as the facts of the event. We have to take responsibility for what we actually do, not just for how we experience things.’","Experts say people are less aware when actions produce negative outcome .

"Hospital managers have been accused of covering up the surgical record of an NHS gynaecologist whose alleged mistakes devastated the lives of some of her patients. Jayne Cockburn is thought to have operated on hundreds of patients at Frimley Park Hospital in Camberley, Surrey, before an investigation led to her being suspended. She was stopped from carrying out operations in 2011 but it took hospital bosses three years to reveal this to the patients she had dealt with. Lawyers claim that NHS gynaecologist Jayne Cockburn left some of her patients incontinent, file photograph . Lawyers allege that: . Hospital bosses finally wrote to 101 former patients this summer saying they had had ‘cause to undertake a clinical review’ of the consultant’s surgical practice. The hospital has admitted that about half of these women suffered ‘potentially significant’ medical issues. The letters prompted a wave of claims. Solicitor Philippa Luscombe of law firm Penningtons Manches, which is dealing with more than 20, said: ‘She was diving in and operating left, right and centre, without obtaining full and proper consent. ‘There are some very sad cases, such as women left doubly incontinent when they were seeking help for a relatively minor problem. Some will never have a sex life again. It’s nasty.’ One former patient, in her 50s, said surgical complications after a hysterectomy carried out ‘without good reason’ had effectively destroyed her marriage. She said: ‘My husband is still with me but we are no longer intimate. We are like brother and sister.’ Jacqueline Elston, 52, who has been awarded £50,000 in compensation, was left incontinent after a series of operations during which incisions were allegedly made without her consent. She said: ‘It cannot compensate for the fact that I have to live with these problems for the rest of my life.’ Miss Cockburn was suspended from carrying out operations at the Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, pictured . And Mike McLeod, 43, from Fleet, Hampshire, whose mother Yvonne died in 2004 after a prolapse operation, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned this is a cover-up by the hospital. They have known for years there was a problem with this surgeon.’ Pathologist Norman Ratcliffe said Mrs McLeod died of an abdominal infection, as a result of an instrumental perforation of the small bowel. The General Medical Council has launched an investigation into Miss Cockburn, according to lawyers. A spokesman for Frimley Park Hospital said: ‘Following the hospital’s own review earlier this year into care and treatment provided by the consultant up to 2011, we offered 101 patients the opportunity to be seen by a gynaecologist. About half were found to have potentially significant issues as a result.’ He said Miss Cockburn ‘has not carried out any clinical duties at Frimley Park Hospital since 2011’. He refused to say whether or not she was still being paid by the trust. He said former patients had been contacted only recently because ‘the scale of the issue only became apparent over a period of time, during which a pattern of complaints emerged’. Miss Cockburn was not contactable.","Gynaecologist Jayne Cockburn was suspended from duty in 2011 .

"Jamie Winter admitted lying to her clients about the extent of her Botox training . Beautician Jamie Winter mislead customers for 18 months claiming the entire time she had completed Harley Street training in administering Botox - but the truth was she never finished the course. Winter now says she needs a . shot of Botox herself to counteract the aging effects of the court case after . admitting lying to clients and injecting them with the skin plumper. One unsuspecting client was left with swollen eyes when she suffered a bad reaction to the treatment given by Winter, from Leeds. The now unemployed 35-year-old admitted misleading customers over the extent of her Harley Street training when she injected clients with the anti-ageing drug in a bid to help them look more youthful. Hull Crown Court heard around a dozen people from Scarborough and Bridlington had been treated by Winter, who told reporters outside the court: ' I shall be going home now to do some Botox because this whole case has been totally ageing'. Winter, who practised for 18 months and lived in Scarborough at the time, told clients she had undergone specialist training at the Academy in Harley Street, London at a cost of £6,500. However she never completed the £10,000 course. At the time no qualifications were needed to administer Botox. The case came to light after one client reacted badly to the drug and suffered swelling around the eyes. She approached a solicitor seeking compensation and was advised to go to the police. Having launched an investigation Humberside Police interviewed 12 people - two men and 10 women - who had run up bills for treatment ranging from £180 to £360 for a course of injections. The drug was unlicensed and available on the internet for £70. Winter was arrested in May 2012 and charged with fraud by false representation, claiming she had trained for two years and was qualified to inject the drug. Appearing in court the brunette, wearing a blonde wig in an effort to disguise her face, pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud by false representation between July 2011 and August 2012. Beautician Winter admitted five charges of fraud by false representation at Hull Crown Court. She arrived at court wearing a blonde wig (left) in a bid to disguise herself from photographers . Botox is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of wrinkles. The drug is also used to treat overactive bladder symptoms, prevent chronic headaches, treat increased muscle stiffness, specific eye problems, underarm sweating and other medical conditions. Manufacturers of the drug warn it can cause life-threatening side effects. All practitioners must now be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). To find a qualified practitioner visit the Department of Health backed Treatments You Can Trust Register. The cost of treatment varies with some clinics charging £100 while others price the procedure at £350. Most clinics charge on a 'per area' or 'per unit' basis. Prosecuting barrister Jharna Jobes said . Winter was initially facing fraud charges against 12 clients but said . the Crown was prepared to accept her not guilty pleas to seven and to a . charge of concealing criminal property - £10,500 in a gym locker - as it . would make no difference to her sentence. Defending his client, barrister Richard Thompson, said Winter initially protested her innocence and wanted a trial, which was not in the public interest. He said: 'At the time of the allegations there was no system of regulation. What was being alleged is fraud. 'She says at the time her clients were perfectly happy for her to administer Botox. 'It was initially charged as assault but these were people who were willing to have this done to them. 'The assault charge has been dropped.' Speaking outside court Ms Winter, now of Leeds, said: 'I do accept I mislead some people and should have made it clear what my training was. But I never injured anyone. 'The case was originally motivated by compensation. The police jumped in and got it all wrong. 'They thought people needed to be qualified to administer Botox. 'The reality is they don’t. I did not complete the college course because it would have cost me £10,000 and I would not have been qualified. 'The whole case has been blown out of proportion.' Leaving court she said she has administered the drug on herself but was not seeking a future career in it. She quipped: 'I shall be going home now to do some Botox, . because this whole case has been totally aging!' Judge Michael Mettyear told Winter she should be sentenced at Hull Crown Court on November 11.","Jamie Winter admitted lying about extent of her training for 18 months .

"The controversial badger cull has fallen so far short of its target that every animal killed has cost taxpayers more than £2,000, it is claimed. Only 708 badgers, or 30 per cent of the population, have been killed in Gloucestershire, falling far short of the 70 per cent target. And it emerged last week that  only 850 animals have been killed  in Somerset – the other area where the cull pilot is being carried out –  far fewer than the aim of 2,100. The overall costs of the two culls, including policing animal rights protesters, is estimated by campaigners at some £3.5million. Cull: The badger cull is costing £2,200 per animal killed. Only 30 per cent of Gloucestershire population have been killed - falling short of the 70 per cent target . With a total of 1,558 dead animals, this works out at £2,246 per badger. In contrast, vaccinating badgers against bovine tuberculosis in Wales was less than a third of the cost at £662 per animal. Campaigners warned that the  inability to meet targets could actually increase the spread of the  disease in cattle. Ridiculed: Owen Patterson, Enviroment Secretary, was ridiculed for suggesting badgers had 'moved the goalposts' Dominic Dyer, of charity Care for the Wild, said: ‘If the fact that this cull is morally and scientifically bankrupt isn’t enough, we’ve now got the fact that every badger killed so far has cost the British taxpayer around £2,200. 'To put that in perspective, the cost of each dead badger could provide a hospital bed for a week. ‘I don’t know how they can possibly kill enough badgers in the next three weeks in either zone to reach the total they want. ‘That means scientifically the cull can’t possibly have any positive impact on bovine TB – and will most likely make it worse. ‘They should stop now before this cull costs more lives and more taxpayers’ money for absolutely no reason.’ Experts . have said that at least 70 per cent of badgers in an area must be . killed in order to limit bovine TB – meaning that costs could spiral . further if the cull is unsuccessful. Environment . secretary Owen Paterson yesterday denied the project was a failure but . confirmed the cull companies would be seeking an eight-week extension so . they could reduce animal numbers further. Last week, he was ridiculed for . suggesting badgers had ‘moved the goalposts’ as he revealed the . Government had reduced its cull target.

"A massive offshore wind farm scheme designed to power a  million homes has been axed, raising the risk that Britain could be hit by blackouts. German company RWE pulled the plug on the £4billion, 240-turbine Atlantic Array project in the  Bristol Channel, citing ‘technical challenges’ and spiralling costs. But critics yesterday blamed disagreements within the Coalition for creating uncertainty and discouraging investment in renewable energy. David Cameron has said he wants to ‘roll . back’ green taxes in next week’s autumn statement, with senior Tory . sources last week alleging he ordered ministers to ditch the ‘green . c**p’. Scrapped: German developer RWE is pulling the plug on the 240-turbine Atlantic Array project, pictured, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said . But leading Liberal Democrats remain committed to green levies, which  currently add £112 to the average bill, and pay for clean energy such as wind farms and solar panels. An industry insider said: ‘The mixed messages coming from government over whether it  supports renewables has undermined investor confidence. ‘Without a consistent approach, this will not be the last large-scale project that gets pulled.’ There are 22 offshore wind farms in operation, supplying power for 2.5million homes. Another 24 are either being built or in the pipeline, with offshore wind expected to generate enough electricity for 15million homes in the next decade. Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Liberum Capital bank, said scrapping the Atlantic Array could risk energy security. ‘The reason the Government liked offshore wind was that you can build them in really big chunks and they produce a lot of power, unlike onshore wind,’ he added. ‘When big coal plants come offline, you have to have something that can replace them. 'New nuclear won’t be ready until the end of the next decade. Now it looks like wind won’t be ready until then as well, so what will replace our coal?’ Paul Cowling, director of offshore wind . at RWE, said: ‘Given the technological challenges and market conditions, . now is not the right time for RWE to  continue to progress with this . project.’ Claims: Critics blame Coalition for discouraging investment in renewable energy for the company's decision to pull the plug on the project . The Atlantic Array had drawn criticism from environmentalists, concerned about its impact on marine wildlife, and campaigners who branded the planned 720ft-high turbines  as unsightly. But Friends of the Earth spokesman Andrew Pendleton said: ‘Wanton green-bashing by some at the heart of the  Coalition is starting to cost jobs and threaten the future security of our energy supply.’ Ed Miliband has also been accused of fuelling uncertainty after pledging to freeze energy prices for almost two years if Labour wins the next election. Last month, National Grid warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years. The number of coal-based power plants in the UK has fallen sharply due to EU legislation, which has caused older, polluting, fossil-fuel plants to be turned off. Plans for some gas-fired plants have been suspended because of economic pressures. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ‘The decision was made on purely technical grounds and reflects the many complex challenges of constructing offshore wind farms. The UK still expects to deploy significant amounts of offshore wind by 2020 and we remain well placed to meet our 2020 renewable energy target.’","240-turbine Atlantic Array project designed to power 1million homes axed .

"A member of AC/DC says the band has not spoken with Phil Rudd since he was charged with threatening to kill and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana last week. Angus Young, 59, said in an interview with Rolling Stone on Thursday that Rudd's behavior was somewhat erratic while recording the band's new album, 'Rock or Bust.' Young explained that Rudd, 60, was a no-show to recordings and video shoots, and that the band has resolved to continue the album campaign with or without him. From left: Brian Johnson, Malcolm Young, Phil Rudd, Angus Young, and Cliff Williams performing  during a concert in Germany. Young says his band mates have not been in touch with Rudd since he was charged . 'Well, we had a few problems. The situation he's in - that took everyone by surprise,' Young told Rolling Stone. 'We had a few issues before with him, even when we were recording it was hard even to get to him to do the recording.' 'And then he was supposed to show up to do promos with us, to do video shoots and a few shoots and a few other things, and he never showed up for that either. So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us,' Young said. Rudd, who has been with the band on and off for nearly four decades, was released last week. He is expected to appear in court in New Zealand on Nov. 27. 'We haven't had contact,' Young said in New York City. 'But he has his people that represent him. He's got himself in a pickle.' Police had initially accused Rudd of trying to arrange for a hit man to carry out two killings. Police had charged him with attempting to procure murder, which comes with a maximum 10-year sentence; the charge was dropped after a day. Rudd, 60, could face a maximum prison term of seven years for the charge of threatening to kill. Young says AC/DC will continue to promote the album and perform without Rudd, if need be. The band will launch a tour next year. 'We were resolved for us to go forward and I think Phil's got — it's something he's got to do himself. He's got to sort himself out I think,' the guitarist said. 'But we were resolved to go forward. So at this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.' The Australian band also faced a shake-up in its lineup when 61-year-old guitarist Malcolm Young, who has dementia, announced in September he was leaving the group because of his health. Stevie Young, nephew of founding members Malcolm and Angus Young, played guitar on the band's new album and will join them on the tour. Rock or Bust is due to be released on Dec. 2.

"Cosmetic cowboys with no medical training will remain free to inject women with ‘backstreet Botox’ because health Ministers have bowed to pressure to leave the industry largely unregulated. The Mail on Sunday has learnt that the Government is to reject a crucial recommendation in a hard-hitting review of the booming sector, to the outrage of leading doctors. This newspaper has been campaigning since March for far tougher regulation of the industry. The Mail on Sunday has called for measures including a minimum standard for surgeons; proper regulation for all those practising cosmetic surgery; and an end to the hard-sell tactics that see special offers and glossy advertising undermine the seriousness of the procedures involved. Ministers have bowed to pressure and will leave the industry largely unregulated . Ministers are worried that regulating the £3 billion industry will constrain it in the run-up to the 2015 Election – a period during which they want unfettered economic growth. But doctors and campaigners believe people’s health could be put seriously at risk. When the review was published in April, Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said he agreed entirely with the principles behind its recommendations. A key proposal was the creation of a compulsory register for everyone carrying out cosmetic treatments – including Botox injections, use of wrinkle-smoothing dermal fillers, and laser hair-removal treatments. A crackdown on so-called 'backstreet Botox' is to be shelved over fears that it could harm the economy . At the moment these can be carried out by anyone – sometimes with horrifying results. But this newspaper has been told that the Department for Business has insisted that any register should be voluntary – meaning ‘cosmetic cowboys’ will be able to operate as normal. ‘Non-surgical cosmetic interventions’ account for three-quarters of the value of the cosmetics industry and the vast majority of growth in the sector, which will be worth £3.6 billion by 2015 having grown five-fold in a decade. Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry, who sat on the cosmetics review panel, said the lack of a mandatory register was ‘outrageous’. Describing the Government’s expected response as ‘utterly appalling’, Ms Parry said: ‘It means people’s lives will continue to be put at risk. ‘We are heading for a public health disaster, just because it fits in with the Government’s growth agenda. I believe there’s an element of chauvinism here, a mindset that ‘‘these are stupid people having these treatments and it’s their own fault if things go wrong’’.’ NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh was asked to lead the cosmetics review in the wake of the PIP breast implants scandal, which led to thousands of British women having them taken out. Last night Sir Bruce said he would be dismayed if the Government decided against firm regulation. And Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic  Surgeons, said a mandatory register was essential. Marcelle King, 58, is one of those who has suffered from ‘backstreet Botox’. She ended up in casualty after being injected with what she believes was fake Botox by a man purporting to be a plastic surgeon. The ‘treatment’ took place in a friend’s kitchen. Mrs King, a dog trainer from Poole in Dorset, suffered a severe allergic reaction and said: ‘I could have died. The police still don’t know what I was injected with – it could have  been knocked up in someone’s bathtub. ‘I will be very disappointed if the Government fails to regulate – it’s all about money isn’t it? Has someone got to die before they do anything serious about it?’ Critics claim the cosmetics industry has determinedly  lobbied Ministers to stop short of a mandatory register. Firms have funded a body called Treatments You Can Trust, which launched a voluntary register of ‘qualified cosmetic injectable providers’  in 2010.","Ministers have bowed to pressure and will leave industry largely unregulated .

"Police have been dragged off the beat to work on the Olympics after dozens of G4S security guards failed to turn up for work, it emerged yesterday. Just four of the 58 staff expected to report for duty at the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, showed up, one of whom later disappeared. In Salford, Greater Manchester, only 17 of the 56 G4S staff due at another Olympic team hotel could be bothered to present themselves for work. Security: Police inspect a car outside a Manchester hotel which had been due to be guarded by G4S staff . Filling in: Police officers stand guard at the Marriot Worsley Park hotel in Manchester to protect athletes after G4S workers failed to appear . Home Secretary Theresa May admitted yesterday that she has no idea how many G4S staff will turn up for work – raising the prospect that thousands more soldiers may have to be deployed, on top of the 3,500 who have already been called up. ‘The precise balance of the numbers that they will be providing will become clear over the next few days,’ she told MPs. The political pressure was also growing last night as a series of leaked documents revealed that some officials have known of the problem for at least three months. Mrs May claimed that ministers were told only last week that G4S could not deliver the 10,000 security guards it promised. But she was directly contradicted by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who said: ‘Everyone that was organising the Olympics knew this was coming up ages ago.’ An internal G4S memo leaked last night revealed that the company’s bosses deliberately failed to train people early because it would not be ‘cost-effective’. In the document, obtained by Channel 4 News and dated June 29, Mark Hamilton, then head of Olympic security, wrote: ‘It would have been an advantage to have everyone trained months in advance but this was neither practical nor cost-effective.’ Gaps: Only 17 of an expected 56 G4S security staff turned up for work at the hotel, Greater Manchester Police Federation said . Yesterday, several hundred officers from nine police forces were being drafted in to plug gaps left by G4S. West Midlands Police Federation chairman Ian Edwards said his force has had to provide 150 officers per day to cover a hotel in Warwickshire where Olympic footballers are staying, and could need to provide hundreds more at other venues. He said: ‘It’s chaos, absolute chaos. You shouldn’t lose your local police officer because of the Olympics.’ The position of G4S chief executive Nick Buckles – due to give evidence to a Commons select committee today – looked increasingly perilous last night. G4S could lose more than £700million of future Government work – including running prisons and police stations – after its reputation was tarnished by the debacle. Base: Athletes have been staying at the Marriot Worsley Park hotel in Manchester with police protection . Ring of steel: Armed police and soldiers guard the Olympic Village in Portland, Dorset, where sailing events are to be held. Dorset Police is one of nine forces deploying extra officers to fill the gap left by G4S . Target: The Olympic village in Portland is among several Games venues which will have to be patrolled by extra police officers . A collapse in its share price has seen some £600million wiped from the value of the company since the guard shortfall emerged last week, and it has already admitted it will make a £50million loss on the Olympics contract. City analyst Mike Allen, of broking house Panmure Gordon, said: ‘I’m sure that one or two heads are going to have to roll for this.’ G4S chairman John Connolly said: ‘We don’t want to do anything that smacks of short-term expediency, but it would be right to consider whether any members of the senior team are best placed to take the company forward.’ But Mr Buckles could walk away with a bulging pension pot and company shares worth £21million. Arrival: A group of soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland march in front of the Olympic stadium. Extra military personnel have been drafted in after G4S failed to provide enough security guards . Monitoring: Three soldiers survey the Olympic Park as the massive security operation gets under way . Downing Street confirmed that the Government’s Cobra crisis committee would now meet every day – often under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister – throughout the Olympics to prevent further security disasters. Last night it emerged that officials were sufficiently worried to commission an audit of whether G4S could deliver on its promises. A source told ITV news the audit was seen by the Home Office and Games organisers Locog. The audit dated April 23, said: ‘Clearly the training operation is very frustrated at not being able to put through the required numbers, and viewing with trepidation the inevitable last-minute nature of the mass throughput that will be the consequence.’ The audit found that attendance at training events was just 60 per cent of ‘planned capacity.' Last laugh? Mr Buckles could take home a package . of up to £21million in bonuses, shares and pension if he is forced to . quit the company over the guard-recruitment fiasco . Vigilant: Soldiers in high-visibility vests man an entry point to the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London . With just ten days until the opening . ceremony, senior police officers are said to be ‘extremely concerned’ not only about the absence of so many G4S staff – but also about the . poor quality of those who turn up.

"Nearly 1,000 children have been referred to hospitals in the last three years because of their weight . Children as young as ten months old have been admitted to hospital because they are dangerously overweight, an investigation has revealed. Over the past three years, at least 932 children under the age of 15 have needed urgent medical attention as a consequence of Britain’s obesity epidemic. However the true scale of the problem is likely to be much higher, as less than a third of hospital trusts have released information about the number of young children whose weight has spiralled out of control. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust has revealed that during the past year, doctors found themselves having to treat a ten-month-old baby for obesity – and a one year old was referred to Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust as a result of her weight. Several overweight two-year-olds, at least 101 children under the age of five and a further 283 children of primary school age were also diagnosed with obesity, according to hospital admission data obtained by the Sunday Times. Tam Fry, a National Obesity Forum member and chairman of charity the Child Growth Foundation, said the findings should provide Britain with a wake-up call. He said: ‘Unless we tackle bad lifestyle and bad diet then we will never get to grips with the obesity epidemic. ‘We should ask ourselves why babies born at healthy weight get so fat that they are admitted to hospital at ten months. ‘If the parents sit around and eat the wrong food, then what chance do their children have.’ He added: ‘This is a total failure of the NHS to do its job properly, which is to regularly monitor children of a young age to ensure they are healthy. ‘Better monitoring and early intervention would help prevent this issue.’ The second highest number of admissions for obese children are at Great Ormond Street in London . A separate investigation also found . that some foods that are aimed at babies and toddlers have alarming . amounts of sugar. Products that have more than 22.5g of sugar per 100g . often appear as red in colour-coded nutrition labels. But one snack, Organix Goodies Strawberry and Apple Fruit Gummies, has almost 70g of natural fruit sugar per 100g. Over the last three years, 932 children under the age of 15 were admitted to hospital for obesity . And the same company’s Goodies Raspberry and Apple Soft Oaty Bars have 29.4g of sugar per 100g. The . firm admitted that the products have a high natural sugar content . because they contain fruit purees and concentrates, but said they do not . contain any refined sugar. As . well as the Organix range, Heinz fruit with yoghurt cereal – which is . aimed at babies over four months – contains 27.6g of sugar per 100g, . some of which has been added. A . company spokesman said they try to keep the amount of sugar in their . products to a minimum, but the investigation also found the brand’s . organic biscotti contains 28g of sugar per 100g. Childhood . obesity is now thought to cost the NHS around £4.2billion every year, . according to estimates put forward by the Royal College of Paediatrics. In . Britain at the moment, one in three children aged between two and ten . years  old is overweight, according to the National Child Measurement . Programme. And over the past . decade, the UK has seen a four-fold rise in youngsters needing medical . attention as a consequence of being obese. NHS . admission figures, released earlier this year,  show that the number of . overweight children admitted to hospital rose from 872 in 2000 to 3,806 . in 2009. The statistics . also show that between 2000 and 2009, a total of nearly 21,000 patients . aged between five and 19 were treated for obesity-related conditions . such as asthma and type 2 diabetes. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The rate of childhood obesity has remained stable for the past few years but is still deeply worrying. 'People who are obese in childhood are more likely to carry that weight into adulthood — leaving them at risk of a lifetime of serious health problems. 'We are taking the lead in tackling obesity through our Responsibility Deal with industry and through Change4Life we are targeting more and more children and families with information on how to eat well, move more and live longer.'

"Women are set to be allowed into frontline combat roles for the first time in British Army history – even though senior officers fear the move will lead to a drop in standards. Centuries-old rules which prevent women joining infantry and tank unit regiments are likely to be repealed following a six-month review. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is expected to sign off the plans this week, bringing Britain into line with allies such as the US and Australia. EQUALITY PLEA: Women are set to be allowed frontline combat roles for the first time in British Army history even though senior officers fear the move will lower standards; pictured is army driver Alex Neil who believes is 'good enough' she should be able to join the infantry . As part of the UK review, thousands of officers and members of other ranks across the Army, Royal Navy and RAF were invited to fill in a confidential questionnaire on the website Survey Monkey. One officer who took part told The Mail on Sunday he had an ‘overwhelming fear’ that Army top brass would lower the physical standards to make the change work. He added: ‘I’m in favour so long as women pass the tests currently in place – not new tests designed for both men and women which are easier than what we demand now. ‘I’ve seen what several years serving in the infantry does to very fit and determined men, who are built bigger and stronger than women. They carry huge packs and endure enormous hardships. ‘What will lifting 100lbs over the mountains do to a woman’s body which simply isn’t designed for it? We will break people into pieces if we go through with this.’ Other officers said they were worried that the Army could be leaving itself open to expensive legal action should women who volunteer for infantry training suffer serious injuries. They also pointed out that, on the basis of their own experiences, few women are interested in transferring into combat units. ‘I’ve seen what several years serving in the infantry does to very fit and determined men, who are built bigger and stronger than women. They carry huge packs and endure enormous hardships', a source said. Pictured is Private Nicola Bateman, a medic, who treats casualties on patrol . An exemption clause in the European Union’s Equal Treatment Directive allows the UK to exclude women from certain military units in order to guarantee public safety. A similar clause was written into the UK Equality Act of 2010. However, Britain is also obliged by the European Commission to periodically reassess discriminatory legislation. And supporters of women being permitted to join the infantry say their performance in Afghanistan has proved the time is right for change. On a visit to Helmand Province in February 2013, The Mail on Sunday asked female soldiers if they wanted to join the infantry. Private Alex Neil from 12 Close Support Logistic Regiment said: ‘If a woman is good enough, why not? Our infantry should definitely be opened up to female recruits. We carry the same amount of kit as the guys and do many of the same jobs.’ But Pte Alisha Henderson, serving in a catering unit, disagreed. She said: ‘Some women say you should push for equality but I think it is impossible for most women to be as strong as men.’ Three British female personnel lost their lives in clashes with the Taliban: Captain Lisa Head, 29, and Corporals Sarah Bryant, 26, and Channing Day, 25. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed the review process into women in combat roles was continuing.","Rules preventing women joined infantry and tank units to be repealed .

"Scientists have warned exposure to the rare metal tungsten, found in mobile phones, could double the risk of stroke (stock image) Exposure to a rare metal found in mobile phones could double an individual’s risk of stroke, scientists warned. High levels of tungsten significantly raises the risk of the disease, particularly for those under the age of 50, a new study has found. Although our current exposure to the precious metal is low, it is being increasingly used in everyday items such mobile phones, computers and light bulbs. In the past decade, production has almost doubled, as advances in technology continue to drive demand. Experts now fear its increased prevalence could pose a health risk to future generations. During its production, small amounts of the metal escape into the environment, eventually making their way into rivers and farmland. Exposure to tiny amounts present in the air, drinking water and in the food chain is common, but it remains unclear why certain individuals have higher levels. Researchers said there is no clear evidence linking use of technology such as smartphones and laptops to increased amounts of the metal in the blood. ‘Whilst currently very low, human exposure to tungsten is set to increase,’ said lead researcher Dr Jessica Tyrrell, from the University of Exeter. ‘We’re not yet sure why some members of the population have higher levels of the metal in their make-up, and an important step in understanding and preventing the risks it may pose to health will be to get to the bottom of how it’s ending up in our bodies.’ The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science ONE, looked at 8,614 US adults aged between 18 and 74 over a 12-year period. Individuals with high concentrations of tungsten in their system were found to be twice as likely to suffer a stroke, independent of typical risk factors. More than 150,000 people have a stroke each year, and it is the fourth largest cause of death in Britain after cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease. Co-author of the study complied at the University of Exeter, pictured, Dr Nicholas Osborne said the relationship between tungsten and stroke could be the 'tip of the iceberg', warning about the 'cocktail of chemicals' we subject our bodies to . Stroke is also the leading cause of adult disability, with more than half of all survivors left dependent on carers for everyday assistance. Co-author Dr Nicholas Osborne said: ‘The relationship we’re seeing between tungsten and stroke may only be the tip of the iceberg. 'As numerous new substances make their way into the environment, we’re accumulating a complex ‘chemical cocktail’ in our bodies. ‘Currently we have incredibly limited information on the health effects of individual chemicals and no research has explored how these compounds might interact together to impact human health.’ Dr Madina Kara, Neuroscientist at the Stroke Association, said: ‘We know that environmental factors, like air pollution, can play a part in stroke risk but this is the first time we’ve seen research linking tungsten to an increase risk of stroke. 'Whilst this research reveals increased tungsten levels in those having stroke, follow-on studies are required to assess the direct effects of tungsten on our health and its link to stroke. ‘Lifestyle factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and poor diet increase your risk of stroke. High blood pressure remains the single biggest risk factor for stroke. We know that half of all strokes could be prevented if people took steps to monitor and control their blood pressure.’","Study carried out at University of Exeter found people with high levels of the precious metal in their system were twice as likely to suffer a stroke .

"Lying on the bed, I try to relax as my therapist massages tea tree cleanser into my skin, before wiping toner across my cheeks. While this might sound like a run of the mill beauty treatment, it's not. I'm face down on the couch, and it's not my face that's getting a pampering. It's, um, my bottom. That's right, I'm having a 'bacial' - a bottom facial - which, according to those in the know, is this season's hottest beauty therapy. Scroll down for video . 'Lit up like a rainbow': Kim under the LED lamp which is said to correct pigmentation and encourage circulation . I blame Cheryl Cole, Kelly Brook and Lady Gaga. They've spearheaded the trend for 'belfies' - self-portraits of one's posterior, posted on social media. As a result, bottoms are taking centre stage, with one London salon group reporting that, in the past few months, they have seen a 200 per cent rise in enquiries for the treatments. 'Many of those undergoing the bum facials said they were motivated by seeing celebrities' perfect behinds on Twitter or Instagram,' says Esther Fieldgrass, CEO of EF Medispa. 'One of the most common complaints is a spotty bottom. While a lot of people are affected by this problem, it's terribly embarrassing for sufferers, especially now it's swimsuit season. Blemishes can be caused by anything from hormones to tight underwear causing friction and trapping sweat against the skin, but a bit of TLC can work wonders.' Beauty expert: Clare Russell helps Kim achieve the perfect derriere . While I have no intention of posting a 'belfie' any time soon, I am only too aware that my own middle-aged bottom is somewhat neglected - and with a beach holiday looming, a bacial seems prudent. The bacial at EF Medispa is bespoke to each client - when it comes to bottoms, one size apparently doesn't fit all. So my treatment begins with an assessment. I strip off my jeans and climb onto the massage table. Unsure of the dress code, I opt for bikini bottoms. But before I have a chance to think about it further, my therapist, Clare Russell, has pulled them aside to inspect the damage. (Learn from my mistake - it's easier for the therapist if you bite the bullet and go commando, or slip into one of the salon's paper thongs.) Having endured the embarrassment of my 55-year-old buttocks being scrutinised under an unforgiving light, I perk up when Clare informs me that I am fortunate enough to be free of blemishes. But, she tells me gravely, years of neglect have left my bottom looking rather lacklustre. Some maintenance, she tells me, is most definitely in order. Fruity: Clare applies a blueberry smoothie - not a drink but a chemical peel aimed at removing dead skin cells . What were once dimples are now plain cellulite and things aren't as firm as they used to be. Plus, as I haven't exfoliated in some time, things are more prickly pear than peach. Clare prescribes a 'blueberry smoothie' which isn't a drink but a chemical peel aimed at removing dead skin cells. This is to be followed by LED light therapy - a non-invasive treatment using a high-grade cold laser to heal problematic skin. But first, my buttocks are massaged with tea tree cleansing cream. While having a stranger pummel your bottom is peculiar, I nevertheless feel my gluteus maximus begin to relax. Next is another cleanse, using a toner that aims to increase skin cell turnover, and then it's time for the smoothie, a mask containing blueberry extracts, blue corn meal and lactic acids. Ever since a Sex And The City episode where Samantha's face is left red raw after such a treatment, the term 'chemical peel' has struck fear in my heart. Now it is striking fear into my nether regions. But Clare reassures me that, although I might feel a light tingle or warmth on application, this is a very gentle peel that will restore a glow without visible irritation. She presses the mask on and leaves me to relax for 15 minutes while the mask weaves its magic. I can't help wondering what on Earth my husband would make of all this if he could see me, wearing nothing but a mask across my  bottom. (I removed my bikini following the initial embarrassment). Women are keen to emulate the bottoms of stars like Kelly Brook, right, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini . After a quarter of an hour has passed, warm, damp flannels are used to wipe off the mask, leaving my buttocks invigorated. Then it's time for the sciencey bit, with a little LED light therapy - which uses a combination of coloured lights to promote healing, correct pigmentation, help with any scar tissue and encourage circulation. Clare wheels over an arch-shaped lighting panel, which she places about 18 inches above my bottom before switching it on. I don’t feel anything, not even warmth, but my bottom is lit up like a rainbow. The blue light is an anti-bacterial spot blaster, which has the added benefit of preparing the skin for sun exposure by increasing its natural UV protection, making it a perfect pre-holiday treatment. The yellow light boosts the nervous, lymphatic and circulatory systems and helps detoxify skin tissue. In combination with the red light, it stimulates collagen production, which results in firmer skin. Clare says three to five treatments are recommended to obtain the best results. While the LED panel does its work, I dream of my new and improved bottom jauntily making its way along a Majorcan beach.  After 15 minutes, the LED is wheeled away and Clare massages a divine-smelling shea butter moisturiser into the whole area, gently putting one hand on top of the other and tapping to create a vibrating sensation, which apparently aids lymphatic drainage. The process ends with a warning to keep my buttocks hydrated for the next four or five days - not a sentence you hear very often - using a rich body lotion. Finally, I sit up and, even without looking, I feel optimistic about the state of my derriere. Just knowing it’s had such state-of-the-art treatment makes me feel more confident. And frankly, so it should, because if there’s one thing that might give me pause for thought, it’s the price. At £180 for the Blueberry Smoothie plus a further £150 for the LED Light Therapy, I'm quite literally sitting on a fortune. But it's worth it. After just one session, I'm delighted, as is my husband, who comments on how smooth it feels. My bum feels firmer, the skin looks plump, its tone better, and my formerly dehydrated cheeks feel... dare I say it, soft as a baby's bottom. If you can't quite stretch to a £300-plus bacial, try DIY. Anything you'd use on your face can also be used on your bum. Start with a cleanser - Garnier Skin Naturals PureActive Deep Pore Wash (£3.49, superdrug.com) contains spotbusting salicyclic acid, as well as blueberry to reduce the appearance of marks. If you want to use a toner, Clarins' Gentle Exfoliator Brightening Toner (£25, clarins.co.uk) encourages cell renewal and prevents the build-up of dead skin cells. As for exfoliating, a body brush can scratch, so try a gentle fruit acid mask such as REN Glycolactic Radiance Renewal Mask (£30, renskincare.com). Leave for ten minutes and then remove with a warm, wet flannel. Moisturise with Olay Regenerist Night Renewal Elixir (£19.99, boots.com), which will also boost cell turnover.","Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Kelly Brook started trend for 'belfies'

"A Taliban commander in Afghanistan said Thursday that Americans can expect to see more kidnappings to ransom accused terrorists held by the United States. Terrorists under his command, the Taliban leader said, would work to take more Americans prisoner, since the Obama administration's deal to free Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has shown captive U.S. troops can be used as leverage. 'It's better to kidnap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people,' the commander told TIME magazine. 'It has encouraged our people. Now everybody will work hard to capture such an important bird.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not a care in the world: The president met with other G7 leaders in Brussels as a Taliban commander told TIME magazine that Obama's actions have made more kidnappings likely . Taliban fighters turned over Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl to American Special Forces on Saturday in exchange for five of their most prized leaders -- a bargain that the Afghani terrorists want to replicate . MOTIVATION: The five Afghans released from Guantanamo Bay are among the most senior members of the Taliban being held at the controversial camp, and include one who had direct ties to Osama bin Laden . Multinational troops, mostly Americans, have fought bloody battles against the Taliban for more than a dozen years; the U.S. will pull out most of its troops at year's end . According to TIME, the Taliban commander has provided reliable information in the past about Bergdahl's captivity. Both Republicans in and Democrats Congress have been quick to raise a red flag about what the Bergdahl trade could mean for future American conflicts overseas. Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed Obama on Tuesday for setting a 'dangerous precedent that puts all Americans at risk throughout the world.' 'Since World War II we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups,' Ruppersberger told The Baltimore Sun. 'What concerns me is the future. This puts all Americans at risk throughout the world, including our men and women on the front line ... for kidnapping.' 'What does this tell terrorists – that if you capture a U.S. soldier, you can trade that soldier for five terrorist prisoners?' Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Sunday on ABC’s 'This Week.' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another Republican, said Wednesday on CNN that Obama's choices have placed 'countless American men and women in uniform across the globe in greater danger. 'What the president has done here send a very clear message, and an incentive,' he said, 'that if you can get your hands on an American serviceman and woman, you can trade them for as many as five terrorists.' Rubio also warned that America's enemies all over the world have been watching and learning what the president is willing to do in the interest of recovering U.S. personnel overseas. Serious firepower: Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan have killed tens of thousands in attacks like this 2013 bombing of NATO supply trucks in in Jalalabad . 'Dangerous precedent': House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland warned that Obama's decision will put American servicemen and women in peril all over the world . 'What can they do, impeach him?' -- A frustrated Sen. John McCain is angry at Obama for freezing Congress out of the decision to free the five Taliban leaders, but seems resigned to playing the White House's game . 'This has sent a very powerful message to enemies of America across the globe,' Rubio claimed, 'from Iran to North Korea, to of course all these non-state actors in North Africa and the Middle East, that there’s great value in capturing Americans because if you do, you can get some of your own prisoners released.' Obama has faced withering criticism from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle over his handling of the Bergdahl affair, although he said Thursday in Brussels that he would make 'absolutely no apologies' for his decisions. But a national poll released Wednesday by Fox News shows that 84 per cent of Americans fear the Bergdahl prisoner swap will lead to more kidnappings abroad. Fifty-seven percent say they are 'very concerned.' Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, told reporters that although Obama broke a federal law by releasing Taliban terror leaders from Guantanamo in secret, Congress would likely have few options to push back. 'What can they do, impeach him?” McCain said. “It’s a breakdown of trust between the legislature and the president of the United States.”","A move toward capturing and keeping more US soldiers would be a shift for the Taliban, which is better-known for torturing and killing enemies .

"David Cameron yesterday tried to defend his decision to pose for a light-hearted ‘selfie’ in the middle of Nelson Mandela’s memorial service – by claiming he was only being polite. The Prime Minister attempted to laugh off the storm of criticism he provoked after larking around with Barack Obama and Denmark’s prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. He joked he was being ‘polite’ by agreeing to pose for a picture with Miss Thorning-Schmidt, the glamorous daughter-in-law of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Scroll down for video . The polite thing to do: David Cameron has defended posing for this selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service, saying it was proof the late leader was still 'bringing people together' All smiles: Mr Cameron posed for the snap with Barack Obama and Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt . Is that appropriate? Images of the three leaders taking the group photo prompted outrage online . Mr Cameron was challenged over the . photo at Prime Minister’s Questions by Liberal Democrat MP Martin . Horwood, who asked him: ‘Has the Prime Minister had the opportunity to . discuss international mobile phone usage with any other European heads . of government over the last day or so?’ To laughter from MPs, Mr . Cameron replied: ‘You could say, in a roundabout way. Perhaps in my . defence, you should always remember that the television cameras are . always on. ‘But in my . defence I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in . his life and in his death in bringing people together. 'So of course when . a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it . was only polite to say yes.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also came to Mr Cameron's defence today.

Mrs Thorning-Schmidt then points out something of interest in the order of service . They then share a joke during the poignant memorial to Nelson Mandela . Mr Cameron said he was just being polite in agreeing to the selfie, because he was asked by a member of the Kinnock family . The smartphone used in the selfie appears to be a BlackBerry Z10, the company's larger 4.2-inch touchscreen handset, which came out in March this year. Judging by the way Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is holding the camera, the snap would have been taken using the handset's front-facing 2MP camera - a high resolution for a front-facing lens, but not the best choice when taking a selfie with the leader of the free world. The back lens offers a far superior quality - an 8MP camera complete with auto-focus and auto-stabilisation functions that would avoid any blur when focussing in on one of the three recognisable faces. Miss Thorning-Schmidt could have also zoomed in on the faces with the 3x digital zoom to really highlight the cheesy grins being shown off at the time. After having taken the photo, she may have used the phone’s built-in camera app, or downloaded a selfie app such as TapCam Mirror, which would have let her add fun frames to the pictures. Miss Thorning-Schmidt would have also been able to share the image instantly using her BlackBerry Messenger contacts on the BlackBerry 10 operating system. Speaking on his radio phone-in on LBC . 97.3, Mr Clegg said: 'I know some people aren't happy about it. I think it was . a bit of friendly light-hearted joking around by the three of them. I . personally don't feel that people should be too censorious about it at . all.' He added: 'It was a . very celebratory atmosphere, it was a real celebration of the man's . life. There was dancing, there was singing, the crowd was in a very . jubilant mood. 'So it wasn't as out of keeping with the setting as I think some people have suggested.' A . photo of the incident at Johannesburg’s FNB Stadium quickly went viral . and featured on front pages on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday. The . New York Daily News described it as a ‘funeral faux-pas’, while a poll . for the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet found that two-thirds of Danes . felt posing for a jokey picture at a funeral was ‘inappropriate’. The . British political commentator Iain Martin said: ‘Why do Cameron and . Obama feel the need to behave like idiots?’ Michelle Obama also appeared . deeply unamused, staring stonily ahead while the three world leaders . joked around. In a comment on Twitter, the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said: . ‘One person in that image retains her dignity – Michelle.’ The . photograph provoked scathing criticism on social media, with many users . saying it was inappropriate for world leaders to joke around at an . event to mark the death of one of the great statesmen of the 20th . century. Twitter user James . Armitage wrote: ‘What selfish morons take a “selfie” at a memorial . service? Oh yeah that’s right, Barack Obama and David Cameron.’ In a . message directed at Mr Cameron, Sarah McDermott said: ‘You have . precisely zero class or decorum.’ Miss Thorning-Schmidt is married to Stephen Kinnock, the son of former UK Labour leader Neil (right) Downing . Street said the event was ‘a celebration of Mr Mandela’s life’ rather . than a funeral. AFP photographer Roberto Schmidt, who took the now . infamous photograph of the three leaders, acknowledged they were . ‘messing about like kids instead of behaving with the mournful gravitas . one might expect’. But he . defended their behaviour, saying he felt they were ‘simply acting like . human beings’, given the ‘carnival atmosphere’ inside the stadium. Tens of thousands of South Africans filed past Nelson Mandela’s . embalmed body as he lay in state in Pretoria yesterday. His body was . surrounded by flowers, and dressed in one of his trademark colourful . shirts. Huge crowds began . forming in the early hours of yesterday, with the line stretching 2km . through the streets. Many mourners waited for at least four hours in the . baking sun. Politicians, celebrities and Mr Mandela’s family had all paid their respects before the public were allowed in. The . group included Mr Mandela’s widow Graca Machel, his former wife Winnie, . South African president Jacob Zuma, U2 singer Bono, Zimbabwean dictator . Robert Mugabe and supermodel Naomi Campbell, who wiped away tears and . had to be comforted after viewing Mr Mandela’s body. Helle Thorning-Schmidt was previously . given a warm welcome by David Cameron (below) when she visited Number . 10 on her first official to London as Danish Prime Minister in November . 2011. As the . daughter-in-law of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, it was joked that a . Kinnock had finally managed to get a foot inside Downing Street. Her father-in-law famously lost to John Major's Conservatives in the 1992 general election after leading the polls for months. While he blamed sustained personal attacks on him by the press, critics said voters were turned off by Labour’s tax plans and his premature triumphalism at a Sheffield party rally. There had been fears that his son Stephen's wife could suffer from the same 'Kinnock curse' in the lead-up to polling day. And indeed she was forced to dismiss allegations that she had separated from her husband and that he was gay right before her general election. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt speaks during a meeting with US President Barack Obama at the White House in February last year . But it did not stop her sweeping to victory to become Denmark's first female Prime Minister in September 2011. During her time in office, she has also visited Barack Obama at the White House in February last year. Dubbed a 'Gucci diva' for her penchant for designer clothes, she led a 'Red bloc' of parties to oust centre-right Lars Loekke Rasmussen from office.

On Wednesday morning all flights in and out of JFK were operating on time. The storm, called Winter Storm Saturn by the Weather Channel, is slowly crawling east, where it is expected to dump several inches of wet snow, sleet, and ice on the nation’s capital. Flights out of Dulles have preemptively been canceled. As a jibe at Washington and the weather, Members of the Capital Weather Gang have named the blizzard ‘Snowquester’ after the crippling sequester effects that are being carried out. Washington authorities are urging drivers to remain off the roads until they’ve been properly salted and cleared. The storm will likely then clash with a nor’easter over New England, dropping as much as half a foot of snow on New York City, according to NBC New York. Winds could reach up to 55mph in the New York area, according to reports.

It could cause even more hurt for those in the region who were affected by last October’s Superstorm Sandy, as forecasters again predict strong winds to whip around coastal tides. A winter storm warning remains in effect for parts of 16 states from the Upper Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic, according to National Weather Service spokesman Chris Vaccaro. 'It will be a wet, heavy, gloppy snow consistent with wallpaper paste,' he said.

He added that more than 10 to 12 inches of snow was possible in some areas, and locally higher amounts in the Appalachians, West Virginia and eastern Maryland. 'We're expecting a sizeable accumulation for Washington DC, where there has not been a storm to produce more than 2 inches of snow since January 2011,' Vaccaro said. North Dakota on Tuesday was digging out from the storm, which caused blowing snow and drifts up to 3 feet (0.9 meter) high in blizzard conditions in the northwest oil region, a foot of snow near Minot and 15 inches near Grand Forks on Monday.

Hardware stores in and around Chicago did brisk business on Monday, selling salt and snow shovels at a time many usually turn their thoughts toward gardening and baseball. 'Everybody's got a little comment with every bag they're buying,' Mike McIntosh, who works at Dressel's Hardware in Oak Park, told the Associated Press. Workers had started to stock the shelves with tools and supplies associated with spring and summer, only to find the shovels and salt they thought they'd hold for another year were still in demand. 'Everybody's a bit surprised, but it's good for us, we've got a lot of this stuff to move,' he said.

A Minnesota Department of Transportation snowplow rumbles along Highway 169 north of Mankato today, cleaning up heavy snowfall . On Monday, the system moved across the Dakotas and Minnesota, dropping up to a foot of snow in some areas and freezing rain in others. Some schools closed and officials warned motorists to stay off the roads. As it moved eastward, emergency officials in a number of states issued similar warnings in the hopes that commuters will leave their cars in the garage and take public transportation to work. In Wisconsin, where as much as a foot of snow is in the forecast, emergency managers urged residents to put winter survival kits in their vehicles and check on road conditions.

State patrol officers were searching for a semi driver in the Red Cedar River near Menomonie in western Wisconsin early on Tuesday after the vehicle slid off the nearby snow-covered Interstate 94 into the frigid waterway. A wet snow pelted commuters as they slid along the slick streets of downtown Chicago through the soggy wintery mix early Tuesday. Snow was forecast for the morning and afternoon rush hours, Seeley said. The weather service also said that as much as 1.5 inches of snow could fall per hour, 'making snow removal difficult and travel extremely dangerous.' Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn urged motorists to avoid driving unless absolutely necessary, insisting that 'safety comes first.' The Illinois Department of Transportation planned to send a fleet of 360 trucks to plow roadways in northeastern Illinois early Tuesday, with a total of 600 throughout Northern Illinois. The storm is creating wet, heavy snow - known euphemistically as 'heart attack snow' - which could pose a risk when it comes time to shovel for the elderly, sedentary people or those who have heart problems.

"School bullies are using lines from TV comedy and movies to disguise their cruelty – by calling it banter. Teachers are cracking down on the trend, which pupils have picked up from programmes such as The Inbetweeners and Bad Education to mask ‘appalling behaviour’. English teacher Mike Stuchbery said that rather than ‘light-hearted joking’, it has become a ‘friendlier-sounding term for bullying’. One teacher has banned 'banter' from his classroom claiming some pupils use the word as a way to get out of trouble for bullying (file image) He has gained a groundswell of support from other teachers on Twitter after banning what he called ‘the B-word’ from his lessons. In a blog on the Times Educational Supplement website, he said: ‘If I catch someone stealing another student’s pencil case, calling a fellow pupil a derogatory name or thumping them, nine times out of ten I’ll be met with, “Siiiiir, it’s just bantaaaaaaaah”. 'It’s as if kids think that squawking these words in the tone and cadence of an East End fishmonger is some sort of magic get-out-of-jail-free card.’ Mr Stuchbery, who teaches at Lynn Grove High School in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, said the cruel, modern banter had taken over from what was traditionally good-humoured wordplay. He added: ‘Banter is everywhere. Chuck “banter” into Facebook and you’ll get hundreds of pages dedicated to ripping a person, group or organisation to shreds. Through repetition and the magic of social media, banter has become an acceptable, friendlier-sounding term for bullying. ‘It attempts to mask appalling behaviour under the guise of some ancient, noble, peculiarly British tradition.’ He said banter was also ‘loathsome because it shifts the blame to the victim’, adding: ‘It is classic victim-blaming. “It’s just banter” makes it seem as if the problem rests with the person who has suffered the insult.’ The Inbetweeners and Bad Education have spawned playground catchphrases such as ‘Archbishop of Banterbury’, ‘Bantom of the Opera’ and ‘Bantanamo Bay’. The Inbetweeners and Bad Education have spawned catchphrases such as 'Bantanamo Bay', 'Archbishop of Banterbury' and 'Bantom of the Opera' In his blog post, Mr Stuchbery vowed to tell his students that ‘banter’ can no longer be used to excuse bullying. He said: ‘I’m going to look my students in the eye and ask them point-blank, “Why did you do it? Why did you steal his pencil case? Why did you thump her? Give me a solid reason”.’ He was backed by Dan Roberts, deputy head of Devonport High School for Boys in Plymouth, who said: ‘People use banter as a means of excusing their behaviour. If someone asks you to stop and you carry on, that isn’t banter.’ Carrie Herbert, founder of the Red Balloon Learner Centre Group, which helps victims of bullying, added: ‘It is used to mask really unpleasant, hurtful behaviour, as if it is just a joke.’ The term was used to describe allegedly ‘sexist, racist and homophobic’ texts between former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay and head of recruitment Iain Moody. The League Managers Association provoked fury by calling the texts ‘friendly banter’. But former England player Stan Collymore said this response was ‘casual racism’.","English teacher banned what he calls 'The B word' from his classroom .

"Mothers taking their children back to school this week have driven a rise in the demand for anti-ageing treatments. The Harley Medical Group has seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of women wanting treatments such as Botox, Dermal Fillers and face peels - and they believe the pressure to look good at the school gates is to blame. A spokesman for the Group, that has clinics across the UK, said more 'yummy mummies' have been booking treatments throughout June, July and August, compared to the previous three months. Back to school: Many mothers are worried about the pressure to look good at the school gate . The Group saw a rise in enquiries for . laser treatment for pigmentation and brown spots, Dermal Fillers and . Line and Wrinkle treatments. 'We aren't talking about making women look like movie stars or supermodels. We are talking about refreshing them post holidays, capitalising on their post holiday glows and getting them looking good for the autumn months ahead,' said Dr Naylor of The Harley Medical Group. Anti-age me: The Harley Medical Group has seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of women wanting treatments such as Botox . Other treatments which are popular amongst mothers who visit the Group's 21 clinics include Laser Rejuvenation or Obagi Blue Peel to treat pigmentation caused by pregnancy or sun damage, Dermaroller Therapy to give the skin a healthy glow and Botox and Dermal Filler treatments to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. 'Having a ""Mummy Makeover"" is part of a trend toward women wanting to look refreshed again after the summer holiday break,' Dr Naylor added. 'We aren't creating beauty, we are simply restoring it.' The news comes after it was revealed in MailOnline last week that mothers spend an average of £87 to make sure they look their best at the school gates. They will have spent a collective £658m on clothes, jewellery and beauty treatments. One in five admitted in a survey that they feel under pressure to look glamorous on the school run. Forums on parenting websites are awash with mothers lamenting their dread at the school run resuming - not only for the challenge of getting children dressed and out the door on time but because they'll have to face other 'judgmental' mothers again. One such thread on netmums.com is entitled 'hate the school run - the mums are so mean!', where members share their horror stories of the cliques they're left out of and the animosity between working and stay-at-home mothers. All in the timing: One mother recommends arriving to miss the other mothers (posed by models) Meanwhile, on mumsnet.com, the situation has led to members offering their survival tips for the school run. One advises: 'Park round the corner from school, so it looks like you've walked' and 'time it so everyone's just going in and you don't have to mingle with the other parents'. Another warns: 'Never go out in your pyjamas, however late you are.'","Harley Medical Group has seen 18 per cent rise in demand for treatments .

"A pair of beguiling puppy-dog eyes is hard to resist. But next time you think about sharing food with your pet, fight the temptation. Some 85 per cent of pet owners feed their cat or dog human food, a study of 3,000 people by retailer Pets at Home found. A third of families admit giving their pets fruit. But raisins or grape contain toxins that can cause kidney failure in both cats and dogs. In some cases, small dogs have died after eating as few as four grapes . Nearly two-thirds gave them cheese, which both dogs and cats struggle to process, while a third fed pets fruit. But both dogs and cats can struggle to process dairy and the high salt content is also harmful. Grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure in pets, and in some cases small dogs have died after as few as four grapes. One in 20 owners said they feed their four-legged friend chocolate. The treat contains theobromine, a chemical like caffeine, which can kill pets even in small doses. The amount of the chemical in a bar . varies depends on the type, with greater amount in dark chocolate, which . has higher cocoa content. Ten per cent admitted giving pets tea or coffee – but the caffeine can lead to heart palpitations and fits due to the caffeine content. The most popular human food given as a snack is cheese, with nearly two-thirds of owners admitting to feeding it regularly to their pets. But both dogs and cats can struggle to process dairy and the high salt content is also harmful . Don't share your dinner with your dog . The survey of more than 3,000 pet owners was carried out by Pets at Home. Commenting . on the findings, Maeve Moorcroft, who is head of pets at the firm, . warned that owners could be killing their cat or dog with kindness. ‘We’ve . all been there, those big beautiful eyes can be hard to resist as we’re . eating and it’s so easy to just share a little of your food. However, . giving in to the longing and loving looks of our pets can actually . really harm them,’ she said. ‘Their digestive system is extremely different from ours and they often have reactions to the food we eat. It’s best to stick to pet food and a diet recommended by an expert.’ The research also found more than a quarter of people give their pets biscuits, which could lead to obesity and a shortened lifespan. Other foods given to pets included bread, roast dinners and crisps - all of which have no health benefit to pets and can cause digestive problems. Almost half of dog owners admitted to giving their own food to their pet every day, whereas 56 per cent of cat owners did so at least once a month. More than two-thirds of people gave shared their own meal with their pet, while 39 per cent of owners said their pets just help themselves to their meals.","A Pets at Home survey found 85 per cent of adults admit to feeding their cat or dog non-pet food on a daily basis .

"Ken Livingstone was accused of inciting a lynch mob mentality by urging protesters to go to homes of Whitehall officials . Ken Livingstone was accused of inciting a lynch mob mentality after he urged protesters to go to the homes of Whitehall officials sent into a controversial local authority and ‘make their lives intolerable’. The former London mayor made his call at a rally for supporters of the mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman. Mr Livingstone told the meeting in Mile End: ‘When these commissioners turn up, find out where they live and then have a peaceful demonstration outside their homes so their neighbours know these are the kind of people who overturn a democratically elected mayor. Make their lives intolerable.’ Local government minister Kris Hopkins told The Times: ‘I am appalled at his comments which run the risk of stirring up a lynch mob mentality in Tower Hamlets ... Stupid remarks like his will only worsen tensions.’ Auditors were asked to investigate council finances and found a ‘culture of cronyism’. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has sent three commissioners in to monitor the council for the next three years. Peter Golds, the Tory group leader on the council, said Mr Livingstone’s comments were ‘absolutely deplorable’ and ‘an incitement to intimidation which surely is not acceptable nowadays’. He added: ‘This investigation is about probity - the commissioners are there to ensure that the council will be run properly and, far from scaring them off, I wish for them to do their job properly in accordance with the law.’ Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said the remarks were ‘deeply disturbing’. ‘It’s almost inciting people to the level of intimidation,’ he warned. Labour – which distanced itself from the remarks - also faced calls to expel Mr Livingstone from the party. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Ken Livingstone’s views do not represent the views of the Labour Party and any act of intimidation would be entirely wrong. Tower Hamlets council must now work with the commissioners to ensure that what has gone wrong is put right.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has sent three commissioners in to monitor the Tower Hamlets Council for the next three years .","Former London mayor Ken Livingstone accused of inciting a lynch mob .

"Sexy: This is a typical image which would arouse a man - but a woman's desire is much more unpredictable . For decades, we have been led to believe that men are driven by a base need to 'spread their seed' and lust after many partners, while women desire monogamy and their sexual fulfillment comes from emotional intimacy. But an author who has researched female sexuality has said anyone who thinks women are inherently less promiscuous and sexually assertive than men is kidding themselves. Writer Daniel Bergner, from Brooklyn, New York, says the idea that women are 'biologically programmed' to be monogamous is a 'myth' that has been perpetuated for too long. He told MailOnline: 'I think that one of our conventional . assumptions - that women are biologically programmed by evolution to be . less promiscuous, less assertive, and less driven sexually - is a myth. 'There is very little evidence to support this theory. It gets in the . way of serious understanding.' Bergner, 53, has written a book on the subject, called 'What Do Women Want?: Adventures in the Science of Female Desire', which has been re-published this month by Canongate Books. He busts a number of myths through his research, based on scientific studies, which include theories that women want less sex than men, watch less porn and that their desire is sparked by emotional intimacy. In fact, Bergner said the research he has seen reveals women can be just as much of an 'animal' as a men when it comes to sex and that their desires are actually a lot more wild and unpredictable. At the start of the book and in a video on Canongate's website, he explains a test that Meredith Chivers carried out to determine what really turns women on. She wired up a plethysmograph to women's private parts and then showed them a series of images to monitor what made them become aroused. Bergner explains: 'The results reveal that women get turned on by all sorts of videos. Straight women get turned on by naked women exercising; lesbian women get turned on by gay male porn; the sight apes having sex is a turn on.' Writer Daniel Bergner has debunked myths surrounding female sexuality in his recently re-released book, right . But he added that many women were in denial about what they found to be a turn on. 'The plethysmograph was showing lots of arousal when women were telling Chivers they didn't feel turned on at all,' he said. ...'what turned men on was a lot more predictable and a lot more boring' Bergner told MailOnline that this repression of sexual desire has been drummed into women for 'eons'. Many other studies he looked into found women lied about, or were too embarrassed to admit, what really turned them on. Often women would only give honest answers to questions, such as whether they watched porn and how many sexual partners they have had, if they were told their input would be completely anonymous. 'Though we live in a culture that is, . in many ways, sexually unrestrained, we are still uneasy, even fearful, . about women's desire. This goes back eons,' Bergner explains. 'It is somehow overwhelming to . confront the realities of female sexuality.' He adds that perhaps female sexuality has been repressed in order to create some balance and order in society. 'Sexuality is a potentially anarchic force, and it is comforting to believe that - innately - half the population, the female half, is at least comparatively civilised when it comes to sex. It is soothing to believe that women are genetically scripted to serve as a stabilising force,' he said. Yet Bergner has discovered female sexuality is a lot more interesting than men's. Animal instincts: Women can be just as sexually aggressive and promiscuous as men, according to research revealed in the book . When men were shown the same images as the women during Chivers' test, 'what turned them on was a lot more predictable and a lot more boring,' he notes. Bergner said Chivers' study also contradicts the idea that all women want to to settle down with one man - and that they will have the best sex with that one man - because of the emotion intimacy their relationship brings. In fact, Chivers' study found the plethysmograph 'flat-lined' when the women were shown images of their love-term lovers. Seeing someone they knew was a 'lust-killer'. But images of a handsome stranger were a turn on. However, while Bergner has explored what women want in his book, he humbly admits he can't give a definitive answer. He said: 'I don't mean to imply (by the book's title) that I have a single answer - or that a single answer exists. That would be not only arrogant but terribly and monumentally foolish. We human beings are too complex for single answers, and our complexity is what makes a book like this a challenge and finally a pleasure to write. I hope that our complexity makes the book a pleasure to read as well.' In the spirit of further research, Canongate is running a survey to find out what women really want, which you can answer at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/YDJQHKF .

"Up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, a shocking survey reveals today. Tesco found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads, 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste. Much of the food is thrown away by customers – but large amounts are lost because they have been on display too long. Yet more produce has to be ditched before it even reaches shelves. Tesco found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads and two in five apples  are never eaten . The supermarket's survey tracking best-selling products also found one in five bananas go to waste . Two in five apples and one in five bananas are never eaten, according to the Tesco survey tracking its best-selling products. Signalling the end of ‘buy one get one free’ offers, the chain said it would no longer offer the deals on large bags of salad. It has promised to scrap confusing ‘display until’ dates on fresh fruit and vegetables and will give customers food storage tips. A study by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers earlier this year found up to half the food bought from supermarkets goes in the bin. Experts blame our throwaway culture for the colossal waste as well as misleading sell-by dates and offers that encourage customers to buy too much. Tesco has announced buy one get one free deals on large bags of salad will be scrapped to tackle food waste . Fifteen million tons of food are discarded each year, with households responsible for nearly half the waste, according to the Waste And Resources Action Programme (Wrap), a recycling quango. Almost four million tons are thrown away despite being perfectly edible. Tesco is now examining what happens to 25 more best-selling products, including free-range eggs, bacon, onions, and milk. In the first six months of this year, 28,500 tons of produce was binned at its stores and distribution centres. Richard Swannell of Wrap said: ‘We welcome Tesco’s approach to tackling food waste across their whole supply chain, and by identifying the hot spots they can tackle these areas effectively. ‘Food waste is a global issue and collaborative action is essential if  we are to successfully reduce food waste and reap the financial and environmental benefits of doing so.’ Other Tesco initiatives to limit waste include reducing the amount of baked goods on display and telling customers how to use stale bread. The firm said it was involved in trials with apple growers to reduce pests and disease in orchards by use of natural predators. It said however that 27 per cent of fruit wastage happens at home. Matt Simister, Tesco’s commercial director of group food, said: ‘We’ve all got a responsibility to tackle food waste and there is no quick-fix single solution. ‘Little changes can make a big difference, like storing fruit and vegetables in the right way. Ready meals and snacks have ballooned in size in the past two decades, campaigners said yesterday. The British Heart Foundation warned portions were out of control at a time when one in seven children and one in four adults is obese. The charity compared the sizes of 245 current products against equivalents from 1993. It found that shepherd’s pie ready meals have doubled in size, a portion of peanuts is 80 per cent larger and chicken curries are 53 per cent up. Packets of crisps are 50 per cent bigger than 20 years ago. The charity’s Simon Gillespie said: ‘When people are presented with more food, they eat more food.’ ‘Families are wasting an estimated £700 a year and we want to help them keep that money in their pockets, rather than throwing it in the bin. We’re playing our part too and making changes to our processes and in store. ‘Ending multi-buy promotions on large packs of bagged salads is one way we can help, but this is just the start and we’ll be reviewing what else we can do. We’re working with our suppliers to try to cut waste at all stages of the journey from farm to fork.’ Instead of multi-buy promotions on large salads, Tesco will allow consumers to select a second different item at a discount, such as a cucumber or pepper. ‘Bogof’ deals took off in the 1990s as the big supermarkets fought for market share. But in 2011 the Local Government Association called on retailers to stop them. Deals on products with a short shelf life, such as fruit and veg, were found to result in shoppers throwing away vast amounts of produce. In its report released in January, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said £1billion of food – from fresh fruit and veg to tinned and packet produce – is binned every year when still within its sell-by date. The report claimed up to three quarters of vegetables grown in Britain end up never being eaten.","Tesco found 48% of bakery goods and 24% of its grapes go to waste .

'I had stopped enjoying football,' Rooney said, recalling how a coach made him 'fall back in love with football.' Rooney succeeded Steven Gerrard as England captain in August. Far more was expected of Rooney after announcing himself on the international scene with four goals at Euro 2004 as an 18-year-old forward. But the 2006 World Cup campaign was remembered for his red card against Portugal, and he struggled four years later in South Africa. Although Rooney broke his World Cup goal drought at his third competition in June, England went out in the group stage with only one point - leaving the country without a title since its only success at the 1966 World Cup.","Wayne Rooney wins 100th cap against Slovenia at Wembley Stadium .

"A word of warning. When you leave the house today, don’t forget your coat – or you’ll be in for a rather chilly shock.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘Compared to the last few days it will really feel a fair few degrees colder. It is also going to be fairly windy in parts, particularly along the east coast, where we have a weather warning. Combined with the drop in temperatures it will suddenly seem a lot colder.’ He added: ‘The weather was pretty decent in the past few days, with many parts of the country enjoying temperatures above 20C (68F).

"Senior terrorist bankers Khalifa al-Subaiy and Abd al-Nuaymi (above) are allegedly living freely in Qatar . Two senior terrorist financiers are alleged to be living freely in Qatar - despite the Gulf state's claim that it does not support terrorist groups. Khalifa Muhammad Turki al-Subaiy and Abd al-Rahman bin Umayr al Nuaymi are reportedly living in the country's capital Doha, according to a U.S. official. In a transcript of a keynote speech in Washington, obtained by the Sunday Telegraph, David Cohen - the under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence - confirmed their residence. He said: 'There are U.S. and UN-designated terrorist financiers in Qatar that have not been acted against under Qatari law. 'There's Khalifa al-Subaiy and more recently Abd al-Nuaymi, who we designated last December, the UN designated in August.' He  accused Qatar and its near neighbour Kuwait of being 'permissive jurisdictions for terrorist financing' - but so far the fate of these bankers has not been known. However, the U.S. Treasury told the newspaper it could not disclose further classified information on the men. Al-Nuaymi, 60, was last month added to a list of suspects targeted with financial sanctions in the UK after the Government confirmed he is banned from doing business in Britain. It comes 10 months after the US authorities imposed sanctions on him, saying al-Nuaymi was a 'terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade'. The US Treasury said he was 'considered among the most prominent Qatar-based supporters of Iraqi Sunni extremists' and 'reportedly oversaw the transfer of over 2 million US dollars (£1.25 million) per month to al-Qaeda in Iraq for a period of time'. The pair are said to be living in Doha - the country's capital - where they have evaded prison and being added to the country's designated terrorist list. Qatar claims to condone jihadists operating out of the Gulf . Al-Nuayami has denied breaking the law and maintained he is being persecuted over criticism on US policy in the region. While al-Subaiy, 49, who was a former employee at Qatari Central Bank, was outed as a terrorist fundraiser in 2008 when he allegedly served a brief prison sentence. According to the official U.S report he has 'provided financial support to Al Qaeda' on behalf of the group's senior leaders, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It is thought he lived freely in the Gulf state for a number of years in the nineties while he was wanted for terrorist offences in America. The pair are accused of raising millions of dollars for Al Qaeda and other jihadist groups and sending it to them in Syria and Iraq. While it is alleged that both men have been kept out of jail thanks to their links with senior figures in Qatar. They have reportedly raised millions of dollars for terrorists including jihadists groups such as ISIS (pictured holding Al Qaeda flag) in Iraq and Syria . Qatar, which has huge investments in the UK, insists it does not support jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq operating out of the Gulf. The country introduced a designated terrorist list but so far not one person has been added to it. The revelation adds to growing demands on the British Government to put pressure on Qatar to crack down on terrorist paymasters after the murders of two British aid workers in Syria. David Haines and Alan Henning were killed by members of ISIS in September and October this year. Mr Cohen added that the U.S. would continue to work with its partners in the Gulf on the issue.","Khalifa al-Subaiy and Abd al-Nuaymi are allegedly living freely in Qatar .

"Far from being self-indulgent, wallowing in the past can leave you feeling happier about the future. Individuals who are nostalgic about their earlier lives also have a more positive outlook over the years to come, a study has found. The findings suggest that recalling happy memories improves your sense of wellbeing. Americans tend to focus on visual details, such as the colour of the decorations or the presents given . ‘Nostalgia raises self-esteem, which in turn heightens optimism,’ said study co-author Dr Tim Wildschut, from the University of Southampton. ‘Memories of the past can help to maintain current feelings of self-worth and can contribute to a brighter outlook on the future. 'Our findings imply that nostalgia, by promoting optimism, could help individuals cope with psychological adversity.’ In the study, published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, participants were asked to recall a nostalgic event and write about it. A second group were asked to record an ordinary event from their past. The team found that the number of optimistic words included in the nostalgic narratives were significantly higher than in the ordinary stories. In a second experiment, participants were played either a nostalgic or ‘neutral’ song. Those listening to the former reported higher levels of optimism than the other group. A previous study showed that pensioners who reminisced about their youth saw significant improvements in memory and six hour chats boosted recall by an average of 12 per cent . By promoting optimism, nostalgia could help individuals cope with psychological adversity. The study found that remembering times gone by can raise self esteem and heighten optimism. The number of optimistic words included in nostalgic narratives were significantly higher than in the ordinary stories. Researchers also found that people who listened to nostalgic songs reported higher levels of optimism. The group was also presented with two sets of lyrics – one of which had been identified as nostalgic by half of them. When asked to complete questions about how they felt, those who read the nostalgic lyrics reported a more positive outlook compared to those who read the control lyrics. Dr Tim Wildschut said: ‘Nostalgia is experienced by virtually everyone and we know that it can maintain psychological comfort. ‘We wanted to take that a step further and assess whether it can increase a feeling of optimism about the future.’ Previous studies have shown that reminiscing can be good for your health. Pensioners who got into groups and reminisced about their youth – including wartime experiences – saw significant improvements in memory. Just six half-hour chats boosted recall by an average of 12 per cent. Importantly, care home residents with dementia, including some in the late stages of the disease, also experienced improvements, with recall around 8 per cent better. It is thought that the simple act of swapping stories makes use of parts of the brain that might otherwise lie dormant, reinvigorating the person’s ability to remember. However, reminiscing one-on-one with a carer was not beneficial, meaning that the sense of togetherness fostered by teamwork is important to the process.","University of Southampton researchers found that looking back in time can help maintain feelings of self-worth and contribute to a brighter outlook .
The study also found that listening to nostalgic songs made people more optimistic than those who listened to a tune unattached to memories .

"It is one of the country’s most exclusive public schools, where parents pay fees of up to £36,000 a year so that their sons can follow in the footsteps of old boys such as P. G. Wodehouse, Ernest Shackleton and Nigel Farage. But pupils arriving at Dulwich College may be surprised to discover that a music teacher at this bastion of the Establishment is a card-carrying communist who hopes to teach her pupils the songs of North Korea’s brutal dictatorship. Lesley Larkum, Head of Strings at the school founded in 1619, has visited North Korea – where millions have starved to death while the ruling dynasty lives in luxury and threatens the West with nuclear weapons – and has spoken at communist rallies in London. Scroll down for video . Lesley Larkum, 49, is the Head of Strings at £39,000-a-year Dulwich College, but leads a double life as a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain and has visited North Korea . The 49-year-old is a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist) as well as being a cheerleader for Kim Jong Un’s reviled regime. Ms Larkum, who once led a women’s socialist choir called Velvet Fist, has even played the country’s national anthem, known as Aegukka or Patriotic Song, at events to celebrate the founding of North Korea by the ‘Great Leader’ Kim Il Sung in 1948. Speaking for the first time about her remarkable double life, Ms Larkum told The Mail on Sunday that she hoped to educate her pupils about North Korea’s music – most of which champions communism and sings the praises of the country’s ruthless leaders. Citizens risk imprisonment for tuning in to Western radio stations, and must instead listen to state- controlled numbers such as We Shall Hold Bayonets More Firmly, while marching songs on the country’s official website include Raise Your Weapons To Wave. Ms Larkum said: ‘I have performed and taught Argentinian music here. I would love to expand that repertoire to include North Korean music. Some of it is political, some of it isn’t. I think my pupils would love it. Ms Larkum said she wants to teach pupils at the south London college (pictured) songs from North Korea, almost all of which are anthems praising the country or its leader, Kim Jong Un . ‘I don’t think the school would mind at all. I haven’t made a secret of my views – Dulwich College is all about broadening young minds and teaching them about other cultures, whatever their views. 'I don’t think my views are relevant to my day job. I’m Head of Strings, for goodness sake. But North Korean politics are fascinating.’ She says she has ‘sympathy’ with North Korea and disagrees with the West’s stance on the country, which was named as part of the Axis of Evil by former U S President George W. Bush. Britain has an arms embargo against North Korea, as well as a ban on exporting luxury goods there, asset freezes on its financial institutions and travel bars on the regime’s key figures. Ms Larkum said: ‘I certainly believe the West should leave North Korea alone. What have they ever done to us? I don’t think we should ever interfere with any other country.’ Ms Larkum, who lives in a £400,000 flat near the school in South-East London, is no typical communist. Yesterday, as half-term began in the private sector, she flew out for a week’s holiday to enjoy a different sort of party – on the island of Ibiza. Dulwich College did not respond to requests for comment.","Lesley Larkum, music teacher at Dulwich College, also ardent communist .

"Professor Richard Dawkins has become embroiled in a Twitter row over his comments about Muslims . Richard Dawkins has  provoked anger after he claimed Muslims have contributed almost nothing to science since the Middle Ages. The outspoken biologist and atheist . wrote on Twitter that a single college at Cambridge  University had won . more Nobel Prizes than all the world’s Muslims. His comments sparked fury on the social network where he was accused of disguising his ‘bigotry’ as atheism. But last night the 72-year-old best-selling author of The God Delusion refused to apologise for his remarks. The row broke out after he commented: . ‘All the world’s Muslims have fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, . Cambridge.’ He responded to the barrage of ensuing criticism by telling . his 782,000 followers: ‘A statement of simple fact is not bigotry. And . science by Muslims was great in the distant past.’ In response to one Twitter user who . pointed out that Muslims had been responsible for algebra and ‘alchemy’, . Professor Dawkins replied: ‘Indeed, where would we be without alchemy? Dark Age achievements undoubted. But since then?’ He sought to justify his controversial . observation by adding: ‘Why mention Muslim Nobels rather than any other . group? Because we so often hear boasts about (a) their total numbers . and (b) their science.’ One angry Twitter user hit out  at the . remarks telling the author: ‘You absolutely disgust me.’ Writer Caitlin . Moran added: ‘Think it’s time someone turned Richard Dawkins off and . then on again’. Channel 4 News economics editor Faisal Islam questioned . Dawkins’ ‘spurious use of data’. Writer Owen Jones told the professor: ‘How dare you dress your bigotry up as atheism. You are now beyond an embarrassment.’ But some users noted that the . criticism of Professor Dawkins was in marked contrast to that when he . has made comments about Christianity . Richard Dawkins offended people on Twitter yesterday when he posted this comment . His comments sparked anger among high-profile Twitter users including economics editor at Channel 4 News, Faisal Islam . Writer Caitlin Moran joined the debate and asked someone to turn Dawkins off and on again . One wrote: ‘Dawkins spent the best part of 10 years attacking Christianity and not raising an eyebrow. He now turns that same eye on Islam and uproar.’ Trinity College has 32 Nobel laureates, whereas only ten Prize winners are thought to have been Muslims. Awarded annually since 1901, the Nobel Prize recognises achievements in Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, Peace and Literature, as well as a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. Winners from Trinity include Bertrand Russell who won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his 1946 work, ‘A History of Western Philosophy’. Twelve of the college’s Nobel laureates were recognised for work in physics, eight in chemistry and seven in medicine. Of the ten Muslim Nobel Laureates, only two are scientists: Pakistani Abdus Salam, who won the Prize for Physics, and the Egyptian-American Ahmed Zewail, who won in Chemistry.Six were awarded the Peace Prize, including Yasser Arafat. Half of the ten Muslim laureates were awarded the prize in the 21st century, during which Trinity College has only had one prize winner. An Emeritus Fellow at New College, . Oxford, Professor Dawkins appeared to try and appease his critics by . saying that Trinity College also has more Nobel Prizes than any country . in the world except America, Britain, Germany and France. The Cambridge college has 32 Nobel laureates, whereas only 10 laureates are thought to have been Muslim. Mr Islam said that Professor Dawkins’ claims were wrong, arguing that he should not have included prizes won . for economics. He wrote that over the last two decades, ‘it’s 8-4 . against Trinity. I say this as a Muslim alumnus of Trinity College, . Cambridge.’ He added that if Professor Dawkins . ‘had any clue what he was talking about, he’d know to trip out the . Economic Nobels, which aren’t quite real.’ Professor Dawkins found himself in the . spotlight earlier this year when he took on the former Archbishop of . Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams in a debate at Cambridge. The author branded  religion a . ‘betrayal of the intellect’ and ‘a betrayal of all that’s best about . what makes us human’. He also said: ‘If I were a cultural Muslim, I . would have something to say about that faith’s appalling attitude to . women and various other moral points.’","The author of The God Delusion tweeted that the world's Muslims had won fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge .

"An Illinois attorney who pleaded guilty to prostitution in 2012 has agreed to have her law license suspended for three years after facing a disciplinary hearing. Reema Bajaj, 27, faced an Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC) board accused of lying to the board about her work as a prostitute. The ARDC complaint filed in June accuses Bajaj, a Northern Illinois University graduate, of criminal conduct and making false statements in both a disciplinary matter and on her bar application by not disclosing her 'employment' as a call girl. Suspension: Reema Bajaj, who had sex in exchange for office supplies for her legal practice, has agreed to have her law license suspended for three years . The complaint against Bajaj was threefold: Criminal conduct for her prostitution conviction; making false statements in connection with at an earlier disciplinary hearing into the matter; and making false statements on a bar application. The ARDC accuses Bajaj of 'committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects,' as well as 'conduct which tends to defeat the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute.' The complaint details the charges filed against Bajaj in DeKalb County in 2011 in her prostitution case. Between 2005 and 2008, Bajaj posted online advertisements as 'Nikita' on sites such as Adult Friend Finder, according the complaint. Potential: Bajaj had just been admitted to the bar and opened her own law firm when allegations of prostitution emerged . Closed: Bajaj dissolved her law firm last month and is now suing her former lawyer for damages . Bajaj, who was admitted to the bar in 2010, accepted money from two men in exchange for sex, according to the complaint. The first man paid her $100 per meeting for about 25 encounters over three years. Barred: Bajaj won't be allowed to practice law for three years . The second man paid her between $25 and $70 in cash or an equivalent amount in DVDs or gift cards for sex on at least 15 occasions between 2007 and 2011. According to the complaint, in 2011 she received $70 worth of office supplies from the second man for her recently-established legal practice in Sycamore in exchange for a sex act. The ARDC complaint states that when Reema Bajaj testified before the Commission in September of last year, she denied ever receiving money for sex under oath - despite having pleaded guilty in the criminal case earlier that year. The Commission's other complaints allege that Bajaj failed to disclose her pseudonym, Nikita, and that she had worked as a prostitute on her application for a law license. Last month, Bajaj dissolved her law practice and filed a suit against her former defense lawyer, Timothy Johnson, and DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell for allegedly showing other attorneys nude photographs of her they had access to through the criminal investigation. Out of practice: It is unclear what Reema Bajaj will pursue during the years she is likely to be banned from working as an attorney . Bajaj is seeking more than $50,000 in damages for 'extreme anger, grief, embarrassment, and humiliation,' according the the Daily Chronicle. She also claims an unnamed prosecutor shared newspaper articles about her arrest with other attorneys and that prospective clients, jurors and judges have seen the embarrassing pictures. Bajaj's agreement to have her law license suspended for three years will go before another disciplinary board panel later this month, according to the Chicago Tribune. If the panel approves the agreement, the Illinois Supreme Court will review the case and make the final decision over Reema Bajaj's future.","Reema Bajaj, 27, has agreed to have her law license suspended after facing a disciplinary board .

"A cathedral organist who has been embroiled in a string of sex scandals has been jailed for sexually abusing a teenage pupil. Ian Ball, 46, has had a series of inappropriate relationships and once had a pint poured over his head by a married lover’s husband. But the Oxford graduate has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years for molesting a 14-year-old boy who visited his cathedral for organ lessons. Jailed: Ian Ball, 46, has had a series of inappropriate relationships and once had a pint poured over his head by a married lover's husband . He was also found to have dozens of illegal images of children on his home computer. Ball was forced to resign from his position at Gloucester Cathedral in 2002 after he admitted acting “inappropriately” with a 17-year-old sixth former. He had previously had an affair with choir member Ruth Harper, which was made public after her ex-husband threw a pint over Ball’s head in a local pub. Cathedral organist and choirmaster Ian Ball who has been jailed for sexually abusing a boy . The father-of-two was also investigated in connection with allegations involving a relationship with a male minor; however police took no further action. But Ball has now been put behind bars for two-and-a-half years after it was revealed he sexually assaulted a teenage boy at a different cathedral. Ball, who now lives in Worcester, pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault on a 14 year-old boy. He also pleaded guilty to seven charges of downloading indecent photographs of children after 84 pictures of girls aged between ten and 13 were found on his computer. Kenneth Ball, prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court how the victim, who is now an adult, had been attending the cathedral for organ lessons. He said: “He had lots and lots of attention from the defendant who showered him with art books and poetry books and showed him love letters between him and his ex-girlfriend. “The youngster was incredibly stressed. He was still very keen to learn the organ and he didn’t not want to have lessons. “He continued lessons with the defendant on the organ at the cathedral.” Ian Ball was forced to resign from his position at Gloucester Cathedral in 2002 after he admitted acting 'inappropriately' with a 17-year-old sixth former . Ball, who is originally from Lancashire, was assistant organist at Bristol Cathedral from 1991-1994 before moving to be organist of Clifton Cathedral from 1994 until 1998. He then became acting director of music at Gloucester Cathedral from 1998 and was promoted to acting director in September 2001. The following year he was forced to resign from the position in 2002 after he was criticised for having an “inappropriate” friendship with a sixth form choir girl. He then began the role of director of music for the Gloucester parishes of St Mary de Lode and St Mark, much to the anger of many local parishioners. Ball has faced a vast amount of criticism in the past for a number of inappropriate relationships. Whilst at Gloucester Cathedral he struck up a close relationship with two teenage girls in the choir. He also had an affair with an older woman from the church, which resulted in the breakdown of his marriage to wife Elizabeth. Though Ball faced no legal action for his behaviour, as the women were over the age of 16, he was criticised by churchgoers and asked to leave this cathedral. Now, more than ten years on, an underage victim of the organist was persuaded to tell police what had happened. Ball admitted he had acted inappropriately but claimed it was a one off because he was going through a tough time at home. Bristol Cathedral. Ball, who is originally from Lancashire, was assistant organist here from 1991 until 1994 before moving to be organist of Clifton Cathedral . Robert Duval, defending at Bristol Crown Court, said the incident happened when Ball had become depressed after being overworked and exhausted. He said: “He was lonely. He was not himself. He fully accepts that he found intimacy with a child that he should not have done. “He acted in this profoundly reprehensible and selfish way. It is a unique stain on his otherwise unblemished character. “A short sentence will be an enormous punishment for him.” Sentencing Judge Michael Roach said: “What you did not only blighted the remainder of his adolescent years but it led to a blight of his adult years as well.” He handed him a two-and-a-half year sentence yesterday, a five year Sexual Offences Prevention Order and ordered him to register as a sex offender indefinitely.","Ian Ball, 46, had a pint tipped over head by ex-husband of one of his lovers .

"Murdered: Francois Murad, a Catholic priest died in Syria last week . A Syrian Catholic priest has been beheaded by jihadist fighters in Syria, it has been claimed. The death of Franciscan Father Francois Murad has been confirmed by the official Vatican news agency. The gruesome killing has raised further concerns about the West arming rebels in the fight against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Grainy footage purported to show the 49-year-old’s death has been posted on the internet. Father Francois, was killed on 23 June in Gassanieh, in northern Syria. He had been staying in the convent of the Custody of the Holy Land. Catholic.org linked to the video and reported: . 'Syrian terrorists have beheaded a Catholic priest who they accused of . collaborating with the Assad regime. Those accusations have not yet been . verified.' Fides News Agency said: 'According to local sources, the . monastery where Fr. Murad was staying was attacked by militants linked . to the jihadi group Jabhat al-Nusra.' Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Front for the Protection of the Syrian People, is an Al Qaeda associated group, described as 'the most aggressive and successful arm of the rebel force.' In the video, filmed on a camera phone and posted on LiveLeak, three men - including a man reported to be Father Francois - are seen sitting on the dusty ground as a crowd around them cheers.

It has not been confirmed Father Francois was beheaded. Assad's forces pounded Sunni Muslim . rebels in the city of Homs with artillery and from the air on Sunday, . the second day of their offensive in central Syria, activists said. They said rebels defending the old centre of Homs and five adjacent Sunni districts had largely repelled a ground attack on Saturday by Assad's forces, backed by guerrillas from the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah, but reported clashes and deaths within the city on Sunday. Mohammad Mroueh, a member of the opposition 'Homs Crisis Cell' said at least 25 loyalist troops including four Hezbollah fighters had been killed in Homs in the previous 24 hours. Such reports are difficult to verify in Syria, where independent media cannot usually report freely. The opposition Syrian National Coalition said in a statement that it feared that Assad's forces will use chemical weapons on the city 'after the regime's campaign on Homs failed to achieve any important results.' The offensive follows steady military gains by Assad's forces, backed by Hezbollah, in villages in Homs province and towns close to the Lebanese border. Opposition sources and diplomats said the loyalist advance had tightened the siege of Homs and secured a main road link to Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon and to army bases in Alawite-held territory near the Syrian coast, the main entry point for Russian arms that have given Assad an advantage in firepower. Destruction: Homes are seen destroyed by Syrian government airstrikes and shelling in Aleppo, Syria . Devastating: More than two years of fighting in Syria's civil war has damaged some 9,000 state buildings and run up $15 billion in losses to the public sector, a government minister said Sunday . Crater: A man sits next to the damaged area outside Khalid bin al Walid Mosque in Homs . At least 100,000 people have been . killed since the Syrian revolt against four decades of rule by Assad and . his late father erupted in March 2011, making the uprising the . bloodiest of the Arab Spring revolutions against entrenched autocrats. The . Syrian conflict is increasingly pitting Assad's Alawite minority, . backed by Shi'ite Iran and its Hezbollah ally, against mainly Sunni . rebel brigades supported by the Gulf states, Egypt, Turkey and others. Sunni Jihadists, including al Qaeda fighters from Iraq, have also entered the fray. The . loyalist advances have alarmed international supporters of the rebels, . leading the United States to announce it will step up military support. Saudi Arabia has accelerated deliveries of sophisticated weaponry, Gulf . sources say. Assistance: Rescuers and neighboors removes chunks of rubble from a partially collapsed building after a rocketed slammed into the side of a residential block located next to a mosque in the northern city of Aleppo . Injured: A wounded Syrian man walks past rescuers and others gathered at the scene after a rocket slammed into the side of a residential building . Opposition activists said a woman and child had been killed in a strike by government aircraft on the old city of Homs, home to hundreds of civilians. Video footage taken by the activists showed the bodies being carried in blankets and a man holding a wounded child with a gash in his head. Rebel fighters fought loyalist forces backed by tanks in the old covered market, which links the old city with Khalidiya, a district inhabited by members of tribes who have been at the forefront of the armed insurgency. 'After failing to make any . significant advances yesterday, the regime is trying to sever the link . between Khalidiya and the old city,' Abu Bilal, one of the activists, . said from Homs. 'We are . seeing a sectarian attack on Homs par excellence, The army has taken a . back role. Most of the attacking forces are comprised of Alawite militia . being directed by Hezbollah.' Checks: A member of the Free Syrian Army mans a checkpoint during a siege on the Kurdish city of Afrin, which is under the control of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), in the Aleppo countryside . Tension: A view of the Shi'ite villages of Nubbul and Al-Zahraa that the Free Syrian Army plans to siege in the Aleppo countryside . Alawites belong to an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam and have controlled Syria since the 1960s, when members of the sect took over the army and security apparatus in the mainly Sunni country. Activists said loyalist forces have been issued with masks as protection against chemical weapons. They said sarin gas had been used in the past few months to dislodge rebel fighters from Deir Baalba, a town northeast of Homs. 'Old Homs and the adjacent areas have been under siege for more than a year and unless the fighters receive new weapons quickly the regime's new tactics of levelling neighbourhood after neighbourhoods will eventually force the rebels out,' said an opposition campaigner who did not want to be named. 'Chemical weapons will accelerate the regime's takeover of Homs,' he added. Syrian authorities have denied using chemical weapons in the conflict and accused the opposition of using them. The United States has concluded that Assad's forces have used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year. Advances: A Free Syrian Army member stands on a lookout point beside the Shi'ite villages of Nubbul and Al-Zahraa . Support: Syrian refugees hold a large Syrian opposition flag, with a length of 300 metres, to show their support for the Syrian opposition against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at Al Zaatri refugee camp in the Jordanian city of Mafraq . Saudi Arabia, a foe of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has urged the European Union to arm Syrian rebels without delay, following similar action by the United States. The European Union lifted restrictions on arming the rebels in May when it failed to renew a weapons arms embargo before it expired on June 1. But Britain and France, which had advocated lifting the ban, said they would not send weapons before Aug. 1. 'The Syrian opposition is not only fighting an illegitimate regime, but also fighting a foreign occupier,' Saudi state news agency SPA quoted Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal as telling an EU-GCC ministerial meeting in Bahrain on Sunday. He was referring to Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah forces that have joined in recent fighting alongside Assad's military, notably spearheading the capture of the border town of Qusair. 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... refers to the EU resolution to lift the ban on arming the Syrian opposition, and calls for the implementation of this resolution in light of the grievous realities on the ground in Syria,' Prince Saud said. Gains by Assad's forces and Hezbollah's involvement have prompted the United States to promise the rebels military aid beyond the non-lethal equipment it had previously supplied. The New York Times reported in June that the supplies, to be coordinated by the CIA, might include anti-tank weapons.","Father Francois Murad's death was confirmed by Vatican news agency .

"One-time Queens Park Rangers target Alexandre Pato shot back to the top of headlines on Wednesday night after scoring a composed hat-trick against Capivariano for Sao Paulo. Pato was once widely tipped as one of the game's rising stars and had initially impressed during a five-year spell at Italian giants AC Milan. However, a combination of injuries and a dip in form led him to an exit from the San Siro in a cut-price £12.8 million move to Corinthians in 2013. Alexandre Pato was once tipped as one of world football's rising stars during his early career at AC Milan . The Forgotten forward runs clean through on goal to seal his hat-trick against Capivariano . Pato scored 17 goals in 62 games for Corinthians before being loaned to current club Sao Paulo where he has started to show signs that he might be back to his best. Nevertheless, Corinthians do not consider Pato to be in their first-team plans and recently offered him to Premier League side QPR, although no deal materialised before the end of the January transfer window, a decision that the relegation threatened club could come to regret. But if Pato can carry on at Sao Paolo with performances like the one against Capivariano, then there should be no shortage of suitors for the 25-year-old Brazilian when the window reopens in the summer. Pato (right) is still only 25-years-old and has scored 12 goals in 30 appearances for Sao Paulo this season .

"Border agents are on alert after an unusual amount of rain created a 60ft hole in a fence that divides the U.S. and Mexico. The storms began on Friday in Sonora, Mexico, and didn't stop until Sunday morning, causing debris from the Mexican side of the border to pile up against the border fence. The fence, which is just west of the Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry near Interstate 19, was between 18ft and 26ft high and extended at least 7ft underground. An unusual amount of rain created a 60ft hole in a fence that divides . the U.S. and Mexico . Border agents were alerted not long after the wall fell down. U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Nicole Ballistrea said: 'Resources have been deployed to the area until the fence is repaired. 'Our technology assets such as cameras are also able to assist us.'Contractors have assessed the damaged section of the fence and are developing a plan to initiate repairs.' The fence was built in 2011 but it is constantly monitored by agents because smugglers attempt to cross it illegally by trying to knock parts of it down. John Hayes, floodplain coordinator for the Santa Cruz County Flood Control District, said: 'It had a lot of water behind it and it just pushed the fence straight down. Debris from the Mexican side of the border piled up against the fence during the storms over the weekend . 'If you're fencing is tight enough to catch debris, it basically becomes a dam. It's not meant to withstand those loads of water.' Hayes said the fence appears to have floodgates but they did not open. The debris and water that made its way through the fence also crept into a Nogales, Arizona, neighborhood, flooding houses and business with up to three feet of water. It is not yet known how much the damage caused will cost to repair.","Storms began on Friday in Sonora, Mexico, and didn't stop until Sunday .

"The children of cleaners and catering assistants in some Asian countries are better at maths than those of doctors and lawyers in Britain, research reveals. Youngsters from deprived backgrounds in Shanghai were the equivalent of a year of school ahead of UK children from wealthy homes with well-educated parents. The advantage in Singapore was around three months. Gap: When the most deprived children from the UK and Shanghai were compared, British children were nearly three years behind (file picture) When the most deprived children from the UK and Shanghai were compared, British children were nearly three years behind. The gap rose to five years if deprived British pupils were compared with children from well-off homes in China’s largest city. The gulf in academic attainment between the two regions was revealed in data within a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released in December. It had already shown that British teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. The new analysis, based on maths tests taken by more than half a million 15-year-olds, suggests some countries are better at helping their children succeed at school, regardless of background. The report concludes: ‘In the United States and the United Kingdom, where professionals are among the highest-paid in the world, students whose parents work as professionals do not perform as well in mathematics as children of professionals in other countries. Report: The new analysis, based on maths tests taken by more than half a million 15-year-olds, suggests some countries are better at helping their children succeed at school (file picture) ‘Nor do they perform as well as the children in Shanghai, China, and Singapore, whose parents work in manual occupations.’ The success of pupils in emerging economies has led other nations to look at their education systems. Education minister Liz Truss is travelling to China next week to find out how maths is taught there. Education Secretary Michael Gove has already announced changes to improve maths in England, including a focus on core knowledge, more mental arithmetic and tougher exams. Anyone aged 16 to 18 who does not have a GCSE in the subject with a C grade or higher is also expected to continue studying it under  new rules. Miss Truss said: ‘Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths – their children are streets ahead. Improvements: Education Secretary Michael Gove has already announced changes to improve maths in England, including a focus on core knowledge, more mental arithmetic and tougher exams . ‘Shanghai and Singapore have teaching practices and a positive philosophy that make the difference. They have a belief that diligence redeems lack of ability. ‘Our new curriculum has borrowed from theirs because we know it works – early learning of key arithmetic and a focus on times tables and long division, for example. ‘The reality is that, unless we change our philosophy and get better at maths, we will suffer  economic decline.’ Research has shown children with high maths scores at age 10 earn seven per cent more when they are 30 than those who struggle with the subject, a difference of tens of thousands of pounds over their  working life. Andreas Schleicher, deputy director for education and skills at the OECD, said: ‘If school systems want all of their students to succeed, they should give the children of factory workers and cleaners the same education opportunities that the children of doctors and lawyers enjoy.’","Chinese children three years ahead of Britons with well-educated parents .

"A group of businessmen and retired mandarins are waging a behind-the-scenes propaganda war aimed at derailing moves to take Britain out of the EU. Appalled by the prospect of a vote to withdraw, they have formed ‘Business For New Europe’ to fight a public and private campaign to keep Britain in the union. They are raising a multi-million-pound war chest to secure support from international leaders in the run-up to the vote which they now suspect is inevitable. Campaign: A group of businessmen and retired mandarins are waging a propaganda war aimed at derailing moves to take Britain out of the EU. Roland Rudd, right, pictured with Lord Peter Mandelson, is the driving force behind the group . They are lobbying world leaders to go public with warnings that Britain will become isolated economically and politically if it votes to quit the EU. They hope if enough of them speak out British voters will take fright and vote to stay shackled to Brussels. David Cameron has promised a renegotiation of UK membership of the EU if the Conservatives  win the 2015 general election, followed by a referendum two years later. It will be the first national vote on Britain’s membership of the EU since 1975, with the latest YouGov poll suggesting the number who want to leave comfortably outnumber those who want to stay by 43 per cent to 35 per cent. Roland Rudd, an arch networker and lobbyist who runs the successful City PR company Finsbury, is the driving force behind the group. He is a confidante of Tony Blair, Lord Mandelson, the former Cabinet minister and EU Commissioner, and David Miliband, Labour’s last foreign secretary. Pledge: David Cameron has promised a renegotiation of UK membership of the EU if the Conservatives  win the 2015 general election, followed by a referendum two years later . They are intensifying their PR drive after heavyweight Tory eurosceptics including Education Secretary Michael Gove indicated they would vote to quit the EU. In the past week the diplomatic offensive has intensified. The Australian foreign minister Bob Carr, in a letter to the Foreign Secretary William Hague, said: ‘Australia recognises the UK’s strength and resilience and looks forward to seeing it continue as a leading economy and effective power. Strong active membership of the EU contributes to this.’ Two days earlier a leaked memo from the Japanese government submitted to Mr Hague warned that up to 1,300 Japanese firms with British outlets could review their position if Britain does not continue to play a ‘major role’ in the EU. Business For New Europe does not claim to have prompted the Australian or Japanese comments, but its supporters are talking openly of similar interventions in the coming weeks from Canada and South Korea, fuelling the suspicion that it is co-ordinating international and domestic opposition to the Cameron plan. One of Prince William’s key advisers also warned this week that leaving the EU would make Britain ‘an irrelevance’ on the world stage. Sir David Manning, a former British ambassador to Washington who was complicit in the secret deal between Tony Blair and George Bush to go to war in Iraq, is not a member of the group, but is known to be sympathetic with its aims. And when the Italian prime minister Enrico Letta visited Britain last week he held a dinner for a small select group of businessmen at the embassy in London. Mr Rudd and Lord Mandelson were both present. Mr Letta too spoke out against British withdrawal. As part of the ongoing behind-the-scenes efforts Mr Rudd led delegations to meet the Spanish foreign and economic minsters in Barcelona and their counterparts in the Polish government in Warsaw at the end of last year. Similar trips are scheduled for Berlin and the Netherlands after Germany’s elections in September. The pro-EU lobbyists’ offensive coincides with a raft of economic figures which show that Britain could actually prosper outside the failing eurozone. Only this week statistics showed that Britain attracted more investment from overseas than any other EU country last year. The number of foreign investment projects rose by 11 per cent to 1,559, according to a report by UK Trade and Investment. Want out: A poll suggests the number of Britons who want to leave the EU comfortably outnumber those who want to stay by 43 per cent to 35 per cent . The funding created or safeguarded 170,000 British jobs, a further sign that Britain is extending its lead over rivals in the eurozone. A report by the International Monetary Fund showed that every land mass in the world is now expanding economically except Europe. The Commonwealth is growing at 7.2 per cent, while the eurozone is shrinking. A report by the Office for National Statistics showed that exports to the EU are now at their lowest proportion of Britain’s overall trade since the present measure was introduced in 1988. Despite the plethora of positive figures there has been evidence in the past two months that the covert campaign by Mr Rudd is paying rich dividends. In May President Obama, speaking at a Downing Street press conference, infuriated Tory MPs by saying: ‘I think that the UK’s participation in the EU is an expression of its influence and its role in the world.’ It is no coincidence that one of the most senior backers of the Rudd group is Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a director of Shell, who is an ardent europhile. He was British ambassador to the EU from 2000 to 2003 and ambassador to the US from 2007 until last year. He is a hugely respected figure in the White House. ‘The Obama Exocets were the first big coup for Rudd and his group,’ said one senior government source. Mr Blair and Lord Mandelson, while not members of Business  For New Europe, travel extensively overseas using their contacts in  foreign governments to urge them to speak against Britain pulling out. Former diplomats who back the group include Lord Jay, who was senior mandarin at the Foreign Office from 2002 until July 2006, Sir Stephen Wall, who was senior EU adviser to Mr Blair in Downing Street, and Sir Andrew Cahn, the Chef de Cabinet to former Labour leader Lord Kinnock when he was an EU commissioner. Daniel Hannan, the leading eurosceptic Tory MEP, said: ‘Why should we take their predictions seriously? 'Mr Rudd and his supporters all warned us we would be doomed if we did not join the euro. I think they were wrong then and they are now.’ Mr Rudd was unavailable for comment.","They are appalled by the prospect of a vote to .

"A senior teacher who had  sex with a 16-year-old pupil has been jailed. Janette Kilner, 33, pursued a relationship with the pupil, who is described as ‘bright’, after he gave her a bracelet as a Christmas gift. In her position as her school’s deputy head of drama, she arranged for him to have extra tuition after classes and at weekends before exchanging explicit text messages and emails. Crime: Kilner met the schoolboy at St Thomas the Apostle College, pictured, where she taught, and then took him home for sex . Kilner then cavorted with the boy in  her car and took him back to her home for unprotected sex. During . this period she was also using the internet to meet women and men for . night-time trysts in their vehicles in car parks – a practice known as . dogging. Snaresbrook . Crown Court in East London heard that at the time of the boy giving her . the gift Kilner was going  through a difficult time. She had broken up . with a boyfriend and her father was terminally ill. Sentencing: Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the teacher had also been dogging at a public car park . She started spending more time with the pupil, who was studying for his GCSEs, after being flattered by his attention. Prosecutor Gary Pons said Kilner taught the boy during his final year at St Thomas the Apostle College in Nunhead, South London. ‘It . was during 2013 that their relationship developed beyond a . teacher-pupil relationship and it did so gradually,’ he said. ‘First, it . was with him among other children on a Saturday when they began to talk . to each other and they became more and more personal. ‘They . exchanged private email addresses and phone numbers in and around June . 2013 and they began sending each other text messages clearly sexual in . nature. She made arrangements to pick him up and it was improper . behaviour during these car journeys. ‘Matters . progressed to kissing as they would drive around the neighbourhood. On . July 10 the defendant picked up the victim by a park and drove him to . her house where they began to kiss.’ Mr . Pons said Kilner began removing his clothes as they watched television. ‘She wanted him to go upstairs and he at first said no but eventually . they do go upstairs and have full intercourse,’ he added. Mr . Pons said they had unprotected sex and that Kilner was meeting unknown . men and women in car parks for sex during this time. The relationship . came to light when the boy told two of his friends, who reported the . incident to another teacher at the college. The . teacher informed the police and Kilner was arrested. She was suspended . from the school on July 27. She made full admissions in police . interviews but said the boy was not forced into anything. Kilner, who lived in Dagenham, Essex, pleaded guilty to six counts of sexual activity with a child by an adult in a position of trust. Sentencing her to 14 months imprisonment, Judge Judith Hughes QC, said: ‘This is a tragic case, having read the reports about you. ‘Clearly this is an offence of a serious breach of trust as you were his teacher. ‘It must be noted that the boy was a willing participant but that does not excuse the behaviour. ‘You are now barred from teaching children or vulnerable adults but you can apply to be taken off this list in the future.’","Janette Kilner had sexual relationship with student from her London school .

"A pizza delivery guy brought a huge order to the Dolby Theatre on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood on Sunday only to be roped into appearing onstage at the Oscars. Edgar, pictured below at work at Big Mama's & Papa's Pizzeria in Hollywood, was fulfilling an order for five of the chain's specialty Big Papa's and a selection of smaller pies. After the slices were consumed, host Ellen DeGeneres collected hundreds of dollars from Brad Pitt and Harvey Weinstein to tip the man, but he never saw that cash, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video... Pizza time: To his surprise, Ellen brought Edgar out onstage to deliver the pizzas himself .

'It's pretty clear he had no idea Ellen passed Pharrell's hat around and scored around $300,' wrote the site. The pizza parlor did end up getting a lot of free publicity however, as advertising on the show costs at least $1.8m, according to Variety. The publicity coup is thought to be worth about $10million to the pizza chain. Ellen had roped him into joining her onstage - where he helped hand out pieces among a room full of multimillionaires, with recipients including Brad, Jennifer Lawrence, Jared Leto, Julia Roberts, Kerry Washington and Meryl Streep. Digging in: Brad Pitt bit into a slice of pizza in the audience as wife Angelina Jolie looked on . Good teamwork: Angelina looked on as husband Brad and 12 Years A Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor prepared their snack . And the pizza goes to: Martin Scorsese takes a greasy slice . As Ellen persuaded the stars to dig in, the bemused delivery guy doled out the squares behind her. The . sheepish delivery man followed Ellen around the front seats of the . auditorium and the host later passed around a Pharrell Williams-like big . hat to gather tips for the pizza delivery from the stars. A source from the chain told MailOnline: 'Yes, we did [deliver the pizza]. We had a couple of guys during the Oscars. 'It was five Big Papas at 60 square slices each. But they got a bunch more, those were just the big ones.' But he said  the delivery guy had no warning he would be making a cameo in front of millions of TV viewers. Dig in!

That's my delivery guy!,' tweeted Jason with the handle @garmonbozia shortly after seeing the familiar face. Others took to Facebook to find out who the delivery man was. Hollywood legend: Harrison Ford stood up and helped himself to a slice . Special delivery: The real delivery guy offered Harrison a pizza . The feeding frenzy started when host Ellen appeared onstage and surprisingly said, 'Guess what? Pizza's here.' A pizza deliveryman with a red cap and red apron then appeared onstage holding several boxes of stacked pizzas. 'I lied. We weren't going backstage,' Ellen told the laid-back pizza guy. Surrounded by stars: The pizza guy found himself surrounded by pizza-loving stars . Popular idea: The stars at the Oscars didn't hesitate when offered fresh pizza . Ellen told the celebrity-studded audience that she had a vegetable pizza with tomato sauce, a cheese pizza and other different kinds. 'I've never done this before, you help,' Ellen asked the delivery guy who proceeded to offer slices to the stars. When Ellen asked who wanted a slice several famous hands immediately shot up.

"An exam board apologised yesterday for a 'confusing' chemistry A-level question that students complain was impossible to answer. The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance admitted that guidance given in an A2 paper sat by just under 16,000 teenagers was 'unhelpful'. It has insisted that examiners will take into account 'the potential for confusion' when marking the question and ensure that students are not penalised. Frustration: Students argue that a question was 'impossible to answer using the data provided' in a chemistry exam on Tuesday (file pic) Students have set up a Facebook page, Thechem5paperwasadisgrace, which is 'liked' by over 2,000 people, in protest over the AQA chemistry exam which was sat on Tuesday. They argue that one question was 'impossible to answer using the data provided' while some claim there wasn't enough time to complete the difficult paper. The contested question - worth five marks out of a potential 100 for the whole paper - asked students to make a calculation using a ratio they should have come up with in part one. To help students who could not calculate the original ratio, the paper gave them another ratio to use to answer part two. However, it also told them in bold print that this was 'not the correct ratio'. One student said: 'A question regarding the percentage of a certain compound required us to use a ratio from the previous question. However if one did not get that ratio, there was a 'wrong' ratio given for use to at least get method marks. 'However, the result using this ratio was more than 100 per cent which is chemically, mathematically and theoretically impossible.' Another said: 'I know that a lot of students spent a long time trying to work out a rational answer and so ran out of time to answer other questions. I feel sorry for a lot of people who are now worried that they won't get into university because of this exam.' Baffling: The contested question was worth five marks out of a potential 100 for the whole paper . A spokeswoman for AQA said: 'We expect that the majority of students will have answered part one of the question correctly, used the ratio that they have calculated and will therefore have had no problems. 'However, the alternative ratio given in A6(d) (ii) leads to an answer that is different to what students would normally expect to see. 'Although the question can still be answered, we recognise the alternative ratio given was unhelpful and it has clearly caused confusion for some students. 'We apologise to these students and accept it would have been better to use a different ratio.' She added: 'We would like to reassure students that we have established procedures in place to deal with issues like this. 'Our examiners will take into account the potential for confusion when they mark the papers and will ensure the results of those students who used the alternative ratio are not affected.'","Anger over chemistry on Tuesday .

"David Cameron’s plans for gay marriage will leave churches open to being sued under human rights legislation unless they agree to same-sex unions. Legal advice sent to the Prime Minister says that churches that refuse to marry homosexuals would be banned from using council facilities such as village halls. The paper, written by Aidan O’Neill – a leading human rights lawyer at centre-left Matrix Chambers – also says that Christian teachers who refuse to take classes discussing gay marriage could be legitimately fired. Ministers have unveiled plans to legalise gay marriage following a legal ban on same-sex weddings in the Church of England . Parents who support traditional marriage would be barred from fostering or adopting and would have no right to prevent their children being taught about gay marriage in school. Most explosively, the document argues that the exemption granted to the Church of England by the Coalition Bill to prevent it having to conduct gay marriages is ‘eminently challenge-able’ in the European Court of Human Rights since the established church has a legal obligation to marry anyone in their local parish. And it warns that the Government’s insistence that protections are put in place for other religious groups who don’t want to marry homosexuals could be undermined by evolving European human rights law. It emerged as senior Government sources confirmed that a Commons vote on gay marriage is planned before mid-February. Details of the legal advice are contained in a letter from former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey to the Prime Minister. Legal pitfalls: David Cameron (right) was sent legal advice by leading human rights lawyer Aidan O'Neill (left) Lord Carey warns that the plans will lead to ‘serious and wide-ranging conflict between religious institutions and local authorities’ and argues that the legal opinion ‘demonstrates why the legislation is unworkable’. He concludes: ‘These proposals are divisive, have no mandate and are poorly thought-out.’ Mr O’Neill’s legal opinion, which was commissioned by the Coalition for Marriage, points out that local authorities have a legal obligation to uphold the Equalities Act, giving them the right to bar churches and employees who uphold a traditional view. A Government source said: ‘It is precisely because the Church of England has a legal duty to marry that we have created a legal lock to ensure this doesn’t apply to same-sex couples.’ A Downing Street source said the Prime Minister would ‘press ahead’ with the plans over the next month and that No 10 ‘has legal advice of our own’.","Human rights lawyer Aidan O'Neill sent legal advice to the Prime Minister .

"An 81-year-old grandmother who fell outside a hospital had to lie in a  gutter in the rain while an ambulance came from seven miles away. When it arrived 30 minutes later, paramedics merely drove Gladys Shepherd 300 yards round the corner to the hospital’s urgent care unit. Her granddaughter Louise Woods said: ‘You’d think a hospital would be the best place to have an accident. I couldn’t believe it.’ Pregnant Louise Woods who went for help after her grandmother Gladys Shepherd fell in the grounds of a hospital. She said she 'couldn't believe' how the situation was dealt with . Mrs Shepherd was already at Burnley . General Hospital when she fell, after visiting its memory assessment . service. She slipped over as she waited for her granddaughter to bring . her car round from the hospital car park. Her face was cut and bruised, . her legs, shoulder and arms were severely bruised and she was unable to . get up. Heavily pregnant Mrs Woods could not lift her, and when she ran . inside to get help, she was told no doctors were available and Mrs . Shepherd would have to stay where she was until an ambulance arrived . from Altham. She was told to ring the ambulance herself. Mrs Woods, 26, from Clitheroe, said: ‘Three receptionists came running . out with umbrellas but said there were no doctors available to check her . over before moving her, so I would have to ring an ambulance. Gladys fell just 300metres from the urgent care unit at Burnley General Hospital, Lancashire . ‘We tried holding umbrellas over her and I took off my coat to cover her . but she was still in a puddle. I even told them I would push her myself . around to the urgent care centre in a wheelchair if someone would just . help me get her off the floor. ‘You would have thought they would have spared a doctor for two minutes . rather than wasting all those resources on sending an ambulance.

"Three masked men broke into a woman's home, bound her hands and feet before carving anti-gay slurs into her body in a vicious hate crime, authorities said. The attackers also spray-painted 'we found you ****' on a wall at the woman's home and tried to set it on fire. Police in Lincoln, Nebraska refused to elaborate on what had been carved into the 33-year-old woman's body with a knife in the horrific attack on Saturday night. Terror: The homophobic slur was spray-painted on the wall of the woman's basement at her home after she was bound and her body cut . United against hate: Residents of Lincoln, Nebraska hold a vigil after a 33-year-old woman had homophobic slurs carved into her body by three masked attackers . The distraught woman, who is openly lesbian, managed to walk to a neighbor's house following the assault when the attackers had left. Linda Rappl, 68, said the woman was naked and bleeding. She told CNN: 'She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down.' Mrs Rappl called police and the woman was treated at hospital after she was cut on the stomach and arms. She was being housed at an emergency shelter and had asked that her identity not be released. The local community banded together in a vigil organized by a local LGBT group on Sunday night. More than 500 people attended to show their outrage at the attack and support for the victim. Mayor Chris Beutler said authorities would do everything to ensure justice is done and denounced violence directed at any group. Hate crime: The attack happened on Saturday night in Lincoln, Nebraska . Katie Flood, a spokeswoman for the Lincoln Police Department, said that 'multiple detectives' are working on the case, but the department does not want to release many details this early in the investigation. 'Doing so could compromise our ability to conduct quality suspect interviews at a later date,' she said. Nothing was reported stolen from the home. The hate crime comes in the wake of public debate over the city's fairness amendment, a proposal to ban discrimination in housing and employment based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The city council approved the measure in May but opponents obtained enough signatures to keep it from going into effect before an as-yet unscheduled public vote. 'It was the talk of the town,' said Tyler Richard, president of Outlinc, a Lincoln gay rights support group. He said public comments to the council about the ordinance have run in favor of keeping it. Omaha, Nebraska's largest city, approved anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender residents in March. Richard, who attended Sunday's vigil, said Outlinc has 'full faith' in the Lincoln Police Department, which he said has a long history of support for the city's gay and lesbian community. 'We trust that their investigation will be fair and complete and we await the results,' Richard said in a statement. 'As we consider the possible impetus for this horrific attack we are reminded more than ever why fairness is vital in our city.'","Victim, 33, escaped to neighbor's home in Lincoln, Nebraska .

"Religion, such as Buddhism, will have died out in many developed countries by 2041, according to one biopychologist . Religious people in many developed countries will be a minority by 2041, according to one Irish biopsychologist. A study into the beliefs of people living in 137 countries, which forms the basis for a new book, found atheism increases in more developed places as people become increasingly materially rich. The book also debunks the popular belief that religious groups will dominate atheistic ones because they collectively have more children. Biopsychologist Dr Nigel Barber has based his book, 'Why atheism will replace religion,' on the findings to draw his controversial conclusions. Biopsychologists examine the application of the principles of biology to the study of physiological, genetic and developmental mechanisms of behaviour in humans. In an article in Psychology Today, Dr Barber explains that in his book he questions how long it would take for the average country in . the world to reach a similar level of wealth and development as . countries that already have secular minorities. This transition was defined as a minority of the population believing in a god, or a minority considering that a god is important to their lives. This was measured in terms of a country's GDP, local prices and Human . Development Index (HDI) and allowed Mr Barber to come to the conclusion . the average country will transform into a secular society in 2041. He said atheists are heavily concentrated in economically developed countries and religion will decrease as individuals' personal wealth increases. The book proposes that people do not have to rely on supernatural influences when material possessions are catering to their needs, according to Science World Report. Religion declines not only because people are becoming richer, but also due to the increasing quality of life, decline of serious diseases, better education and welfare states, the author said. He believes there is less demand for religion in societies such as Japan and Sweden where normal people are relatively comfortable and consequently the majority of the populations are already secular. Dr Barber concentrates on the emotional . benefits of religion that favored its evolution amongst our ancestors, who faced many different challenges to their daily lives. The book links the cause of religion’s emergence with reasons for its potential decline and the Amazon description for the book likens organised religion to a Dodo. Will cathedrals be empty in 2041? A study into the beliefs of people living in 137 countries, which forms the basis for a new book, found atheism increases in more developed places as people become more materially rich . The description says: 'Religion evolved to help our ancestors . cope with anxiety and insecurity. 'Supernatural belief is in decline . everywhere that ordinary people enjoy a decent standard of living and . are secure in their health and finances. 'The market for formal religion is also being squeezed by modern substitutes such as sports and entertainment. 'Even Facebook is killing religion because . it provides answers for peculiarly modern narcissistic anxieties for . which religion has no answer.' Dr Barber also said it is unlikely religious . communities will continue to dominate atheistic groups as they have . children more frequently, as has been previously suggested. Dr Barber said: 'Noisy as they can be, such groups are . tiny minorities of the global population and they will become even more . marginalized as global prosperity increases and standards of living . improve.' He believes as women become more integrated into the workplace they will have less children, whether they are religious or atheist. Jewish men pray at the wailing wall in Jerusalem. Dr Barber's book says religion evolved to help our ancestors cope with anxiety and insecurity, but now people enjoy a decent standard of living, formal religion is being squeezed by modern substitutes such as sports and entertainment .","Dr Nigel Barber's book debunks the popular belief that religious groups will dominate atheistic ones because they collectively have more children .

"Fatal: Champion bodyboarder David Lilienfeld was dragged under the water by the killer 16ft shark . A champion surfer was killed in a Great White shark shark attack in South Africa - as his brother paddled nearby. David Lilienfeld, 20, was bodyboarding in the Indian Ocean when the 16ft beast struck, dragging him under the waves. Terrified witnesses watched from the beach as the deadly predator grasped Mr Lilienfeld in his jaws, during the attack in the sea at Koeel Bay east of Cape Town. His brother Gustav, who had been near his brother when the animal struck, helped drag him to rocks but he died before medics could reach him. Devastated Gustav was consoled by his father at the scene moments after the tragedy yesterday. And soon after the fatal attack, the spotlight fell on a documentary crew who were accused of risking public safety by luring sharks in close to the shore for filming. NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon confirmed Mr Lilienfeld's body was found . on rocks on the shore and said his severed right leg had yet to be . recovered. He also confirmed that the surfer had been in the water alongside his brother, who witnessed the attack. He said: 'The deceased man sustained complete amputation of his right . leg, below the hip, while body boarding with his brother and friends and . he was rescued from the water by his brother, friends and bystanders. 'The leg has not been recovered.' He . added: ‘The brother was in the sea at the time and apparently saw the . incident unfold. We don't yet know exactly where the man was bitten, but . he later washed up on some rocks. ‘He was examined at the scene by paramedics and is now being examined by pathologists.’ Mr Lambinon said the victim's brother had been offered counselling following the tragedy.

Victim: The body of David Lilienfeld, attacked by a shark at Gordon's Bay in South Africa, is carried away by police and a rescue team . Officials . said in the moments before the attack witnesses had spotted a shark . believed to be a Great White and thought to measure up to 16 feet in . length. The tragedy happened . at the Koeel Bay beach, a popular surfing spot which lies close to the . town of Gordon's Bay around 30 miles east of Cape Town. Yesterday's . attack comes after a TV documentary crew was accused of risking public . safety by attracting sharks into shallow waters around Cape Town. Experts this week expressed concern . after it emerged a film crew shooting along the region's False Bay coastline were using chum and bait to lure sharks to their boats. Cape Town based shark author Dirk . Schmidt appealed last week to South Africa's department of the . environment over its decision to grant permits for the controversial . filming to take place. Mr Lilienfeld's body was found on rocks on the shore. His severed right leg has yet to be recovered . He said today that he had feared bringing sharks closer to the shore would increase the risk of an attack. He . said: ‘I expressed my serious concerns about the project because I . feared public safety could be put at risk if they were brought closer to . the beaches for filming. ‘I . went out earlier this week and watched the crew luring White sharks . close to their boats and then fishing them out to tag them for the project. ‘Obviously when this kind of activity is happening there is always a risk of increased shark presence in the area afterwards. ‘It's impossible to say for sure whether the filming project is linked to today's terrible tragedy. ‘However . this was my worst case scenario, and I wish the department of the . environment had issued a strong warning to bathers while the filming was . underway.’ Nothing they could do: Rescue workers prepare to transport the surfer's body.

Talented: David Lilienfeld, pictured riding a wave, was a champion bodyboarder before his was killed age just 20 during a Great White shark attack . South Africa's government today confirmed a documentary had been cancelled in light of this morning's tragedy. However, confusion surrounds who in fact had been filming in the area prior to the tragedy. South African officials had said a team from National Geographic Channel's Shark Men were issued with a permit to film. Attacked: A 16ft Great White shark killed Mr Lilienfeld while he paddled with his brother . But the channel flatly denies filming in the area at the time and categorically stated it was 'not associated with this event'. Department of the environment spokesman Zolile Nqayi yesterday said a crew had been informed their permits were being immediately withdrawn. He said: ‘We have cancelled all the permits for the Shark Men filming and research project following the attack today. ‘There has been considerable controversy about this project which we have noted, however we have always believed that the project would not result in any increased risk to the public. ‘We do not believe that today's attack was linked to the Shark Man filming but have decided to stop this whole thing now to prevent panic among the public.’ But a spokesman for the National Geographic Channel said: 'National Geographic Channel are not filming and are not associated with this event. 'While it is true we do have a series currently airing on National Geographic Channel called “Shark Men” with Chris Fischer, we have not renewed the series for another season, have no plans to at the moment, and are not filming new episodes at this time. 'Therefore, the filming we understand is taking place in South Africa is not for National Geographic Channel or for future episodes of Shark Men.

"New footage claims to show Mexican smugglers known as coyotes smuggling immigrants across the U.S. – Mexico border using jet skis. A video shown on the Breitbart website claims the person driving the jet ski is a smuggler, and that his passengers are a woman and her infant child. It then shows the pair being taken into custody by Border Patrol. The woman departs the jet ski and walks along the river bank to a nearby road where authorities apprehend her and the baby. Jetting to freedom: Breitbart claims the person driving this jet ski is a coyote, and his passengers are an illegal immigrant mother and her infant baby . MailOnline was not able to independently confirm the nationality of the woman and infant. The video is said by Breitbart to have been shot recently at Anzalduas Park, in Mission, Texas. A downstream dam in the Rio Grande has created a lake of sorts that allows the coyotes to quickly zip across the river with immigrants, according to the site. ‘We have problems, a lot of times they (the coyotes) have more intel sources than we do,’ Border Patrol agent Albert Spratte is shown saying on the video. ‘Our resources have been hampered.’ On American soil: The woman is then shown scurrying along the riverbank until eventually being arrested by the Border Patrol . Families shown on the riverbank pretending to fish often spend entire afternoons on cell phones telling smugglers of Border patrol movements, according to Spratte. The jet skiing coyotes are only adding to the problem of undocumented immigrants overcrowding border holding cells. ‘Our station can hold like 300 people [but] we’ve actually held up to 1,300,’ Spratte continued. Multiple messages left with the Border Patrol and the National Border Patrol Council seeking further comment and attempting to verify the information in the Breitbart report were not immediately returned.","The video claims to show smugglers scooting people across the border via the watercraft .

"A social worker has been suspended for 12 months after she turned up at a couple's house shouting 'baby murderers' and threatening to kill them. Joanna Burgess admitted being part of a mob outside the house in July last year, where she was heard to shout out threats to kill before a brick was thrown at the property. She was arrested and, following her conviction by magistrates, was this week hauled before the Health and Care Professionals Council (HSPC) which suspended her. Social worker Joanna Burgess pleaded guilty at Kettering Magistrates' Court to being part of a mob outside the house where she was heard to shout out threats to kill before a brick was thrown at the property . Elena Elia, a solicitor for the HCPC, told the hearing that Burgess turned up with others outside a home on July 8 last year. 'She was heard to shout 'baby murderers' and was heard to shout out threats to kill a victim inside the property,' Ms Elia said. She added: '(Burgess) was a member of the party responsible for throwing a brick that injured the victim who required sutures. 'The victim was fearful that the group would smash her door down and further injure her. 'After her arrest, she maintained silence but stated that she had known the victim for some years and had previously given a statement to the police about the victim.' It was not said at the disciplinary hearing who the target of her abuse was. The panel was told Burgess had been charged by police following the incident and had pleaded guilty before magistrates in Kettering, Northants., to using threatening language and disorderly behaviour. She was given a 12-month conditional discharge, and ordered to pay £175 pounds costs. The HCPC panel decided to strike Burgess from the register for one year for her behaviour. Panel Chair Brian Wroe said: 'This type of bullying behaviour undoubtedly calls into question the suitability of the perpetrator, Ms Burgess, to remain able to work in social services. 'Ms Burgess' conduct on July 8, 2012, undermines public confidence in the profession and also impacts, albeit indirectly, on the safety of any clients of Ms Burgess.'","Joanna Burgess pleaded guilty to being part of a mob outside the house .

Yet the bullying became so relentless that she thought about taking her own life. She told WNEM-TV: 'I had actually . reached a point where I had thought about suicide for how bad this case . was in. I thought I wasn't worthy at Ogemaw Heights at all.' 'I felt like I wasn’t worthy,' she added on the Today show. 'Why even be a part of this community, this world if I’m just going to be tossed around like basically a piece of trash?' But the savage bullying was soon overpowered by a tremendous outpouring of support for the teen. A former student, Jamie Kline set up a Facebook page 'Support Whitney Kropp,' which has shared her story of bullying with more than 100,000 since it was created. 'When we first started doing it, it was obviously meant to hit the Ogemaw Heights community, but once we established that and people started paying attention, we determined the page is here, why not use it for the greater good? Why not work for (combating) bullying in general?' Kline told the Detroit News. Speaking out: Whitney appeared on the Today show to lambast her bullies and reveal how hurt she had been . Kindess: Donations have helped Kropp pay for her dress, hair and make-up for the dance on Saturday night . For the homecoming dance on Saturday night, businesses will buy her dinner, take her photo, fix her hair and nails, and dress her in a gown, shoes and a tiara, the Detroit News reported. Shannon Champagne and another beauty salon worker have offered their services to help. 'It really touched me,' Champagne, a nail tech, said. 'I can't believe that kids can be so mean and ruthless. In high school, everything means everything to you. You don't realize that none of it will matter after you leave.' 'I am in awe, overwhelmed at the amount of support,' Kline, 35, told the News. 'I never expected it to spread as far as it has.' For Whitney, the messages and kind . words from the town and complete strangers thousands of miles away is . enough to drown out the bullies - and she's now looking forward to the . big dance. Bernice Kropp . told WNEM: 'This was something that was really awful, could have ended . awful, and because so many people came together, it just turned right . around.' Hurt: The 16-year-old was . humiliated to learn that she had been elected in a prank by fellow students . Support: Whitney, second from right, is seen with her sister Olivia, mother Bernice and brother Justin . Whitney recounted to the News how she had been sitting in her geometry class on September 13 when the results of the homecoming vote were announced over the school PA system - to the laughter of some of her fellow classmates. Despite her surprise, she had been happy that she had been called, her mother said. 'The first thing is softhearted,' Bernice Kropp said when asked to describe her daughter. 'She's just sweet. She doesn't have a mean bone in her body.' Even when Josh Awrey, a popular football player, quickly withdrew as the other sophomore rep, she was still excited about the news. 'In the Homecoming Court! :)' she wrote on her Facebook page after the announcement. 'Little nervous but this is going to be fun :D' After the backlash, Awrey decided to remain a class rep, even though he said on his Facebook page that he had never wanted to be part of homecoming. 'Im sick of everyone blaming me,' he wrote. 'I had nothing to do with this. I think what they (students) did is rlly rude and immature.'","Whitney Kropp, 16, elected to homecoming court earlier this month - only to find out it had been a prank by popular students .

"Users of legal highs have been warned that they are ‘dancing in a minefield’ after a huge surge in the number of deaths. Ninety-seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. In around two thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death. Tragic cases: Users of legal highs have been warned they are 'dancing in a minefield' after a huge surge in the number of deaths, including those of medical student Hester Stewart (left), 21, and Adam Hunt . (right), 18 . Professor Fabrizio Schifano, of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths at St George’s University of London, warned: ‘These type of drugs are showing up more than ever before. ‘Clearly this is a major public health concern and we must continue to monitor this worrying development. Those experimenting with such substances are effectively dancing in a minefield.’ The figures were compiled from reports submitted to the university by coroners. Of the 97 deaths involving legal highs, around a third were chemically similar to the illegal drug mephedrone – known as meow meow or bubbles. Ketamine will today be made a Class B banned substance amid fears that it is ruining young people’s health. Anybody caught possessing the horse tranquilliser, which is used as a party drug, will face up to five years in jail. Known as Special K, it was taken by up to 120,000 people last year. But there is mounting evidence that it is causing huge health damage, . with users as young as 20 being forced to have their bladders removed . due to its toxic effects. It has also been linked to a string of deaths.The drug achieved notoriety when ex-Co-op bank boss the Reverend Paul Flowers was caught trying to buy it. In December, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said that ketamine should be upgraded from Class C to B. That . recommendation has now been accepted by Home Secretary Theresa May. Other Class B drugs include cannabis and amphetamines such as speed. Others mimicked the effects of amphetamines such as ketamine, while one was linked to a synthetic form of cannabis. In many cases, users took multiple substances as well as alcohol. The report warns that many legal highs have undergone no human testing and the damage they do is ‘virtually unknown’. Maryon Stewart, whose medical student daughter Hester died after taking the legal high GBL, warned: ‘Young people are largely unaware of how grave a threat they face from legal highs. ‘With precious little education on these substances, young people are living in an information vacuum. ‘The appalling tragedies in the report are all avoidable so it is absolutely critical everyone wakes up to the dangers to our children from these untested substances.’ Another legal high victim was Adam Hunt, who bought a substance called AMT over the internet from Holland in August. Four days after he took the drug, he was dead. His mother Bernadette found the 18-year-old collapsed in his bedroom. He was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save him. Originally developed as an anti-depressant, AMT is a ‘psychedelic’ drug which can have effects similar to ecstasy. However, it can also cause severe nausea and anxiety. Adam passed 11 GCSEs and had been studying electrical engineering at college. Determined: Last night crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'I am determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs' In a statement after his death, his parents said: ‘He was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly. ‘His life had such potential and was all in front of him. Sadly it has been cut very short.’ The report also recorded growing numbers of deaths from cocaine, which reached 115, and ecstasy. Last night crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: ‘I am determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in so-called legal highs which, as this report shows, has tragically claimed the lives of far too many people in our country.’","Ninety-seven people were found dead with substances in system in 2012 .

"An angry mother has accused a primary school of denying her child water on one of the hottest days of the year for fear of upsetting pupils observing Ramadan. Kora Blagden, 32, claimed a teacher at her son Luke’s school refused to let the 10-year old drink from his water bottle because it was unfair to fasting classmates. Many pupils at Charles Dickens Primary . School, Portsmouth, Hampshire, are fasting during Ramadan, which means . they refrain from taking food or water between sunrise and sunset for . around 30 days, depending on the moon. The school has said pupils had been reminded to be respectful to classmates who were fasting but added it would 'never prevent' children from having access to water . Kora Blagden (left) has complained to the school as she says her son Luke (right picture, stood on the left) was told he could not drink water in case it upset pupils who were fasting . Mother-of-four Kora said: 'Just before bedtime me and my sons Luke, ten, and Alfie, eight, were talking about Ramadan as we had seen it on the news. Luke said to me he was told he wasn’t allowed to drink in class by his teacher. 'The reason being, a child who is fasting had a headache and the teacher said it would be unfair if the other children drank in front of the pupil. 'They normally have their bottles on their table but they were kept in a tray by the teacher. He went along with it but he was thirsty and didn’t want to offend the other children. Alfie said he was allowed to drink in the morning but not in the afternoon. 'Luke was dehydrated when he got home and drunk three glasses of water straight away.' Headteacher Craig Duncan has said water was available to students who had been 'reminded to be respectful' to classmates who were fasting. He said: . 'School staff do everything that we can to ensure the welfare of all of . our children and we would never prevent them from having access to . water. A number of pupils at Charles Dickens Primary School, Portsmouth, Hampshire, are fasting during Ramadan . 'In . this case, water was available and pupils were just reminded to be . respectful to their classmates who were unable to drink in this hot weather.' Ms Blagden spoke to deputy head Lisa Florence before lessons began today and was given a verbal apology for the incident. She said: 'I spoke to the deputy head and told them what Luke had said to me and I asked why this was allowed. 'The deputy head said it was not what they had been told to do and it is only what children of Muslim faith do' - Kora Blagden . 'She said it wasn’t fair my son was refused a drink in lesson and therefore drank nothing in lesson time all day. 'She said they will be speaking with Luke and the teacher, and stated she was sorry my children felt they could not drink. 'The deputy head said it was not what they had been told to do and it is only what children of Muslim faith do. 'I have no problem with that but I don’t wish my sons to be told they can’t drink water. 'Personally I think it is very wrong.'

"Criticism: Sir Michael Wilshaw believes pupils are being let down by headteachers who treat sport as an 'optional extra' A ‘disproportionately high number’ of athletes and sports stars are privately educated amid the dire state of competitive sport in state schools, according to the head of Ofsted. Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, will today warn that too many pupils are being let down by head teachers who ‘treat competitive sport with suspicion or as an optional extra’. Not enough state schools are ‘developing the talents of the next generation of Mo Farahs’ and this lack of sporting participation is ‘cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back’. Children are being hampered by teachers unwilling to run teams, sports taught at a ‘superficial level’ and ‘limited facilities’ such as a lack of playing fields and all-weather playing surfaces. Sir Michael will call on the Government to do more to enable competitive sport to thrive in the state sector. Ofsted launched an in-depth assessment of competitive school sport after it emerged that 41 per cent of UK medallists at London 2012 were privately educated. The watchdog investigated the school backgrounds of English athletes who compete at Olympic and Paralympic standard and also at the highest levels in football, rugby union, hockey, netball and cricket. It found ‘unacceptable discrepancies’ between the proportion of pupils attending state schools and how well they were represented in elite sport. Despite state schools educating up to 93 per cent of the population, they only produce about a third of top sportspeople across a range of disciplines, the new analysis found. Forty-five per cent of hockey players, 54 per cent of the rowing team and 73 per cent of the equestrian team competing at the London 2012 Olympics were privately educated. In the Rugby Union English Premiership, 61 per cent of players have attended an independent school. Cricket and hockey also have an ‘over-representation’ of independent-schooled players in their national leagues while football is the ‘most demographically representative’ sport. Ninety-four per cent of English footballers competing in the Premier League have been educated at state schools. Sir Michael will tell the Festival of Education conference at Wellington College, Crowthorne, Berkshire, today: ‘It simply can’t be right that state educated athletes are so woefully under-represented in our elite sports. ‘Heads who treat competitive sport with suspicion or as an optional extra are not only denying youngsters the clear dividends that come with encouraging them to compete, they are also cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back.’ Future: Not enough state schools are 'developing the talents of the next generation of Mo Farahs' and this lack of sporting participation is ¿cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back' Ofsted also visited 35 state schools and academies and 10 independent schools. It surveyed the views of more than 500 head teachers and 1,000 11 to 18-year-olds. As a result, the watchdog concluded that competitive sport ‘remains optional in the vast majority of state schools’. Only half of the young people surveyed reported that they ‘regularly’ played sport in school against their peers or versus other schools. Just 40 per cent said they regularly played sport outside of school. Among the head teachers surveyed, only 13 per cent said they expected all students to take part in competitive sport. A few indicated that no pupils were expected to participate. ...Only half of the young people surveyed . reported that they ‘regularly’ played sport in school against their . peers or versus other schools. Just 40 per cent said they regularly . played sport outside of school . Ofsted’s report, Going the Extra Mile, said that the quality of competitive sport in state schools was ‘very mixed’. In many schools it ‘was average at best and in a significant number it was weak’. Only 15 out of 35 state schools played high quality competitive sport regularly and were successful in regional and national schools’ competitions. The best schools’ competitive sport was flourishing because it was valued and seen as a key part of the culture and ethos. Teachers gave up their time to help organise activities and run teams. The report says: ‘In too many of the other maintained schools and academies we visited, students had few opportunities to excel in competitive sport because it was not seen as a priority. ‘It was undervalued by school leaders, who were not investing in it. ‘They did not have enough teachers willing to organise activities and run teams and were unable to provide enough time to coach or play high quality sport. ‘Without the ‘enthusiasts’ and ‘organisers’ – the people on the ground to run school sport – these schools struggled to help students compete regularly or excel.’ These schools were less likely to be rated good or outstanding and typically had lower levels of academic achievement than those state schools that offered high quality competitive sport. Staff focused time on getting pupils involved in PE instead of high quality competitive sport. Standards of performance were ‘often low’, with independent schools dominating some sports because they ‘play to a higher standard.’ Sir Michael will insist today that ‘high school fees and large playing fields are not a pre-requisite to success’. He said: ‘If all schools follow the example of the best identified in this report, there is no reason why more pupils from state funded schools can’t be batting for England at the Ashes or scoring a winning try in the next Six Nations.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw believes sport is being treated as an 'optional extra'

"Lee Chapman was found by police sleeping rough in Peterborough . Inmates at a low-security prison are allowed visits from female friends and were frequently in possession of drug and mobile phones, it has been claimed . The extraordinary claims have been made by Lee Chapman, 34, who escaped from Hollesley Bay prison, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, where he was serving a triple-life sentence for arson and burglary. Chapman had absconded from custody and robbed six homes in eleven days. He has been given a further two years to his sentence. The prisoner had recently been moved to the low security prison, before absconding and eventually being found by police sleeping rough in Peterborough and charged with absconding. Chapman's defence told Ipswich Crown Court that the prisoner had found it difficult to adjust to low-security prison. On October 8 the prisoner left his room via a drainpipe and fled by bus from the prison grounds. While making his way back to Cambridgeshire Chapman burgled six homes in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in 11 days. Chapman stole food and also a Nintendo games console from one home. One householder even caught Chapman in her home eating a chocolate bar from her fridge. When the woman confronted Chapman, he apologised, . returned a house key he had found, and fled. Chapman was eventually . found by police sleeping rough in Peterborough on October 29. He told the crown court he admitted escaping from lawful custody and burglary. Judge David Goodin jailed him for a total of two years to be added to his existing sentence. Hollesley Bay, Suffolk, is a category D low-security prison . After the case a Prison Service spokeswoman denied that there were drugs, mobiles and women in Hollesley Bay jail. She said: 'It is a criminal offence . to be in possession of drugs or a mobile phone in prison and any . prisoner found in possession will be referred to the police. 'We take this issue extremely . seriously and staff work hard to keep all prohibited items out of . prisons, using a range of robust and intelligence-led measures and work . closely with partner agencies, including the police.

"We’ve all wished someone from the future could send us tomorrow’s lottery ticket numbers. While it may seem wishful thinking, a physicist from Cambridge University believes that, in theory, it could be possible. He argues that if a thin wormhole stays open long enough, people might send messages instantly through time using pulses of light. Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space-time. A study in May from Dr Luke Butcher at Cambridge University argued that if a thin wormhole stayed open long enough, people could send messages through time using pulses of light, or photons . Space-time can be warped and distorted. It takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions, but theoretically, distortions are possible. In the case of the wormhole, a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space-time. Imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to represent two points in space-time. The line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space-time. If the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to warping space-time -  then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points, in the same way a wormhole would create a shortcut. The problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable.  When a particle enters a wormhole, it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it. The latest study suggests there are unusual-shaped wormholes than may be able to stay open longer than normal. It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but the theory of wormholes being used to send objects through time was first suggested by Albert Einstein's calculations. Wormholes are theoretical tunnels through the fabric of space-time that can create shortcuts for long journeys across the universe. The problem with his theory is that, if wormholes exist, they don’t stay open long enough for a human, or even a single particle of light, to pass through them. But a new study at Cambridge University suggests that some wormholes are capable of staying open long enough to send messages backwards and forwards through time. In 1988, physicist Kip Thorne at the California Institute of Technology suggested that wormholes might be kept open through the use of a negative energy, known as Casimir energy. According to modern physics, the vacuum is full of fluctuating electromagnetic waves of different possible wavelengths which creates a vast amount of energy, normally invisible to humans. Between two parallel plates in a vacuum, some energy waves would be too large to fit through creating a negative Casimir energy. Einstein believed worm holes could open up a window into a different era. The problem with his theory is that, if worm holes exist, they don't stay open long enough for anything to pass through them. But a new study at Cambridge University suggests unusually-shaped wormholes could stay open longer than normal . Professor Luke Butcher’s recent paper builds on that theory by suggesting that if a wormhole is a lot longer than it is wide, the amount of Casimir energy naturally present inside it would be enough to allow it to stay open longer than normal. ‘My approach was to see if the wormhole itself – because it has a tube-like structure - could create the same effect as the plates,’ Dr Butcher told MailOnline. ‘My calculations showed that if a wormhole is very long compared to how wide it is, you can get negative energy created in the centre of the wormhole. ‘It’s not quite the right sort to keep the wormhole stable – which is what I’d hoped - but it does mean the wormhole collapses very slowly.' The wormhole would be open just long enough, Dr Butcher suggests, to send a photon through to the centre. The worm hole would be open just long enough, Dr Butcher suggests, to send a photon through to the other side. Because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time, if Professor Butcher's theory proves correct, a message could be sent through time . Because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time, if Professor Butcher’s theory proves correct, a message could be sent through time. Dr Butcher warned a lot more work needs to be down to confirm his theory. For instance, scientists still need to find out whether a pulse of light large enough to transmit a meaningful message can get through a collapsing wormhole and whether the pulse can actually escape the wormhole completely. ‘More calculations need to be done away from centre closer to mouths to see if the theory holds true,’ added Dr Butcher. ‘I would also like to look at the opposite case. 'Could a very short and fat worm hole be able to send messages through time? ‘This is all very much theoretical, but the possibilities are intriguing.’","Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space-time .
If a message entered a wormhole, it could reach the future or the past .

"If you find it hard to look on the bright side and your glass is half-empty rather than half-full, blame your lateral habenula. Scientists say chemicals in this small part of the brain are crucial to feelings of disappointment. If the chemistry is right, we may find it easier to brush off the bad times. But if it is out of balance, we may feel set-backs more keenly. Chemicals in a small part of the brain called lateral habenula are crucial to feelings of disappointment . Researcher Roberto Malinow said: ‘The idea that some people see the world as a glass half-empty has a chemical basis in the brain.’ To work out why some people find it hard to be optimistic, the professor looked at the chemistry of a lateral habenula, a tiny area deep inside the brain. Roberto Malinow's research could help in the search for new treatments for depression . Studies on monkeys have shown the lateral habenula becomes very active when the creatures are denied a fruit juice they are expecting. In experiments on rats and mice, Professor Malinow showed the balance of two brain chemicals in the region to be key. One, called glutamate, ramps up activity in the area, while the other, GABA, dampens it down. Rats with depression made less GABA than others. But when they were given an anti-depressant, levels increased. It is thought pessimists naturally make less GABA. This would make them feel knock-backs more deeply – and so expect bad things to happen more often. The finding suggests making enough GABA is crucial to dealing with disappointment. Professor Malinow, of the University of California, San Diego, said: ‘What we have found is a process that may dampen the brain’s sensitivity to negative life events.’ His research, published in the journal Science, doesn’t just help explain why some people are more pessimistic than others – it could also help in the search for new treatments for depression.","Scientists say chemicals in lateral habenula are crucial to disappointment .

"A hug or two a day may be more effective than an apple for keeping doctors at arm’s length. Regular embraces can lower the risk of heart disease, combat stress and fatigue, boost the immune system, fight infections and ease depression, according to a new study. Just ten seconds of hugging can lower blood pressure and after this time elapses, levels of feel-good hormones such as oxytocin increase, while the amounts of stress chemicals, including cortisol, drop. Healthy hugs: A ten-second hug a day can lower the risk of infections and heart disease . ‘The positive emotional experience of hugging gives rise  to biochemical and physiological reactions,’ says psychologist Dr Jan Astrom, who led the study report published in the journal Comprehensive Psychology. A second study found that after ten seconds of hugging, levels of various hormones in men and women aged 20 to 49 changed. Oxytocin is secreted by the body during childbirth and in breastfeeding, where it stimulates release of milk. Until recently, its effects were thought to be confined to just that. Love's embrace: Hugging releases health-benefiting hormones . But research is increasingly showing that it seems to have many more effects, from improving social skills to combating stress and encouraging trust. The skin contains a network of tiny, egg-shaped pressure centres called Pacinian corpuscles that can sense touch and which are in contact with the brain through the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve winds its way through the body and is connected to a number of organs, including  the heart. It is also connected to oxytocin receptors. One theory is that stimulation of the vagus triggers an increase in oxytocin, which in turn leads to the cascade of health benefits.","Hugging releases stress-reducing hormone oxytocin .

"Britain's leading examining board has been accused of 'justifying' antisemitism in schools after GCSE pupils were asked in an exam to explain 'why some people are prejudiced against Jews'. More than a thousand religious studies students sat the test last Thursday, which was set by one of the three major English exam boards, AQA. The bizarre question has sparked fury among teachers, parents, ministers and members of the Jewish community who have blamed the body for 'justifying' anti-semitism in schools. Bizarre: More than a thousand students sat the exam last Thursday, which was set by one of the three major English exam boards, AQA . 'Clearly this is unacceptable and has nothing whatsoever to do with Jews or Judaism,' said Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Rabbi David Meyer, the executive head of Hasmonean High School, whose pupils do not sit the AQA exam, said that the question had 'no place' in an exam paper. 'The role of education is to remove prejudices and not to justify them,' he said. 'The question plants suggestions and implies ideas that shouldn't be instilled into students.' The question has caused such outrage that it has been carried to the very top of Government. Never forget: Jewish women in their barrack in the Auschwitz concentration camp where more than a million Jews were murdered between 1940 and 1944. AQA wanted pupils to 'illustrate prejudice based on irrational fear, ignorance and scapegoating' Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'To suggest that anti-semitism can ever be explained, rather than condemned, is insensitive and, frankly, bizarre. AQA needs to explain how and why this question was included in an exam paper.' He said that it was 'the duty of politicians to fight prejudice, and with antisemitism on the rise we need to be especially vigilant'. Top of Government: Education Secretary Michael Gove branded the question 'bizarre' and 'insensitive' However, one examiner leapt to the board's defence, saying it was a 'legitimate' question that pupils needed to be asked. Educator Clive Lawton, formerly an A-level chief examiner for religious studies for another board, said: 'I do understand why people might react negatively to the question, but it is a legitimate one. 'Part of the syllabus is that children must study the causes and origins of prejudice against Jews.' A spokesperson for AQA said that the question was part of a paper focusing on Judaism and the 'relevant part of the syllabus covers prejudice and discrimination with reference to race, religion and the Jewish experience of persecution. 'We would expect [students to refer] to the Holocaust to illustrate prejudice based on irrational fear, ignorance and scapegoating.' She added: 'The board is obviously concerned that this question may have caused offence, as this was absolutely not our intention'. '[The question] acknowledges that some people hold prejudices; it does not imply in any way that prejudice is justified'. Ofqual, which regulates exams, said that it was in discussion with AQA: 'We will take appropriate follow-up action if necessary.' Approximately six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust by the Nazi regime and its collaborators in the build up to and during the Second World War.","Jewish community leaders condemn question for 'justifying' anti-semitism in schools .

"A man has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old girl who he targeted at random, authorities said today. Erick N Walker, 26, of Marysville was captured at his home last Friday, a month after the death of teenager Molly Conley. Walker appeared in court in Lake Stevens, Washington on Monday where he is expected to be charged with first-degree murder. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Erick N Walker, 26, of Marysville was captured on Friday at his home, a month after the death of teenager Molly Conley . Lock-down: A month after the 15-year-old was shot dead, police arrested a 26-year-old man at his home in Lake Stevens, Washington . The young girl was shot as Walker allegedly fired several times at random targets, according to Fox. Police said on Monday that Walker was the sole person involved and did not know the teenage girl or have connections to other targets he shot at. Neighbors reported that weapons were removed from Walker's home on Friday where he had lived for about four months. He is not believed to belong to any gangs. Miss Conley, an A-grade student and lacrosse star, was shot dead in a random drive-by shooting as she walked with friends to a sleepover to celebrate her 15th birthday. She was walking along a narrow road in a residential area of Lake Stevens, Washington on June 1 when gunfire broke out and she was fatally hit in the neck. Police received several calls at 11.18pm and officers rushed to the scene, where they found Molly unresponsive. None of her friends were injured. Loss: Molly Conley, pictured with her big brother, was gunned down as she celebrated her 15th birthday with friends on June 1 . Creepy: Walker's Facebook page which was covered in pictures of weapons . Random violence: Walker is being held without bail after he allegedly shot dead a teenage girl at random last month . Walker, who works for Boeing and is originally from Everett, Washington, appeared in court on Monday where his lawyer requested more time to read the legal documents. The 26-year-old is being held without bail. Molly, who had just turned 15 when she was killed, had . planned to spend the night at a friend's house before her birthday . party. Instead, her friends attended a vigil for Molly at a local . church. Michel Hazen, who lives around the corner from the street, told KIRO: 'Just as I was kind of drifting off to sleep, I heard a loud, maybe a yell or a scream or something.... Then I started hearing sirens.' Molly was a freshman student at Blanchet High School in Seattle, where she had achieved the nickname '4.0' for her perfect grades. Friends and relatives remembered her as . an accomplished student and actress and a talented lacrosse player who . brightened up their days with her positive, caring attitude. Star student: Molly had a 4.0 GPA and was a member of the lacrosse team at Blanchet High School . Loved: Teachers, relatives and friends described Molly as an upbeat, outstanding student . Conley even persuaded her mother and stepfather to be foster parents to babies waiting for permanent homes. 'Molly would help take care of them, and she was extremely passionate,' her mother Susan Arksey told the Seattle Times. The president of the school, Tony . Desapio, said he was devastated by the killing and is offering support and counseling to . students. 'It was a deep moment of sharing grief, . and longing and missing Molly and a deep moment of trying to make sense . of a real tragedy,' Desapio said. Scene: The girls were walking to a lake before their sleepover when there were gunshots on this road . 'Molly was a vibrant, wonderful . presences in our community. She was a blessing to us.' Friends also expressed their sadness . and condolences on Facebook. One of her closest friends, Iris Thatcher, . uploaded pictures of the girls as she paid tribute. 'Thank . you Molly for some of the best years I had ever had,' she wrote. 'I . love you so much and this is so hard to go through knowing one of my . best friends is gone. 'Thanks for being the best and impacting my life so greatly. RIP.' Heartbreak: Members of the lacrosse club grieve outside church after a vigil for Molly . Sadness: Two girls walk in to the Our Lady of Fatima church just hours after their friend was gunned down . Conley leaves behind a sister, who is a senior at the school, and a brother, who is in 10th grade. Lake Stevens, the area where the shooting took place, has suffered several other shootings in recent weeks. There are bullet holes in signs near to where Molly was killed. It is a suburban community with around 28,000 residents and largely made up with families. It surrounds a large lake around which many businesses and recreational activities center.","Erick Walker, 26 was captured on Friday at his home in Marysville, Washington .

"A row over a seven-year-old's smart haircut has become so heated that his parents have threatened to remove him from school. Regan Bradley, a pupil at St Brigid's RC Primary School in Manchester, upset the authorities by getting his hair styled with short sides and a combover - a style that wasn't uncommon in the much stricter schools of the 1950s. He has been threatened with increasingly severe 'behaviour sanctions' if the style is not changed - even though the cut does not obviously breach any school rules. Smart: Seven-year-old Regan Bradley, left, has been told off for his haircut at school - despite it being seen on schoolboys as far back as the 1950s, right . 'Not clear': Regan's parents, Peter and Kelly, say they do not understand why the cut is unacceptable . According to St Brigid's guidelines, tramlines, mohicans and gel are banned - along with anything deemed 'distracting'. Julie Miles, the headteacher of St Brigid's, threatened to drag the Bradley family into a meeting with the chair of the school governors over the controversial cut. But Regan's parents - beautician Kelly, 28, and father Peter- insist the style is 'just a normal haircut'. Ms Bradley said: 'Mrs Miles is saying his hair doesn’t comply with policy. But I don’t understand why and we’re not cutting it. 'It’s becoming so bad I’m thinking of taking him out.' Celeb lookalike? The combover style has also gained celebrity followers recently, including The Only Way Is Essex star Mark Right, pictured right last year . Rules: St Brigid's RC Primary School in Manchester has regulations against many hair styles . Mr Bradley added: 'They are saying it needs to be the same length all over, but that’s a bowl cut and we’re not doing that. 'It is our decision how Regan has his hair, we are his parents, so it is unfair to keep picking on him.' Mrs Miles said: 'Regan is a lovely little boy who is liked by all the staff and who always wants to do his best. 'Our uniform and appearance policy - which is linked to our behaviour policy - provides parents with clear guidelines on what is acceptable in terms of hair styles and what isn't. 'Rules are applied fairly and consistently throughout the school and are not bent for individual children.'","Regan Bradley got smart combover - but was told it breached school rules .

"It is one of the great mysteries of astronomy - a giant body, believed to lie somewhere beyond the orbit of Pluto, . Dubbed 'Planet X', Nemesis or Tyche, it was believed that this mysterious large planet or small star might periodically pass through outer comets, sending them flying towards Earth and causing mass extinction. However, researchers today admitted it may not exist after an exhaustive search of hundreds of millions of objects. An artist's impression of Pluto: Researchers had theorized about the existence of a large, but unseen celestial body called Planet X and suspected to lie somewhere beyond the orbit of Pluto. Researchers previously had theorized about the existence of this large, but unseen celestial body, suspected to lie somewhere beyond the orbit of Pluto. In addition to 'Planet X,' the body had garnered other nicknames, including 'Nemesis' and 'Tyche.' Previous speculations about this hypothesized body stemmed in part from geological studies that suggested a regular timing associated with mass extinctions on Earth. The idea was that a large planet or small star hidden in the farthest reaches of our solar system might periodically sweep through bands of outer comets, sending them flying toward our planet. The Planet X-based mass extinction theories were largely ruled out even prior to the new WISE study. 'The outer solar system probably does not contain a large gas giant planet, or a small, companion star,' said Kevin Luhman of the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds at Penn State University, University Park, Pa., author of a paper in the Astrophysical Journal describing the results. However, the team admit their research was not wasted - and say they found several thousand new residents in our sun's 'backyard,' consisting of stars and cool bodies called brown dwarfs. 'Neighboring star systems that have been hiding in plain sight just jump out in the WISE data,' said Ned Wright of the University of California, Los Angeles, the principal investigator of the mission. The second WISE study, which concentrated on objects beyond our solar system, found 3,525 stars and brown dwarfs within 500 light-years of our sun. 'We're finding objects that were totally overlooked before,' said Davy Kirkpatrick of NASA's Infrared and Processing Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. Kirkpatrick is lead author of the second paper, also in the Astrophysical Journal. Some of these 3,525 objects also were found in the Luhman study, which catalogued 762 objects. This infrared WISE image shows a star-forming cloud 20,000 light years away that is teeming with gas, dust and massive newborn stars. The inset reveals the centre of the cloud, a cluster of stars called NGC 3603 . Despite the large number of new solar neighbors found by WISE, ""Planet X"" did not show up. Previous speculations about this hypothesized body stemmed in part from geological studies that suggested a regular timing associated with mass extinctions on Earth. The idea was that a large planet or small star hidden in the farthest reaches of our solar system might periodically sweep through bands of outer comets, sending them flying toward our planet. The Planet X-based mass extinction theories were largely ruled out even prior to the new WISE study. Other theories based on irregular comet orbits had also postulated a Planet X-type body. The new WISE study now argues against these theories as well. Both of the WISE searches were able to find objects the other missed, suggesting many other celestial bodies likely await discovery in the WISE data. 'We think there are even more stars out there left to find with WISE. 'We don't know our own sun's backyard as well as you might think,' said Wright. WISE was put into hibernation upon completing its primary mission in 2011. In September 2013, it was reactivated, renamed NEOWISE and assigned a new mission to assist NASA's efforts to identify the population of potentially hazardous near-Earth objects. NEOWISE will also characterize previously known asteroids and comets to better understand their sizes and compositions.","Astronomers believed Planet X might periodically sweep through bands of outer comets .

"A headmaster has revealed the 'semi-literate' job applications he received from state school teachers vying for a post at his top boarding school. Among the spelling mistake-ridden CVs received by Richard Cairns were boasts that one history teacher liked 'to see a student bossom' (sic), while a chemistry teacher gave his date of birth as 1053. Mr Cairns, the headmaster at leading private school Brighton College, was so appalled at the poor standards displayed by candidates for the post of assistant headteacher that he has made details of their applications public. Standards: Brighton College headmaster Richard Cairns said that of the 30 job applications he received from state school teachers for a job at his school, 12 were 'semi-literate' Among the 50 CVs and covering letters Mr Cairns received, 30 were from state school teachers. Just one state school teacher was among the final eight candidates, and he did not get the job. Mr Cairns told The Sunday Times: 'Of the 30 from state schools, 12 were semi-literate. These are serving teachers and this is really worrying.' The headmaster said the spelling errors, coupled with the low standard of academic qualifications achieved by many of the applicants, showed the failings of many teachers working in state schools. He questioned how such candidates with low A-level grades and third-class university degrees could impart basic education to children and called for the . introduction of minimum standards which potential staff must meet before . they are allowed to teach. Candidates: Among the applicants for the assistant headteacher position at the Sussex school, pictured, was a teacher who said he liked 'to see a student bossom' Mr Cairns also said that many . teachers between 25 and 40 who had themselves been taught in state . schools had never been taught basic grammar, spelling, and sentence . structure. Among the CVs received was one from a . chemistry teacher, who used the word 'form' instead of 'from' when . describing how long he had been a teacher, wrote that he had been born . in 1053 and included two pages documenting his experience of flying a . single-engine aircraft. He also wrote about being a keen sailor three times in his application. Others had poor qualifications, . including C,D, and E grades at A-level, with one hoping to land the post . despite having achieved just five O-levels and a typing certificate. One candidate wrote his application in block capitals, while a woman teacher said . her skills involved 'diversity and cultural competence'. A . history teacher wrote that he 'liked to see a student bossom', while . other letters addressed Mr Cairns as 'Mr Richard', or simply 'Cairns'. Mr Cairns said that he would like to . see a minimum standard introduced in which teachers had achieved at . least three B grades at A-level, and a 2:1 degree in their chosen . teaching subject. Last week a new international study revealed that British pupils lag behind leading nations including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese city of Shanghai. The . study was carried out as part of the Programme for International . Student Assessment (PISA), and focused on applied skills rather than . theoretical knowledge. The findings show that the UK's . average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, roughly . average for all countries and on a par with the Czech Republic, France . and Norway. Results: Although students from Brighton College regularly celebrate getting top A-level grades (pictured last year), some of the teachers applying for a job at the school had not done so well in their exams . Britain did better in science with an above-average 514 points, similar to Australia, Ireland and Slovenia. Official figures have shown that . one-in-five of state secondary school maths teachers in England do not . have a maths degree, with the same being true of 34 per cent of physics . teachers. A spokesman for . the Department for Education said that a record number of high-achieving . graduates are now applying to become teachers. 'We . are reforming teacher training to attract the best graduates and . professionals, investing £4m in professionals, investing £4m in . professional development for existing teachers and reforming pay so . schools can attract the best teacher who have the greatest impact on . their pupil's achievements,' he said.

"Barack Obama has come perilously close to endorsing the fast-growing Occupy Wall Street protests. The President today said those holding sit-ins and rallies in New York and across the U.S. are expressing the frustrations of Americans over Wall Street practices and economic inequality. The protests have slowly grown in size . and attention over the last three weeks and now President Obama said he . understands the public's concerns about how the nation's financial . system works. Scroll down for video . Frustrated protesters: President Obama, pictured today, said those holding it-ins and rallies are expressing the frustrations over Wall Street practices and economic inequality of the Americans . Address: President Obama speaks during a press conference in the East Room of the White House . ‘It expresses the frustrations that the . American people feel that we had the biggest financial crisis since the . Great Depression - huge collateral damage all throughout the country,’ he said. ‘And yet you're still seeing some of the . same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack . down on abusive practices that got us into this problem in the first . place.’ 'It expresses the frustrations that . the American people feel that we had the biggest financial crisis since . the Great Depression - huge collateral damage all throughout the . country' President Barack Obama . Around 5,000 protesters marched . yesterday in Manhattan, joined by union leaders who say they will . continue to support the protests with manpower and donations of goods . and services. President Obama said the U.S. needs a strong and effective financial sector for the economy to grow, and that the financial regulation bill he championed ensures tougher oversight of the financial industry. He launched an onslaught against banks on Thursday over rising fees and efforts to block financial reform, tapping into public anger to garner support for his 2012 re-election campaign. ‘I think people are frustrated and the protesters are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works,’ Mr Obama said. Human figure: Protesters often chant 'We are the 99 per cent', contrasting themselves with America's wealthiest one per cent, and about 1,000 people formed a sign in Washington's Freedom Plaza on Thursday . Washington: Participants march with signs past the White House to the Chamber of Commerce in a protest . ‘It can't be competing on the basis of hidden fees, deceptive practices or, you know, derivative cocktails that nobody understands and that exposed the entire economy to enormous risks.’ During his White House news conference . today, President Obama continued a sales pitch for his $447 billion jobs . package, saying it was necessary to avoid another recession. 'I think people are frustrated and the . protesters are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how . our financial system works' President Barack Obama . But Republicans say the proposal - a mix of stimulus spending and tax cuts for workers and small businesses plus an end to some tax breaks for corporations and the rich - will never pass as a whole. President Obama added that he is 'comfortable' with the millionaire's surtax being debated in the Senate as one of the ways to pay for his plan to create jobs. 'In order to deal with the jobs bill, we're still going to have to reform the tax code to make sure that we're closing loopholes,' he said. The protesters have varied causes and no apparent demands, but have spoken largely about unemployment and economic inequality, reserving most of their criticism for Wall Street. Message: Protesters 'occupied' Freedom Plaza in Washington D.C. today as the nation's capital had its first major demonstration against rising inequality since the Occupy Wall Street movement started . Preparations: Protesters rally during Occupy DC in Washington D.C. on Thursday, with the Capitol in view . ‘We are the 99 per cent,’ they chant, contrasting themselves with America’s wealthiest one per cent. ‘The great thing about Occupy Wall Street is that they have brought the focus of the entire country on the middle class majority,’ said George Aldro, 62, a member of United Auto Workers. ‘We're in it together, and we're in it for the long haul,’ he said during a march in Manhattan. 'We're in it together, and we're in it for the long haul' George Aldro, 62, United Auto Workers . Ed Figueroa, a janitor in a public school in the Bronx, New York, and part of the Service Employees International Union, said the march was ‘the first time in these weeks that unions have shown their face.’ ‘But it won't be the last time,’ he added. The unions were donating food, blankets and office space to the protesters, said Dan Cantor, head of the Working Families Party. But he said the young protesters would continue to head their own efforts. The movement lacks an identified leader and decisions are made during group meetings. Shouting: Gene Levine speaks to a crowd as he takes part in a protest on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee, to draw attention to concerns over Wall Street practices and economic inequality . ‘They're giving more to us than we're giving to them,’ Mr Cantor said. ‘They're a shot in the arm to everybody.’ 'We are here to support this movement . against Wall Street's greed. We support the idea that the . rich should pay their fair share' 1199 Service Employees International Union . Victor Rivera, a vice president for the 1199 Service Employees International Union for health care workers, said the union had donated ‘all the food they need for this entire week’ to the protesters. ‘We are here to support this movement against Wall Street's greed,’ he said. ‘We support the idea that the rich should pay their fair share.’ Late on Wednesday, some demonstrators marched toward the New York Stock Exchange but were stopped by police about two blocks away. Police said 23 arrests were made - mostly for disorderly conduct. One person was arrested for assaulting an officer, who police said was pushed off his scooter. Videos show demonstrators clashing with police, screaming expletives and swelling toward uniformed officers, trying to break a police line. Get back: Police use batons to push back the protesters at a run in during a march through the Wall St area . A captain in a white shirt swung a baton at the group as several people click photos. Police spokesman Paul Browne said the . line charged at officers after they were told not to do so. ‘Those . officers have a right to defend themselves,’ he said. No injuries were . reported. 'They're basically saying that somehow . the government is supposed to take from those that have succeeded and . give to those who want to protest' Herman Cain . Another officer used pepper spray under similar circumstances, Mr Browne said. According to the patrol guide, officers are allowed to use such instruments in order to defend themselves. The Occupy Wall Street protests started on September 17 with a few dozen demonstrators who tried to pitch tents in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Since then, hundreds have set up camp nearby in Zuccotti Park and have become increasingly organized, lining up medical aid and legal help and printing their own newspaper. On Saturday, about 700 people were arrested and given disorderly conduct summonses for spilling into the roadway of the Brooklyn Bridge, despite warnings from police. Taken away: A protester is arrested in front of Wall Street, after the largest number yet of protesters went on unpermitted marches around the Wall Street area on Wednesday . A group of those arrested filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying officers lured them into a trap before arresting them. Video shows officers using bullhorns to try and tell the group to get off the road. Several Democratic lawmakers have expressed support for the protesters, but some Republican presidential candidates have rebuked them. ‘They're basically saying that somehow the government is supposed to take from those that have succeeded and give to those who want to protest,’ the former pizza-company executive said. ‘That's not the way America was built,’ he added, at a book signing in St. Petersburg, Florida. On Tuesday, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney called the protest ‘class warfare’. Activists have been showing solidarity with the movement in many cities, including Los Angeles in California, Boston in Massachusetts, Seattle in Washington and Providence in Rhode Island. Many protesters are college students. Hundreds walked out of classes in New York, some in a show of solidarity for the Wall Street movement - but many more concerned with worries closer to home.","President says sit-ins and rallies show frustrations of American public .

"Former Prime Minister John Major has praised the'guts and drive' shown by immigrants . John Major has praised immigrants for having Tory instincts – and said most do not come here for benefits. The former prime minister said immigrants had the ‘guts and drive’ to travel vast distances to Britain’s shores to make life better for themselves and their families. He said this desire to improve their lives was a ‘very Conservative instinct’ of wanting to improve their lives. And he said that, in his experience, not all immigrants came to the UK ‘to benefit from our social security system’, he said. The welcoming tone is in stark contrast to that used by the current incumbent of Number 10, David Cameron. The Prime Minister wants to see the number of immigrants brought down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands. He has also pledged to fight for a renegotiation of our relationship with the EU, to give us more powers over our borders and to crack down on benefit tourism. Sir John also revealed that he knew the day after he won the 1992 election that he would go on to lose the next one five years later. He made his comments during an interview with the historian Peter Hennessy for the BBC Radio 4 programme, Reflections. The former Tory leader was talking about his time as a young man when he lived in modest circumstances with his family in Brixton, south London. ‘There was a different social value placed on immigration,’ said Sir John. ‘I saw immigration at very close quarters in the 1950s. ‘They shared my house. They were my neighbours. I played with them as boys. I didn't see people who had come here just to benefit from our social system. I saw people with guts and the drive to travel halfway across the world in many cases to better themselves and their families. ‘And I think that is a very Conservative instinct.’ Scroll down for video . David Cameron has taken a hard line on immigration - vowing to reduce the net figure to below 100,000. But the Prime Minister looks set to miss his target after a surge in European immigration . Sir John's remarks are in stark contrast to Conservative election campaigns since he lost the 1997 election to Tony Blair. Lord Howard faced criticism for his campaign against Labour immigration policies in 2005 . In the programme, Sir John also admits that he knew as early as 1992 that he would not win the 1997 general election. ‘The day after the 1992 general election, Chris Patten [the Conservative chairman] and I sat in the White Room at Number 10,’ he said. ‘Chris had lost his seat at Bath. And we agreed that in winning a fourth successive term, we had stretched the democratic elastic as far as it would go, and unless Labour collapsed, we would have little chance of winning the next election. He said that after the pound dropped out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992: ‘I was never sure whether I should have resigned or not’, he said. ‘I asked the views of people I respected like Douglas Hurd and I think Norman Fowler and also people who were not politicians about whether I should resign, and their view was unequivocally that I shouldn’t and that if a Prime Minister did resigns a few months after winning an election that the government itself was doomed. Now whether that was the right decision to stay on or not, I was never certain. ‘I was never in any doubt that winning the 1997 election would be very difficult. I was reinforced in that view by the impact of Black Wednesday, I thought it overwhelmingly likely that we would have lost. ‘In one sense it was liberating. It meant I could go and do, as Sarah Hogg [his Policy Unit head], for one, repeatedly said to me, you can do what you think is right. ‘You don’t have to politically trim. You can do what you think is right and economically we did.’ Sir John said his party was ‘so difficult’ over Europe, because the previous generation of Conservatives who had lived through two world wars and believed in peace in Europe at all costs were replaced by younger Conservatives who had grown up in ‘more ideological’ age. He said Margaret Thatcher went into the ERM because the recession of the late 1980s saw inflation and unemployment soar. He said the idea she was pushed into joining was ‘utterly, utterly false’. Sir John revealed that Tony Blair’s reforms to the health service were ‘the sort of thing I wished to do from the first moment I dreamed of going into politics’. ‘I shall live with regret to my dying day that I did not have the wherewithal, and was not in a political position, to go down the route of those reforms which were the sort of things I wished to do from the first moment I dreamed of going into politics,’ he said. The former leader said he would also have liked to increase teachers’ pay and build more inner-city homes.","Former Prime Minister's tone in stark contrast to David Cameron's rhetoric .

"Uniting nations: A quarter of UK babies have a father born abroad . One in four British babies has a father born in a different country, figures released ahead of Father's Day show. The report shows 171,000 - 24 per cent - of children born in England and Wales in 2011 had a foreign-born father. The main birthplace for foreign fathers is Pakistan, followed by Poland, India and Bangladesh. When both mothers and fathers are taken . into account, almost a third of all babies, 31 per cent, had at least one parent born . abroad, according to the Office for National Statistics. This is a substantial rise on the . figure in 2000, when just 21.2 per cent of babies had at least one . non-British-born father or mother. The statistics also show that some . 131,288 children had two foreign-born parents – 18.1 per cent of the . total number of births in 2011. The figures show that 64.9 per cent of babies born in London in 2011 had either one or two parents born outside the UK. The . next highest percentages were seen in the West Midlands, where 28.7 per . cent had at least one foreign parent; the South East, 27.7 per cent; . and the East of England, which covers counties to the north and east of . the capital, 26.9 per cent. At the other end of the scale, the . figure in the North East was 13.1 per cent, and 14 per cent in Wales. In . Scotland, it was 18.3 per cent. David Green, from the centre-right . think-tank Civitas, said earlier this year: ‘The irresponsible actions of the last . government have played havoc with public services, leading to serious . harm especially in the NHS, and serious harm in the schools system. ‘Maternity . units are in crisis, there are huge pressures on school places, and . housing is under even more pressure that it otherwise would have been.’ Mixed capital: In London, 64.9 per cent of babies born in 2011 had either one or two parents born abroad . A spokesman for the Office for National Statistics said that in 2000, the proportion of babies in England and Wales born to at least one foreign-born parent was 21.2 per cent. Not all births are necessarily to parents who live in Britain permanently, as some could be people who travel to the UK to take advantage of its free NHS. In March, a leading surgeon, Professor Meirion Thomas, said the UK was becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’ as people travel here simply to give birth. Years of high immigration levels have put intolerable pressure on maternity units because the number of births has been  far higher than officials had  predicted. There is currently a shortage of more than 3,000 midwives in the NHS.","A quarter of babies born in 2011 had a foreign-born father .

"Getting kids looking spick and span and sitting still for a family portrait is never an easy task but it's even tougher when you have to do it with baby orangutans. But renowned wildlife photographer Mitsuaki Iwago managed to wrangle this cheeky group together long enough to take these photographs. The 62-year-old snapper travelled all the way to Borneo from his home in Tokyo, Japan, to meet these rehomed orphans - aged one to three - who, in the absence of their parents, have learned to love each other as siblings. These orphaned orangutans were photographed at a rescue centre in Borneo. Although they have lost their parents, that have bonded as if they were siblings . Mr Iwago, who spent the trip photographing orangutans both in the wild and - as with the orphans - at the Orangutan Foundation International rescue centre, said: 'I decided to visit Borneo because I heard the main habitat for these rare animals, the forest, has been disappearing rapidly due to deforestation. 'I wanted to see how they live in the wild with my own eyes. 'Because of the fast pace of deforestation activities, the total number of wild orangutans has been decreasing rapidly. 'At the same time the number of orphans, who have seen their habitat being destroyed, has been increasing dramatically. 'Orangutans are peaceful animals who love to live quietly. Deforestation has destroyed the animals' homes and decimated their population . A baby orangutan studies its mother's mouth, learning how she uses it to perform different tasks. It can take up to eight years for a mother to fully raise her young . 'Although there are community activities, they always strive to avoid unnecessary social tensions. 'As I press the shutter of my camera, I wish the forest, which has provided orangutans with a safe and abundant environment since time immemorial, remains a place where future generations can prosper and live in peace.' Over the last 60 years, Borneo's orangutan population has fallen by more than half, with less than 69,000 being left on the island. In just the last two decades, the rainforests where the animals live have been stripped back by 55 per cent. Mr Iwago also photographed a young orangutan observing his mother's mouth at Tanjung Putting National Park. He said: 'An infant always plays with their mother's mouth and observe how they use it to accomplish various tasks. These cute and moving pictures were taken by famous Japanese wildlife photographer Mitsuaki Iwago . 'It takes about 6 to 8 years for a female orangutan to raise an infant. 'They build comfortable nest structure in the forest canopy, and stay together living a quiet and peaceful life until the babies become independent. 'It is fairly uncommon to encounter a group with several babies in the wild.' The Orangutan Foundation International was established in 1986 by conservationist Dr Birute Mary Galdikas, who has experience in forest and orangutan protection. She wanted to protect the animals who have become orphans as a result of deforestation.","Orphaned orangutans lost their parents due to deforestation .

"Double Standards: Stephen Twigg attacked free schools but called one in his Liverpool constituency 'inspiring' Labour frontbenchers were branded hypocrites last night after denouncing the Government’s free schools while backing them in their own constituencies. At least 21 Labour MPs are supporting free schools in their local areas – including four members of the Shadow Cabinet and another six Labour frontbenchers. Teaching unions have opposed free schools, which are set up by teachers and parents, because they are not subject to many local authority controls. And Labour MPs have largely fallen into line behind the union position. Earlier this month at the TUC, Ed Miliband attacked Education Secretary Michael Gove’s free school ‘experiment’, saying: ‘We have been absolutely clear that we are not going to have new free schools under a Labour government.’ And education spokesman Stephen Twigg, who will address the Labour conference tomorrow, has confirmed he would prevent any more being set up if his party wins the 2015 election. Referring to free schools in June, he dismissed them with the remark: ‘We don’t like them.’ But Mr Twigg sang a different tune when he hailed the Everton Free School in his own Liverpool constituency as ‘inspiring’. Similarly, Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham attended the ‘founders’ ceremony’ for the Atherton Community free school in his Leigh constituency near Manchester – despite calling such schools ‘freaky’. The party’s justice spokesman Sadiq Khan has also enthusiastically supported a free school in Tooting, south London. And Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman proudly advertised the ‘new facilities’ of such a school in her London constituency on her website. Mixed messages: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham went to the founders' ceremony of a school near his constituency in Leigh . Ed Miliband’s opposition to free schools did not stop his personal aide Karen Buck, the MP for Westminster North, praising the ARK Atwood Free School in her seat as ‘welcome’. She said it will make ‘an important contribution to the continuing improvement of standards’. As well as this, Sharon Hodgson, one of the party’s education spokesmen, said she was ‘pleased that parents and children are now able to take up places at Grindon Hall’ – a free school in her Washington and Sunderland West constituency. Labour’s most influential backbencher Margaret Hodge, who runs the Commons Public Accounts Committee – the Westminster spending watchdog – has previously attacked free schools as ‘vanity projects’. But Mrs Hodge led a campaign for a free school in Barking, east London, demanding £25million of funding to give the children in her constituency ‘the best possible education’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, joined Mr Gove at the opening of the Krishna Avanti free school in Leicester. And frontbencher Stephen Timms has welcomed not one but two new free schools in East Ham – the Oasis Academy Silvertown and the London Academy of Excellence. A source close to Mr Gove, who championed the free schools programme, said: ‘This sort of shameless hypocrisy is exactly why people hate politicians. 'Miliband and Twigg should drop their official opposition to free schools and tell their union paymasters that raising school standards is now their priority.’","Senior Labour figures have repeatedly attacked free schools .

"Human rights judges yesterday saved British taxpayers from a multi-million pound compensation bill in a ruling on prisoner voting. The European court said it was wrong to deny inmates the vote but refused to order damages to be paid out to them. The decision came after ten UK inmates had argued their human rights were breached by not being allowed to vote in the 2009 Euro elections. Judges also deprived ambulance-chasing lawyers of the chance of a fat pay day by dismissing their claims for costs in bringing the case. The European Court of Human Rights in the French city of Strasbourg has ruled that Britain's blanket ban on prisoners voting is illegal . They declared that the prisoners ‘only needed to fill in an application form’ and ‘did not need legal assistance’. This decision lifts the threat of huge payouts for more than 1,000 claims thought to be in the pipeline which are now unlikely to be brought. However, the ruling on voting re-enforces a 2004 verdict that the UK’s blanket ban on convicted prisoners taking part in elections violated the European Convention on Human Rights. Upholding this basic principle means that the row over prisoner voting will continue to dog David Cameron. It has become symbolic of the power struggle between Parliament and the European Court of Human Rights, and will add to Tory pressure for a showdown. Chris Grayling (left), the Justice Secretary,wants MPs to decide whether or not to keep the ban on prisoners voting; Paul Firth (right) the perverted Scout leader and former deputy headmaster jailed in 2003 . Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that the court’s interference has persuaded Home Secretary Theresa May to advise Mr Cameron that Britain must withdraw from the Convention, which it exists to enforce. Sources close to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said Labour’s Human Rights Act, which makes European rights part of British law, would be repealed if the Tories win next year’s election. ‘Decisions like these should be made in this country,’ they said. ‘A Tory government will make wholesale changes to human rights laws so this kind of decision will be taken by Parliament – not an international court.’ The latest twist in the battle over prisoners came after seven judges ruled that ten men held in Scottish jails were wrongly barred from the 2009 poll. Two judges had dissented, condemning the court’s thinking as a mess and insisting there was nothing wrong with the UK law. They added the prisoners were wrong not to disclose details of their sentences to the court. But the two were in a minority and the Strasbourg court reiterated its condemnation of the centuries-old British practice of barring prisoners from voting. On rejecting any compensation, they declared that the satisfaction of having their complaint upheld was enough of a remedy for the ten inmates. The refusal to pay legal costs chiefly affected Taylor and Kelly, solicitors based in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. The firm has been involved in a number of claims over the issue. In 2004, the first test case on prisoner voting, involving axe killer John Hirst, forced the Government to pay nearly £10,000 in legal costs. During a second major case in 2010, the Strasbourg court offered £4,000 in legal costs to two other Scottish prisoners represented by Taylor and Kelly. The row with Europe has troubled both Labour and Tory governments. Successive Prime Ministers have stood by the ban and it has been endorsed by MPs in repeated debates and votes, most recently in 2011. Yesterday the Ministry of Justice said any decision on whether prisoners can vote will remain a matter for British MPs. Eurosceptic Tories said the court had made a political retreat in the face of warnings of a UK withdrawal from EU institutions. Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said the decision was ‘a rare outbreak of commonsense from this federalist court’.","European Court of Human Rights says blanket prisoner voting ban illegal .

"Believe it or not, this rather angry-looking doll is supposed to be Prince George – and it was sold on eBay for over £1,600. The life-sized ‘replica’ was modelled on photographs of the newborn prince when he left hospital last year. Known as a ‘reborn’, it is one of hundreds of spooky dolls that have been made and sold around the world. Spot the difference: The Prince George 'reborn' doll which sold for £1,650 on eBay... and the real baby (right) Unsettling: The doll - not a toy - came with a King in Training clothes set and an Aden & Anais muslin . It was snapped up on eBay for £1,650, complete with a ‘King in Training’ clothes set and an Aden & Anais muslin which the Prince wore as he left hospital. The babies are not toys and are made using soft silicone to make them look and feel as lifelike as possible. Reborn artists have specialist shops around the UK where they craft the dolls to look like real human babies. Customers are usually adult women who pay up to £2,500 for a popular model.

On her website she wrote: 'Visitors are very welcome to call to my nursery and see the Prince for cuddles. Orders can be secured with £60 deposit or a payment in full of just £199.' She adds: 'Each and every doll I make is special, unique and individual… just like real babies.

P90X, the extreme fitness regime, blends exercise, yoga and martial arts moves in order to prevent the body from adapting to one type of workout . He leads workouts with about 'a dozen' or so others on Capitol Hill every morning . Paul Ryan's so-called 'energy and vision' has helped him become Mitt Romney's new vice-presidential running mate. And it seems that the 42-year-old who will join the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2012 White House race gets his fighting spirit from P90X, an extreme fitness regime he is devoted to. Mr Ryan, a father-of-three from Janesville, Wisconsin, has just six to eight per cent body fat thanks to the workout, which aims to confuse muscles by blending exercise, yoga and martial arts moves. The six-foot-two politician was inspired to stay fit and healthy after finding his father dead in his bed in 1986 when Paul was just 16. The 55-year-old had suffered from a fatal heart attack. Strength: Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan (above) is a big fan of the extreme fitness regime known as P90X. The extremely intense workout blends yoga, exercise and martial arts . Fitness freak: Paul Ryan is seen above with P90X founder Tony Horton (left). The politician is a true devotee . The chairman of the House Budget Committee, who was announced as Mr Romney's running man just two days ago, is a former personal trainer who now weighs around 163lbs. The regime, which involves learning fitness moves from a video series, is broken down into a range of cardio activities, pull-ups, push-ups, karate and yoga. 'I'm kind of a skinny guy', he told Politico.com in March before revealing that he leads P90X workouts along with fellow politician Bart Stupak every morning on Capitol Hill. He added: 'There's about a dozen of us who do it... It's a fantastic workout.' Hard-core: The workout, seen above, was created by Tony Horton, an exercise instructor from Rhode Island . Extreme: Mr Ryan is a big fan of the regime and is said to lead a workout every morning at Capitol Hill . House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy is also said to take part in the daily workout which begins at 6am. Sounding like a true convert, Mr Ryan, who detailed that he drinks two cups of coffee every morning in addition to working out, said: 'It pushes your body in many different ways so that it gets out of its plateau. It has results. It works.' Founded by Tony Horton, an exercise instructor from Rhode Island, P90X is a home exercise system that aims to transform a person's body in just 90 days. Muscles confusion is said to prevent a person from adapting to exercise, which results in continuous fitness improvement. As the workout changes from day to day, he added that it offers a unique take on regular fitness routines. Mr Ryan wears a heart-rate monitor when he works out and aims to hit a target heart rate of 165 beats per minute. The . youngest of four children, Mr Ryan has also described the heartbreaking . moment when he discovered his father in bed . after he was struck by the heart attack. Team: Mr Romney announced his selection at a campaign rally at the Nauticus Museum (above) after touring the USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Virginia two days ago. The pair are on a four-day bus trip to key swing states . Overwhelming: Mr Ryan (left) was brought to tears at a campaign event in Waukesha, Wisconsin yesterday . Support: Mr Ryan was joined by his wife Janna (top right), daughter Liza (bottom middle), son Charles (bottom left) and son Sam (bottom right) during a welcome home rally yesterday . 'It was just a big punch to the gut,' he told The New Yorker magazine. 'I concluded I've for to either sink or swim in life.' The trauma of such a discovery had a severe impact on their entire family. Mr Ryan's mother, Elizabeth, was forced to go back to college to study interior design in order to support her children. His grandmother moved back into the family home in order to care for Mr Ryan and his siblings while their mother attended college. The politician now loves staying . active as much as he can and also enjoys deer hunting and skiiing, . revealing to CNN that at one stage of his life, he was forced to ditch a . chance to forge a professional career in skiing in order to pursue . politics. He even admitted that he 'sometimes' regrets the decision. More than three million copies of P90X have been sold since the program was created in 2004, raking in an estimated $420million. Active: Mr Ryan enjoys staying active and being outdoors. He is also a keen hunter (pictured) and skier . Along with DVD videos, the program comes with a nutrition guide, fitness plan and calendar. Mr Romney described Mr Ryan as man of integrity and character rooted in his middle-class Midwest upbringing as well as an intellectual leader at a time when the United States was in fiscal crisis. 'Paul is a man of tremendous character, . shaped in large part by his early life,' he said. 'Paul's father died . when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any . young man should. 'But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and . sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the . virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest. 'Paul Ryan works in Washington - but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in . Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose . integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good.' He praised Ryan's prowess in politics, . saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul Ryan, but I . don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and judgement.'

"Criticism: Popular broadcaster Stephen Fry has attacked critics of same sex marriage by claiming there are 260 species of animal which display gay tendencies  - but only humans are homophobic . Popular broadcaster Stephen Fry has attacked critics of same sex marriage by claiming there are 260 species of animal which display gay tendencies  - but only humans are homophobic. The author and actor also said that the Olympic and Paralympic games showed that Britain is an open and tolerant society which is not negative towards those who love each other. Fry was speaking during a new video for the Out4Marriage campaign, which supports changing the law to allow gay couples to marry. During the three-minute monologue, he said: 'At least 260 species of animal have been noted exhibiting homosexual behaviour but only one species of animal ever, so far as we know, has exhibited homophobic behaviour — and that’s the human being. 'So ask which is really natural.' During the video, Fry also accused the Church of England of listening to 'screeching' extremists who he claimed spread lies about same-sex marriage. He said those supporting gay marriage did not want to force religious leaders to carry out same sex marriage ceremonies if they did not believe in them. 'The most important thing for me is that a misconception is cleared up that equal rights for gay marriage are not about forcing priests or clerics of any religion to marry people in their churches if they do not want too, it is not about that,' he said. 'Those against gay marriage are somehow spreading this disinformation that we are going to say that ""you Reverend so and so are forced to hold this gay marriage in your church"", it is not true.' He added: 'There are other faiths like Quakers and Congregationalists and Unitarians and the Liberal Reform part of the Jewish faith who are actually extremely keen,' he said. 'They feel their communion won’t be complete unless it includes gay marriage because they believe in social justice and equality too. 'It’s wrong, in a country like ours, which has an established Church, just because their more extreme end is screeching with outrage at the idea of this, that we are not allowed to be married.' Scroll down for video . On the attack: Fry said only humans are homophobic - despite many species of animals being gay. This pair of male lions are pictured affectionately nuzzling each other . He said the Olympic and Paralympic Games proved that Britain is an open, generous and tolerant society which is diverse and 'full of love'. He said we celebrate our openness and tolerance and not ' be down on other people who love each other and are no threat to anybody else.' Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Joseph Musgrave, for the Out4Marriage campaign, said 'Stephen Fry has brought his own inimitable style to a point we have long sought to clarify. 'No religious group should be in any way forced to conduct or solemnise same-sex marriages.' A spokesman for the Church of England said  it would continue to debate same-sex marriage.

"A New York bus monitor who suffered relentless bullying from four middle school students has received more than $700,000 - raised by a Canadian man who was moved by her story. Karen Klein, of Greece, New York, received the money at a ceremony on Tuesday in Canada. The 68-year-old was tormented with profanity, insults and threats during a bus run as the school year wound down in June. Scroll down for videos (WARNING: DISTURBING CONTENT) Retirement fund: Karen Klein, right, was presented with a check for more than $700,000 by Max Sidorov, left, of Toronto, who said he was struck by her story . A 10-minute cellphone video taken by another student took on a life of its own on the internet and spawned an outpouring of $703,833 in donations for Klein from all over the world. The large novelty check was handed to her by 25-year-old Max Sidorov, a Toronto nutritionist with the help of fundraising site Indiegogo. Sidorov said that he two bullied as a student and started the drive with the goal of raising $5,000 to send Klein on vacation. But he couldn’t have expected the flood of financial support that came in, enough to send Klein on more than 140 vacations. An Indiegogo spokeswoman said that more than 30,000 people from 84 countries contributed to the fund. Victim: Regardless of the vacation she is yet to take, Klein said that the attention has already sent her all over North America . Tormented: Klein, 68, was taunted and . tormented by the middle school students in Greece, New York in a . difficult-to-watch 10-minute video. She can be seen wiping away her tears in the footage . Unacceptable: At one point, a student says: 'If I . stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like . butter, because it’s all f***** lard' Regardless of the vacation she is yet to take, Klein said on Tuesday that the attention has already sent her all over North America. She told CBC News: 'I came [to Canada]. I went to New York City to be on the Today Show; I went to Boston to be on a radio show.' Klein told the network that she visited New Orleans on country singer Tim McGraw’s dime, and took a trip to California 'thanks to Anderson Cooper.' The video shows Klein trying to ignore a stream of profanity, insults and threats from the seventh-grade boys. One of the students can be heard saying: 'If I stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** lard.' At one point, she even breaks down in tears. Retiring: Bus monitor Karen Klein, who was cruelly bullied by four seventh-graders,  says she is planning to retire . The four middle school students were suspended for a year, and have been barred from regular bus transportation.In an interview with the Associated Press in July, Klein said the punishment was ‘fine with me.' Klein said they'll still be going to an alternative school - 'they won't be just sitting at home doing nothing.' She said that the best part of her ordeal going public, and the resulting school action, 'is that they have to do community service - for senior citizens.' The Greece, New York, grandmother has since retired. Klein said that her decision to leave the job she held for three years was tough but wasn't based on her now infamous encounter with the mean-spirited seventh-graders. Speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday, Klein said: 'When you’re an adult and you get bullied, that’s one thing. I can handle it, but children can't.

The triennial show began in 2000 with entries representing 35 cities from 14 countries. Now, more than 100 cities from 25 countries are taking part and their entries will be on display in the Canadian city until September 29. The stunning array of designs feature 22,000 plant species and cultivars in ten exhibition greenhouses and 30 themed gardens. These hulking gorillas are made from living and growing plants with their chests, hands, feet and faces moulded out of plastic as an addition to the design . The competition may remind some of the spectacular creations made by Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands in the 1990 Tim Burton film . The theme for this year's event was Land of Hope, with entrants asked to incorporate something from their own country with an environmental concern such as an endangered species . A family of monkeys is seen gathered on one mound where the artist has also brought in giant leaves to recreate the animals' environment in Montreal . The theme for this year's event is Land of Hope, which asks competitors to design something that represents either nature in the city, endangered species or ecosystems, peace, positive action to help the environment or how man and nature are dependent on one another. Charles Lapointe, president and CEO of Tourisme Montréal, said: 'I am absolutely thrilled that show has returned to make Montréal blossom in 2013. 'It goes without saying that the beauty of these original works by talented horticultural artists will not only captivate local Montrealers, but will also serve to attract visitors from around the world.' The endless 50ft designs - including a chameleon, frog, family of chimpanzees, water buffalo and herds of animals - will become a key attraction in the city for the summer. A line of lemurs with with their distinctive bright eyes has been carved from foliage for this entry, likely to have been submitted by Madagascar . Some artists created plants out of plants, with this entry showcasing tall flowers with large petals and leaves on their stem . A frog looks to be basking in the spray from a water jet among the exhibits, which are on show until the end of September . An chameleon's tail curls as it hangs out on a tree branch with different leaves and paint picked to show its ever-changing colours . Mosaïcultures Internationales is a chance for the representatives from parks, gardens and green spaces around the world to exchange ideas as well as a competition and exhibition. All the entries must match up to standards for sustainable development and can promote an attraction within their cities. Organisers predict that more than a million people will visit the displays, which are expected to bring in about $46million to the province of Quebec. They say that mosaiculture is different from topiary because artists create something new out of foliage and plants, whereas topiary involves pruning shrubs into shape. This entry brought the sea bed into a flowerbed with this fish's bright orange fins among the greenery . A horticulturalist designed a horse for this entry, with the large eyes and ear added on to the plants and foliage used for the head and mane . A Highland cow creation looks a long way from home in the Montreal display, looking like it's enjoying bathing time in the water . A resting shepherd and his flock sit atop a carpet of shale in this entry. Contestants were asked to include examples of man and nature being interdependent as part of the Land of Hope theme . A loyal sheepdog joins its master for the design, incorporating leaves in many different shades for the shepherd's trousers, cloak and hat . Artists were free to interpret the Land of Hope theme from looking at how humans interact with nature to highlighting endangered animals or ways to protect the planet . The wide eyes of this colourful creature peer out from long blades of grass in another entry, part of the mosaiculture competition in Montreal . Some sculptures stand as high as 50ft depending on how ambitious the horticulturalists were with their subjects .",The Mosaïcultures Internationales de Montréal show sees more than 100 plant creations from 25 countries .
"A pastor at a mega-church has been dismissed after allegations that he committed a grave ‘sin’ with a 16-year-old female church member. Dr Jack Schaap, 54, had been pastor of the First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years, but was let go after a deacon saw a text on Schaap’s phone from the teenager, allegedly with a picture of the two of them kissing. A board of deacons from the church voted to fire him, according to a public release from the church ‘due to a sin that has caused him to forfeit his right to be our pastor.’ In a sombre meeting at the church on Wednesday night, the Board of Deacons said the shamed father-of-two confessed to having an affair with the young woman - a member of the church - when she was just 16. Dismissed: Dr Jack Schaap, who was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Hammond for more than a decade, was let go in August . Big city: Shaap's wife, Cindy, second left, is the daughter of famed Baptist Rev Jack Hyles; here, they're pictured in front of Chicago's Buckingham Fountain . Caught: A deacon of First Baptist Church saw a picture on Schaap's phone from a teenage girl; the picture allegedly showed the two kissing . Schaap had been counseling the teenage girl, one former member of First Baptist Trisha Kee told CBS Chicago. The church did not confirm Ms Kee's statement, but issued a statement explaining why they fired him: ‘Our church grieves the need to take this action and the impact it will have on our people,' the statement read. 'We ask that everyone pray for the families involved, and pray that the situation will be handled in a Christ-honoring manner.’ The legal age of consent in the state of Indiana is 16, the lowest age allowed in any state. Eddie Wilson, the director of public relations for the church, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the church is in the process of finding a new pastor to lead the congregation. He added that Schaap and his wife Cindy are currently in seclusion to work out their marital difficulties. Cindy Schaap is the daughter of the late founder of the church, Rev. Jack Hyles. The couple has two children. The deacons also felt it appropriate to turn Schaap’s case over to the authorities, ‘for the sake of transparency and honesty,’ and not because they believe the former pastor committed a crime. The Lake County Sheriff’s office is currently investigating along with the FBI. Schapp's published books include Marriage: The Divine Intimacy and Dating . with a Purpose: Common Sense Dating Principles for Couples, Parents, and . Youth Workers. The pastor has received his fair share of criticism over the years due to some of his more controversial teachings. Last year, he was chastized for his views on women, believing them to be an inferior species and saying husbands should take charge of their wives and blasted Eve as being the sinner. He also said it would be a 'cold day in hell before I get my theology from a woman', adding: 'Your soul is going to hell because of what Eve did.' Long-running: Schaap, pictured preaching from the church's pulpit, had been pastor there since 2001, but was dismissed after a vote from the deacons . Place of worship: The First Baptist Church is located in Hammond, Indiana, and is partially housed in the old federal court building; its auditorium sits 7,500 . Roots: Schaap, pictured left, is married to Cindy Schaap, the daughter of the late Rev Jack Hyles, right, who founded the First Baptist Church in Hammond . FBI spokesman Robert Ramsey told CBS: ‘It is too early at this point to release any further information.’ Typically, mega-churches have more than 2,000 members or regular attendees, with several areas to listen to sermons, often with one or more pastors speaking during a Sunday service. Mega-churches are houses of worship with 2,000 or more members and weekly attendees. They have grown in popularity in recent years, and are mostly a phenomenon of modern times. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, most current mega-churches were founded after 1955 after larger churches started to become more appealing to many church-goers. Many focus on ‘seeker services,’ which often offer little deep theology and instead appeal to sceptics and non-believers. They are also aimed at targeting younger audiences, often with the prospects of contemporary music and more casual settings than traditional churches. The denominations involved include Baptists, Methodists, and Nondenominational, as well as some Pentecostal churches. Many of them feature contemporary worship styles, with live music complete with worship band, and sometimes even an orchestra pit. Mega-churches have also received a fair amount of criticism, as some say they focus more on entertainment than on worship, and that large numbers detract the amount of time pastors can spend with the congregation. First Baptist itself is housed in the old federal courthouse building in Hammond, Indiana, and contains an auditorium that seats 7,500. Mr Wilson said that more than 15,000 people attend services at the weekend. Members of the mega-church have already expressed their shock at the pastor’s alleged actions. ‘The pastor been good to us,’ said Ronald Winston to WGN-TV. Mr Winston lives at the church’s mission. ‘He take care of the shelter. I don’t have no better opinion of him.’ Another member, Aranda White, said: ‘To me, he was teaching to word from the Bible. I have nothing bad to say about him.’ An informational meeting was held at the church at 7pm tonight to address the dismissal of Schaap, who has led the congregation since 2001. In the meeting of the congregation Wednesday night, church leaders said that Schaap admitted to having sex with one of the members of First Baptist Church when she was 16. The Times of Northwest Indiana reported that near the end of the meeting, Pastor Eddie Lapina said that he would serve as interim pastor as the church continues their search for a suitable replacement. Those filing out of the meeting bore grim faces, and few offered to comment for the paper. Those who did said that they would continue to pray for the family and for Schaap. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting. One member, Joseph Flores, said that he was feeling conflicted over the firing. ‘I’m glad to see they’re doing something,’ he told the Times, ‘but I hope they show the good he’s done for us, too. He straightened up this part of the city, and he’s done a lot for this community.’","Jack Schaap, 54, has been pastor at First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years .

"A blind father-of-two has seen his twin sons’ faces for the first time after a surgeon restored his sight - using one of his teeth. Ian Tibbetts, 43, first damaged his eye 16 years ago when a piece of scrap metal from an oven struck him in the right eye - ripping his cornea in six places. The wound healed but he suffered more problems and eventually lost the sight in his right eye in 1998. Ian Tibbetts, 43, lost his sight in 1999 and had never seen his twin sons . Callum and Ryan. Last December he had surgery on his left eye which used part of a tooth to help him regain 40 per cent vision in that eye . Before the pioneering surgery, Callum and Ryan only appeared blurry. Mr Tibbetts said: 'They were just shapes - I couldn't make them out. Now I have my independence back now and can start looking after the kids while my wife is at work' And just a year later, the former forklift truck driver had lost nearly all the remaining vision in his left eye. Before the pioneering surgery, Mr Tibbetts had never seen his four-year-old twins Callum and Ryan’s faces - instead seeing them as blurry shapes. But after the operation on his left eye - which he underwent in December last year - he has regained 40 per cent vision and can now see his children for the first time. Mr Tibbetts, who . lives in Telford, Shropshire, with his wife Alex, 35, and their twin . boys, agreed to have the revolutionary surgery other all other . treatments failed. The . procedure - called Osteo-Odonto-Keratoprosthesis (OOKP) - involves the . reconstruction of a new eye using a tiny plastic lens and one of the . patient’s own teeth. The lens is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth, which is later implanted in the eye. The treatment Mr Tibbetts had is only suitable for certain types of blindness and can only be performed by one surgeon in Britain - Christopher Liu (right) at the Sussex Eye Hospital in Brighton . The procedure - called Osteo-Odonto-Keratoprosthesis (OOKP) - involves the reconstruction of a new eye using a tiny plastic lens and one of the patient’s own teeth. The lens is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth, which is later implanted in the eye. And as long as the retina is still functioning, the lens then provides a new window through which the patient is able to see. Remarkably, because the tooth belongs to the patient, the body does not reject it.

He said: 'I have my independence back now and I can start looking after the children while my wife is out at work. 'Before, the kids were just shapes. I couldn’t make them out. I had to actually learn to tell them apart by their voices. I could tell whichever one it was by the way they spoke and sometimes by how quickly they moved. 'I had a picture in my head of what they looked like but they were better. I’m a bit biased there. 'The image in my mind was totally different to how they were. I gave them a big hug and a kiss. 'The sight doesn’t last forever so at the moment I am just taking each day as it comes and appreciating it. Mr Tibbetts said that before the operation, he had to tell his sons Callum (left) and Ryan (right) apart by their voices. He said: 'I had a picture in my head of what they looked like - but they were better' In 2009, Martin Jones, 42, told how he saw his wife for the very first time after going through OOKP surgery with Professor Liu. Martin . was blinded when a tub of molten aluminium exploded in his face and had . never seen care worker Gill, 50, who he married eight years after the . accident. Professor Liu said: 'OOKP is not guaranteed to restore sight but it does have a high success rate. 'Patients who have the surgery are often able to see immediately and the quality of sight can be extraordinarily good. 'However it is only suitable for certain types of blindness, specifically patients who have severe and irreversible corneal damage. The procedure - called Osteo-Odonto-Keratoprosthesis (OOKP) - involves the reconstruction of a new eye using a tiny plastic lens and one of the patient¿s own teeth. The lens is inserted into a hole drilled through the tooth, which is later implanted in the eye . 'It is a complex procedure and takes a good five years to master it. I began working on it in the mid-nineties under the tutelage of Giancarlo Falcinelli, the surgeon who perfected it. 'It was a big commitment and I had to learn Italian in order to work with him. 'But to be able to restore the sight of someone who has been blind for many years is an immense privilege.' Mr Tibbett's story of regaining his sight and seeing his twin boys’ faces for the first time will be shown in a BBC One documentary ‘The Day I Got My Sight Back’. The programme - . which will be shown at 10.35pm next Tuesday - was recorded over a . seven-month period last year and follows three of Professor Liu’s . patients.","Ian Tibbetts, 43, damaged his eye 16 years ago and went blind in 1999 .

"A former hostess at a Disneyland restaurant is suing Disney claiming the theme park would not allow her to serve customers while wearing her Muslim head scarf. In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Monday, Imane Boudlal alleges that when she turned up to work wearing her hijab she was told to remove it, work ‘backstage’ out of sight of customers or go home. The dispute dates back to 2010 when Boudlal, who worked at the Storyteller Café in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, learnt from her US citizenship exam that she could wear her hijab to work. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Imane Boudlal is suing Disney for allegedly refusing to let her work at Disneyland wearing her Muslim hijab. Right, she . wears the Disney-made bonnet she claims was provided to wear instead . of her headscarf . Having worked at the restaurant for two-and-a-half years, she then started wearing her hijab to work. However, whenever she did she was told to remove it, work away from customers or was sent home, the suit claims. She was sent home at least seven times without pay for wearing the headscarf to work, reported the OC Weekly. Boudlal’s managers offered her a bow-tie bonnet covered with a hat as a compromise but she refused saying that the hat made a ‘joke’ of both her and her religion. After refusing to wear the bonnet and turning down the ‘backstage’ work, Boudlal was suspended. She filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2010 and last week received a . notice of right to sue. Boudlal's . attorneys also claim that she was taunted the entire time she worked . there by her colleagues, who called her 'terrorist,' 'camel' and 'Kunta . Kinte,' the name of a slave in Alex Haley's novel, Roots. Harassed: Boudlal's attorneys also claim that she was taunted the entire time she worked at the Disneyland restaurant by her colleagues, who called her 'terrorist' and 'camel' Resort: Boudlal worked at the Storyteller Café in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel (pictured) in Anaheim . Boudlal told her managers about the abuse both orally and in writing, but the managers did nothing, her attorneys told the Los Angeles Times. Boudlal is being represented by her union, UNITE HERE Local 11, which has been in a bitter fight for years with Disneyland over an expired contract for hotel workers. Back in 2010, a Disney representative accused the union of distorting the facts in Boudlal's case to distract from the key issues in the contract fight. 'I don't understand why I cannot wear my white scarf that already matches my restaurant uniform, and be left to do my job,' she said to the OC Weekly. 'My scarf doesn't do anything to harm Disney or the guests.' This is not the first time that a Disney employee has insisted on wearing the hijab to work. In 2010, Noor Abdallah, then a 22-year-old intern from Chicago, agreed to wear a specially customised Disney-made bonnet as a compromise.

"Megan Ward, 19, from Birmingham has never been able to have an orgasm . A student has told of the frustration of living with a  condition called 'anorgasmia' - which leaves her unable to have an orgasm. Megan Ward, 19, has never reached sexual climax and has been unable to overcome the problem, despite receiving expert help. The condition is believed to be related to general anxiety and Megan says it has put her off sex entirely at certain times. Writing  on student website The Tab, she said: 'I have never, not once, not by myself, not with a partner, not with a vibrator, had an orgasm. 'I guess it's impossible to know what you're missing out on when you've never had one, so it's hard to want something you can't imagine.' After suffering for so long, Megan sought help from a sexual therapist last March. She said: 'Sex therapy is a specialised form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 'What you do is try to change some of what they call your 'maladaptive thinking patterns' towards sex. 'There are a whole host of reasons why women develop anorgasmia, and different ways of it manifesting. 'Some don't even get close to coming, and it's often a lack of stimulation which causes it (basically, the guy being bad in bed). 'This isn't the case with me. I have four different kinds of vibrators, I am very well stimulated, thank you. 'When I get close, it's like a wall is put up in my head and I involuntarily force all stimulation to stop. 'Everything that was turning me on suddenly repulses me and I just can't continue. 'Something subconsciously is telling me I can't have an orgasm, so the therapist will talk to me and try to 'rewire' my brain and how it thinks about sex.' Megan, pictured with a friend, was so frustrated with her inability to climax that starting visiting a sex therapist . Despite the therapy, the Birmingham student didn't make any progress and after eight sessions, she stopped going. 'My therapist had, at the start, been confident that I wasn't the one woman in 20 who never climaxes. 'But as the weeks went by, and nothing was getting better, we both got confused and frustrated. 'I was using the methods I had been told and it still wasn't happening. I was a failure. 'That was the only way I could see it. My body was meant to be able to do this apparently wonderful thing but it couldn't. 'The therapy, which worked for others, wasn't working for me, so I was a double failure. I couldn't handle that. I quit after eight sessions.' Megan completely lost her sex drive and it put an immense amount of pressure on her relationship. He boyfriend stuck with her throughout the lowest points though, and the pair once again enjoy an active sex life. She now plans to go back to therapy in the hope that she can have even better sex in the future. 'I once described my missing orgasm as missing the cherry on top of an ice cream sundae, only to be told the orgasm was the sundae everything else was the cherry on top,' she said. 'I want my damn sundae.'","Megan Ward, 19, from Birmingham has never been able to have an orgasm .

"A grandfather who suffered a heart attack in a hospital car park died after being driven 14 miles to a different hospital. Charlie Hall, 67, had been for a routine CT scan at the University Hospital of Hartlepool when he was taken ill immediately afterwards and collapsed outside. His wife, Doreen, 59, says she was surprised when the nurses who rushed out and performed CPR on Mr Hall - who was slumped in his car and not breathing - called paramedics. They then treated him in an ambulance. Charlie Hall, 67, had been for a routine CT scan at the University Hospital of Hartlepool when he was taken ill immediately afterwards and collapsed outside, while his wife Doreen (left) went for help . When paramedics managed to get Mr Hall breathing again, they took him to the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton, over 14 miles away. A spokesman for the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust told MailOnline: ‘Mr Hall needed urgent emergency care which is provided at the University Hospital of North Tees.’ Grandfather-of-four Mr Hall was in a coma for five days and died on November 25. His widow, from Peterlee in County Durham, said: ‘I am just devastated. I want to know why he wasn’t taken back into the hospital. The whole family are in shock. ‘He went in there fit and healthy; he even drove to the hospital himself. I just can’t get my head around it. ‘It was supposed to be his 68th birthday on Sunday but he is not here to see it. I have got nothing to celebrate now. ‘I am very angry. I think there are a lot of questions that need answering. I have asked for an investigation and filed a formal complaint. The grandfather suffered a heart attack in the hospital car park of the University of Hartlepool (pictured) and died after being ferried 14 miles to a different hospital . David Emerton, Medical Director for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘We've got every sympathy with the family and appreciate that this has been a very difficult time for them. ‘We are in discussion with the family and we will do everything we can to address their concerns.’ Mrs Hall has since been told that her husband, who had two children from a previous relationship and was a stepfather of three, was suffering from heart disease and pneumonia. ‘Charlie was due to get his results from the hospital two days after he died but obviously he didn’t live long enough to find out,’ she said. Mrs Hall, who was married to her husband for 23 years, added: ‘‘I have since found out that he suffered from heart disease. But he could have lived for another three or four years. ‘I think he would have survived if he had been taken straight back into the hospital.’ Mr Hall originally visited the hospital because of the niggling pain in his hip. Mrs Hall, who was married to her husband for 23 years, said she is angry about how he was treated. She has filed a formal complaint . The retired pit miner underwent a series of tests including an X-ray, an MRI scan, a chest X-ray and a full body bone scan. His widow believes he should never have been discharged straight after his latest CT scan. ‘After the scan, two nurses walked him up the corridor and he couldn’t breathe,’ she said. ‘But rather than phone a doctor they left him in the waiting room and carried on with the next person. ‘We waited a few minutes until he could get his breathing back before leaving the hospital. ‘I think he should have been kept him in for observations or at least have somebody on standby. ‘They knew he was struggling to breathe so why did they let him leave the hospital?’ Mr Hall’s death certificate said his death is as a result of heart disease. North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust has confirmed it is carrying out an investigation into the circumstances of the death. When paramedics managed to get Mr Hall breathing, they took him to the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton (pictured), over 14 miles away, as it provides emergency care .","Charlie Hall, 67, had been for a routine .

"Bullied: This photo of blogger Carly Findlay was posted to Reddit on Wednesday (minus the writing), with many commenters mocking her appearance caused by a chronic skin condition . A blogger with a chronic skin disease bravely stood up to internet bullies who ridiculued her looks when her picture was posted on Reddit. A Reddit user with the screen name 'roschleiche' shared a picture of Carly Findlay on a thread called 'WTF' on Wednesday. Ms Findlay suffers from both Netherton's syndrome and erythroderma, causing her skin to inflame when exposed to the elements. In the picture her face appears shiny because she wears paraffin as protection . The Melbourne, Australia-based writer figured out that her image was posted to the site when she noticed an influx of traffic to her blog. Many of the comments made fun of Ms Findlay's appearance, comparing her to a glazed donut, a lobster and 'something that was partially digested by my dog'. One commenter even said that Ms Findlay's smile looked fake. 'Seeing people like this smile makes me uncomfortable, It looks like a lie; they are only smiling in an attempt to fool themselves that their lives aren't horrible. You can see it in her eyes. The same rehearsed dead-eye mouth-smile in all her pictures. Gives me the willies.' After reading through the nasty comments, Ms Findlay decided to enter thread. Ms Findlay wrote that for years she didn't share pictures of herself online for fear that they would be used against her in this way. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Ms Findlay responded to the hate comments by entering the thread herself . Those feelings of anxiety stopped when she started blogging, and gained both confidence and a support system. 'The love I have around me and the success I have had through telling my own story to break down stigma like these Reddit threads is stronger than any of those words,' she wrote. At the same time, Ms Findlay took the opportunity to thank the people who stood up for her on the thread. 'The level of kindness shown in these situations is always greater than the level of hate,' she said. Sorry: After posting her response on Reddit, the user who originally posted her picture apologized . While many defended Ms Findlay before she entered the discussion, even more came out saying she was 'inspirational' and a 'champion' after. The Redditer who originally posted the picture even apologized, though Ms Findlay beleives the apology was somewhat backhanded. 'I'm reading all this and I apologize! I was looking for ""champagne fridge"" on google images. When I saw your pictures, I thought ""WTF!"" and further: ""allergic reaction"", also your hair looks a bit of fire so I put it here. Hopefully you see it as a good promotion for your blog and chapeau to you for being awesome!' the poster wrote. Ms Findlay wrapped up the entire experience in a post on her blog, writing: 'Today's comments on Reddit showed me that the Internet is full of pretty awful people. But it also showed me people are so kind, and are willing to learn.'","A picture of blogger Carly Findlay was posted online Wednesday with many criticizing her appearance .

"Helen Basson, who had arthritis in every joint of her body five years ago, can run pain-free thanks to a copper shoe heel . A mother-of-three is training for a half marathon after beating excruciating arthritis - thanks to a pair of £30 copper insoles. Garden designer Helen Basson, 39, feared she would end up in a wheelchair after she was diagnosed with arthritis in every joint of her body after the birth of her third child. Her condition was so bad she was unable to lift her baby out of his cot or get into the bath unaided. But within three months of inserting the copper insoles, recommended to her by her mother-in-law, Mrs Basson astounded her doctors by beginning to walk freely. She is now planning to take part in a half marathon in February. She said: 'I couldn't do anything. I had to be helped off the toilet and getting in and out of the bath was extremely difficult. 'It was terrifying - I was a young woman and I feared I would end up in a wheelchair. 'The low point was a check-up at the hospital when they inserted a fluid into me and discovered I had arthritis in every joint. 'There was a time when I thought I wouldn't be able to walk again, so running a half marathon will be incredible.' The apparent healing powers of copper were first pioneered by the ancient Greeks who used copper bracelets to ease aches and pains (the insoles claim to contain 14 times more copper than bracelets). Copper is an essential mineral in the body and is thought to keep blood vessels, the immune system and bones healthy. The Arthritis Foundation reports . there is no scientific research to prove the effectiveness from copper . bracelets. However it also says there is scant research to prove there are no benefits. Mrs Basson, with eight-year-old son Theo, feared she would end up in a wheelchair. But within three months of inserting the copper insoles she could walk freely again . Mrs Basson first noticed something was wrong after her son Theo was born in May 2004 and she was unable to straighten her left arm. It wasn't long before the discomfort spread to her knees, wrists, hips, elbows and ankles. She went downhill so quickly she was unable to walk more than 100 metres. Mrs Basson, who lived in Devon before her children were born but now lives in France, was shocked when a rheumatologist at her local hospital in Nice told her the arthritis was in every joint of her body. The agonising condition left her in too much pain to vacuum, iron or clean the house - meaning her husband James had to do everything. Then late in 2007 her mother-in-law recommended the 'copper heelers' which had eased the pain for her some months earlier. The mother-of-three has astounded doctors with her progress and now plans to run a half marathon . Within three months of inserting them into her sandals Mrs Basson, who refused drugs prescribed by doctors, began to notice a difference. Setting herself small goals she started to walk more, building the distance up gradually. When the condition eased she started training for the Rock 'n' Roll Nice, a half marathon around the streets of the city in southern France. She said: 'As well as inserting the copper heelers I changed my diet and stopped having dairy, alcohol, caffeine and gluten. Now I am able to do everything I want to do. I have even started sailing again. 'The doctors are amazed. They cannot believe I have managed to control the arthritis without any drugs. 'I still get a few aches and pains, but I have learned to manage the condition now.' Tony Andrews, of The Original Copper Heeler, the company which invented the copper insoles, said: 'I was passionate in finding a completely natural, drug free solution to stop the torturing pain of this 'quality-of-life' destroying disease. People from all walks of life are wearing the copper heelers.'","Helen Basson, 39, feared she .

"Pupils expecting GCSE or A-level results this summer could miss out on top grades after exam boards were told to fix pass rates and grades to match last year. The move, outlined in a policy document from the exams regulator Ofqual, is intended to halt year-on-year rises in exam success after the pass rate soared for the 29th year in a row last summer. This comes after exam boards were heavily criticised for making errors in papers and handing out unfair grades, as 220,000 pupils battled for just 40,000 university places. Getting better all the time: There have been concerns over the grading system after GCSE and A-level results rose for the 29th year running (file picture) However, critics claim it could stop exam-takers from reaching the highest grade that they could have done in other years. This is the first year in which 'comparable outcomes' will be used in both GCSEs and A-levels. Results will be predicted based on previous cohorts and the past performance of the exam takers - so at A-level, GCSE grades will be taken into account, and at GCSE level, markers will look at pupils' results from SATs tests aged 11. An Ofqual document said of the method: 'If we aim for comparable outcomes, roughly the same proportion of students will achieve each grade as in the previous year..... If necessary . we will require exam boards to change their grade boundaries.' Teachers have claimed the move is a return to 'norm referenced' A-levels,  in which a fixed 10 per cent of pupils would be awarded an A grade each year. Since this was scrapped in 1987, the percentage of A grades has risen from 10 per cent to 27 per cent and the pass rate has gone up from 70 per cent to 97.8 per cent. Overhaul: Last year, 200,000 pupils submitted papers for remarking after complaints over errors in papers and unfair grades . Exam boards received a record number of complaints last year, with 200,000 resubmitting their papers for remarking. A-levels results will be released on 16 August this year, with GCSE results coming out on 23 August. The change in the system comes after controversies over school exams reached new heights. Exam boards were criticised for errors in papers, with AQA forced to apologise in June for a 'confusing' chemistry A-level question that students complained was impossible to answer. Last month, hundreds of GCSE and A-level grades had to be changed after OCR markers added up scores on exam papers wrongly. There was a scandal last December after an investigation revealed that seminars held by examiners were giving teachers vital information about papers. A chief examiner at Edexcel was also caught boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with Ofqual. Nansi Ellis, head of education policy at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: 'If Ofqual is just ensuring consistency in exam standards with last year then that is good news. 'However, we would be concerned if any changes mean that students don’t get awarded the grades their hard work merits if the grades have been set so that a fixed percentage of students are awarded A*s and As.' But Ofqual's chief executive Glenys Stacey insists genuine improvements in teaching and learning standards will still be recognised. The policy of 'comparable outcomes' was in fact introduced at A-level last year and was one of the reasons A* grades only rose from 8.6 per cent to 8.7 per cent. Headteachers have warned it will make it impossible to deliver on Education Secretary Michael Gove's demand schools increase the percentage of A* to C grade passes at GCSE in maths and English. A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'We are determined to raise standards across the board. It is vital that all pupils get the grades their work deserves. 'Ministers have been clear that it is only fair to every hard-working young person that there is no grade inflation or dumbing down in the exams system.'","Move intended to stop gross inflation of results .

"A computer boffin has built a makeshift 3D body scanner out of everyday gadgets and used it to create a replica of his father. Dat Phan from Mission District, San Franciso, used a gaming computer, wheel bearing, plywood and an Xbox Kinect to make the prints which were then turned into a small model. He was inspired to start experimenting with the process through his membership of CODAME, a non-profit art and technology organisation. Genius: Dat Phan from Mission District, San Franciso, used a gaming computer, wheel bearing, plywood and an Xbox Kinect to make a 3D printer. His father spins on a rotating wooden disk (pictured) End result: He then used the technology to create a replica model of his father . As an undergraduate he studied computers but it wasn't until he started using them for art that he started to get creative. To complete the process, which only takes around a minute, he uses the Kinect as a scanner and places the subject on a rotating platform made of the plywood. It turns using a motor and a wheel bearing he bought off Ebay. The Xbox console is fixed to a sliding podium, made out of a speaker stand, piping and some cords. As the subject spins while holding a pose, data is collected and then fed back through the gaming computer which recreates a 3D image. Dat told Mission Local: 'I started doing research and thinking about how to do full-body scanning in an efficient way.The most basic method is holding the sensor by hand and walking around people, dragging the cords behind. The scan: Dat (left) pulls the console on the stand up and down while the subject pulls a pose. The whole process takes only one minute . 'I found some designs on how to build a turntable that a person could stand on. I also adapted a camera slider design to shuttle the Kinect sensor up and down. 'I also determined what kind of computing power was needed to drive the 3D scanning and model generation. He added: 'It requires a very powerful graphics card to be able to process the scan data. Most of the calculations are done on the graphics card rather than the CPU.'","Dat Phan from Mission District, San Francisco, created the model .

"Niki Taylor was on the cover of Vogue before most girls her age even snagged their first kiss, but her life hasn't always been runways and red carpets. The former supermodel, now 39, opened up to Oprah in an emotional interview talking about the loss of her little sister Krissy at a young age and nearly dying herself in a 2001 car crash. In a preview of the interview, set to air Sunday night at 9pm, Taylor says unexpectedly losing Krissy, also a model, to a rare heart condition in 1995 was 'the biggest tragedy and loss' of her life. 'We were very close. We worked together. We did everything together. I miss her very much,' Taylor says. Scroll down for video . An 'it' girl with a tortured past: Former supermodel Niki Taylor opens up about her personal life tragedies in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The full interview will air Sunday night at 9pm . 'I miss her very much': In the interview, Taylor (left) talks about the sudden loss of her little sister and fellow model Krissy (right) who died in 1995 from an undiagnosed heart condition. Pictured above in May 1994 . Taylor goes on to reveal that she started self-medicating to deal with the sudden loss of her closest friend. 'I was 21 and I didn't deal with it very good at all because I wanted to be numb,' she says. 'And I chose prescription drugs. That was my choice and not wanting to deal with losing my best friend.' Taylor first started working as a model at the age of 13, when she was signed to an agency in her native Florida. By the age of 14, she landed her first magazine cover on the August 1989 issue of Seventeen, and just a year later she made history by becoming the youngest person ever to grace the cover of fashion-bible Vogue. Cover girl: Taylor was the youngest person to ever grace the cover of Vogue, in 1990  at the age of 15. Her first cover was for Seventeen magazine in August 1989 (left). On the right, one of Taylor's Vogue covers from 1994 . In addition to losing her sister, Taylor herself almost died in 2001 when she was involved in a serious car crash in Atlanta, Georgia while being driven by then-boyfriend Chad Renegar. Renegar was apparently attempting to answer his phone when he lost control of the car and crashed into a utility pole. 'We turned onto an ordinary street,' Taylor says. 'We hit a utility pole and the seat belt tore my liver in half. If I had been sitting this way or this way or just in a different position, maybe the outcome would have been different. But for some reason I was supposed to go through that and be in the hospital for three months - be in a coma, die on the operating table twice.' Thankfully, Taylor was wearing her seat belt at the time and was not thrown from the vehicle. Fighter: Taylor also speaks about the 2001 car crash in which she almost died. The crash left her in a coma for weeks, and she had to undergo some 40 surgeries . However, she lost 80 per cent of the blood in her bodies from injuries, and was in a coma for weeks, undergoing some 40 surgeries. 'It was definitely a miracle that I survived,' Taylor says.

"An ingredient in red wine called resveratrol can lead to developmental abnormalities in the foetal's pancreas if consumed in pregnancy, a study shows . Pregnant women who have the odd drink should avoid red wine, researchers suggest. They say that an ingredient in the wine that is normally viewed as healthy could harm their unborn child's pancreas. Resveratrol has been credited with having protective effects against heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and a number of other conditions. Naturally present in red wine, red grapes and some berries, it is also available as a supplement. However, a study now suggests it can lead to developmental abnormalities in the foetal pancreas. The study was carried out by the Division of Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism and the Division of Reproductive and Development Science at Oregon Health and Science University in the United States. Lead researcher on the study Dr Kevin Gove said: 'This study has direct relevance to human health. 'Resveratrol is widely used for its recognised health benefits, and is readily available over the counter. 'The important message in this study is that women should be very careful about what they consume while pregnant, and they should not take supplements, like Resveratrol, without consulting with their doctors. 'What might be good for the mother may not be good for the baby.' As part of the study, Dr Grove and colleagues gave resveratrol supplements every day throughout pregnancy to obese macaque monkeys eating a Western diet. A second group of obese monkeys was not given the supplement, and both were compared with lean monkeys fed a healthy diet. The animals were closely monitored for health complications, and blood flow through the placenta was determined by ultrasound. The study, which was carried out on monkeys by researchers at the Oregon Health and Science University in the U.S., found that the consumption of resveratrol during pregnancy has 'a direct relevance to human health' The foetuses were analysed for developmental abnormalities, and findings showed definitive evidence of pancreatic abnormalities. The study was published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal. Dr Gerald Weissmann, editor-in-chief of the journal, said: 'We've known for a long time that resveratrol is pharmacologically active, and we're just now really beginning to understand the pros and cons of consuming high concentrations of this substance. 'As we begin to establish a safety profile for resveratrol and other dietary supplements, findings like this should come as no surprise. 'There are always negative side effects when you eat, drink, take or do too much of anything.'","Red wine ingredient resveratrol could damage unborn baby's pancreas .

"Worried: David Cameron has held crisis talks at Downing Street after being told of allegations of a sensational love affair which has potentially significant political implications for him . Speculation is rife over the identities of two people allegedly involved in a secret affair which could have serious political implications for David Cameron and his government. The internet has been awash with rumours since details of the relationship emerged last night. It comes as David Cameron holds crisis talks at Downing Street after being told of the alleged affair which has potentially significant political implications for him. For legal reasons, MailOnline cannot disclose the identities of the people involved or any details of the relationship – or even how long it lasted. It has been said that they are middle-aged figures and that the affair has now concluded. It does not involve anyone serving in the Cabinet. Mr Cameron was said to be stunned when he was told the identities of the alleged lovers. It was said that he ‘immediately realised the importance of the story’. The Prime Minister and his aides also discussed the possible fallout should details of the affair become public. The situation was labelled 'dynamite' and a 'complete mess' by senior party sources. The affair, which was revealed to the Prime Minister within the past few weeks, is also said to have caused ‘great personal distress to innocent parties’. It is likely to cause a further headache for Mr Cameron, whose leadership is already being tested by backbench revolts over issues such as Europe and gay marriage and rumours of plots being hatched to overthrow him. On Friday, he faced a further blow when one of his MPs, Patrick Mercer, resigned the party whip after being caught in a cash-for-questions ‘sting’ operation. Surprised: When aides told Mr Cameron the identities of the alleged lovers he was said to be 'stunned'. He is pictured with his wife Samantha during their holiday in Ibiza last week . The Commons has recently been beset by sex scandals. Weeks ago Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, a Tory MP, was arrested following allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013 – accusations he has branded ‘completely false’. A third person has also given a statement to Lancashire police, claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Mr Evans, and on Friday police said they were planning to interview a fourth alleged victim who claims he was intimately groped by Mr Evans in a Commons bar. In April, Scotland Yard said it had launched a formal investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard. The Metropolitan Police set up a . phoneline for alleged victims after a number of women made claims about . inappropriate conduct by the peer, who was the party’s former chief . election strategist.

"A federal jury has ruled that use of the 'N-word' is discriminatory workplace behavior, even when used among blacks. A black New York City employment agency worker who was the target of a slur-laced rant by her black boss has been awarded $250,000 in compensatory damages by a Manhattan federal jury. The case against Rob Carmona and the . employment agency he founded, STRIVE East Harlem, gave legal airing to . what some see as a double standard surrounding the word: It's a . degrading slur when uttered by whites but can be used at times with . impunity among blacks. Too tough? A federal jury has ruled against Robert Carmona, a New York non-profit founder known for his tough love, whose former employee sued him for going on a 'four minute tirade' that included the n-word . But 38-year-old Brandi Johnson told jurors that being black didn't make it any less hurtful to be the target of what her attorney called Carmona's ‘four-minute [N-word] tirade’ about inappropriate workplace attire and unprofessional behavior. Johnson, who taped the March 2012 remarks after her complaints about his verbal abuse were disregarded, said she fled to the restroom and cried for 45 minutes. ‘I was offended. I was hurt. I felt degraded. I felt disrespected. I was embarrassed,’ Johnson testified. In closing arguments, Johnson's attorney Marjorie M. Sharpe said Carmona's use of the word was intended to offend ‘and any evidence that defendants put forth to the contrary is simply ridiculous.’ High price: Carmona's organization, called Strive (pictured), helps rehabilitate and find jobs for former criminals and other difficult to employ people. He must now pay Brandi Johnson $250,000 plus punitive damages . ‘When you use the [N-word] to an African-American, no matter how many alternative definitions that you may try to substitute with the [N-word], that is no different than calling a Hispanic by the worst possible word you can call a Hispanic, calling a homosexual male the worst possible word that you can call a homosexual male,’ Sharpe told jurors. But defense lawyers said the 61-year-old Carmona, a black man of Puerto Rican descent, had a much different experience with the word. Raised by a single mother in a New York City public housing project, he became addicted to heroin in his teens and broke it with the help of drug counselors who employed tough love and tough language. Carmona went on to earn a master's degree from Columbia University before co-founding STRIVE in the 1980s. Now, most of STRIVE's employees are black women, defense attorney Diane Krebs told jurors in her opening statement. Illegal: Carmona has made his name helping people get off the streets and into jobs with living wages. He's now gaining recognition for what has now been labeled 'discriminatory behavior' toward his black employee . ‘And Mr. Carmona is himself black, as you yourselves can see,’ Krebs said. In his testimony, Carmona defended his use of the word, saying he used it with Johnson to convey that she was ‘too emotional, wrapped up in her, at least the negative aspects of human nature.’ Then he explained that the word has ‘multiple contexts’ in the black and Latino communities, sometimes indicating anger, sometimes love. Carmona said he might put his arm around a longtime friend in the company of another and say: ‘This is my [N-word] for 30 years.’ ‘That means my boy, I love him, or whatever,’ he said. He was asked if he meant to indicate love when he called Johnson the word. ‘Yes, I did,’ he responded. The controversy is a blemish on STRIVE, which has been heralded for helping people with troubled backgrounds get into the workforce. Its employment model, which was described in a CBS' ‘60 Minutes’ piece as ‘part boot camp, part group therapy,’ claims to have helped nearly 50,000 people find work since 1984. Sharpe told jurors that STRIVE's tough-love program cannot excuse Carmona's behavior. ‘Well, if calling a person a N-word and subjecting them to a hostile work environment is part of STRIVE's tough love, then STRIVE needs to be reminded that this type of behavior is illegal and cannot be tolerated,’ she said.","New York City non-profit founder Rob Carmona lost his argument that the word is a term of endearment in the black community .

"The trial of alleged honeymoon killer Shrien Dewani is more likely than ever to collapse after a string of blows to prosecution evidence, a legal expert has claimed. The South African Law Society's William Booth said he still believes Dewani's lawyers could apply to have the case discharged within days, after fresh claims it is 'short on evidence'. South African law allows defendants to have their trial dismissed - without having to take the stand - if a judge decides prosecutors have presented a flimsy case. Scroll down for video . Collapse: Lawyers for Shrien Dewani (pictured leaving the Western Cape High Court this week) could ask to have the case dismissed without him taking the stand after blows to the prosecution case, an expert said . Fragile: William Booth (right), a senior figure in the South African Law Society, said Dewani's lawyers will have to decide whether he should give evidence in his state or whether they should try to withdraw the case . 'Many observers' now agree the trial has been 'rather short on evidence', according to a report today in the Sunday Telegraph. Mr Booth previously said the millionaire's lawyers had 'strong reasons' to try and have the case discharged when the prosecution case closes - likely to be this week. Today he repeated his view in an interview with MailOnline. 'It's probably more likely to be withdrawn the longer the case goes on,' he said. 'The high water mark of the state's case has still been the evidence of the three main witnesses, and based on their testimony the state would certainly struggle to secure a conviction.' Fragile: Dewani denies involvement in the death of his wife Anni (pictured with him at their wedding) The first two of the witnesses were driver Zola Tongo and hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, both of whom were jailed for the murder of Anni - and Mr Booth claimed their evidence was 'riddled with inconsistencies'. The third, hotel receptionist and 'middle man' Monde Mbolombo, has now admitted lying under oath during a previous case. The hotel worker, who has been granted immunity in exchange for giving evidence, admitted doing so in the 2012 trial of fellow hijacker Xolile Mngeni - who died in jail of a brain tumour last month. 'You lied in the State v Mngeni?', prosecutor Shareen Riley asked earlier this month. 'That’s correct,' he replied. Mr Booth, who is the chairman of the South African law society's Criminal Law and Procedure Committee, added: 'The court can look at the credibility of the witnesses - whether their evidence has been so poor it cannot be relied on. 'Certainly a strong case can be made out that the three main witnesses have given very poor evidence. 'The main problem is you are dealing with witnesses who are accomplices so you must treat the evidence with caution. The last of the accomplice witnesses has already admitted lying previously.' If the case is dismissed it would happen after all the prosecution evidence - which many expect to end this week. Dewani's lawyers have declined to confirm whether they plan to make the application under section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act. For it to succeed the judge would have to be convinced there is not enough evidence for a 'reasonable person' to convict Dewani, Mr Booth said. That would be a tougher test for Dewani's lawyers than leaving it to 'beyond reasonable doubt' - but would save him from taking the stand. 'How's he going to be called as a witness?' said Mr Booth. 'There's the problem of his health - he's in a very fragile emotional state. It's quite something to get into that witness box'. 'Riddled with inconsistencies': Mr Booth criticised the evidence of driver Zola Tongo (above), who was jailed for Anni's murder. 'The main problem is you are dealing with witnesses who are accomplices,' he added . Questioned: Convicted hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe (left and right) also gave evidence for the state . Couple: Shrien Dewani (left) has denied arranging the murder of his wife Anni (right) in Cape Town in 2010 . He added previously: 'Although it is not down to him to prove his innocence, a judge can choose to draw conclusions from the fact that an accused chooses not to give evidence in his own defence.' The prosecution case was dealt a previous blow when evidence of Dewani's bisexuality was ruled irrelevant. Presiding judge Jeanette Traverso ruled she would exclude much of the testimony of three key witnesses - including the 'German Master' gay fetish escort paid by Dewani, 34. She said that Dewani's gay affairs despite his conservative Hindu background were not enough of a motive for murder - and besides, he had already disclosed his sexuality at the start of the case. Anniversary: The trial was adjourned as Anni's father Vinod Hindocha visited the place of her death . Mr Booth's is not the first warning that the case could collapse. Last month the judge had to warn reporters after Dewani suffered a 'panic attack' outside court as photographers allegedly surrounded his car and banged his window with their lenses. Judge Traverso told reporters: 'We want to see justice done and incidents like that mean that justice may not be done'. She added that the media should 'treat the accused and the case with the necessary dignity'. Dewani denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride Anni almost four years ago during their honeymoon to South Africa. The state alleges he plotted her murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000). The driver, Zola Tongo – who spent his sixth day on the stand  – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates Bristol-based Dewani in his Swedish wife's death in November 2010. But during gruelling cross-examination, Dewani's defence team managed to blast a number of holes in Tongo's story, highlighting discrepancies between his evidence from the witness box and his statement to police a week after Mrs Dewani suffered a fatal gun shot wound to the neck. Francois van Zyl, who heads the defence team, also highlighted that the taxi driver received a substantially lower jail term for his role in the killing in exchange for implicating Dewani in the murder. The trial in Cape Town adjourned for the day on Thursday so Anni's family could grieve on the fourth anniversary of her death. Grief etched on their faces, her parents Vinod and Nilam and brother Anish made a pilgrimage to the township street where her body was found slumped in an abandoned car. They were led in prayer by a Hindu priest as sympathetic onlookers began singing hymns, while passing buses slowed down to watch. The trial continues.

"A 13-year-old student dressed as the Batman villain Two-Face shot himself dead with a hand gun today at an Oklahoma junior high school, just minutes before classes were due to start. Horrified students - many of whom were similarly dressed for the school's Super Hero Day - heard a gunshot before 8am and found eighth grader Cade Poulos lying in a hallway, according to classmates speaking to KOCO. Terrified teenagers then fled the halls, fearing a gunman was on the loose. According to a Facebook memorial page since created for the Stillwater Junior High student, bullying is a suspected motive for the boy's death. Scroll down for video . Killed: Police have identified 13-year-old Cade Poulos as the eighth grade student who allegedly shot himself in the head moments before class . Family: Cade Poulos is pictured right of his sister and brother in a Facebook memorial to the boy that mutually condemns bullying . 'We all broke down and cried when we heard the gun shot. I hope people realize now that Bullying is NOT acceptable, and it hurts . people in every way. Little words hurt. We know what you experienced. But we all love you, your [sic] in our prayers...' a Facebook post in memorial of Cade read. Since its creation this morning it has received over 6,000 likes by mid-afternoon. On Wednesday night, about 120 of Cade's friends and community members packed into the Highland Park Methodist Church for a prayer service, according to the Tulsa World. The church's senior pastor, Rev Derrek Belase said during the service: 'God created Cade, and God loved him until the very end. This morning, God welcomed him home.' The junior high school and a nearby elementary school were locked down and classes canceled for the day, authorities said. Several students told KOCO that Cade had gone to school dressed as the fictional character Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, for the day of costumes as part of Breast Cancer Awareness week. Stillwater Police Capt. Randy Dickerson told the News Press that 'the . hallway was probably full of kids that time of day,' some of whom have come forward describing the scene to local media as immediately evacuated out of fear. 'It doesn't appear that anyone else was in danger or threatened,' he added. Super Hero Day: Students at Stillwater Junior High School were dressed in costume according to the school's website with several students telling a local new station that Cade was dressed as Batman villain Two-Face, pictured right from The Dark Knight . Remembered: Cade is pictured centre of his family according to its timestamp three years ago while school officials say they have no filed reports of him having been bullied . Approximately 750 to 760 students attend . the junior high school with students in grades eight and nine, . according to Stillwater Superintendent Ann Caine. The school sent a statement to . parents saying there had been a 'single shooting incident' at the school . and that staff and students – eighth and ninth graders – had been moved . to a safe location. Parents were told to pick up their children at a . nearby shopping center. With Cade allegedly dressed as a popular Batman villain, the scene may have painted a grisly reminder of this summer's shootings at the Aurora, Colorado movie theatre where accused gunman James Holmes shot and killed 12 while dressed as the Joker. 'Everyone . thought it was a joke at first,' ninth-grader Ashlyn Lundholm told the . Stillwater NewsPress. 'Then I heard people screaming. Then we went to . lockdown for 35 to 40 minutes.' An eighth-grade student told the newspaper he witnessed the shooting. 'I saw him on the ground,' Aaron Veselak said. 'There was blood all around his head.' Role playing: James Holmes is pictured, left, days before allegedly going on a shooting spree at a Colorado movie theatre while dressed as the evil Batman villain the Joker, pictured right, last July . Evacuation: Following instructions to evacuate the school immediately after the shooting, Lorenzo and Silvia Cook are seen hugging after meeting up at Cimarron Plaza . Injuries: Police Captain Randy Dickerson, seen at a later press conference, explained the shooting as an isolated incident and no others reported harmed or injured . Feared the worst: A fire-rescue truck is seen parked outside Stillwater Junior High School as first responders arrived to initial fears that a gunman was on the loose . Dickerson told the NewsPress that 'the hallway was probably full of kids that time of day.' According to KOKO, it was a teacher who immediately responded to the boy. 'Everybody just heard a huge pop…there was just a gasp, everybody all at the . same time. Then silence for about three seconds and then I looked over to see . what it was, and I saw a body laying on the ground, with blood everywhere. And I . just started running,' a student told KOSU. Dickerson told NewsOK he had not heard bullying as a possibility in the shooting but said it's still early into their investigation. 'There's no documented bullying in the . school records, but all the kids i've talked to who went to school with . him said he was bullied and that leads me to believe treated like an . outcast. His peers would know more than the school records,' one . Facebook user responded to another questioning the reports of his . bullying. Emergency response: Officers stand outside the junior high school just after 8am this morning following the reports of a student killing himself in the hallway . Lock down: The school was put on lock down and classes canceled for the day while police say they believe any further threats to students are over . Motive: An online memorial for the boy claims bullying was behind his death on Wednesday morning, an assertion police say they are still looking into . Superintendent Caine said counselors would be available for students. 'It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of a tragic incident at our (school) this morning,' Caine said in a letter to parents. 'At 7:50 a.m. one of our students died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. All other students and staff are safe.' Responding to the scene was State Sen. Jim Halligan who witnessed and applauded the students' swift evacuation to Cimarron Plaza. 'It has been emotional to be able to see the reunion of parents and children,' Sen Halligan told KAUT. Stillwater is located about 70 miles west of Tulsa.

"Mauricio Pochettino has admitted he will have to wait until the last minute before knowing if Hugo Lloris will be fit to face the side that put 11 goals past him last season. The France goalkeeper pulled out of his country’s fixture against Armenia on Tuesday because of a thigh problem, which leaves Pochettino unsure of his fitness for Saturday’s clash at Manchester City. Lloris returned to Tottenham on Wednesday, but will undergo assessment on Friday to see if he is fit to face a side that trounced Spurs 5-1 and 6-0 last season. Hugo Lloris is a doubt for Tottenham's visit to Manchester City after missing France's game with Armenia . The Frenchman has been in fine form for Mauricio Pochettino's side in the Premier League this season . Summer signing Michel Vorm will start in Lloris's place if he fails to recover in time for Saturday's match . Asked if Lloris was able to play, Pochettino said: ‘Maybe, maybe, maybe. Hugo arrived on Wednesday but we need to analyse and to test and we have another day to decide. ‘All players are important. Hugo, yes, is our keeper that we use more than another but we need all players to be fit. We need to wait for tomorrow (Friday) to analyse and then decide.’ Michel Vorm would deputise in the event that Lloris is ruled out, while Nacer Chadli is also a significant doubt after missing Belgium’s clash against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday with a hip problem. Belgium international Nacer Chadli, who scored against Arsenal earlier this season, is another doubt for Spurs . Chadli scored in Belgium's win against Andorra on October 10 but missed their subsequent game with Bosnia . Tottenham travel to the Etihad Stadium with an unbeaten away record, while City have occasionally looked shaky at home in defence of their title. Pochettino, who insisted he will not dwell on last season’s hammerings, said: ‘You never know if it is a good or bad time to play them. The most important thing is we arrive in a good moment. After our victory against Southampton we need to keep the momentum and reproduce the same action during the game against Southampton and try to get the three points but you never know.’ He added: ‘The reality is I don’t remember the results (from last season). It is important this is another season. This is another philosophy, another game. We need to arrive on Saturday to get the points that is the more important thing. ‘It is not important to think in the past. It is important to look forward.’","Hugo Lloris is a doubt for Tottenham's next Premier League fixture against Manchester City after missing France's match with Armenia on Tuesday .

"Five top schools send as many pupils to Oxford and Cambridge as 1,800 state schools put together, a new analysis has revealed. A small group of elite schools is tightening its grip on the country’s most prestigious universities as wealthy families spend increasing sums on education. Three well-known private schools and two elite sixth-form colleges supplied 260 Oxbridge entrants in 2011/12 - the same number as 1,800 state schools across England. Pembroke College at Oxford University, where entrants came from five of the country's top schools . Similar research relating to the previous three years found that the top five schools and colleges produced as many Oxbridge acceptances as about 1,500 state schools. The charity behind the research warned of a growing divide between Britain’s wealthiest families and ‘normal’ middle-income pupils. Rich families were devoting more of their resources than ever to education because they recognised its increasing importance in landing top jobs and ‘positions of power’, it was claimed. The five top schools for producing Oxbridge entrants include Eton, which was David Cameron’s old school, Westminster, where Nick Clegg was an old boy, and St Paul’s, which educated George Osborne. The remaining two schools are large state sixth-form colleges – Hills Road in Cambridge and Peter Symonds in Winchester - which have become the ‘choice destinations for professional parents wanting to maximise the chances of their children getting into Oxbridge’. The analysis - produced by the Sutton Trust education charity - also shows that just 40 schools and colleges provided about a quarter of all Oxbridge entrants in 2011/12. These schools are a mix of elite private schools and top-performing state grammars and sixth-form colleges. The only state comprehensive to make the list is Cherwell School, which is based in Oxford. In a blog, Lee Elliot Major, the trust’s director of development and policy, said the figures were ‘powerful’ because they show the ‘extent to which a tiny minority of the country’s 2,750 schools and colleges dominate enrolment at prestigious universities’. This was a ‘sombre message for the 100,000s of students waiting to receive their A-level results this August’. He argued that despite ‘valiant efforts’ by universities, entry to elite campuses was increasingly dominated by children from the most privileged families. ‘The concern is that a small cadre of schools and colleges is tightening its grip on elite university places,’ he said. ‘The figures indicate that students from the wealthiest families could be pulling further away in the race for prestigious academic degrees, and the positions of power they pave the way to. Eton College (pictured) is one of the top school's that sends its pupils to either Oxford or Cambridge University . ‘This yawning gap is not just a problem for our poorest children but also those from “normal” middle income homes.’ Mr Elliot Major added: ‘The social mobility arms race is escalating with each academic year as the richest families increasingly devote more resources to ensure that their children excel at school and university. ‘They recognise education’s increasing importance in who wins in the workplace.’ The research is based on the latest available data from the Department for Education, published earlier this year. Billions of pounds have been spent over the last 15 years on outreach schemes, bursaries and funding aimed at up opening up access to university. But the analysis shows that the proportion of A-level students attending comprehensives and progressing to the country’s 30 most academically demanding universities fell from 23 per cent in 2008/09 to 19 per cent in 2011/12. Mr Elliot Major warned that prominent positions in politics, law, the media and the civil service - where an Oxbridge degree ‘remains the passport to success’ - would continue to be dominated by graduates from a narrow range of backgrounds. But he also said the figures also highlighted some ‘exceptional’ comprehensives whose pupils are getting the grades and the know-how to get into Oxbridge and other top universities. The list includes Mossbourne Community Academy, which was built up from scratch by Sir Michael Wilshaw, now head of Ofsted, and sent seven per cent of its pupils to Oxbridge in 2011/12. ‘We know that there are tens of thousands more academically talented children in schools across the country who could be real candidates for university, and even perhaps an Oxbridge degree,’ Mr Elliot Major added.","Group of five elite schools is tightening grip on Oxbridge undergrad places .

"A water ban that had hundreds of thousands of people in Ohio and Michigan scrambling for drinking water has been lifted, Toledo's mayor announced Monday. Mayor D. Michael Collins lifted the ban at a Monday morning news conference, and said the city's drinking water is safe. Ohio's fourth-largest city warned residents not to use city water early Saturday after tests at one treatment plant showed readings for microcystin above the standard for consumption, most likely from algae on the lake. Ohio Governor John Kasich declared a state of emergency.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Vote of confidence: Toledo Mayor D Michael Collins announced the ban was lifted by taking a swig of tap water . Unsafe: Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, gestures as he talks about algae near the City of Toledo water intake crib, Sunday, August 3 . Early Monday, Collins kept in place an advisory against drinking or using the water pending additional tests. At a 3 a.m. news conference, Collins said it was his decision to keep the advisory in place at least into the morning hours, even though latest test results suggest the algae-induced toxin contaminating Lake Erie had probably dissipated to safe levels. The mayor said two tests had come back 'too close for comfort.' With the warning, worried residents told not to drink, brush their teeth or wash dishes with the water descended on truckloads of bottled water delivered from across the state. The Ohio National Guard was using water purification systems to produce drinkable water. Oliver Arnold, of Toledo, loaded up on bottled water Sunday so that he could give baths to his six children, including four-month-old twins. 'We're going through a lot. I know by tomorrow, we're going to be looking for water again,' he said. Some hospitals canceled elective surgeries and were sending surgical equipment that needed to be sterilized to facilities outside the water emergency, said Bryan Biggie, disaster coordinator for ProMedica hospitals in Toledo. In . southeastern Michigan, authorities were operating water stations Sunday . for the 30,000 customers affected by the toxic contamination. Drinking . the water could cause vomiting, cramps and rashes. But no serious . illnesses had been reported by late Sunday. Health officials advised . children and those with weak immune systems to avoid showering or . bathing in the water. Amid . the emergency, discussion began to center around how to stop the . pollutants fouling the lake that supplies drinking water for 11 million . people. 'People are finally waking up to the fact that this is not acceptable,' Collins said. The toxins that contaminated the region's drinking water supply didn't just suddenly appear. Water . plant operators along western Lake Erie have long been worried about . this very scenario as a growing number of algae blooms have turned the . water into a pea soup color in recent summers, leaving behind toxins . that can sicken people and kill pets. In . fact, the problems on the shallowest of the five Great Lakes brought on . by farm runoff and sludge from sewage treatment plants have been . building for more than a decade. The . National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a satellite . image showing a small but concentrated algae bloom centered right where . Toledo draws its water supply, said Jeff Reutter, head of the Ohio Sea . Grant research lab. Water crisis: Ohio Army National Guard Special Luis Cardenas directs military vehicles carrying fresh drinking water, Sunday, August 3, 2014, at Woodward High School in Toledo . Green menace: This satellite image provided by NOAA shows the algae bloom on Lake Erie in 2011 which according to NOAA was the worst in decades . The bloom was much smaller than in past years and isn't expected to peak until early September. But instead of being pushed out to the middle of the lake, winds and waves drove the algae toward the shore, he said. 'Weather conditions made it such that bloom was going right into the water intakes,' said Reutter, who has been studying the lake since the 1970s, when it was severely polluted. The amount of phosphorus going into the lake has risen every year since the mid-1990s. 'We're right back to where we were in the '70s,' Reutter said. Almost a year ago, one township just east of Toledo told its 2,000 residents not to drink or use the water coming from their taps. That was believed to be the first time a city has banned residents from using the water because of toxins from algae in the lake. Researchers largely blame the algae's resurgence on manure and chemical fertilizer from farms that wash into the lake along with sewage treatment plants. Leaky septic tanks and stormwater drains have contributed, too. Combined, they flush huge amounts of phosphorus into the lake. State of emergency: Ohio Air National Guard Senior Airman Nick Wander fills a 400 gallon military water buffalo with fresh drinking water . Water supplies: Volunteers coordinate a fresh drinking water distribution point . Vital need: A member of the Ohio Air National Guard carries a bag of water to a nearby car at Woodward High School in Toledo, Ohio . Unclean: Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, holds a sample glass of water as he talks about algae near the City of Toledo water intake crib . Environmental groups and water . researchers have been calling on Ohio and other states in the Great . Lakes region to drastically reduce the amount of phosphorus flowing into . the lake. Ohio lawmakers this past spring took a step toward tackling . the algae problem when they enacted a law requiring most farmers to . undergo training before they use commercial fertilizers on their fields. But they have stopped short of mandating restrictions on farmers. The . International Joint Commission, an advisory agency made up of Canadian . and U.S. officials, said last year urgent steps are needed to reduce . phosphorus applied to fields, suggesting among other things that states . ban the spread of manure on frozen or snow-covered ground. That . report came after a state task force in Ohio called for a 40 percent . reduction in all forms of phosphorus going into the lake. Algae bloom: A detail photograph of the Lake Erie water near the City of Toledo water intake crib, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2014, in Lake Erie, about 2.5 miles off the shore of Curtice, Ohio . Ongoing problem: Birds fly near the City of Toledo water intake crib, Sunday, August 3, 2014, in Lake Erie, about 2.5 miles off the shore of Curtice, Ohio . Agriculture . industry groups have been asking farmers for more than a year to reduce . phosphorus runoff before government regulators step in and impose their . own restrictions. 'We're clearly showing progress,' Reutter said. 'You have to decide for yourself whether you think it's fast enough.' In . Michigan, Detroit's 4 million-user water system gets its water from . Lake Huron and the Detroit River. In the face of the Toledo water . crisis, Detroit officials plan to review their contamination procedures . Monday, water department Deputy Director Darryl Latimer told The Detroit . News. He said it was unlikely Detroit would face a problem like . Toledo's.

"A mother who live-tweeted and posted photos from her own home birth has opened up about why she thought it was important to share an honest account of the experience. British-born blogger Ruth Iorio (née Fowler) who lives in Los Angeles, began labor on Christmas day and continued to post on Twitter about it over the next 12 hours, from the moment her contractions began to when she delivered her baby boy and was transferred to hospital for a blood transfusion. She told the Huffington Post her aim was to open people's eyes to the 'unique experience' of home birth, 'whether attractive or not, and just be honest about it.' Real-time: Blogger Ruth Iorio, who lives in Los Angeles, began labor on Christmas day and continued to post on Twitter about it over the next 12 hours, from contractions to delivery . Revealing: She captioned each of her photos with detailed descriptions of what was happening . When the grueling birth was finally over, she tweeted candidly: 'This mad experience just reiterated how goddamn crazy birth is. . . I don't want to be an ass but this experience has taught me birth is beautiful and primal and mysterious and painful as f***.' The Cambridge graduate's posts began when she had her first contractions, ultimately designating camera duty to her husband Jared when the pain became too much. 'Contractions started at around 8:15pm,' she tweeted. 'Pretty regular - 30 seconds long, 2.5 minutes apart, mild and crampy. Cleaned house and now gonna take bath. Am tweeting the whole thing.' She then went on to describe in detail the painful process of her 12-hour labor, including diarrhea, back pain and losing her 'mucus plug'. 'Labor basically feels like sh**** period pain in waves,' she tweeted. Easing the pain: She went on to describe in detail the painful process of her home labor, including diarrhea, back pain, losing her 'mucus plug' and enjoying a whiskey sour in the bathtub . Efforts: She even did yoga to ease the pain. 'It's really helping moving around,' she wrote. 'Can't imagine being stuck on a bed with an IV. That would suck. Tweeting helps too. Distractions good!' Go-time: Mrs Iorio's water finally broke at around 6am, at which point she posted a picture of herself squatting in the bathtub. 'Home stretch,' she captioned this shot . After four hours of labor, she shared . a picture of herself in the bathtub with a drink. 'Whiskey sour, 4 . hours in,' she tweeted. 'They've slowed to 4 min apart or so. No res for . the wicked [sic].' And when contractions turned into 'nasty back labor' and 'a****** pains', she tweeted about that, too. At one point, the blogger did yoga poses to ease the pain. 'It's really helping moving around,' she wrote. 'Can't imagine being stuck on a bed with an IV. That would suck. Tweeting helps too. Distractions good!' Mrs Iorio's water finally broke at around 6am, at which point she posted a picture of herself squatting in the bathtub. Triumphant: When her son Nye was finally born and she was taken to hospital, Mrs Iorio posted a picture of them in the hospital bed. 'Hello world. F***, that hurt,' she tweeted. 'Totally natural birth, all doped up now!' Eye-opening: 'I don't want to be an ass but this experience has taught me birth is beautiful and primal and mysterious and painful as f***,' she wrote (pictured: baby Nye) Shedding light: Part of the reason Mrs Iorio decided to share her home birth with her followers was in an effort to show her support for midwifery, which is a dying industry in the U.S. Her son, Nye Soledad, was delivered successfully . shortly thereafter, and she was then transferred to a hospital because . her placenta did not detach from her body. There, . the new mom - who lost a significant amount of blood during labor - . received blood transfusions, was given pain relieving drugs and put on . antibiotics.

Part of the reason Mrs Iorio decided to share her home birth with her followers was in an effort to show her support for midwifery, which is a dying industry in the U.S. 'I know homebirth isn't for everyone, but we need to question what's happening,' she said. 'The U.S. is basically trying to get rid of midwives.' Self-reflection: 'Sexy granny pants with massive industrial sanitary towels to catch all the blood #ruthshomebirth,' she tweeted from the hospital alongside this selfie . Sharing the load: When the Cambridge graduate's pain became too much she designated camera duty to her photographer husband Jared (pictured with Nye) She stated from the beginning, however, . that she would not rule out going to the hosptial if she needed medical . attention at any point - which is exactly what happened. 'Given the C- section rate in the U.S. and rates of medicated births decided to try for home birth instead with hospital as back up,' she tweeted before her labor began. 'I know that if I went to a hospital now I would be more likely to have unpleasant intervention I would like to avoid,' she added. Today, Mrs Iorio says she has no regrets about her very public and painful birthing method. And she says little Nye is as happy and healthy as can be. 'He's amazing,' she said in a HuffPost Live interview. 'He's just a great little baby.'","Ruth Iorio opted to have a home birth with a midwife, though after the baby was delivered she was transferred to hospital for a blood transfusion .

"When a Midwestern scrap metal dealer spotted the golden egg at a bric-a-brac market, he anticipated a money-making opportunity, but only for the value of its gold and jewels. He just didn’t realise quite how much he would profit on his $13,300 (£8,000) purchase. After failing to sell it on because would-be buyers thought it over-priced, the man decided to research the piece further – and discovered he was the owner of a $33 million (£20million) long-lost Faberge egg. Exquisite: A scrap metal dealer discovered this $33 million (£20million) Faberge egg at a bric-a-brac stall . Intricate: The egg contains a Vacheron Constantin watch which was given by Alexander III to his wife Empress Maria Feodorovna for Easter in 1887 . Kieran McCarthy, the expert who verified the extraordinary find, likened the moment to ‘Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark’. 'I could never have dreamed something of this caliber would just walk through our door,' said McCarthy, director of antiques firm Wartski and Faberge specialist. The ornamental egg is the third of more than 50 Imperial Easter Eggs designed by Carl Faberge for the Russian Royal Family. After the Russian Revolution all the eggs were seized by the Bolsheviks and most were sold to the West. But eight of them are missing, of which only three are believed to have survived the revolution – including this one. It was last seen at an exhibition in St Petersburg in March 1902 and last recorded in Moscow in 1922 . The ornamental egg is the third of more than 50 Imperial Easter Eggs designed by Carl Faberge for the Russian Royal Family . The egg contains a Vacheron Constantin watch which was given by Alexander III to his wife Empress Maria Feodorovna for Easter in 1887. It was last seen at an exhibition in St Petersburg in March 1902 and last recorded in Moscow in 1922. It was only in 2011 that researchers discovered the Third Imperial Egg survived the revolution, and had been sold at an auction in New York in 1964. It had then found its way to a house in the U.S. Midwest overlooking a Dunkin' Donuts. A photo taken at the home shows the coveted egg beside a chocolate cupcake. 'From caviar in Moscow to a cupcake in the American Midwest,' joked McCarthy. 'The seller could never have conceived of the life the czarina lived. And the czarina could not have conceived of the life lived by the finder.' Not surprisingly, the finder intended to sell it immediately. 'A quick turn around,' said McCarthy. But prospective buyers thought he had overestimated the price. And the buyer was too stubborn to take a loss. Lucky for him, one night in 2012, the owner typed ‘Egg’ and ‘Vacheron Constantin’, a named etched on the timepiece, into Google. A newspaper article regarding the egg appeared quoting McCarthy. Mr . McCarthy said: ‘He flew straight over to London and came to see us. 'He . brought pictures of the egg and I knew instantaneously that was it. I . was flabbergasted.' Mr McCarthy flew to . the US to verify the discovery. Given by Alexander III to Empress Marie Feodorovna for Easter in 1887, the jewelled and ridged yellow gold Egg stands on its original tripod pedestal in this picture . 'From caviar to cupcakes': The Faberge sits on the kitchen counter of its Midwestern discoverer, a far cry from the palaces of czarist Russia . 'The czarina could not have conceived of the life lived by the finder': The egg contains a Vacheron Constantin watch which was given by Alexander III to his wife Empress Maria Feodorovna for Easter in 1887 . The third Imperial Easter Egg was last seen at an exhibition in St. Petersburg in March 1902 and last recorded in Moscow in 1922. Like many of the eggs, this one made the trip to America during the Revolution. But it wasn't until 2011 that researchers discovered the egg had survived at at all. The egg had been sold at an auction in 1964. According to Faberge specialist Kieran McCarthy, it fetched far less at the time than it was worth. It's provenance at the time remained unknown. Flash forward to recent years and a Midwestern scrap metal enthusiast purchases it for the worth of its gold, watch, and jewels for around $13K at a Rust Belt rummage sale. The lucky finder snapped a photo of the egg sitting beside a big chocolate cupcake at his home, which sits near a Dunkin' Donuts. 'From caviar in Moscow to a cupcake in the American Midwest,' joked McCarthy. 'The seller could never have conceived of the life the czarina lived. And the czarina could not have conceived of the life lived by the finder.' But he'll soon find out what the luxurious life is like now that his egg has fetched $33 million. He said: ‘I examined it and said, “You . have an Imperial Faberge Easter Egg”, and he practically fainted.’ ‘I . have been around the most marvelous discoveries in the art world, but I . don’t think I’ve ever seen one quite like this – finding extraordinary . treasure in the middle of nowhere.’ McCarthy is as surprised as anyone that the egg resurfaced the way it did, but he sees a true American tale in its discovery. 'The treasures are out there. They're not in the stately homes,' he said. 'This is the ultimate success of that spirit. 'It gives hope to us all.' Wartski bought the egg for a private collector. It is set to be displayed in London from April 14 to 17. As . it returns to a anonymous private collection in a city that remains a . mystery, who knows when the miracle egg will be seen again. 'After that,' said McCarthy, 'it could disappear for another 100 years.'
