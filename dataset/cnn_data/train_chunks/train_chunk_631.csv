The U.S Justice Department is considering whether federal prosecutors should file civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted of both murder and manslaughter charges in the Trayvon Martin case. In a statement on Sunday, the Justice Department said the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for Florida are evaluating evidence. The news comes as President Barack Obama issued a statement calling for calm after George Zimmerman's acquittal in . the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. Scroll down for video . Calm: Barack Obama urged the nation to respect the jury's 'not guilty' verdict, but said his killing was a tragedy for America . Free man: George Zimmerman went into hiding after he was acquitted of all charges in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on Saturday night. He has been described as a 'dead man walking' and has been sent hundreds of death threats . President Obama said the death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy for America but 'the jury had spoken'. He said: 'I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. ‘But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. ‘I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.' The President's statement comes as American cities brace themselves for race riots following the acquittal of the vigilante who shot the unarmed black teenager. George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin as the 17-year-old was returning from a trip to the shops. Prosecutors said Zimmerman was a ‘wannabe cop’ who identified his victim as a potential troublemaker simply by ‘racial profiling’. But jurors accepted the 29-year-old’s claim that he had acted in self-defence after the teenager attacked him. Gunned down: The slaying of Travon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old sparked protests across the country. Police around the nation braced for additional protests as a result of the verdict . Following their lead: Obama urged Americans to respect the call for calm reflection from Trayvon Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton . The six-strong jury included five white women and another woman of undisclosed ethnicity. Protest marches were held within hours of Saturday night’s verdict and violence was reported as far away as Oakland in California. Gangs of youths attacked police and attempted to set cars on fire while others smashed windows in a downtown area. Police swamped the town of Sanford, Florida, where the trial took place and the gated estate where Trayvon was killed was barricaded off to stop any demonstrations. Officers have put in place plans to stop youths from forming ‘flash mobs’ having learned from the London riots where gangs used social media to organise. Zimmerman went into hiding immediately after the verdict. He was described as a ‘dead man walking’, having received numerous death threats. The neighbourhood watch volunteer killed Trayvon in February last year after he spotted the hooded Miami teenager who was visiting a family friend. Zimmerman called police to report an intruder and followed Trayvon in his car. At some point the pair got into a fight and Trayvon was shot once in the chest. Police in Sanford, which is about 30 miles from Orlando, initially failed to arrest Zimmerman. Race riots: Protestors in Oakland set fire to an American flag after the verdict on Saturday . Protests: Marches throughout the U.S have sparked a national debate over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justic . Controversy: The FBI and U.S Attorney's office are reviewing evidence to see if criminal civil rights charges should be filed . The killing was ruled justified under Florida’s controversial ‘stand your ground’ law which allows the use of deadly force if a person is in fear of their life. But after protests across the US, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder. During a three-week trial the case was widely seen to have fallen apart after defence witnesses backed up Zimmerman’s story that he was attacked by Trayvon, who apparently told him he was ‘going to die tonight’. A crucial part of the evidence rested on who was heard on an emergency call screaming for help. Trayvon’s parents said it was their son, while Zimmerman’s family and friends insisted it was him. A forensic expert said the gunshot wound showed Trayvon was on top of Zimmerman when the fatal shot was fired. Legal experts said the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Zimmerman had deliberately killed the teenager. They acknowledged this by asking the judge at the 11th hour to let the jury consider a lesser charge of manslaughter. The jury took 16 hours to find Zimmerman not guilty of all charges. Zimmerman’s defence team said the case would never have gone to trial had he been black. Lawyer Michael O’Mara said the case was taken up by civil rights leaders and Zimmerman was charged for political reasons to create ‘a civil rights event’. Many celebrities took to Twitter to express outrage at the verdict, while the singer Beyonce held a minute’s silence at her concert in Tennessee. Last year, President Obama said: ‘If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.'","Barack Obama spoke after Zimmerman's acquittal, saying Trayvon Martin's killing was a tragedy for America .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:49 EST, 16 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:53 EST, 16 July 2013 . Nigel Farage today launched a blistering attack on Ed Miliband, branding the Labour leader ‘spineless and clueless’ for not standing up to his union paymasters. The UKIP leader tore into the Unite union after his party was branded ‘pre-fascist’ and ‘xenophobic’ in a secret report. And Mr Farage brushed off a poll showing voters switching back to the Tories, insisting the threat he poses to the Tories is ‘more psychological than arithmetical’. Row: UKIP Leader Nigel Farage tore into Labour leader Ed Miliband for not distancing himself from the Unite report describing UKIP as fascist . The explosive Unite report was written by Steve Hart, who has close links with the Labour leadership and was Unite’s political director until he left last month after a power struggle. The confidential report, submitted to a meeting of Unite’s political committee, launches a highly provocative attack on UKIP leader Nigel Farage, warning Mr Miliband not to ‘chase’ his party’s votes. ‘The UKIP vote represents a dangerous, populist Right-wing vote which is swayed by anti-immigrant and anti-European rhetoric – and nostalgia for a comfortable world that never really existed,’ it states. ‘These are all the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements – which is not to say that UKIP is fascist, because it isn’t, but to point to the dangers of ignoring them and the issues or attempting to chase them.’ Warning: Steve Hart, a recent Unite political director, wrote the key report slamming UKIP . Unite has given Labour more than £8million since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010. Today Mr Farage condemned the criticism of UKIP, insisting it was evidence ‘all that is wrong with the Left of British politics’. Writing for MailOnline, Mr Farage said he had previously urged Mr Miliband to ‘condemn inflammatory, narrow minded and provocative behaviour’ by  Unite Against Fascism at a UKIP public meeting in Hove. ‘The reply simply never came. It suits the spineless and clueless Labour leader to promulgate the utterly reprehensible and totally unfounded view that UKIP is somehow xenophobic or dangerous. ‘The only danger we pose is to the other three parties, who have for too long ignored British voters.’ Len McCluskey's Unite has become embroiled in a bitter row with the Labour party over allegations that the union tried to fix candidate selection in Falkirk. It prompted Mr Miliband to announce an overhaul of Labour's union links, including ending the automatic payment of £9million in political levies into party coffers. It has also emerged that Labour has suspended two local councillors who are accused of paying for people to join the party. Following a meeting last night, Pervaz Khan and Derek Loughborough, who sit on Middlesbrough Council, were placed on 'administrative suspension'. It is claimed that the pair recruited people to join the Labour Party after paying their initial subscription fees. In a sign that the row is damaging Labour, a new opinion poll last night put the party neck and neck with the Tories on 36 per cent. While the Tories were up seven points, UKIP was done five points to just seven . The Conservatives believe they have countered some of UKIP’s appeal by backing legislation paving the way for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU to take place by the end of 2017. The Tories were also boosted by Home Secretary Theresa May’s success in finally getting hate preacher Abu Qatada deported to Jordan. But Mr Farage insisted: ‘One deported terrorist suspect does not a summer make.’ He blames the opinion poll on the fact that pollsters ICM do not name UKIP when asking people how they will vote. 'Most of the pollsters don’t know how to handle UKIP, and neither do the political establishment. In some respects, they are all doing us a favour. ‘The arrogance of both sides reveals a deliberately myopic political establishment that would have the UK sleepwalk towards a situation where wholly undesirable organisations such as the EDL gain traction with people who otherwise have absolutely no sympathy with their dangerous views,’ he added. The leaked Unite report sadly underscores all that is wrong with the Left of British politics. When I wrote to Ed Miliband after the protest organised by Unite Against Fascism at the UKIP public meeting in Hove, I would have expected a responsible Party leader to condemn inflammatory, narrow minded and provocative behaviour against valid political debate. The reply simply never came. It suits the spineless and clueless Labour leader to promulgate the utterly reprehensible and totally unfounded view that UKIP is somehow xenophobic or dangerous. The only danger we pose is to the other three parties, who have for too long ignored British voters. What we are looking at is the Left Wing of British politics trying to control the views of their voters, particularly among blue collar workers, while at the same time ignoring their voice. This is a left wing that feels it has an automatic right to that vote, and cannot bear the idea that another party is gaining credence. This is a left wing that cannot fathom that it has ever done anything wrong despite senior Labour figures revealing that they openly courted Eastern European workers to come to the UK in their hundreds of thousands. The report describes the UKIP vote as having the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements. What he is either naively or arrogantly failing to identify is that UKIP is the solution to the problem, not the problem itself. What he calls ‘the UKIP vote’ is a society that feels let down; a society that wants to rise up against a democratic deficit. History has shown us that all too often such a vacuum is easily filled by opportunistic and unsavoury political elements that play upon long ignored societal issues and dissatisfaction to further their own ill ends. The political class should be grateful that a responsible, reasonable and rational political power is representing the unheard voices underpinning this discontent. In the battle against fascism, UKIP is far and above the best medicine. In the UK, and indeed across Europe, people have felt unrepresented and ignored for too long, while great change such as mass immigration set against a backdrop of economic turmoil has not only been ignored but wilfully swept under the carpet. Yet instead of reading the signs, Unite and The Labour Party instead obsess over their self-preservation. Where voters are turning to UKIP, they wish to discredit and destroy our party, rather than seeking to understand the needs of the people increasingly identifying with our policies. The problem, to them, is UKIP. Not the fact that they are not listening to the electorate, whereas we are. But it's not just the Labour party who are missing the point about the UKIP surge. Today's ICM poll showing - astonishingly - the Tories and Labour on 36 per cent is a symptom of a political class more interested in polling data backing up their pre conceived views. Just as the media have their favourite political parties, polling companies now lean towards their own politics with the results being skewed in favour of the paymaster's allegiance. Just as a bookmaker at a race course would slash the odds on a favourite horse to encourage punters to put their money on the least risky option, political parties want voters to go with the same urge of 'backing the favourite'. I've often said I thought the effect of UKIP on the Conservative Party was more psychological than arithmetical but when political parties rely on manipulated data sets they risk once again ignoring what gets people voting UKIP. It's not a risk for me, of course. It's always been UKIP's unique selling point that we actually listen to the people rather than convince ourselves that the public think we've all the answers and nothing to improve upon. Because what happens is that election time comes as a bitter disappointment. I'm not taking the ICM poll to heart today despite calls from many quarters saying that the Tories have effectively managed to 'squeeze UKIP out'. One deported terrorist suspect does not a summer make. If the data had been from a pollster who prompted UKIP in the first round maybe I'd be more concerned but the figure they have UKIP on, 7 per cent, is the same figure they polled us at a mere two months before our best ever election result, scoring an average of 25 per cent where we stood. Most of the pollsters don’t know how to handle UKIP, and neither do the political establishment. In some respects, they are all doing us a favour. The arrogance of both sides reveals a deliberately myopic political establishment that would have the UK sleepwalk towards a situation where wholly undesirable organisations such as the EDL gain traction with people who otherwise have absolutely no sympathy with their dangerous views. We are not afraid to talk about immigration and the EU, even if we must suffer the name calling and abuse, for we understand how important these issues are to any society. These last few weeks, both Unite and The Labour Party have demonstrated a distasteful and corrupt obsession with forcibly trying to dominate the political landscape, by any means. It is time the Left Wing stopped focusing on their selves and started waking up to what the people of Britain really want. This blind, narrow minded hostility towards UKIP is a blind narrow minded hostility towards Britain itself.","Secret report by Unite union branded UKIP ‘pre-fascist’ and ‘xenophobic’

Art experts at a Romanian museum are analysing ashes found in a stove to see if they are the remains of seven paintings by Monet, Picasso and others said to be worth around £100million that were stolen in a brazen heist last year. Romania's Natural History Museum is looking at the ashes after Olga Dogaru, the mother of one of three Romanian suspects charged with stealing the artworks from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam, claimed that she burned the paintings in her oven. Prosecutors claim that Ms Dogaru feared for her son Radu when he was arrested in January following the early morning raid last October. Stolen: 'Reading Girl in White and Yellow' by Henri Matisse, left, and 'Harlequin Head' by Pablo Picasso, right, were two of the seven paintings stolen from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam last October . Destroyed? Charing Cross Bridge, London by Claude Monet is one of the more famous works that Ms Dogaru claims to have burned . Gone: Waterloo Bridge, London by Claude Monet has not been seen since the theft in October 2012 . Ms Dogaru claims that she buried the art in an abandoned house and dug them up a month later before burning them when detectives began searching the village for them. Prosecution spokesman Gabriela Chiru said that the authorities did not necessarily believe Ms Dogaru's claims and added that it could be months before test results are conclusive. Thieves managed to bypass the sophisticated alarm system, in what police say was a well-prepared 3am robbery at the Kunsthal last autumn. The seven paintings stolen were Monet’s Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge (both 1901), Picasso’s Harlequin Head (1971), Matisse’s Reading Girl In White And Yellow (1919)  and Lucian Freud’s Woman With Eyes Closed (2002), Gauguin’s Girl in Front of Open Window (1898) and Meyer de Haan’s Autoportrait (1890). Missing: Prosecutors say that they do not necessarily believe Ms Dogaru's claims that she destroyed the paintings including Girl in Front of Open Window by Paul Gauguin, pictured . Robbery: Self-Portrait' by Meyer de Haan, left, and Woman with Eyes Closed by Lucian Freud, right, were two of a collection of 150 paintings on display in Rotterdam at the time of the heist . The theft was one of the art world's most dramatic in recent years and one of the biggest ever to take place in the Netherlands. The Kunsthal exhibition, displaying a large part of the Triton Foundation's avant-garde collection for the first time in one gallery, opened just a few days before the heist to celebrate Kunsthal's 20th anniversary. The Triton Foundation exhibition was showing works by more than 150 famed artists, including Alexander Calder, Paul Cezanne, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, August Rodin, and Andy Warhol. Disappeared: An empty space where one of Henri Matisse's stolen paintings was on display is pictured following the heist . The Kunsthal, meaning 'art gallery' in Dutch, is a display space that has no permanent collection of its own. The collection was put together by the Cordia family, which made its fortune in shipping and oil and which ranks among the 100 richest families in the Netherlands, according to Dutch media. Radu Dogaru, the alleged ringleader, as well as the two other suspects remain in custody as investigators seek the paintings and other evidence.

You might think with names like French fries and Worcestershire sauce, it would be pretty self-explanatory where certain foods came from. But a survey has revealed that on average, most people were unaware where some of the most common foods consumed every day first originated. The majority of those questioned - 70 per cent of 1,003 people - were confident they had a good knowledge of foreign foods. Think you know your foods? Few people surveyed correctly identified the origin of fajitas which first originated in the U.S. - not Mexico . However, 64 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively, incorrectly guessed where French fries and pasta were first created. Over three-quarters of those surveyed incorrectly believed that chilli con carne was first eaten in Mexico, not the U.S., while only 10 per cent knew the correct origins of cheesecake – Ancient Greece. More than 90 per cent of us are fooled by the deceptive name of Worcestershire sauce, which was created in Bengal and not the west midlands of England, while only 11 per cent of people know the correct birthplace of French fries (Belgium).

'He served in the Boer War, First World War, and Second World War; was shot in the face, head, stomach, ankle, leg, hip, and ear; survived a plane crash; tunnelled out of a POW camp; and bit off his own fingers when a doctor refused to amputate them.

Eleven of the 14 hospital trusts investigated by Sir Bruce Keogh have been put into ‘special measures’ and hit squads will be sent in to help them improve care, Jeremy Hunt announced yesterday. These experts may decide to sack chief executives and other top managers if they think they are not up to scratch – although officials will be handed a stay of execution to see if they can turn their hospitals around. The 11 ‘mediocre’ NHS trusts in special measures are: North Cumbria; Northern Lincolnshire and Goole; Tameside; United Lincolnshire; Basildon and Thurrock, Essex; Burton, Staffordshire; East Lancashire; George Eliot, Nuneaton, Warwickshire; Sherwood Forest; Buckinghamshire; and Medway, Kent. Victim: Terry Day, 35, pictured with fiancee Samantha Blythe, was mistaken for a drunk by hospital staff in Basildon, Essex, when in fact he had a fatal brain tumour . Three other trusts – based in Blackpool, Colchester and Dudley – will not be put into special measures and have been given the chance to improve care themselves. Six of the 11 going into special measures are ‘foundation’ trusts – a coveted status brought in under Labour which was meant to reward the best-performing hospitals. They are: Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, Tameside, Basildon and Thurrock, Burton, Sherwood Forest and Medway. Sir Bruce said: ‘Mediocrity is simply not good enough and, based on the findings from this review I have set out an achievable ambition which will help these hospitals improve dramatically over the next two years.’ Mr Hunt said that 11 of the trusts would be put into ‘special measures’ for ‘fundamental breaches of care’. He told MPs: ‘No statistics are perfect but mortality rates suggest that since 2005 thousands more people may have died that would normally be expected at the 14 trusts reviewed.’ BASILDON & THURROCK . Victims . included Terry Day, 35, who died after nurses ignored the fact that he . had a brain tumour, instead believing he was just ‘a drunk’. Lucy .

Receptionists are deciding how swiftly patients are seen in A&E because of an extraordinary shortage of nurses, according to the report. The administrative staff are making decisions which would normally be taken by taken by medical practitioners. Ruth May, nurse director for NHS Midlands and East, said: ‘In some hospitals, in some ward areas, there was inadequate staffing – we heard from patients about call bells going off for longer periods than they should have been. I held the hand of a patient – just to comfort them – because the nurses did not have sufficient time to do that. The King's Mill Centre in Nottinghamshire which is part of the Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust which has been under review by NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made a statement about the damning report . ‘I observed some aspects of care that did lack compassion. I would argue that we saw that at the same time as seeing poor levels of staffing.’ The report found nursing shortages at all 14 organisations – particularly at nights and weekends – with some nurses left on their own in charge of 15 patients. Inspectors also found receptionists deciding how quickly patients are seen in A&E at Sherwood Forest Hospitals. Patients are told to tell staff on the front desk if they have chest pain otherwise they join the back of the queue. The inspectors found a queue of eight patients waiting to be assessed by a secretary at the casualty unit at Princess Diana hospital in Grimsby, part of the United Lincolnshire and Goole NHS trust. Earlier this year a major study found that patients are 10 per cent more likely to die if there are not enough nurses on wards as they are more likely to suffer complications. Yet official figures show that the numbers of nurses in the NHS has increased by a third since 1997 – when Labour came to power – up from 261,000 to 350,000 today. Healthcare experts and unions argue that more nurses are needed on the wards compared to several decades ago as higher numbers of patients in hospital are elderly and require dedicated care. But the Royal College of Nursing is concerned that the Government has begun slashing nurses’ posts and claims that 6,000 have been lost since 2010. Yesterday the RCN and Unison demanded that the NHS impose compulsory safe staffing levels with minimum numbers of nurses on each wards. Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘There’s an undeniable link between nurse staffing levels and patient mortality and we can’t keep failing to address this issue.’ 1997: Labour wins the election and takes charge of an NHS budget of just over £33billion. At first, it sticks to Tory spending limits. 2000: Tony Blair goes on Breakfast with Frost to announce plans to increase NHS spending to bring it up to the European average, without warning Gordon Brown . 2000: Alan Milburn’s NHS plan imposes targets to reduce waiting lists, later blamed for prompting managers to ignore care standards. He also says thousands more nurses will be trained . 2001: Gordon Brown unveils five-year spending plan to bring the NHS budget up to European levels by 2008 . 2002: An independent review by ex-NatWest boss Derek Wanless calls for a huge increase in NHS spending. Brown responds with a 1p rise in National Insurance. 2003: But much of the money goes towards a top-down reorganisation of the NHS, such as the formation of foundation trusts and the replacement of health authorities with primary care trusts. Thousands more managers employed. 2004: Much of the extra money goes not to patients but towards extra pay for GPs and consultants, who see their pay soar at the same time as opting out of responsibility for out-of-hours care. 2006: Despite all the billions, a third of trusts face severe financial problems. Many are forced to close wards and cut staff . 2007: First of a series of scandals as it emerges that 90 patients died from C. Diff at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust – because managers were obsessed with targets. 2009: Mid Staffs scandal emerges: up to 1,200 die on filthy and short-staffed wards. Health Secretary Andy Burnham orders an investigation but refuses to hold a full public inquiry. 2010: Labour loses the election, spending almost £100billion annually on the NHS – almost triple the level when it took over.","11 of the 14 hospital trusts investigated put into 'special measures'

A grieving mother has called for a ban on coach operators using old tyres after a coroner ruled that the failure of a tyre that was nearly 20 years old caused the crash which killed three people, including her 18-year-old son, on their way back from a music festival. Surrey coroner Richard Travers questioned why it was legal for such old tyres to be used after hearing how driver Colin Daulby battled to control the 52-seat coach on the A3 in Surrey. As the front nearside tyre blew out the vehicle was sent veering up an embankment, through a fence and into a tree. Scroll down for Video... Emergency services at the scene of a coach crash on the A3 near Hindhead in Surrey, in which three people died. Questions were raised as to why there is no restriction on age of tyres . Mr Daulby, 63, from Warrington, died along with passengers Kerry Ogden, 23, of Maghull, Liverpool, and musician Michael Molloy, 18, from Woolton, Liverpool. Mr Travers said he would be writing to the Department for Transport to highlight the issue. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Molloy’s mother Frances Molloy called for a change in the law. Among the dead: Teenager Michael Molloy, of Walton, Liverpool, and Kerry Ogden, 23, of Maghull, Merseyside, were on the coach which crashed on its way to Merseyside from the Isle Of Wight Bestival Music Festival.  A verdict of accidental death was given by the coroner, despite the coach having 20 year old tyres . Coach driver Colin Daulby, from Warrington, was at the wheel before the coach veered off the road and ploughed into a tree. He had just seconds to react . 'It’s shocking that we do not have legislation about the age of tyres in this country and we never want any other family to go through what has happened,' she told reporters. 'If that tyre had been of a good age Michael, Kerry and Colin would be alive.' Mr Molloy and Miss Ogden were sitting in window seats in the two rows directly behind the driver and all three died instantly in the crash from multiple injuries. Mr Daulby, described as an experienced, safe and careful driver, had only three seconds to react and was helpless to prevent the crash. Three people dead: Emergency crews on the scene: The mangled remains of the coach being recovered from the roadside on the A3 . Another young victim: English graduate Karen Ogden, of Maghull, Merseyside, was described as keen on music and she had been to Bestival several times . The coach, operated by Merseypride Travel, was heading back to Merseyside from the Bestival festival on the Isle of Wight just before midnight on September 10 last year. The company is due at Guildford Magistrates’ Court on August 12 to answer a charge of using a defective tyre on the vehicle, but not the one that caused the accident. Concluding the inquest into the tragedy today, Mr Travers said the 'catastrophic failure' of the tyre, which was two years older than the coach, had caused the accident and he recorded a verdict of accidental death. Where it happened . 'The real explanation that this tyre failed so catastrophically is through age,' he said. 'I formally announce that I will be writing a rule 43 report to draw attention to the Minister for Transport of the very dangers caused by the fact that vehicles, be they private, commercial or public, are legally able to drive on tyres without restriction on age, and by reason of age are potentially in a perilous condition, which there is no realistic means of detecting.' The two-day inquest heard that the tyre had been bought second hand, had never been retreaded and was perfectly legal to use. There were no other defects to the 17-year-old coach that contributed to the crash. But tyre expert David Price said the tyre was 'abnormally old' and that caused the accident as it finally failed. 'It is known that tyres deteriorate significantly with age,' he said. There are presently no laws to stop old tyres being used but some car manufacturers recommend tyres more than 10 years old are scrapped. Mr Price explained that the tyre had been delaminating, or falling apart internally, for perhaps months but this would not have been noticeable to the eye. He said that it was only half worn so had either been a spare or in storage for years. He added that a lack of a legal requirement about the age of tyres was 'frustrating'. The vehicle was full of friends who had left Merseyside on September 5 to go south for the festival and each paid £56 to hire the coach. Survivors spoke of waking up and seeing the tree looming towards them as the coach went up the embankment, then scrambling out while smelling fuel. Many suffered serious injuries, the inquest in Woking, Surrey, was told. Janet Fields, who was driving her ex-partner Troy Walter, was behind the coach and said in a statement: 'It just left the road. There were no brake lights, no skidding - it just glided off the road and then up the embankment.' Mr Molloy had just turned 18 and was a 'talented and gifted musician'. The teenager was once a member of the aspiring Liverpool band Hostile Radio but had gone solo. English graduate Miss Ogden was described as keen on music and she had been to Bestival several times. Her father Robert Ogden said his daughter had the travelling bug and hoped to teach English abroad. Mr Daulby was described as a safe and considerate driver who loved his part-time job with the company. Tests showed he had not consumed alcohol or drugs. Mrs Molloy said she would consider legal action against the coach operators. 'If Merseypride Travel can be held to account for this then that is what we will do.' She pointed out that the tyre was older than her son, adding: 'We have heard horrendous evidence and this has traumatised so many families. There were 52 really happy and healthy people on that coach. Michael’s friend Zack Washington had suffered life changing injuries.'","Driver Colin Daulby battled to control the coach on the A3 as tyre blew out .

Court session: Chris Brown appeared in a Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday where a judge revoked his probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009 due to an alleged hit-and-run incident in May . The Los Angeles County District . Attorney's Office had earlier filed court documents asking a judge to . revoke Brown's probation, according to a report in TMZ. The request was made because Brown allegedly left the scene after rear-ending a woman's Mercedes-Benz in May. The . Mercedes driver, Olga Gure-Kovalenko, claimed that Brown refused to . hand over his driver's license, registration and insurance information . after the accident. Defense table: Chris and his attorney Mark Geragos appeared together in court . Free man: Brown had his probation revoked but remained free pending another court hearing in August . Brown was with his other on-and-off girlfriend Karreuche Tran at the time. Legal documents filed by prosecutors claimed that Brown 'willfully and unlawfully' broke the law in the hit-and-run incident. Even if the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office does not pursue the case because the victim doesn't want to prosecute Brown, the county district attorney will seek revocation because Brown was supposed to obey all laws as a term of his probation. Probation revoked: Brown, shown performing in June in Los Angeles, was placed on five years probation after pleading guilty in 2009 to assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna . Prosecutors in their court filing asked the judge to revoke Brown's probation and immediately remand him into custody. The request was a standard one and it was not expected that Brown would be jailed. If the judge revokes Brown's probation following the August hearing, he faces four years in prison. Brown's representatives released a statement on Monday saying the lawyer for the alleged hit-and-run victim said his client did not want to press charges. The lawyer specified that any damage was 'negligible' and Brown identified himself and gave appropriate insurance information. 'We are hopeful the case will be dismissed next week,' the statement said. The judge supervising Brown's probation was required to revoke it due to the hit-and-run charge, but once the case is dismissed it was expected that probation would be reinstated on the same terms and conditions, the statement said. Probation hearing: Chris Brown, shown in Los Angeles in February, was ordered back to court in August .","Brown's lawyer says he hopes to have May hit-and-run case dismissed next week and probation reinstated .

The first plane to be designated as Air Force One in the 1950s has been abandoned in a field at a southern Arizona airport. The aircraft that once spirited President Dwight D. Eisenhower on cross-country voyages sits in a dusty 10-acre parcel of land at Marana Regional Airport, decaying under the unrelenting glare of the sun. 'I think it's one of these big secrets that, really, few people know that it's out there,' airport manager Steve Miller said. 'It's sad that it's just sitting out there, considering its history over the past 70 years.' Original: The first Air Force One aircraft is housed at the Marana regional airport . Abandoned: The plane, pictured, is almost forgotten at a field in Arizona . The original Air Force One is a Lockheed VC-121 Constellation 48-610 that was built in California in 1948. The next year it was converted to carry VIPs and re-designated as a VC-121A. It was named Columbine II after the state flower of Colorado, the home state of first lady Mamie Eisenhower. In 1953 it became the official presidential aircraft until it was replaced in 1954, when it became the primary backup aircraft, according to The Arizona Daily Star. After a brief civilian stint with Pan American, the aircraft carried Eisenhower for a final time on Oct. 25, 1959, on a trip from Augusta, Georgia, to Washington, D.C. Historic: The Columbine II, a Lockheed VC-121 Constellation 48-610, was built in Burbank, California, in 1948 . First Lady: The plane was affectionately named after the columbine, state flower of Colorado, the home of first lady Mamie Eisenhower, pictured right with her husband . It served as a VIP transport at . Washington National Airport and Maryland's Andrews Air Force Base before . it was retired and flown to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 1968. It . was stripped of its identity and fitted with mismatched landing gear. Mel Christler of Christler Flying Service bought the aircraft, along with four others, in a 1970 surplus auction, not knowing its true identity. He hoped to convert it to an aerial sprayer, but the plane would not fly due to the landing gear problem. Christler learned of the plane's history in 1980 when Smithsonian Institution curator Robert Mikesh tracked down its whereabouts and contacted him. Replaced: A new Air Force One, pictured, replaced the Columbine in 1954 and carried President Eisenhower, pictured with Vice President Richard Nixon in 1955, on his official trips . Dusty field: The first Air Force One aircraft, pictured right from above, is housed at the Marana Regional Airport in southern Arizona . Christler and some partners completed . a $150,000 restoration of the Columbine in 1990, reintroducing it to . the public and participating in the Eisenhower Centennial celebration in . Abilene, Kansas. After . appearances in air shows, it was parked in Roswell and Santa Fe, New . Mexico, until 1998. Efforts to sell the aircraft at auction were . unsuccessful, and it was parked at the Marana airport in 2005 in a lease . agreement. Marana Regional Airport, which opened in 1943, generates revenue by leasing parcels of its 600 acres. The aircraft has no hangar to shelter it from the sun's rays, which are gradually breaking down the aircraft inside and out. Later versions: President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline disembark from a later version of the Air Force One jet liner in May 1961 at Paris Orly airport . Football: President Ronald Reagan throws a football toward the press as he boards yet another Air Force One in Cleveland, Ohio in January 1988 . 'In its glory days it had marbled floors,' Miller said. 'Now it just looks like any old, beat-up aircraft sitting there.' The plane is owned by Christler's business partner, Harry Oliver of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Timothy Coons, a contractor who serves as the plane's caretaker, is looking for a museum willing to take it and restore it. 'Like any machine like that, the interiors are slowly degrading because of the heat,' Coons told the Star, adding that it would take $200,000 and 30 days of work by a team of mechanics to restore. 'We're trying to find a good home,' Coons said. 'It's not doing any justice just sitting here.'

A couple has been arrested for allegedly crashing a wedding at a Mormon church and stealing $550 from the gift table after seeing the wedding announcement in a local newspaper. Richard Duran and Tarnya Muir, both 46, went to the church in Price, Utah on Friday after getting a ride from Duran's cousin. They allegedly told him they wanted to pass on their congratulations to the bride and groom - but in fact, police believe they went with the intention to steal from the newlyweds. 'We believe they looked in the paper, there was a [wedding] announcement, they saw that and they decided, ""Let's go to that reception"",' Price Police Capt. Bill Barnes told the Deseret News. Busted: Tarnya Muir, left, and her boyfriend Richard Duran, right, have been arrested for allegedly stealing cash gifts from a wedding. They told police they knew the bride and groom - but couldn't remember their names . 'Plot': Duran and Muir, pictured, got a ride with his cousin and claimed they wanted to wish the couple well . Muir allegedly went to the table where guests had placed gifts and cards containing money for the couple, Ryan and Keosha Rasmussen. Once there, the 83-year-old grandmother of the groom spotted Muir filling her bag with cards, according to witnesses at the event. When another relative asked her if she had taken the cards, Muir denied it, they added. 'My daughter followed her and could see the envelopes in the purse, so she grabbed the purse and knocked the lady down,' the groom's mother, Kaye Rasmussen, said. 'The lady kicked her.' Victims: Ryan and Keosha Rasmussen were unable to enjoy usual wedding celebrations, such as cutting the cake, because their guests were making witness statements to police following the theft . Scene: After leaving the church in Price, Utah, they drove away but were chased by wedding guests . Duran then allegedly pulled the purse from Rasmussen's daughter and the thieves fled to the cousin's car outside the church. Relatives of the newlyweds also jumped into a car and chased the pair as other family members called 911. Officers caught up with the chase as it came to a stop on the edge of Price. Police said they recovered 20 cards containing around $550. Muir told police she was friends with the bride - but allegedly could not remember her name. Duran and Muir were booked into the Carbon County Jail for investigation of theft. The cousin who drove the couple to the church was not arrested. Reminiscent: Actors Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are pictured in the 2005 movie Wedding Crashers - but police say Muir and Duran's plans to steal from the party were much more malicious . 'We've had these incidents before but nothing this blatant from career criminals targeting a reception,' Barnes told the Deseret News. The newlyweds are now enjoying a honeymoon cruise but Kaye Rasmussen said the incident upset their wedding. 'We missed some of the little things, like cutting the cake and the dance, because everyone was filling out police reports,' she said. 'But they'll have something to tell their kids. It's kind of a unique memory.'","When police caught Richard Duran and Tarnya Muir they said they knew the newlyweds - but could not remember their names .

NeverWet to the test: The $20 product, launching this week at Home Depot, is a superhydrophobic spray that actively repels liquids to protect clothes, shoes, and even electronics . End result: As chocolate sauce was poured over the treated spot on Mr Lauer's pants, the liquid slid right off; Ms Guthrie exclaimed, 'Woo, it works!' NeverWet was originally designed by Ross Technology, which was faced with the challenge of fixing rusting pipes under the sea, and set to work to . find a substance that would coat and protect the metal. Available to buy: The $20 product is available at Home Depot, and will soon be available at other U.S. stores . In . the course of their experimentation, they found the resulting . substance - a silicone-based spray - could have infinite uses in the . worlds of fashion, technology and engineering. Not only is NeverWet, the first such . consumer product to enter the market, impervious to any liquid . substance, including oils, mud and condiments, but it actively deflects . moisture leaving no trace whatsoever on its surface. In a video released by the company, a . man in pristine white deck shoes - one coated in NeverWet, one simply . plain canvas - jumps into a muddy puddle. After swishing his feet around in the muck, he steps out to reveal the uncoated shoe covered in a thick layer of mud. As . the NeverWet coated shoe emerges however, the mud shoots off the . surface, leaving the canvas bone dry and completely unmarked. In another demonstration, chocolate sauce is poured onto the coated shoe, which slips off leaving not a trace. And on a treated white T-shirt, engine . oil, apple sauce and orange juice form convex fluid globules that speed . off the surface of the fabric. Not only could footwear companies use . the coating to thoroughly waterproof their shoes, but a fabric with . such effective repellant qualities could prove priceless to firms . producing ski equipment, sailing and fishing gear or wet weather . clothing, as well as being used as a protector for upholstery, . tablecloths or napkins in restaurants. No more stains: NeverWet, the first such consumer product to enter the market, is impervious to any liquid substance, including oils, mud and condiments, and actively deflects moisture . Waterproof: In this demonstration, mustard is poured onto the coated shoe, which slips off leaving just a few beads behind, which then brush off . And its uses can extend beyond simple fabric treatment too.

Repelling soda: The coating could prove priceless to firms producing ski equipment, sailing and fishing gear or wet weather clothing, as well as being used as a protector for upholstery, tablecloths or napkins in restaurants . How it works: NeverWet creates microscopic nano-particles across the surface it coats, when liquids hit the superhydrophobic barrier, it forms a nearly circular bead that causes the liquid to shoot off the surface . This . so-called superhydrophic substance was developed only in the last . decade as scientists tried to mimic the water-repellent properties of . the Asian lotus plant. Research found that, contrary to expectations, smooth surfaces actually encourage liquids to stick. NeverWet creates microscopic nano-particles across the surface it coats. When . water hits the coating's superhydrophobic barrier, it forms a nearly . circular bead that either causes the liquid to shoot off the surface or . never cling there in the first place.

Water damage no more: Studies have proved it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets; protecting iPhones that previously would have been rendered useless after being submerged in water . Among other things, it can be used on metal, wood, masonry and aluminum as well as fabric, leather and canvas. According to Ross Technology, applications of NeverWet can be as diverse as making toilet plungers water repellant so they attract less bacteria, forming anti-corrosive coatings on metal, and as an anti-icing device, protecting surfaces prone to freezing, such as aeroplanes, piping and electrical transmission lines.",The superhydrophobic spray is now available at Home Depot for $20 .

'Ignorance': Half of German school children were unaware that life under Hitler's Third Reich was a dictatorship . Half of German schoolchildren do not know that the Third Reich was a dictatorship, a survey has found. More than 50 per cent of the teenagers polled were also unaware that the East German state was also a tyrannical regime run by communists. Despite being obliged to visit a concentration camp  at least once in their schooldays and learning about Hitler's seizure of power, German students showed a lack of knowledge about their roots. The widespread ignorance is detailed in a study called, 'Late Victory of the Dictatorships?' after a recent survey conducted by researchers at the Free University in Berlin. 'This is shocking,' said study author Klaus Schroeder. More than 7,500 school pupils aged around 15 were asked how they viewed the various governments that have ruled Germany. Only around half were definite that the Nazi government was a dictatorship - despite the country at the time being ruled ruthlessly by one party from 1933 to 1945. Just over a third were certain that the former East German government - established by the Russians and controlled between 1949 and 1990- was also a communist dictatorship. Only about half said the former West German government was a democracy. Followers: More than 100,000 Nazi Storm Troopers gather at Luitpold arena to listen to a speech by Hitler. Opposition in the dictatorship was brutally crushed . A deceased honorary ceremony held during the 'Reichstag' in Nuremberg with Adolf Hitler, second from right, in 1935 . Astonishingly, only around 60 per cent were certain that the current united German government was democratic. 'The low estimation of historical knowledge is clearly having an effect,' Mr Schroeder added. 'These students have almost no political knowledge at all. They have no . idea about words like ""Meinungsfreiheit"" [freedom of speech] nor of . concepts like human rights,' 'The schools really should take action.' German schoolchildren have to visit a concentration camp such as Auschwitz, pictured, at least once, but they were still ignorant of the country's past . The students most able to tell the difference between dictatorship and democracy were in the former eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony Anhalt, while those with the least idea were from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia - Germany's most populated, and the most damaged by bombing aside from Berlin in WW2. The Third Reich is the name that was given to Germany while Hitler ruled the country from 1933. Immediately after coming to power, Hitler destroyed all political opposition was eliminated - a hallmark of a totalitarian regime. The Gestapo - secret state police - and the SS obliterated liberals, socialists and communists. This was followed by the holocaust, in which Jews were slaughtered.","Most pupils unaware of past were from North Rhine Westphalia - the region worst affected by bombing outside Berlin .

Convicted paedophile Shawn Sullivan has been a wanted man since 1994 for allegedly molesting two 11-year-old girls and having unlawful sex with a girl of 14 in Minnesota. If extradited to America  and found guilty he could face 25 years jail on each count. But two senior judges demanded assurances from the US Government that Sullivan - who lives in the affluent London suburb of Barnes with his Ministry of Justice worker wife - would not be put into a controversial sex offenders' treatment programme. Shawn Sullivan, a paedophile who is one of America's most wanted men, will be allowed to stay in the UK with his partner, 34-year-old MoJ policy manager Sarah Smith . Today they refused to comply, and so the judges turned down the plea to return him to the US. Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Eady both believe the programme, known as 'civil commitment', would be a 'flagrant denial' of his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. But critics will see it as another example of the one-sided extradition treaty between the two countries. Last week it emerged that seven times more British citizens have been sent to the US under the lopsided Extradition Act than Americans sent in the opposite direction. Home Office figures reveal how the treaty at the centre of the case against Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon is being used by the US authorities far more often than their British counterparts. Gary McKinnon who is fighting extradition to the US after allegedly hacking into Pentagon and Nasa computers between February 2001 and March 2002 while searching for evidence of 'little green men' Sullivan, who has joint Irish/US nationality - who also goes under the name O'Suilleabhain - was given a suspended jail sentence in Ireland in 1996 for sexually assaulting two 12-year-old girls. He was arrested in London in June 2010 while living with 34-year-old MoJ policy manager Sarah Smith in Barnes, South West London. They married in Wandsworth Prison before he was granted bail and tagged. But lawyers for Sullivan - who has been put on America's most-wanted sex criminals list - said if returned he could be declared 'sexually dangerous' and jailed without trial and with no hope of release. The judges gave the US authorities until today to give an assurance that he would not be put on the civil commitment programme and be given a fair trial. Sullivan was given a suspended jail sentence in Ireland in 1996 for sexually assaulting two 12-year-old girls . Today Lord Justice Moses confirmed that that 'the United States will not provide an assurance' that Sullivan would not be entered into the programme. As a result his appeal would be allowed and extradition refused. Sullivan originally from Fort Benning, Georgia, has remained here pending extradition proceedings. Although on the list of America's most wanted criminals he went undetected until 2007 when he was added to Interpol's most wanted list. In December 2010 Senior District Judge Riddle said there was no reason not to order extradition and sent the request from the US Government Home Secretary Theresa May. In February last year she rejected representations on his behalf and ordered extradition. But in refusing to give the go ahead Lord Justice Moses said there was a 'real risk' that if sent back his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights might be violated. Under civil commitment, the court was told, someone could be held with no hope of release even though they had not been convicted of any offence. Lord Justice Moses added: 'I emphasise again that my judgment rests solely on my conclusion that the is a real risk that if extradited the appellant might be subject to an order for civil commitment within Minnesota, and that that amounts to a risk that he would suffer a flagrant denial of his rights.' He said under the programme: 'There is no requirement that the offences took place recently, nor , indeed, that the misconduct resulted in conviction, provided that the misconduct is substantiated by credible evidence.' He said because the United States may now wish to given an assurance and because if he allowed the appeal it may be to no avail, he was adjourning the case for further argument. Mr Justice Eady agreed and said the material before them 'reveals that there is more than a fanciful risk that the appellant would become subject to the civil commitment process'. In the absence of any undertaking 'he would suffer a flagrant breach of his rights' under the Convention, which protects against loss of liberty without a proper hearing.","Shawn Sullivan has been a wanted man .

And Kim Kardashian is so passionate about make-up that she and her sisters have just launched their own beauty range. Despite all this, her boyfriend Kanye West is actually a fan of the low maintenance look and prefers Kim - who has famously revealed the work that goes into her beauty routine - without a scrap of make-up. Revelation: Kim Kardashian has revealed in an interview that rapper beau Kanye West actually prefers her more natural look . The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star revealed 36-year-old Kanye's preference for her bare-faced look in an interview with Feelunique.com. She said: 'He loves the dress up aspect, but he also likes me without make-up on.' And it seems that Kim is taking a more relaxed approach to her beauty regime because of this. A source told Us Weekly that she hasn't worn any make-up since the arrival of her daughter four weeks ago. 'She has always had a schedule with every hour of the day taken,' 'Now, she hasn’t had her hair or make-up done since she had the baby,' said the insider. How he likes her: Whilst Kim said that Kanye likes it when she dresses up (R) he loves her without make-up (L) and a source has revealed that she hasn't even worn any make-up since the birth of her daughter a month ago .

A police officer in Seattle is being investigated after a video appeared online appearing to show him urinating against a wall while on duty. The Seattle Police Department has launched an internal review after the video appearing to show the officer literally caught with his pants down was posted on YouTube. Apparently filmed behind some shops in the Washington city, the officer is seen to pull up in his patrol car in what appears at first to be a routine security check. Scroll down for video . On duty: The police officer was seen on camera getting out of his patrol car on what appeared to be a routine security check behind some shops . Not wanting to be caught: The officer looks around to check that no one is watching him . Caught in the act: The officer then appears to undo his trousers and urinates against a wall . But when the officer approaches a corner by the bins and appears to undo his trousers as he checks to see that no one is watching, it becomes clear that he is more worried about being caught than catching anyone else up to no good. He then appears to urinate on the wall. Unbeknown to the officer, he is standing directly below a CCTV camera which is recording his every move. When he realises his mistake, he is seen to utter something in alarm before heading out of shot. He eventually gets back into his patrol car and drives away. Busted: The officer gets a shock when he looks up and spots the CCTV camera above his head . Gone: After disappearing briefly, the officer makes a hasty retreat back to his police car before driving away . The video has reportedly been passed on to the officer's commander as well as the force's Office of Professional Accountability for investigation. The officer's actions have left local business owners, fed up of people using the area as a public toilet, unimpressed according to Komonews.com. Liz Warren, who manages a local photography store, said: 'It's a terrible thing for a police officer who's supposed to be getting people in trouble for this kind of thing, and then they're going and doing it.' But not only is the officer annoying the locals, he is also breaking the law - urinating in public is illegal according to the Seattle Municipal Code. The fine if caught is $27.","The officer was caught on CCTV urinating behind a shop in Seattle .

A single Twitter user is behind the online uproar on Monday that pressured literary agent Sharlene Martin to drop a book deal with a member of the jury for George Zimmerman's murder trial. User @MoreAndAgain expressed her outrage on Twitter Monday evening after the juror, identified only as juror B37, revealed that she was planning to write a book about the trial. The user dug up the name of the literary agency, Martin Literary Management, that was planning to represent the juror and encouraged users to message the agency's owner, Sharlene Martin. To aid in the process, @MoreAndAgain posted Martin's phone, email and business address - as well as her Twitter handle. 'Only thing I can think to do is flood Sharlene Martin's phone, email, and snail mail, w/ requests that she drop juror B37. That sound good?' @MoreAndAgain wrote at 8 p.m. Monday, just before posting Martin's personal information. The Twitter user took the further step of launching an online petition on Change.org, which quickly gathered more than a thousand signatures, and prompted Martin to message @MoreAndAgain directly. 'I appreciate your passion for the death . of Travyon Martin. Stand by for a message shortly. I grieve his death as . well,' she wrote, according to @MoreAndAgain. Literary agent Sharlene Martin, left, . said the book would explain why the jury decided Zimmerman was not . guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, right, . due to Florida's laws . Within an hour, Martin sent another direct message that read: 'After careful consideration regarding the proposed book project with Zimmerman Juror B37, I have decided to rescind my offer of representation in the exploration of a book based upon this case.' Around midnight, Martin released a similar statement to the Associated Press and then tweeted a statement from the juror that read: 'I realize it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered in order to protest our verdict from unfair outside influence, but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case. 'The potential book was always intended to be a respectful observation of the trial from my and my husband’s perspectives solely and it was to be an observation that our ""system"" of justice can get so complicated that it creates a conflict with our ""spirit"" of justice. 'Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury.' The Twitter uproar that ended the book proposal followed the airing of an interview with juror B37 on CNN Monday. The juror, who has been characterized as a white, married mother of two, did not show her face in the interview. Pivotal take: The jury member, whose name and face have not been revealed, said that they never believed it was a race-based incident . War of words: One of the jury members (right) spoke out and said that she felt Rachel Jeantel's (left) testimony was not credible because of her version of events and presentation . She said she believed that Zimmerman made some poor decisions in the moments before he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, but that Martin wasn't innocent. 'I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into,' she said. 'I think they both could have walked away.' 'Trayvon decided that he wasn’t going to let [Zimmerman] scare him... and I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,' she added. Prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin. He was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter on Saturday night. Literary agent Sharlene Martin had . originally said that now-defunct book would explain why the jury reached . the decision to acquit the former neighborhood watch volunteer. 'My . hope is that people will read Juror B37’s book, written with her . attorney husband, and understand the commitment it takes to serve and be . sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial and how . important, despite one’s personal viewpoints, it is to follow the letter . of the law,' she said. Cleared: The juror said that she felt that Zimmerman went above the bounds of what he should have done but 'his heart was in the right place' She added that the book has the potential to open discussions about how laws might need to be revised in order to fit with modern society. 'The reader will also learn why the jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman Not Guilty due to the manner in which he was charged,' she said. Sharlene Martin has represented books written by high-profile writers, including Honor Bound by Raffaele Sollecito and Picture Perfect: The Jodi Arias Story by Shanna Hogan, due out in September. Mystery still surrounds the identities of the jury members and there is still no indication of how long the six women, known only to the public as B76, B37, E6, B29, E40 and B51, will remain anonymous. Jurors refused to talk to reporters about how they reached their decision on Saturday after they received numerous interview requests from media outlets. Their names are being kept secret until Judge Debra Nelson lifts an order protecting their identities. Attorneys have argued that the names should not be kept secret. National issue: Demonstrators protested in Atlanta on Monday, two nights after the verdict was handed down . Rage: A man shouts during a protest march against the acquittal in Los Angeles, California on Sunday . In June, the judge ruled they would . remain anonymous for an unspecified period after the verdict and .

Light artist Michael Bosanko completed his collection of copies of masterpieces last week, with his take on René Magritte's 'The Son of Man'. Bosanko, from Caerphilly, South Wales, painstakingly drew every brush stoke with a torch, using long exposure to photograph his creations. Scroll down for video . Enlightened: Light artist Michael Bosanko has recreated Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man using just a torch and a camera on long exposure . Original: Da Vinci's pen and ink sketch is a careful study of the anatomy of man based on the ideal human proportions described by Ancient Roman scholar Vitruvius . The Scream: Bosanko has recreated Edvard Munch's 1893 masterpiece using the Brecon Beacons as the background for his light image . The artist, who has been creating . light images since 2004, said: 'The idea behind 'illuminating famous . artists' was to look at various styles across the centuries, and apply . what I do in different ways. 'Interpreting famous pieces of art . from entirely different artists was about as challenging as things could . get. I just had to give it a shot. 'I light paint by using a long . exposure, and have no visual trace to reference from as I'm 'painting' in the dark in a three dimensional space.' The series was shot entirely in the Brecon Beacons and includes Munch's The Scream, Banksy's The Balloon Girl, Da . Vinci's Vitruvian Man, Van Gogh's The Starry Night, . Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa and Magritte's The Son of Man. The copy of Van Gogh's 1889 oil . painting was created using the longest exposure, with Bosanko leaving . the shutter open for more than 20 minutes. Making waves: The Welsh artist has copied Katsushika Hokusais's The Great Wave off Kangawa using strokes of blue and white light . Masterpiece: The Japanese artist's original image, which is also known simply as The Wave, was a woodblock print created in the 1830s . Tribute: Bosanko used a deserted bridge in the Welsh hills as the setting for his version of Banksy's 2003 graffitti work The Balloon Girl . He added: 'It's difficult to pick a . favourite because I love them all for different reasons. I think the Van . Gogh interpretation has the slight edge. I love the original, and is . was a difficult image to complete. 'The overall reaction has been surprisingly phenomenal; quite humbling, actually.' In the past nine years, Bosanko has . exhibited and created light art around the world and has been . commissioned to make pieces for companies like Orange and British . Airways. Incredibly Mr Bosanko has to visualise the image he wants to create after observing the setting and then rely on memory to light-paint. Speaking earlier this year he explained the process. 'In real time, I leave the camera's exposure open,' he said. 'While the camera is exposing for up an hour, I step into the scene and move light sources in a way that is captured on the camera's sensor. 'In real time, the casual viewer will only see me moving lights about in what seems a random fashion. All the while the camera's sensor is picking up the trails of light, and recording real time in one still image.

Whitney Tilson, the outspoken founder of Kase Capital, also added that he would buy his first gun if he ever discovered that someone had coerced one of his girls into a sexual act.

'Getting drunk and/or hooking up regularly is such a bad idea in so many ways, especially at such a young age and especially for young women.' Tilson is married with three young daughters, two of whom are teenagers.

A truly horrifying story from the front page of tomorrow’s NYT (especially if you have three daughters, the oldest two of which are teenagers). How can so many smart young women be so massively stupid?! Getting drunk and/or hooking up regularly is such a bad idea in so many ways, especially at such a young age and especially for young women. [From the Times:] It is by now pretty well understood that traditional dating in college has mostly gone the way of the landline, replaced by “hooking up” — an ambiguous term that can signify anything from making out to oral sex to intercourse — without the emotional entanglement of a relationship. Hookups can lead to things like this: . In November of Haley’s freshman year, a couple of months after her first tentative “Difmos,” or dance-floor makeouts, she went to a party with a boy from her floor. She had too much to drink, and she remembered telling him that she wanted to go home. Instead, she said, he took her to his room and had sex with her while she drifted in and out of consciousness. .... A friend of hers, Kristy... had been making out with a guy at his house, not sure how far she wanted to go, when he stood up and told her, “Get down on your knees.” At first she froze. “I was really taken aback, because I was like, no one has ever said that to me before,” she said. Then he said something like, “ ‘I think that’s fair,’ ” she recalled. When she still hesitated, he pushed her down. “It was at that point that I was like, ‘I’ll just do it,’ ” she said. “'I was like, 'It will be over soon enough.'"" I certainly hope that my daughters would never spend a second with a guy who would ever dare say “get down on your knees” – but if that happened, they would: . a) walk away . b) better yet, punch him in the mouth and walk away . c) better yet, kick him in the balls and walk away . d) better yet, pretend to go along with it, but when he pulls it out, squint, laugh, and walk away . e) better yet, bite it! Lastly, after doing any of a-e, come home and tell me his name so I can buy my first gun and...well, you get the idea! ;-) It’s good to see that at least some women have some good sense – and very interesting that it’s more likely to be those from “modest” (i.e., low income) backgrounds: . At colleges nationally, by senior year, 4 in 10 students are either virgins or have had intercourse with only one person, according to the Online College Social Life Survey. Nearly 3 in 10 said that they had never had a hookup in college. ....

A Virginia DJ has been arrested after videos showing him raping unconscious women were found at his apartment. Police say Joseph M. Rivera sexually assaulted scores of women without their knowledge over a number of years. The 34-year-old was taken into custody in Las Vegas this week and has been charged with rape, aggravated sexual battery and animate sexual object penetration as well as two counts of unlawful filming. One of the victim's families reported their loved one had been assaulted in May, sparking a joint investigation by Fairfax County and Alexandria police. 'All the victims appeared unconscious and to this day are unaware of the videos and photographs,' Detective Brian J. Byerson wrote in a search warrant filed in Fairfax County Circuit Court on May 13. Some of the incriminating videos were filmed in a home Rivera lived in on Station House Court in Lorton, The Washington Post reported. They were stored on a range of electronic devices, according to the search warrant. Rivera confessed to taking photographs and filming the assaults during an interview with police. He said the videos were created between November 2011 and December 2012. Police have identified some of the women featured in the tapes though the identities of others who appear in the video are not known. Apartment: Some of the assaults are believed to have taken place at this apartment block in Alexandria, Virginia, where Rivera last lived . Jail: Rivera is being held in a Las Vegas prison before he is transferred to Fairfax County, Virginia . Those who police have interviewed said they were unaware of the assault and never gave permission to engage in sexual acts with Rivera. Rivera worked as a party disc jockey - a job that saw him come into contact with numerous women. He also hosted bar-tending competitions.

A former cop was acquitted on Tuesday of killing his depressed wife with his department-issued gun after a month-long trial that has revealed secrets of affairs and alleged corruption within an Albuquerque police force. After more than 10 hours of deliberations, a jury acquitted Levi Chavez, 32, of murdering of his wife, 26-year-old Tera Chavez, in 2007 and trying to make the hairdresser's death look like a suicide. Upon announcing the verdict, the family of Levi Chavez, including his current wife Albuquerque detective Heather Chavez, let out gasps and wept. Freed: Levi Chavez, right, a former Albuquerque police officer, gets a hug from his wife Heather Chavez after being acquitted of his first wife's murder . Relief: Chavez hugs his attorney David Serna in Sandoval District Court in Bernalillo, New Mexico on Tuesday . The former officer, clenching a Rosary, immediately embraced his attorney, David Serna. 'What did I tell you?' Serna told Chavez. Following the verdict, emotional family members of Tera Chavez were quickly escorted out of Sandoval District Court, the result of an edict from state District Judge George Eichwald who sought to ease tensions between the two families. 'Justice was not served,' Joseph Cordova, the father of Tera Chavez, said after listening to the verdict with his wife. Prosecutor Bryan McKay, who told jurors during closing arguments that Chavez used his department-issued gun to commit 'cold-blooded, calculated, planned-out murder,' declined to comment after the verdict. Meanwhile, in the courtroom, Chavez and family gathered to pray a Hail Mary until Serna grabbed Chavez by the arm to escort him through a crowded pathway of supporters and family members. Acquitted: Levi Chavez, center, a former Albuquerque police officer, leaves the court after his month-long trial . Grief: Theresa and Joseph Cordova, parents of Tera Chavez, leave the Sandoval County Judicial Complex, saying 'justice has not been served' 'I'm going to go to church, pray my Rosary and thank my Virgin Mary,' Chavez said as he was crowded by reporters. Asked if he would try to get his old job back with the Albuquerque Police Department, Chavez blurted out a date but declined to say what that date meant. Serna said he doubted that Chavez would want return to the state's largest police department. 'He's got several plans in the works,' Serna said. 'I don't feel like speaking for his future.' Chavez still faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of Tera Chavez. They allege the former officer killed his wife to keep her from disclosing an alleged staged theft of a truck for insurance money. Some of the evidence in the civil case, like testimony from an insurance investigator about the fake theft allegations, was barred in murder trial. The city of Albuquerque already has paid Tera's family $230,000 to settle claims against it and its police department in the civil case. Accused: Prosecutors have depicted Levi Chavez as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling, and say he killed his wife after she found out he had staged the theft of his pickup truck to collect the insurance proceeds. He was acquitted of her murder on Tuesday . The less-than-perfect crime: Tera Chavez was killed when her husband allegedly shot her in the mouth and tried to make it look like a suicide . That case is scheduled to be heard in . state District Court in Bernalillo County and has been on hold while the . criminal trial was held. For . weeks, the murder trial captivated parts of central New Mexico as . residents were fixated in barber shops, diners and grocery stores. Much . of the trial centered on allegations that Albuquerque police officers . who responded to the Chavez home in nearby Los Lunas removed and even . flushed key evidence down a toilet. Witnesses . also described a workplace where interoffice romance was rampant and . said both Levi and Tera Chavez had affairs with members of the police . force. The tawdry details . spilled in the trial and the questions it raised about the practices of . the Albuquerque Police Department have further tarnished the agency, . which is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over a . series of police shootings. In . the trial's final days, Chavez took the stand and acknowledged having a . string of mistresses, searching a website on how to kill someone with . martial arts moves, and ignoring his wife's calls for help. The OTHER side of the law: Former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez seen here in his mugshot after allegedly murdering his wife . But, the disgraced former officer insisted that he did not kill his wife. Serna . said his client was a victim of an overly aggressive former detective . and 'lies' from local media outlets, although none reported Serna ever . requesting for a retraction or correction from any stories since 2007. 'There never was a case against Levi Chavez,'Serna said. 'This was a made up pile of lies from the beginning and it took the jury approximately 10 hours to find that out.' During his testimony last week, Chavez . frequently broke down and had to take breaks when he recounted his ill . treatment of his late wife throughout their marriage. That treatment included sexual . relationships with four different women and constant breakups that began . with way back when the couple were high school students. 'I'm very embarrassed about it,' Chavez said, then later added. 'I took her for granted.' Chavez told jurors that he found his . wife dead from a gunshot wound and thought it was God's way of punishing . him. 'To say I blamed myself is an understatement,' he said. 'Guilt . doesn't even begin to describe it.' However, Chavez said his wife's death . later helped him reform his philandering ways and he later married . another police officer — two months after his wife's death.","Both Levi Chavez and his wife were having extramarital affairs at the time of the shooting .

Dragged from his cabin, bewildered and wearing only a nightdress, Captain William Bligh of the HMS Bounty was facing a nightmarish scenario. Half of his ship's crew, emboldened by the rallying cries of traitorous first mate Fletcher Christian, were in mutiny. About to be cast off by his own men, his thoughts must have been panicked - stranded more than 1,300 west of Tahiti, his prospects of survival appeared bleak. And yet, in the midst of one of the most notorious incidents in British naval history, Captain Bligh did not plead for his life. Instead, he demanded the mutineers hand over the ship's chronometer. Alongside . his clerk John Samuel, Bligh pleaded with the mutineers to let him take . K2, a timekeeping device that allowed the crew to determine their . longitude. Documents held . by the University of Cambridge reveal for the first time how Bligh . interrupted the chaotic mutiny in 1789 to try and save the valued timepiece. In his account of events he wrote: . 'Mr Samuel attempted to save the time-keeper but he was hurried away by . the mutineers with: ""Damn your eyes: you are well off to get what you . have"".' Why was Captain Bligh, facing such unprecedented catastrophe, so desperate to leave with the chronometer? Admission: Captain Bligh's letter to the Admiralty explaining that the chronometer was 'pirated from my command' Dire straits: An illustration of the 1789 mutiny on the Bounty when half Captain's Bligh's crew rose up against him and cast him off the ship . Was it a symbolic gesture, did he simply wish to cling on to something which helped maintain a sense of order? The answer may in fact have been much less romantic. The chronometer was worth a serious amount of money. Bligh had made a promise to the Admiralty that he would look after K2 which had cost £200 (around £11,000 in today's money). At loggerheads: Captain Bligh, left, was dragged from his cabin in the middle of the night by first mate Fletcher Christian, right, and his band of mutineers . He wrote to the Board of Longitude on . October 18, 1787, acknowledging receipt of the device 'which I promise . to return to (the maker) on their order or demand.' And K2's value was more than just monetary, in 18th Century seafaring it was a key tool of survival. Fed . up with Bligh's floggings and hungry to return to the kind of idyllic . life they had enjoyed in Tahiti, Christian and his mutineers lowered the . deposed captain and his loyalists into a rowing . boat and left them for dead. They then used K2 to navigate their way to Pitcairn Island which they believed would be the perfect place to hide out. Simon . Schaffer, Professor of History at Cambridge University, told The Times . that the watch enabled the crew to work out that Pitcairn was . inaccurately marked on the Admiralty's maps. They then set fire to the Bounty to cover their tracks. Land ahoy: After having been cast adrift, Bligh and his crew were hospitably received by the Governor of Timor . Meanwhile, despite having lost the crucial piece of technology, Captain Bligh was able to complete a remarkable 47-day voyage to Timor in the Dutch East Indies. On October 27, 1790, he wrote to the Admiralty admitting that K2 was no longer in his possession. 'I am to inform you the the Time Keeper, which was given to my charge on board His Majesty's Ship Bounty, was left in the said ship when pirate from my command on the 28th April, 1789.' The crimes of the mutineers caught up with them . two years later when, after news reached Britain, a ship . was dispatched to arrest them. After rounding up 14 out of 23 of the mutineers, they were imprisoned in a makeshift cell on the deck of HMS Pandora. Four . died along with 31 crewmen when the ship ran aground on the Great . Barrier Reef, but the remaining ten prisoners were returned to Britain . to face court martial in Portsmouth. K2's journey of high drama was far from over. It remained on Pitcairn Island with the mutineers until 1808 when it was bought by an American whaler named Mayhew Folger who bought it and travelled on to Valpariso, Chile. When Folger ended up in prison the chronometer was confiscated by the governor before it passed through the hands of a Spanish mule trader and a Royal Navy captain. Eventually it ended up with the Royal United Services Institution which allowed it to return to the Royal Greenwich Museum in the 1960s where it remains today.","Captain William Bligh was kicked off the Bounty by mutinous crew in 1789 .

The sprawling mansion has been a bone of contention when it comes to settling the investment mogul's vast estate. Legal wranglings are ongoing on how to divide Wasserstein's $2.2.billion wealth among a complex cast of family including a widow, three ex-wives, a mistress and six children. Miss McCarthy had claimed that her five-year-old daughter Sky would find the stays at the custom-built, beachfront property, 'therapeutic' - following advice the mother sought from a child psychologist. The 26-acre property in East Hampton, a playground for New York City's wealthy and well-connected, is the summer bolthole for Wasserstein's five children from two of his four marriages, who reportedly are unhappy about sharing their home. Miss McCarthy, first petitioned . the trustees of Wasserstein's estate, estimated at $2.2billion, for . access - but her request was denied. She then petitioned the Surrogate's court in Manhattan last year. The estate is managed by some of the late Wassersteins' friends and business associates for all of his six children. Legal battle: Erin McCarthy, wants her daughter Sky, to have the same rights as Bruce Wasserstein's other children from marriage . Expectant: Miss McCarthy, a business grad at Columbia, became pregnant during an affair with the investment banking mogul while he was still married to his third wife Claude . Miss McCarthy, a 41-year-old Columbia business school graduate, originally from . Burlington, Kentucky, went to Surrogate's court in Manhattan to fight for her daughter's . rights. The mother claims her daughter should be treated the same as Wasserstein's five other . children - ranging in age from teens to thirties. According to court documents, the other five children - two daughters and three sons - then offered their half-sister, either properties in California or Paris if she gave up rights to the Hamptons home. However the offer failed, DNAinfo reported. Trustees' for the Wasserstein estate offered a solution: Sky Wasserstein would . receive one-fifth of the market value of the Hamptons' property, along . with homes in Santa Barbara and Paris, while the other siblings would . continue to own the homes, a court-appointed lawyer for Sky Wasserstein told MailOnline. Eric . Prenzer, a lawyer appointed by the Surrogate's Court for Sky . Wasserstein, told MailOnline that he filed a report saying that the trustees' proposal was in the little girl's best interest. David Stoll, a lawyer for Wasserstein's three eldest children, said his client had no comment. Home sweet home: The Wassersteins' Hamptons beachfront property on the exclusive Further Lane boasts a tennis court and swimming pool along with seven bedrooms . Life's a beach: The property has been part of Wasserstein family life for the past 20 years . According to court papers, Miss McCarthy's daughter has $75million in a trust and lives in a multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartment paid for by the Wasserstein estate. There is also tens of thousands of dollars paid out in child support every month. Bruce Wasserstein died at the age of 61 in October 2009 after a short illness, the details of which are unknown. The . investment banking mogul had a stellar career on Wall Street where he . made his name as a corporate raider in the 1980s. He used some of the . earnings to acquire New York Magazine. The billions he earned were poured into breath-taking property including a Manhattan duplex penthouse on Fifth Avenue. There . is also a Santa Barbara ranch in California and Parisian apartment . along with the vast 26-acre Hamptons estate known as Cranberry Dune . where wealthy neighbors include Jerry Seinfeld. The five siblings view Miss McCarthy's daughter as equal for . inheritance of their father's wealth - but according to DNAInfo, allegedly do not want her, and it appears more importantly her mother, to have access to the Hamptons' residence. Public profile: Five-year-old Sky Wasserstein has a Facebook account set up where there are pictures of her posted with her late father and other members of the Wasserstein family . The eldest child: Pamela Wasserstein attends the Women's Filmmaker Brunch during the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival on April 25 this year . According to the website, they claim the problem lies with Miss McCarthy who they blame for ending their father's marriage to his third wife Claude. The Wasserstein clan claim Miss McCarthy once broke into the mansion, DNAInfo reported from court records. Claude Wasserstein added that her two sons were 'terrorized' by Miss McCarthy at the property in 2008, according to affidavits seen by the website. Miss McCarthy said in court documents at the time that she was suffering from post-partum depression and had been unaware Mr Wasserstein had started a relationship with his soon-to-be fourth wife, who was at the home. The Hamptons home, located on exclusive Further Lane, sprawls over 14,000 square-feet and has seven bedrooms along with a tennis court and pool, according to the WSJ. The late mogul's complicated family life includes a widow, three ex-wives and six children - along with his mistress Miss McCarthy.

She is now married to Hamptons newspaper mogul Dan Rattiner (right) Wasserstein has three children with his second wife Christine Parrott, a psychoanalyst who went on to marry Hamptons newspaper mogul Dan Rattiner in 2008. His eldest child Pamela works as a director at the Tribeca Film Institute, according to Vanity Fair. The two other children from this marriage are Ben, an HBO producer and writer, and Scoop, a law student. The billionaire also has two teenage sons Jack and Dash with his third wife Claude Becker, a former producer at CBS who he married in 1996. At the time of his death, the billionaire had been married to Angela Chao since earlier that year. He also married Laura Lynelle Killin in 1968 but they divorced six years later without having any children.","Erin McCarthy launched the legal bid on behalf of her five-year-old daughter Sky last year .

A small Colorado town concerned over government surveillance practices see an answer in drone hunting licenses. Deer Trail, Colorado—population 500—is considering a permit that would allow its freedom-minded citizens to shoot down U.S. unmanned aircraft for cash rewards. The seven-member town board will soon vote on the measure it hopes will be a real money-maker. And though they see the licenses as a fun jab at the federal government, the resident who drafted ordinance isn’t laughing. Not on my watch: Deer Trail, Colorado (population 500) is mulling the idea of instituting a town-sanctioned drone hunting licenses. Mayor Frank Fields demonstrates what the hunting might look like . ‘To [them], it’s a novelty,’ Phillip Steel, the man behind the idea told KHGH. ‘To me, I’m serious.’ Steel fears the country is becoming increasingly controlled by a government bent on controlling its citizens through surveillance and wants Deer Trail to stand out as an exception. ‘We do not want drones in town,’ said Steel. ‘They fly in town, they get shot down.’ Steel calls his ordinance ‘very symbolic,’ but its anything but a vague gesture. It was submitted complete with age restrictions, allowable ammunition types, and prescribed fee and reward amounts. As per the ordinance: . ‘The Town of Deer Trail shall issue a reward of $100 to any shooter who presents a valid hunting license and the following identifiable parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose markings and configuration are consistent with those used on any similar craft known to be owned or operated by the United States federal government.’ 'I'm gonna shoot it down, ordinance or no': Phillip Steel drafted the ordinance and is serious about drone-hunting licenses even if some town boardspeople aren't quite convinced . Drone's eye view? An aerial shot of how a drone might see the town of 500, though Steel admits he's never seen one flying above Deer Trail . Drone days: The small town has, until now, been mostly known for hosting the 'world's first rodeo' in 1896. Now it may hold the world's first drone hunt . The licenses would cost $25 and shooters must be 21 or over. ‘The applicant,’ reads the ordinance, ‘must be able to read and understand English.’ ‘Basically, I do not believe in the idea of a surveillance society and I believe we are headed that way,’ explained Steel. Steel acknowledged that destroying a U.S. drone would be a federal offense. Cash reward: Shooting down a drone would constitute a federal offense. Nonetheless, the ordinance even specifies bounty amounts of up to $100 . He also admitted he’s never actually seen a drone. ‘I’m gonna shoot it down,’ said the defiant Steel. ‘Ordinance or no.’ But not everyone in the town best known for claiming to have hosted the ‘world’s first rodeo’ in 1869 is taking the drone hunting as literally as Steel. ‘Even if a tiny percentage of people get [a] drone license, that's cool,’ resident and town board member David Boyd told KHGH. ‘That's a lot of money to a small town like us.’ People like Boyd and town clerk Kim Oldfield haven’t given their full support to the idea of legalized drone hunting, but they can see fun and profit in a sort of ‘Drone Days’ celebrations with skeet shooting in lieu of the real thing. ‘I can see it as a benefit, monetarily speaking, because of the novelty of the ordinance,’ said Oldfield. The town board is scheduled to vote on drone hunting licenses August 6. 'I haven't made my decision yet': Deer Trail mayor Frank Fields says he's undecided on the measure, which is up for a vote August 6 .","Deer Trail, Colorado residents concerned over government surveillance want to fight back .

A New Zealand woman allegedly bombarded the best-selling author of a book on the Harry Potter series with threats and abuse, according to a federal court complaint. Jessica Elizabeth Parker is said to have sent a barrage of abuse over a five year period to New York-based Harry, A History author Melissa Anelli. Ms Parker is accused of threatening to slit the throat of Ms Anellli and is even said to have got a tattoo of the Potter expert's face, according to the New York Post. Victim: Harry Potter expert and bestselling author Melissa Anelli who has allegedly been stalked by a New Zealand woman for the past five years . It is claimed that the abuse began in 2008 when Ms Parker was banned from Ms Anelli's The Leaky Cauldron fan website after writing abusive and violent posts about Harry Potter actress Emma Watson. According to the New York Daily News, the complaint file states that Ms Parker wrote on a postcode sent to Ms Anelli's parents: 'As long as you refuse to deal with me, I'll remain that little demon on your shoulder. 'I can't be denied forever...Else I will return to your home and flay you alive.' The FBI has secured a warrant for Ms Parker's arrest. Miss Anelli welcomed the news, saying in a statement on The Leaky Cauldron site earlier today: 'It has been a long five years of continuous threats and abuse, not only to me but my family, friends, and colleagues. I only hope it’s carried through to justice being served. Bestseller: Melissa Anelli wrote Harry, A History, left, a book written about J.K Rowling's series of books and subsequent film adaptations starring Daniel Radcliffe, right . 'I want to thank the Leaky community for its constant support over the past decade-plus, for its support now, and for its understanding while I refrain from discussing particulars in order to assure this sees a proper end.'

Ms Anelli has been running The Leaky Cauldron site since 2001. The former News reporter's book has been published in eight different countries and in four languages.

He was hospitalized for a blood clot in his leg earlier this year. His son died of a tragic drug overdose in March. It has been a rough year for 'The Nature Boy' Ric Flair - and it just got worse.A judge in North Carolina issued an arrest warrant for the former professional wrestling champion earlier this month after he failed to pay more than $32,000 in spousal support to his ex-wife Jacqueline Beems.Beems is Flair's fourth wife - and his fourth EX-wife. Pay up: 'The Nature Boy' Rick Flair faces jail time if he doesn't cough up the $32,000 he owes his soon-to-be ex-wife (right) Part of the former couple's separation agreement stipulates that Flair is to pay Beems about $4,000 a month to help her pay for things like her car, health insurance and legal fees. But Flair is yet to make a payment, so on July 3, a warrant was issued for his arrest. 'The reason I didn’t pay my ex-wife the 32 grand is because my son died . and I was in the hospital for a month,' Flair tells the Charlotte Observer. 'I was in the . hospital for a month with a blood clot. I didn’t go to work for three . months.' Flair's son Reid was found dead in a Charlotte hotel room where Flair had temporarily been living on March 29. Toxicology reports showed that Reid had consumed a fatal combination of heroin and prescription drugs. Icon: Flair (left) has been one of the biggest names in professional wrestling for the last 30 years . Adding to the drama are the former wrestlers accusations that Beems has been harassing his new girlfriend, a claim Beems denies. On Tuesday, Beems turned herself in to authorities and was charged with a misdemeanor count of making harassing phone calls. Beems' attorney, Brad Smith, calls the accusations 'unfounded and outlandish.' Flair says his Beems threatened the woman. 'My girlfriend Wendy Kidder is the mother of four and she has 50 texts . and five phone (voice-)mails from my ex-wife,' Flair says. 'They didn’t . give Wendy a warrant for arrest without looking at all of that stuff.' Tragedy: Flair's son Reid died of a drug overdose earlier this year . The reason for the divorce, Beems claims in court filings, is Flair's philandering ways. She claims Flair 'has had numerous intimate relationships with other women during the . parties’ marriage to the embarrassment and humiliation of wife.' The couple was married in November 2009, and it didn't take long before the newlyweds hit a rough patch. In February 2010, police were called to the couple's home in south Charlotte for a domestic violence complaint. Beems was charged with misdemeanor assault in the brouhaha, but the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence. Flair can avoid jail time if he pays Beems $32,352.51, which he tells the Observer he plans to do today. Wooooo!

Brought up by a man she thought was her father until the age of eight and with one failed marriage already behind her, it's perhaps no surprise that actress Liv Tyler has a more wary approach to relationships than most. Now the star, 36, has revealed that despite a stellar career and stunning looks, her longest and healthiest relationship with a male to date has been with her son Milo, nine. 'To have a son was huge for me, because . it’s been the most solid, healthy, consistent relationship I’ve ever had . with a male in my whole life,' she said. Healthy: According to Liv Tyler, her most consistent relationship with a male has been with her son Milo, 9 . Mystified: Liv had an unconventional upbringing which she admits has left her slightly baffled by men . '[Milo] just wants me to make him . breakfast and walk him to school and read to him at night and help him . with his homework – all the basic things that any child would want.' She continued: 'He . couldn’t give a rat’s ass about me being famous or a movie star or . anything. I learn so much from him.' Milo, who was born in 2004, is the son of Tyler's former husband, diminutive British musician, Royston Langdon. She and Langdon, the lead singer of indie band Spacehog, vowed to remain friends in the wake of their 2008 divorce on their son's behalf. It's a situation that Tyler is familiar with as she is herself the product of divorced parents who remained friends for their daughter's sake - with one major difference. Liv's model mother Bebe Buell kept the identity of her daughter's real father secret - and the young Liv believed rock star Todd Rundgren was her father until the age of eight. Stylish: The actress also revealed that her elegant mother and grandmother influenced her personal style . Daddy dearest: Liv now enjoys a good relationship with her father, Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler . It was then that she noticed a similarity between herself and 'Uncle' Steve Tyler's daughter Mia and it dawned on her that Buell might not have been telling the truth about her paternity. The result was a unique upbringing, which Tyler says has left her mystified by men. 'I . was raised by the women in my life,' she revealed in an interview with Net-a-Porter's digital fashion magazine, The Edit. 'That’s made me incredibly strong . and resilient. I’ve always been able to support myself . and my family on my own. 'Men are a bit of a mystery to me in a way. They . are visitors. They visit my life. I am always surprised when there is . one around.' But mystery males weren't the only legacy of her mother and grandmother left for her - their love of fashion and their elegant approach to dressing also left their mark. Old-fashioned: According to Liz, she has an antediluvian body shape and suits retro corseted styles as a result . 'I find myself inspired all the time by . my mother and my grandmother and their innate natural elegance, much . more than fashion or trends that are hot right now,' she explained. That she attributes in part to having an 'old-fashioned' body shape. 'I have quite an old-fashioned body, the . shape of it,' she says. 'Corseted, pulled in, little waist, pointy . boobs – that look actually really suits me, because there’s some . construction to it. 'I always go back to the classic images; I can’t help . but be influenced by Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Newman and . Steven McQueen, and the Kennedys. 'It’s strange: I’m . very independent and quite modern as a woman in many ways, but I’m also . quite old-fashioned.'

'Some individuals we have previously stopped had significant criminal convictions.' Gloucestershire Chief Constable Suzette Davenport added: 'Many of these criminals are organised and use the road network to travel from area to area in an attempt to avoid detection. 'Their activity has a damaging impact on communities and businesses that are targeted. 'We want to prevent the public from the misery they cause and build on the intelligence we already have. 'These criminal gangs must use our roads to carry out their illegal activity so by targeting them in this way we are aiming to develop a robust system to tackle the issue in the future.' Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: 'This is an excellent example of the Department for Transport working together with the police to help keep our roads safe. 'These gangs pose a real risk to other road users as their vehicles are likely to be uninsured, have no MOT, and the drivers may not even hold a valid driving licence.' Operation Trivium, involving four officers from Romania, two from Lithuania and two from Poland, runs between July 15 and July 19.","Officers from Poland, Lithuania and Romania are working alongside British .

Olympic hurdler turned bobsled champion Lolo Jones is no stranger to controversy: just last month she criticized her paycheck from the U.S. Bobsledding Team on Twitter, and now she’s at the center of an alleged bar fight in the early hours of Saturday morning. She was allegedly involved in the early morning altercation with Jenny Enquist, stepdaughter of Tony Carlino, the former head of Team USA who runs the track at Lake Placid. The incident took place after 1 a.m. at Roomers Night Club, a local bar. Jones is one of a number of athletes currently training at the Team USA facilities at Lake Placid, New York ahead of an important event later this month. Scroll down for video... Bobsled champ Lolo Jones was allegedly involved in an altercation at a Lake Placid bar in the early hours of Saturday morning . Altercation: Tony Carlino's stepdaughter was involved in a fight with Lolo Jones . A witness told Deadspin that Enquist was drunk when she confronted Jones, who pushed her to the ground and then left the bar. Enquist followed Jones outside and they had to be separated by bouncers. Another athlete, Aja Evans, was also allegedly involved. After the event, USA Bobsled & Skeleton spokesperson Amanda Bird said the organization was looking into the allegations and speaking to the athletes and witnesses that were at the bar. ‘We are treating this like we have with any other situation by investigating to see if there is a code of conduct violation,’ she said. No charges were filed with police. Lolo Jones has won a world championship gold medal in the bobsled since moving over from the hurdles, Tony Carlino, right, runs the Team USA camp at Lake Placid . Booze brawl: It's not clear what the fight was about, but according to reports, Jenny Enquist was drunk at the bar . Punch drunk: It's unclear what Jones (left) and Enquist (right) were arguing about at the Lake Placid bar . On Tuesday night, the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation said it has found no reason to sanction Olympic hopeful Lolo Jones for her role in the altercation. The story was first reported on Fox Sports Tonight on Monday by host and former Olympic champion swimmer Amy Van Dyken. She reported that federation officials gathered athletes after the incident and specifically told them to keep it quiet. Carlino, known as the ‘Bobfather,’ is a US Bobsled and Skeleton Federation hall of famer who now manages the Olympic Sports Complex in Lake Placid. Former track star Jones is less than a year into her quest to make the 2014 Olympics in bobsled, but already has a world championship gold medal under her belt. She is an outspoken figure and some within the sport feel she receives special treatment because of the publicity she brings. Jones has already found herself in hot . water this summer after posting a video last month criticizing her check . from the U.S. Bobsledding Team. Olympic athlete Lolo Jones caused controversy last month when she posted a video mocking her $741.84 paycheck from the bobsled season . Mocking: In the video, Jones appeared to be making a phone call to her landlord, saying she's going to be a 'bit late' with her rent this month; she even shows the amount to the camera . Recording a brief video of herself, the athlete mocks the total amount - $741.84 - that she received from her seven-month season. In the video, she says: 'Seven months with bobsled season. The WHOLE season. That's it?' She then appears to be on the phone to her landlord, saying she's going to 'be a bit late' on her rent this month. Jones has become a well-known sports personality for her outspoken tweets and social media updates. But she has been criticized for receiving more attention and endorsements in the media that her sporting achievements warrant. Jones, left, is no stranger to controversy, just last month she criticized her check from the U.S. Bobsledding Team, and now she's at the center of an alleged bar fight in the early hours of Saturday morning . Glamorous: Former teammates say Jones' image and endorsements overshadowed their sporting achievements . Her . social media activity has also got her into some difficulty. In October . last year she caused offense to some after she told a paralyzed former . football player to 'get checked for concussion' after he challenged her . on Twitter to a race. In her tweet, Miss Jones said former . Rutgers player Eric LeGrand must have 'clearly been hit in the head'. She later defended her comments saying she did not know who Eric was. Fortunately the former footballer didn't take offense. The athlete was at the center of another Twitter storm earlier this year, when the 30-year-old hurdler announced that she was still a virgin on the micro-blogging site. And last year it was reported she became embroiled in a nasty cat-fight with two of her USA teammates in the aftermath of the Olympics. Peers Dawn Harper and Kellie Wells, who finished second and third respectively in Olympic 100m women's hurdles final, suggested that their medal success was overshadowed by Jones because of the hype around her personal story and a nude photo-shoot for ESPN magazine in 2009. Jones was the gold-medal favorite for the 2012 London Olympics 100-metre hurdles, but finished fourth. Four years earlier in Beijing, the American came in as the favorite and was in position to win gold when she hit the ninth of 10 hurdles and wound up seventh. Miss Jones was one of 24 athletes announced last October as members of last season's U.S. bobsled team, giving her another chance to vie for a spot on the World Cup circuit. Track and field star Lolo Jones is now a gold medal bobsledder . After disappointment in the 2012 Olympics hurdles event, Miss Jones decided to try out for a spot on the national bobsled team, and scooped gold in the World Championships in January . Disappointments: Jones was favored to win medals in both the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 (left) and the London Olympics last year (right) but neither came to fruition . April 2012 - Dating tweets... Miss Jones has proved to be extremely open about her personal life, particularly dating, and especially on Twitter. In . the media frenzy run-up to the 2012 Olympics, she tweeted in April: 'If . a guy doesn't return my call, I get mad they give NO reason but if . twitter ppl [sic] tell me WHY they unfollow me, I get mad they do.' She also tweeted that month: 'I don't have a hard time finding dates but hard finding the right one to date' May 2012 - Hard to stay a virgin...Miss . Jones was at the center of a Twitter storm earlier this year, when the . 30-year-old hurdler announced that she was still a virgin on the . micro-blogging site. The . Iowa-born star made headlines this summer when she said that staying a . virgin was 'the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life - harder than . training for the Olympics, harder than graduating from college, has been . to stay a virgin before marriage.' Miss Jones said on HBO's Real Sports that it was 'harder than graduating from college'. 'When . I was 22, 24, it was cute,' she said. 'But 24 to 29, it's not cute. You . get judged a lot, a lot of guys won't return your calls after they find . out.' August 2012 - Snide comments from Olympic team mates...Miss . Jones became embroiled in a nasty catfight with her own Team USA peers . Dawn Harper and Kellie Wells, who finished second and third respectively . in Olympic 100m women's hurdles final. Fellow U.S. hurdlers Ms Harper, 28, and Ms Wells, 30, spoke bitterly about Miss Jones prior to an after-party filled weekend. During . an interview on NBC Sports, Ms Harper attempted to explain that her own . life story is just as interesting as Miss Jones', who she called the . media's 'favorite'. Ms . Harper said: 'Because their favorite [Miss Jones] didn't win all of a . sudden it's just like, ""We're going to push your story aside, and still . gonna push this one"". That hurt.' Ms Wells also spoke about Miss Jones, who has gained a large amount of attention since outing herself as a virgin. She . said: 'Well, I think that, on the podium tonight, the three girls that . earned their spot, that got their medals and they worked hard and did . what they needed to do, prevailed. And that's all that really needs to . be said.' August 2012 - 'Drooling' with rapper Nas...American . rapper Nasir Jones, known by his stage name Nas, tweeted a picture with . Ms Jones, at a boozey night out at London's Roundhouse, in Camden, the . week after the Games. His tweet sparked rumors the pair would leave the party together.

"By . Keith Gladdis and Michael Seamark . PUBLISHED: . 19:33 EST, 12 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:34 EST, 12 April 2013 . Evgeny Lebedev, the son of a  billionaire ex-KGB tycoon, has been involved in channelling a financial  contribution to the anti-Press Hacked Off campaign. The controversy centres on a £20,000 donation made to a body that Mr Lebedev, the owner of the Independent and London Evening Standard, set up supposedly to champion free and independent journalism. The Journalism Foundation was closed down after only a year when it failed to attract enough donations from outside the Lebedev family. But it has now emerged that Mr Lebedev is planning to transfer the £20,000 donation to Hacked Off. Evgeny Lebedev's (left) wealth comes from his father Alexander, a former KGB agent who owns a bank in Moscow . The move is controversial because Hacked Off – which helped draft a new Royal Charter to bring in State regulation of the Press in a shadowy 2.30am deal in the office of Ed Miliband – does not itself have charitable status. The fear is that – if it gets the money – there will be no way of checking it is only being spent on charitable work that supports the objectives of the Journalism Foundation. Mr Lebedev, who is a personal friend of Hacked Off director Hugh Grant, has railed against alleged Press intrusion in the past. The £20,000 was donated to the Journalism Foundation at a ‘gala’ evening attended by celebrity supporters including Mr Grant in May last year. A spokesman for Evgeny Lebedev said: 'I would like to make clear that this was a restricted donation from a third party to the Journalism Foundation, specifically to be used for supporting the non-Leveson activities of Hacked Off' The revelations about the money were made by The Times newspaper, which said Hacked Off was yet to receive the £20,000 donation. In a critical editorial, the paper wrote: ‘It may be because some of Mr Lebedev’s colleagues see more clearly than he does the inherent difficulty in using an organisation set up to promote “free and independent journalism” to channel money to one committed to statutory Press regulation. Either way, the solution is obvious: Mr Lebedev should ensure that any funds given to his foundation for Hacked Off are returned. Anyone who wants to help fund the group can still do so, directly and openly. It’s a free country after all.’ Yesterday a Foundation spokesman told The Times the donation was for a ‘public interest defence project’ and its trustees had decided to tell Hacked Off the donation would be honoured. A spokesman for Evgeny Lebedev said: ‘I would like to make clear that this was a restricted donation from a third party to the Journalism Foundation, specifically to be used for supporting the non-Leveson activities of Hacked Off. In other words, this was not Evgeny’s money and not for funding anti newspaper legislation. And the money will not be given if the donation does not comply with charities legislation.’ Mr Lebedev’s wealth comes from his father Alexander, a former KGB agent who owns a bank in Moscow. The Independent has supported statutory regulation of the Press. But, last month, Alexander Lebedev apparently contradicted the position adopted by his son. He said: ‘The restrictions of the freedom of the Press in Britain – I would think that would be a very wrong decision. Absolutely. There are better ways to rectify the wrong things that have been done during the hacking affair.’ A spokesman for Hacked Off said: ‘Hacked Off understand that the donation from the Journalism Foundation will be honoured. ‘When it is, the funds will be earmarked for research and campaign work into public interest defences in journalism.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Controversy centres on £20k donation made to The Journalism Foundation .

Fellow NFL stars Tim Tebow and Tom Brady worried about Aaron Hernandez's behavior as early as 2011, according to a newly surfaced video. Brady went as far as to describe the former New England Patriorts star, who was arrested last month for murder, as 'a lot to handle,' in the footage from NFL Films. As well as lamenting Hernandez, Brady also refers to former Florida Gator Brandon Spikes with concern. 'And I'm trying to watch over Aaron and Brandon,' he says, to which Tebow responds: 'I appreciate that, too, man. They're good guys.' And Brady adds: '(Yeah) they're a lot to handle.' Scroll down for video . Early fears: Fellow NFL stars Tim Tebow and Tom Brady worried about Aaron Hernandez's behavior as early as 2011, according to a newly surfaced video, pictured . The December 18, 2011, video, dug up by The Courant, is from Week 15 of the NFL season in Denver, when Brady's New England Patriots defeated the Tebow-led Denver Broncos 41-23. Tebow and Brady are seen shaking hands after the game and talking briefly about Hernandez in the video, which also includes game highlights. The two quarterbacks are very friendly in the footage, and it's clear they have had contact with each other off the field. After some play, the video cuts to Tebow and Brady at midfield surrounded by press. The two shake hands and Brady compliments Tebow on his performance before discussing Hernandez. 'Good game, Tim. You're having a great year,' the elder man says. 'Thanks. I appreciate it,' Tebow responds and Brady adds: 'Keep it up. Good things happen to good people.' The news of the long-forgotten about video comes as it emerged Hernandez has swapped his $1.3m mansion for a 7ft by 10ft grim prison cell where the other inmates think he is a 'punk'.

Friendly: Tebow, right, and Brady, left, are seen shaking hands after the game and talking briefly about Hernandez in the video, which also includes game highlights . The former New England Patriots star, who was arrested last month for murder, is adjusting to life in the Bristol County House of Correction in Massachusetts, where he has less space than a bathroom in his old house. He is locked down in solitary for 21 hours a day and is only allowed one hour of exercise a day in a cage-like pen with a guard watching him at all times. His 6ft by 1inch frame is so large that he does not even fit on his standard issue metal bed. And gone are his Patriots nutritional consultants to ensure he is eating the right food - in their place are unhealthy muffins, grits for breakfast and burritos for dinner. Inside his prison cell - which he has . to keep neat at all times - is the metal bed with thin mattress, a . pillow and a blanket, a combined toilet and sink with a seat that . doesn’t fit and a small metal desk with a stool attached to it. Each . day begins with breakfast at 6am for Inmate No. 174594, formerly No. 81 . for the Patriots, said Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson. He said: 'He'll get an egg - one egg, and a portion of grits.' Nobody is asking Hernandez, 23, for autographs as prison guards have been told to treat him like anybody else. Inside the cell: County Sheriff Tom Hodgson inspects a 7x10-foot cell in the Bristol County House of Correction, which is the same sized cell that Hernandez is now living in . Exercise cages: There are several exercise cages in the courtyard of the Bristol County House of Correction - this is where Hernandez gets to spend one hour a day outside to do pushups . Life of luxury: The former $1.3m house of New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez is pictured in North Attleborough, Massachusetts . Behind bars: The former New England Patriots star is adjusting to life in the Bristol County House of Correction in Massachusetts (pictured) ‘He’d likely get a small muffin square and a choice between milk or juice. We actually serve Tang now to cut costs. ‘But believe it or not, it actually has a higher nutritional value than orange juice and it’s cheaper.’ For an extra refreshment Hernandez has to bend his head down and slurp out of the tap in the sink. Other meals include a cheese burrito with bread and rice or rice and beans with green beans. Each day Hernandez is allowed to leave his cell three times for an hour each time. The . morning hour is to take a shower in a small stall and make some collect . phone calls. He also makes phone calls in his afternoon hour. His exercise hour is at 5pm where he is led to the pen which is big enough for one inmate to do sit ups and press ups. Meals: A recent lunch consisted of a burrito, bread, rice, and vegetables at the Bristol County House of Correction, where former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez is awaiting trial for first degree murder . Inside the facility: Hernandez spends 21 hours a day in a solitary 7ft by 10ft cell at Bristol County House of Correction (a common area pictured in the jail) He had a $40m contract .

When he is in his cell he reads a lot . and was recently given a copy of Tuesdays With Morrie, the bestselling . memoirs of writer Mitch Albom which has the words: ‘An old man, a young . man, and life’s great lesson’ on the front cover. In . jail Hernandez’s former $40m contract is worth nothing - the maximum . amount of money he is allowed to have in his commissary account is $80. And . because of fears he will be murdered by a gang member looking to make a . name for themselves, Hernandez has to be kept in a ‘special management . unit’ - which is effectively solitary. Hodgson said that so far Hernandez has been a model prisoner and seemed ‘very comfortable’ even on the day he arrived. Nevertheless, the difference between his life then and his life now is stark. Hodgson said: ‘Every Sunday he went into a stadium where thousands of people cheered him and revered him. Prison entrance: His cell includes a metal bed with thin mattress, a pillow and a blanket, a combined toilet and sink with a seat that doesn't fit and a small metal desk . External view of the prison: Hernandez's 6ft by 1inch frame is so large that he does not even fit on his standard issue metal bed in his cell . ‘In an instant he walks through our door, gets a new uniform, a longer number, and nobody’s cheering for him.’ Hernandez . was arrested for the murder of his friend Odin Lloyd, 27, who was shot . dead on June 17 at an industrial area near Hernandez’s home in North .

Ashamed: John Heesom, 23, was jailed after admitting to joy riding an ambulance while drunk and crashing it in Flintshire . A drunk joy rider who drove off in an ambulance and crashed it while a paramedic was on an emergency call has been jailed. John Heesom, 23, had downed nine pints of lager and some shots before stealing the rapid response vehicle from outside a house in the village of Caergwrle in Flintshire in February. The driver was inside treating an seriously ill man with a defibrillator and drugs but had left the keys in the ignition of the liveried Ford Focus, Mold Crown Court heard. Emmalyne Downing, prosecuting, said Heesom jumped into the car and sped off but then hit a curb damaging a wheel. Rather than stopping, he drove on until the tyre disintegrated. When he finally he stopped, he got out and tried to set the ambulance alight before fleeing the scene. Police were able to find the ambulance because it was fitted with a tracker, and Heesom was arrested a short time later after being hunted dow by a sniffer dog. When he was caught by police, Heesom had a breath alcohol reading of 60 . microgrammes, almost twice the legal limit of 35. North Wales Ambulance Service has been left more than £5,000 out of pocket following the incident after the vehicle was written off due to smoke damage, and drugs and equipment which were inside had to be destroyed. The service has not been able to replace the ambulance, and is now forced to shared one with another station. Heesom, a car plant worker, was jailed for eight months and banned from driving for two years by Judge Rhys Rowlands, sitting at Mold Crown Court, who said he had 'put people's lives at risk'. He said: 'You took an ambulance rapid response vehicle . After you lost control and damaged it, your first reaction was to try and set it alight.' Judge Rowlands added that such vehicles carry out a 'crucially important task' in the community and that Heesom's actions had prevented it being used again that night and prevented the paramedic from continuing with his duties. The ambulance vehicle, similar to the one pictured, was a write-off following the incident costing North Wales Ambulance Service more than £5,000 . Heesom, from Cymau, between Mold and Wrexham, admitted aggravated vehicle taking, drink driving and a driving licence offence. He claimed that he had not realised that it was an ambulance vehicle. Oliver King, defending, stressed that his client was 'embarrassed and ashamed' and had been shunned in the small community where he lives because of his actions. He also claimed that Heesom is planning to run a charity half . marathon in Chester in an effort to raise money for the ambulance service. 'He wants to make reparation,' Mr King said. 'He is truly remorseful for what he did that night.'","John Heesom, 23, stole rapid response vehicle from outside house .

Luisa Zissman is not one for keeping her opinions to herself and women appear to be the target of her latest outburst as the 25-year-old Apprentice finalist has declared that she 'hates feminists.' It's a curious admission considering her success on Alan Sugar's reality TV show, in which an equal number of aspiring young businessmen and women vie for the chance to work with the business magnate. The cake shop owner from St Albans, . Hertfordshire has defeated 14 other candidates to make it to tonight's . final on BBC1, in which she'll be competing against another aspiring businesswoman, 24-year-old Leah Totton. Lady in red: Luisa Zissman on The Apprentice (left) and on holiday in Las Vegas last June . This perhaps explains Luisa's subsequent retraction of sorts, as reported by The Telegraph: 'Okay, I don't hate feminism. I'm totally behind women in business but I just don't think gender should be an issue at all.' The self-described 'Business Barbie' adds, 'What I've learned through this process is that the general public are quick to say I'm a bimbo when they first meet me. But just because I've got my boobs out doesn't mean I haven't got a brain in my head.' 'I don't think we should be judged for the way we look. They should recognise our business ability and say, ""You've done well girls"".' Luisa's stint on the show has been notable for a spate of controversies. The Sun reported that she had an affair with her married boss when she was a 17-year-old school-leaver entering employment for the first time. Challengers: Luisa Zissman, cake shop owner, and Leah Totton (right), practising doctor - The Apprentice finalists . This was revealed shortly after footage was discovered featuring the businesswoman and mother confirming that she had an abortion when she was 16. And earlier this month it was alleged that Luisa's ex-boyfriend ran a firm of high-class prostitutes and encouraged her to sign up. A source told The Sun, 'Most women would run a mile if they found out their man sold women for sex, but Luisa wasn't fazed in the slightest.' The source added: 'When her boyfriend saw how accepting she was of his business he asked her if she wanted to give it a go. He knew how popular she would be with his clients so he was very keen to get her involved. But Luisa refused.' The 'job interview from hell': Alan Sugar on The Apprentice with this season's candidates . Time out: Luisa has been living it up on holiday in Thailand when not working on the show . The show assembles candidates into groups that race to complete the tasks assigned them. And this season hasn't been easy: assignments have included activities like creating and branding their own ready meals, opening and selling a farm shop, and conceiving of a new online dating concept that would withstand the scrutiny of a group of experts. Based on the strength of her business running two cupcake shops, Luisa hopes to impress Lord Sugar with her plan to launch a range of baking supplies. Competitor Leah hopes her business option - opening a chain of non-surgical cosmetic clinics - will win Lord Sugar's £250,000 investment. The Amstrad business mogul and his colleagues have expressed ethical concerns about Leah's idea, wondering how honest it is to make money out of 'girls not feeling good about themselves,' as an adviser put it. This suggests Luisa may be pulling ahead of her adversary; but it's not long to wait before tonight's winner is announced.","Cake shop owner is one of two women to reach tonight's Apprentice final .

Valerie, who works in the family cleaning business with Alina, 43, said: 'The fact that Joe was married to Vicki didn't bother me at all.

Keeping them sweet: Joe Darger alternates between each of his wives' bedrooms every evening . Polygamy among Mormons began with the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement Joseph Smith when he declared in upstate New York in 1831 that he had seen visions telling him that 'plural marriage' should be practised. After his death in 1844, followers took polygamy to Utah, where it was practised publicly until 1890 when it was renounced by the LDS church to win statehood for the territory. During that time, Congress issued the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in 1962 which re-asserted that polygamy was illegal in all US territories. The LDS argued that such laws infringed their right to religiously-based practise under the U.S. Constitution. But a ruling by the Supreme Court in 1878 stated that they were not protected based on the long-standing legal principle that while government cannot interfere with religious beliefs, it can with practices. Various splinter groups left the church after the 1890 Manifesto in order to continue polygamy. Nowadays, there are said to be more than 30,000 people practising polygamy in Utah, Idaho, Montana and Arizona. States occasionally take action against polygamists, notably Tom Green, who was sentenced to five years in prison for bigamy in Utah in August 2001. One famous Mormon is U.S. presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, whose father George W. Romney was born in 1907 in a settlement in Mexico that had been founded in the 1880s by Mormons fleeing American anti-polygamy laws. The last polygamist in Romney’s direct ancestry was his great-grandfather Miles Park Romney, who had three wives. Romney's paternal grandfather Gaskell was monogamous and the Mormon Church outlawed polygamy in 1890. Describing their joint dates, Joe . said: 'Since Alina and Vicki were close friends and were interested in . pursuing me together, the best thing I could do was to nurture that . combined friendship. 'I was attracted to both girls and knew that individual relationships would develop in time.' Vicki and Alina had been married to . Joe for ten years when they both encouraged him to start pursuing a . relationship with Vicki's twin Valerie. Valerie . had just gone through a divorce after her marriage to an older man . Donald, who had six wives, broke down due to his gambling and abusive . treatment. One evening, while Valerie and her . five children were staying with the Darger family, she felt a sudden . spark of chemistry with Joe. Joe admitted: 'I had a connection with . Valerie, but the fact she was Vicki's twin was weird - they both had . the same mannerisms. But Vicki opened my mind to it.' Alina . added: 'I was excited at the prospect of Val becoming part of our . family. I had a genuine love and concern for her and wanted her to be . the happiest she could possibly be.' Joe . and Valerie married in another Mormon service in their home, with Vicki . and Alina standing beside them, and celebrated with a family meal. The . Dargers were investigated by state authorities several years ago for . their beliefs and attempted to keep their plural marriage secret for . many years.

When it comes to beauty products, bitter experience has taught me that price frequently has little to do with effectiveness. In fact, many of my cut-price buys from High Street chemists and supermarkets have outperformed 'cult' brands that seem to deliver nothing more than pseudo-scientific credentials at inflated prices. So when I heard this month that a cream costing just £1.69 was taking the beauty industry by storm, I wasn't at all surprised. 'Genius on dry skin': Bottle O'Butter has suddenly shot to the top of every beauty must-have list - and for good reason . Once only available in Afro and Afro-Caribbean shops and salons, a cocoa butter body cream called Bottle O' Butter has suddenly shot to the top of every beauty must-have list. Everyone from the beauty bloggers to the Mumsnetters is falling over themselves to give an opinion (good, on the whole) while the product is now widely available online - though at significantly hiked-up prices. 'It's genius on dry skin - you have to try it!' enthused my beauty addict friend Lily, whipping a bottle from her shoulder bag in the middle of a recent barbecue. Observing Lily's dewy and entirely scale-free limbs, the assembled women eagerly began slathering the stuff on to knees, elbows, shins and any children who strayed into range. 'Looks industrial,' observed my bemused husband - a fair point given that the packaging is definitely not one of the product's strong points. There's the name for starters: 'Bottle O' Butter' sounds less like a pampering treat than a prop from Pirates Of The Caribbean. Then there's the bottle's challenging colour - reminiscent of something treated in Ronseal. But Lily would not be silenced on the subject. The cream isn't sticky, she promised, and doesn't smell sickly like some cocoa butter creams do. It's rich (the product contains lanolin as well as cocoa butter) and would therefore be perfect to use on weather-dried skin (I'm a runner and regularly suffer from rain and wind-chapping). Creme de la cream: While the stuff takes a long time to sink into skin, once it does, it will give your epidermis a lovely, glossy sheen . Lily also advised I try using it on the children's skin as an antidote to the irritation caused by chlorinated water in swimming pools. I was convinced enough to go in search of my own supply. Lily, after all, knows what she's talking about when it comes to cult products. She's the first person I can recall using Touche Eclat back in the early Nineties and she hasn't put an immaculate foot wrong since. I could have had my Bottle O' Butter delivered to my front door the following day had I ordered it online. Numerous suppliers have cottoned on to the product's mounting popularity and are selling Bottle O' Butter for around £7 with a further £10 added for quick delivery. But being a sucker for a beauty bargain, I decided to try and hunt it down for myself amongst my local West London beauty salons. It turns out, however, that while Bottle O'Butter might be developing a cult online following, this hasn't yet translated into extra piles of stock in the shops. The girl in the local mini mart kept directing me towards the Lurpak while the nice lady in the chemist next door wasn't selling it, but told me she had been given a bottle by her sister. After some intensive detective work, I eventually received word that Bottle O' Butter was being sold in a beauty salon on a side street off the main road. Feeling like skincare's answer to Hercule Poirot, I dashed to the address to discover a lone bottle on a back shelf, between the hair relaxers. And it was still only £1.69! 'Very popular stuff that,' smiled the woman behind the counter. 'I'm going to put the price up next week. That's my last bottle but tell your friends there's more coming soon.' I'm not sure I want to let them in on the secret - because my search was more than worth it. The cream is extremely thick and rich and gives your skin a lovely, glossy sheen that - at least on me - seems to last all day. It's a particularly welcome effect given that summer's arrival means neglected heels, shins and decolletage must suddenly come out of hibernation. A word of warning, however: the stuff takes ages to sink in. I found myself rubbing it into my shins for about half an hour after my shower - so no good if you're in a rush. And it would definitely be too pore-clogging to use on your face. In the two weeks since I've begun using Bottle O' Butter several of my friends have commented on how good my skin looks. My husband has been caught using it as after-sun lotion and even my seven-year-old son will allow it to be applied after swimming on the grounds that it 'doesn't smell like girls' (it doesn't smell of anything much). My Liz Earle Botanical Body Cream (closer to £20 than £2) meanwhile, has started gathering dust. In fact so enamoured am I of my bargain beauty find that I've even started to come round to the name. Rather than masquerading as an 'intensive moisture delivery system' or a '24-hour nourishing complex' the stuff just does what it says on the tin. And we know that particular marketing strategy has worked before now … .","Bottle O'Butter is taking the beauty industry by storm .

Marks and Spencer's autumn/winter womenswear range was given a resounding thumbs by fashionistas when it was unveiled last week - even winning over the Daily Mail's fashion critic Liz Jones. Now the menswear collection has been revealed and the British High Street brand will be hoping for positive feedback leading to a boast in sales. Aiming for a younger audience, the collection is modelled by rising star Oliver Cheshire from Hertfordshire. Dapper: Bold colours and classic cuts feature in the 'Best of British Collection' from M&S . 'Fantastic value': This Savile Row style suit costs £800 . The chiseled cheekboned 24-year-old has already helped tills ring at M&S by modelling their swimwear and also boosted sales at Superdry when he became a face of the brand. Now the boyfriend of popstar Pixie Lott lends his effortlessly cool image to the M&S range that aims to celebrate the best in British design and manufacture. The brand say the 'Best of British Collection' - made entirely using British designers, fabrics and manufacturers - 'combines our rich heritage with modern styling to create an edit of . timeless pieces with an emphasis on true British craftsmanship and . quality.' The garments have been made from fabrics such as Scottish cashmere through to Yorkshire cloths. Bold yellow, blue and red jumpers brighten up an autumnal look when combined with grey suits while crisp white shirts can be dressed up for a smart work look or down for a geek chic appearance. Something for everyone: Head of menswear design Tony O'Connor said they hope the collection appeals to a younger audience as well as older customers . As with the womenswear, coats are a key element of the collection with checked overcoats, tweed and fitted styles allowing wearers to be suave as well as warm. Head of menswear design Tony O'Connor told GQ that the jewel in the crown of the collection is a Savile Row quality suit for £800. 'I love the idea of a young guy wearing . one of our Harris Tweed jackets with jeans and brogues whereas your . classic guy is going to wear it with a lambswool and cords' He said: 'The great thing with the company at the moment is what they can offer . quality-wise is incredible. There are some pieces that are fantastic . value for what they are. Even though the £800 Best Of British suit is . our most expensive suit... to give the chap that accessibility to a suit that would . normally off the peg in Savile Row cost £2,000 for £800 is something!' He added that in aiming for a younger market the brand don't want to alienate their older fans but instead believe they can offer something for everyone depending on how an item is worn. He said: 'In terms of the brand itself we have a broad church of classic customers, but what we're seeing increasingly is a growth in the under 35 market: people appreciating what we're doing with quality and I'm really trying to push the style aspect further. 'I love the idea of a young guy wearing one of our Harris Tweed jackets with jeans and brogues whereas your classic guy is going to wear it with a lambswool and cords.' Seal of approval: Cheshire described the collection as 'perfect' and 'on trend' in his blog . New looks: The British brand hope to have successful sales with their revamped women's and men's ranges . After his modelling gig, Cheshire gave the collection his own seal of approval. Writing on his blog, I Wear The Trousers, he said: 'Is this range of menswear from high street giant Marks and Spencer the best they have ever produced? That's a big fat yes in my eyes, and it's not just because I'm face of the campaign. 'Every item in the Best of British collection is perfect, massively on trend and very wearable and that's not to mention the quality of the material and cuts of suits. The stand out pieces are their beautiful double-breasted, Prince of Wales-checked overcoats, and their grey speckled suits - they wouldn't look out of place in any of the biggest runway shows around the world! 'M&S has so stepped up to the mark and way beyond it with this range and I feel very honoured to be part of this fashion history.' 'Marks & Spencer are showing that a mainstream, high-street retailer can return to producing in Britain if they want to. Returning to their St Michael roots, the collection offers the best of the British Isles, most notably tweeds and knitwear. While some may think £800 for a suit is expensive, it is actually good value. For something comparable with a designer name and made in the UK, you would be looking at least double, if not triple the price.' Marcus Jaye, founder & creative director, TheChicGeek.co.uk . 'It's rare that you actually say to yourself, I want everything in the collection, but on this occasion, that's actually how I feel. M&S have pulled it out of the bag, it hits the exact right balance of being directional, stylish and completely wearable and if that wasn't enough all the range is produced to the HIGHEST of quality, right here in Blightly!' Anthony McGrath, editor in chief Clothes-make-the-man.com . 'What I like about this collection is . that M&S has resisted the temptation to play safe with middle-aged . grunge.

When asked, the average adult estimated their wash bag contents to be worth £52.23 - a third of the true amount . They are the everyday essentials you never think twice about slinging in the supermarket trolley. But the chances are your toiletries are costing you more than you realise, with many of us spending hundreds every year. A new poll shows the contents of the average British wash bag is worth an incredible £156.69, although 80 per cent of us have no idea just how much we are spending. When asked, the average adult estimated their wash bag contents to be worth £52.23 - a third of the true amount. In total, the British public now spend more than £14 billion on toiletry products each year. And it's not women - the survey also revealed a quarter of all men questioned now use expensive beauty products as part of their daily routine. Researchers say the enormous cost is down to increasingly more sophisticated beauty regimes, with many people using several different creams every day just on their skin. And because most people buy products individually when they need to be replenished, the full cost is hard to estimate. The survey, by Travelodge, found 50 per cent of men have now ditched soap and water in favour of a more sophisticated daily beauty regime. This included cleansing, toning and using anti-aging skin care products such as face serum, eye cream and moisturiser. One in four male respondents admitted to splashing out on premium brands usually used by women. The survey of 3,000 British adults was undertaken after the hotel chain saw a rise in the number of toiletry bags being left behind in its 521 hotels. In the last 12 months, hotel staff has spent hundreds of hours uniting 10,000 wash bags with their owners. In one case a customer paid over a £100 for a courier to pick up her designer toiletry bag, which contained more than £1,000 worth of items. Over half of adults surveyed stated they have two toiletry bags on the go at the same time, for home, holidays, at the gym or for work. The enormous cost is down to more sophisticated beauty regimes and some people use several creams a day . A third of women surveyed stated their toiletry bag is the most important item they pack when travelling away from home. A fifth of women polled admitted they purchase more expensive toiletry items when they are going on holiday as it feels like a special treat. One in five women think nothing of spending £50 on anti-ageing creams and own 10 different bottles of expensive perfume. The study also explored the beauty regimes and habits of British men and women. Shakila Ahmed from Travelodge said: 'The main reason to why so many Britons are clueless to the actual value of their toiletry bag is due to the fact that most adults purchase their toiletry essentials on ad-hoc basics. 'It's very rarely that you would go out and purchase all items in one go therefore you don't really know the exact total cost as you have brought the items singularly.'","British public now spend more than £14billion on toiletry products .

Austin Chapman figured his short films must be pretty good because they've been sweeping major awards on the independent film festival circuit the past couple of years. He was never quite sure about the soundtracks, however, because Chapman, who is deaf, could never really hear them. A Life of Silence: Austin Chapman, 23, was born profoundly deaf and could only hear low buzzing-like sounds with the help of his old hearing aides. His life has largely been visual until now . Or any other music. Then, a month ago he popped a brand new pair of bright orange, state-of-the art hearing aids into his ears and his world was changed forever. He cranked up Mozart's Lacrimosa and suddenly tears of joy streamed spontaneously down his face. He turned on Radiohead and Devo and an epiphany occurred. After years of scratching his head as friends around him snapped their fingers to the beat of Rolling Stones songs or got up and moved to the wave of electronic dance music created by DJ Moonboots, Chapman suddenly understood what this human fascination with sound was all about. More... Happiness gene that affects the level of feel good chemicals in the brain has been discovered ¿ but it only works for women . Internal 'brush' that lines the lungs could offer insight into treating diseases such as cystic fibrosis and asthma . New wonder drug can heal lungs of Cystic Fibrosis sufferers . The 23-year-old filmmaker, whose life has largely been visual until now, still struggles to adequately explain the rush of new sounds echoing through his head. He compares them at one point to seeing a high-resolution photograph for the first time. Later, he describes the sensation as being exposed to a color you've never seen before. A Life-changing Revelation: Now with the assistance of a new set of state-of-the-art hearing aides by Phonak, the filmmaker is rocking out to all sorts of music . Finally, with a broad smile on his face he offers this analogy: 'It's like the first time you kiss a girl. It's like that.' The experience came as he cruised around his Orange County, Calif., neighborhood with friends soon after getting the new hearing aids. He had always wanted to really hear Mozart, so his friends put on Lacrimosa, the brooding work the composer completed on his death bed in 1791. 'I was in the car and it was quite an experience,' recalls Kyle Sinnott, Chapman's best friend since high school. 'He was nodding his head and moving his fingers. He cried at one point, and the same goes for everybody in the car. Everybody let out a tear.' Soon Chapman was playing Brain Damage from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and humming along to the ethereal 'wooh oooh' guitar part that surfaces eerily throughout the song. Music was in his brain and he couldn't get it out. Not that he's embraced every new sound he's been hearing since getting his new, improved Phonak hearing aids. To his dismay, he can suddenly make out the sounds of other people's conversations that he'd never heard before. Rather than enjoy his new eavesdropping skills, he finds them annoying. 'When I hear the talking, I want to say, `QUIET! SILENCE!'' he says with a laugh as he sits in a downtown deli on a recent afternoon, trying to ignore the conversation at a nearby table. The sound of a baby cooing does please him. 'I've never heard a baby talk before,' he says, smiling in wonder. 'Their voices are too high.' Born profoundly deaf, Chapman's condition was diagnosed when he was about a year old when his mother noticed he didn't flinch when a door was slammed behind him. Neither his parents nor his sister have a hearing impairment, and he says doctors don't really know why he was afflicted. A Burgeoning Playlist: Chapman has been playing everything from Pink Floyd and Brain Damage to Devo and Radiohead. He says he is waiting to get a new sound system before he buys every Beatles album in existence . Although he had worn his old hearing aids for only four years, they had already become outmoded. All he could make out with them were low sounds like those made by a bass guitar. Sometimes a mid-range tone would break through, but high tones didn't exist in Chapman's world. It was the same when it came to listening to a conversation. He could hear someone speaking directly to him in a clear voice, especially if it was someone with a deep voice and someone he knew and the sound of whose voice he had come to recognize. But he struggled to hear people talking in higher tones, something he said led him to avoid striking up conversations with strangers. He's less reluctant to do so now. He and others have been the beneficiaries of a remarkable breakthrough in digital technology in recent years that has made small hearing aids far more powerful, particularly in picking up higher pitched sounds, says Gisele Ragusa, a University of Southern California professor and expert in deaf education. 'I was in the car and it was quite an experience, He was nodding his head and . moving his fingers. He cried at one point, and the same goes for . everybody in the car. Everybody let out a tear.' She's watched as children were suddenly able to hear music for the first time and noticed they were often frightened until they got used to the new sounds. She's not entirely surprised that an adult would react differently, particularly after years of seeing friends enjoy something he could only hear fragments of, which she notes must have been annoying. 'He would probably feel elated and excited, and also have some sense of confusion at first, until he got used to recognizing what he was hearing,' she said. Chapman quickly posted word of his audio breakthrough on the social network reddit.com, asking others what he should listen to next. To his amazement, within days he had more than 14,000 suggestions, everything from Beethoven to the Beatles.

'I'm waiting until I have a really good sound system,' he says with a chuckle. 'I want to sit down, and when I hear the Beatles for the first time, I want to really hear the Beatles.' Tear of Joy: Chapman recalled how he cried after first listening to music recently when his friends put on Mozart's Requiem mass while driving around Orange County, Calif. In the meantime, he's rewatching his short films, listening to the soundtracks others created and looking forward to someday doing his own. His first work, At the Altar, was made when he was a student at Pepperdine University and won the award for best cinematography at the Reelstories Film Festival in 2010. Eleven Eleven, a hauntingly beautiful film about a young deaf man who finds his soul mate, only to lose her to death after one day, was honored with the festival's grand prize and audience choice awards last year. Also that year, his documentary ""City of Widows"" was honored for its story about the fate of young women in India who are banished to a life of poverty after their husbands' deaths. Since graduating last year, Chapman has worked as a freelance filmmaker. He also runs the website artofthestory.com. His ambition is to eventually make a feature film. Before music entered his life Chapman says he never gave much thought to what his lack of hearing might be causing him to miss. After all, he can read lips, communicate in American sign language and he speaks fluently, though with the pronounced accent of someone who is profoundly deaf and who for most of his life could never clearly hear himself speak. 'I was a really happy person,"" he says. ""I was really happy all the time.' Then, after a moment's thought, he adds with a smile, 'Now I'm even happier.'","Young man was born profoundly deaf, and his old hearing aids allowed him only to make out low, buzzing sounds like those made by a .

A jobless mother-of-eleven was today told she will not be getting her palatial new taxpayer-funded home - because the £500,000 property doesn’t meet her needs. A storm of protest had erupted over the six-bedroom property being specially built for Heather Frost, who also keeps a horse. Frost, 37, who has never worked and whose children were fathered by four different men, was due to move into the house in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, at the end of this month. Scroll down for videos . Access denied: Jobless mother-of-11 Heather Frost was just weeks away from moving into this £500,000 eco-house courtesy of the taxpayer. Now the housing association has said it does not meet her needs . Heather Frost with her family (L to R) Chloe, 13, Beth, 8, Angel, 16, Daisy, 5, Toby, 19, Page, 11, Sophie, 21, Ruby, 7, Jay, 14, Emily, 10, Tilly, 3 . But Severn Vale Housing Society announced yesterday: 'Three properties on this site, which include the six-bed home, have not yet been allocated. 'With Tewkesbury Borough Council, we are currently working through the allocations process to identify households with suitable needs. 'I can confirm that Heather Frost was never guaranteed the property and she will not be moving into it. We decided that it does not meet her needs.' A spokeswoman from Tewkesbury Borough Council refused to comment on why the lavish property failed to meet Ms Frost's needs. She said: 'We are unable to comment on changes to an applicant’s housing needs.' Frost currently lives with her children, aged from three to 21, in two terraced houses that have been knocked together. A current neighbour, who refused to give his name, said: 'I'm gutted. I think everyone is. 'We were going to throw a street party when she finally moved away. She's been bragging to everyone how great her new house is.' Plush pad: The six-bedroom home was custom built for Ms Frost and her large brood near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire . The house that was lined up for her has three bathrooms, a large open-plan kitchen-diner and two lounges with French windows overlooking a spacious garden. The 1,850 sq ft detached property was designed with state-of-the-art technology to cut electricity bills - which Frost could have claimed benefits to pay. Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayer’s Alliance, said: 'This utter farce has wasted taxpayers’ money and exposed deep flaws in our broken welfare system. 'The council has spent a fortune building a home that most of us could only dream of living in. 'Benefits are there to help vulnerable people not fund a lifestyle that taxpayers couldn’t afford themselves.' Large garden: Ms Frost complained about her current 'nightmare' living arrangements with her numerous children . Serene green: These pictures are the first look inside and outside the rural home which would cost hard-working families at least £1,500 a month to rent . One of Frost’s former neighbours, widow Doreen Freeman, 81, kept a diary of the misery she said she suffered at her hands. Her son Dr James Freeman said his late mother’s greenhouse was smashed, excrement was thrown into her garden and a soiled mattress was set on fire in her garden. Dr. Freeman, said: 'Frost was never worthy of this palatial offering. 'It smacks of a huge U-turn. They more or less promised the house, she bragged about it and now they say they can’t give it to her. 'Frost operated in the most callous and unfeeling fashion toward my mother and it will come as a relief to whoever moves in to this new development that the Frosts won’t be a part of it. 'She ruined the final years of my mum’s life.' Frost refused to comment on the alleged abuse. Frost’s proposed new home was organised by Tewkesbury Borough Council who sold a plot of land to Severn Vale Housing Association for a discounted price of £210,000. A spokesman from Severn Vale Housing Society said: ''I can confirm that Heather Frost was never guaranteed the property and she will not be moving into it.

Comfortable: One of the three bathrooms (left) and a view of the landing from one of the six bedrooms (right) They placed a condition on the sale that one of the 13 homes being built would be big enough for a large family. At the time the council’s Lead Member for the Built Environment Derek Davies said: 'We have a duty to provide appropriate accommodation to people who are at risk of homelessness. 'Mrs Frost’s family has been living in temporary accommodation, consisting of two houses, for a very long time because there have been no other suitable properties available. 'This is an excellent example of the council working in partnership with registered providers, using public land to develop more affordable housing in line with government policy. 'We were able to sell land owned by the borough council to Severn Vale for them to develop 13 affordable homes, including this unit to meet the particular needs of Mrs Frost and her family. 'By providing this larger affordable property, the two houses currently occupied by the family will be available for other families in need.'

Despite a £5,000-a-week housing allowance courtesy of British taxpayers, they struggled to find a home in London. The new Bank of England Governor’s wife even publicly bemoaned the lack of suitable accommodation after her husband landed the top job. But now Canadian Mark Carney has finally found somewhere to spend his perk – a six-bedroom £3million property. Expensive taste: The designer kitchen . Renting: Mark and Diana Carney . The landlords have spent £1million transforming a semi-detached house from three flats into a single luxury dwelling. Its renovated interior boasts a gym, cellar and outside there are landscaped gardens stretching a long way back from the house. The master bedroom suite is laid out over 600sq ft and includes a huge dressing room and a marble bathroom with his-and-hers sinks. Downstairs, the designer kitchen has sliding doors leading out to the garden and a spiral staircase and cellar. For Mr Carney, who has four daughters, the fact that the house also has five bathrooms was surely a clincher. The property has no air-conditioning – a bête noire of eco-conscious Mr and Mrs Carney. There is even an adjoining  flat with its own entrance that can be used as guest accomodation. Luxury: One of the five bathrooms in the London mansion . The Carneys, both 48, have not moved into the house yet. Mr Carney, a former £1million-a-year Goldman Sachs banker, started work at the Bank of England on Monday, having been poached by Chancellor George Osborne from the Bank of Canada for a five-year term. He is currently lodging in West London. His British wife, Diana, and their daughters are on a summer holiday. Mr Carney was lured from Canada with an £874,000 pay packet – about £100,000 more than predecessor Sir Mervyn King earned – which includes a £250,000-a-year housing allowance, or £4,800 a week. After tax, it works out as £11,041 a month towards his rent which is believed to be nearly £15,000 per month. Last night Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘It’s extraordinary that we are paying for him to have this big house. Ordinary people who have to fund their own rent out of their own wages will wonder why they have to pay his rent as well. He is leading the charge for wage austerity in public and the private sector, and this makes people think he is from a different world.’ Light and airy: The master bedroom also boasts a huge dressing room . Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘Most people have to pay the rent from their own salary so Mr Carney’s taxpayer-funded mansion is sure to raise eyebrows. Politicians must hold him and his pay package to account so taxpayers judge for themselves whether he is worth all this money.’ But leading Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘My view is, if he sorts the economy out, it’s worth every penny.’  The Carneys have let out their house in Ottawa, Canada, for around £1,000 a week. In March, Mrs Carney – an environmental campaigner who recently declared war on teabags – revealed their worries about finding a house in London. She tweeted they would struggle because of an influx of wealthy French fleeing their socialist government’s high taxes. Comfort: The sitting room leads through to a further large lounge . The younger Carney children have enrolled in a local junior school and the elder two are going to different secondary schools – all fee-paying establishments which will cost their parents £18,970 per term. Mrs Carney was born in Cheltenham to a pig farmer and attended £31,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire. The couple met at Oxford University in the 1980s. In Canada, Mr Carney was dubbed a ‘rock star banker’ for his genius in keeping the economy growing as others shrank. He has already signalled good news for homeowners by suggesting interest rates will stay low for the foreseeable future.","Mark Carney's wife had bemoaned lack of suitable accommodation .

Linebacker: Monty Ray Grow played for the Kansas City Chiefs for a season in 1994, alongside Joe Montana, and the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995 . A former NFL linebacker has been arrested in Florida after he left a toddler in a car while he visited a strip club. Monty Ray Grow, who has played for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars, left the three-year-old girl locked in the parking lot of a car dealership in Tampa Bay and popped into the Diamond Dolls erotic nightclub on Sunday night. Police said she was found by her mother and grandparents more than 40 minutes later after they used GPS to track her down. By the time Grow returned from the club they had taken the girl away, replaced by waiting officers. It is unclear exactly how long the toddler was in the car but police said her mother tracked her down at 9.09pm, arrived to pick her up six minutes later before Grow emerged from the club at 9.48pm. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said Grow, of Redington Beach, was charged with child abuse Sunday night and was later released on $5,000 bail. It would not reveal his relationship to the little girl, saying only that he was supposed to be caring for her. When Grow returned to the car, he reportedly acknowledged leaving the uninjured child unattended. Grow played linebacker for the Gators from 1989 to 1993. He went on to play a season each for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Rebekah Brooks received £10.8million after resigning as chief executive of News International . Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks walked away with almost £11million when she resigned at the height of the phone-hacking scandal. Her pay-off when she quit as chief executive of News International last year was initially believed to be £3.5million, then reportedly £7million. But accounts published yesterday by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation revealed the true sum was significantly higher and will continue to grow. They reveal that Mrs Brooks, a close ally of Murdoch and friend of David  Cameron, received £10.8million as ‘compensation for loss of office.’ The sum – which dwarfs the £2 million compensation paid by News International to the family of Milly Dowler for hacking her phone – includes ‘various ongoing benefits’ including funding a London office and staff for two years. Mrs Brooks will also have ‘all legal and other professional costs’ relating to the court cases she is fighting paid for ‘until those investigations are concluded’. The accounts note that the company expects more costs will be incurred. The former executive denies three sets of charges. She has been accused of conspiring with her husband, Charlie, and others to pervert the course of justice. She is also facing charges of conspiring to intercept the voicemails of individuals. Earlier this month Mrs Brooks appeared at the Old Bailey, alongside Mr Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson, another ex-editor of the News of the World, over alleged illegal payments to public officials. The editor of The Times, James Harding, quit yesterday. He said: ‘It has been made clear to me News Corporation would like to appoint a new editor.’ Mrs Brooks was a close ally of Mr . Murdoch and part of the 'Chipping Norton set' which also includes Mr . Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. She edited the News of the World and the Sun before becoming chief executive of News International in 2009. She was thought to have been instrumental in securing The Sun's backing for the Conservatives in the 2010 general election. Mr . Cameron faced repeated criticism for getting too close to the Murdoch . empire and his friendship with Mrs Brooks, and her husband Charlie who . he went to Eton with. Last . month Lord Justice Leveson's report into media standards found Mr . Cameron's closeness to senior media executives like Rebekah Brooks had . created a problem of ‘public perception’. The report said: 'Mr Cameron went to great lengths . to secure meetings face-to-face with Mr Murdoch and other News . International executives and editors. ‘The benefits of this may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated.' Mrs Brooks is understood to have been a key ally in persuading Mr Murdoch to back the Tories at the 2010 election. Her husband Charlie (left) was at Eton with David Cameron . He added: ‘The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a . ‘deal’ whereby News International’s support was traded for the . expectation of policy favours.’ Giving . evidence to the Leveson Inquiry - set up in response to the phone . hacking scandal - she revealed details of text messages she had . exchanged with the Prime Minister.

He said: 'I decided today that until the 'Stand Your Ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.' He continued: 'The truth is that for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world, we can't bring them back. 'What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do.' Under the 'Stand Your Ground Law' a person is able to use deadly force if they fear their life is under threat. Courtesy: Eric Marchand . Music Legend: Stevie Wonder with President Barack Obama in 2009 - The Grammy award-winning musician has reacted strongly to the acquittal of George Zimmerman on Saturday . Florida officials have repeatedly said they will not consider scrapping the controversial law. Zimmerman,29, was cleared of the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin after a trial that divided America. 'I decided today that until the ‘Stand Your Ground’ law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world. The truth is that — for those of you who’ve lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world — we can’t bring them back. What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That’s what I know we can do.' He has gone into hiding amid death threats. Outrage over the Zimmerman verdict has led to an outpouring of anger on the streets of many US cities. Black performers have used Twitter to express their anger that Zimmerman was not held accountable for the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. Stars such as Jay-Z, Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip are among those who've dedicated live performances to the late teenager. Since George Zimmerman's controversial acquittal, civil rights groups and leaders have called for legal action against the neighborhood watch volunteer. On Sunday, in a move which could have dramatic ramifications, the Justice Department confirmed today that it will look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal charges against George Zimmerman in the wake of his acquittal. Florida teen Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a self-appointed neighbourhood watch rep George Zimmerman as he walked in an apartment complex in Sanford - Zimmerman was found not-guilty of all charges against him on Saturday . George Zimmerman is greeted by defense counsel Don West at the start of his trial in Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida last week before his acquittal on Saturday night . The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed. In a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of the civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and testimony from the state trial. The statement said that, in the government's words, 'experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation.' George Zimmerman's acquittal of the murder of Trayvon Marton has cast an enormous spotlight onto the controversial status of 'stand your ground' laws.The defense allowed people to defend themselves with force when they feel threatened in their home, business, car or any place they 'have a legal right to be'.However, at least 22 states have a similar law and it is not clear whether Stevie Wonder is aware of this, as he has only specifically mentioned Florida in relation to his boycott.The states where 'Stand Your Ground' exists in some form or another are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West VirginiaWhile George Zimmerman did not use 'stand your ground' as a defense, police did not arrest him for almost two months after Trayvon Martin's death.This was because police initially did not have the evidence to disprove Zimmerman's claim he acted in self defense, according to former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee.Mr. Lee resigned from Sanford police as a result of his failure to charge Zimmerman last year.Across the nation there are 22 states that have 'stand your ground law' with varying degrees of requirements of how and when deadly force is justified.Before 2005, a citizen was required to have attempted to flee the scene before defending themselves, but afterwards that was amended to remove the running away aspect.Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses, while others extend the law to cars or any place someone 'has a right to be.' This moves follows demands from a furious NAACP for the Obama administration to intervene. Already, over 100,000 people have signed up to an online petition and the NAACP has written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging the Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against 29-year-old Zimmerman. In his first public statement since the verdict, President Barack Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence. 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,' Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement. 'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.' Obama, who last year said that 'if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' added that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. 'And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,' he said. The president urged Americans to broaden 'the circle of understanding and compassion' in their communities and put some of the emotion the case has aroused into curtailing gun violence. 'We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,' he said. 'We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.' 'That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin,' he added. George Crump the family's attorney said that they will still be pursuing a civil case against George Zimmerman. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous was unequivocal in his response to the not-guilty decision on Saturday by the Florida jury. 'We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,' NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement. We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,' said Jealous.

Politicians such as Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y) and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson have all added their voices to the NAACP's position and demanded the administration review the case. The Rev. Al Sharpton, called the verdict 'a sad day in the country' and 'a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country.' 'I think this is an atrocity,' Sharpton said. 'It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.' Jesse Jackson called the verdict 'Old South justice.' 'I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,' Jackson said. Jealous said Martin's family may bring a civil suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges must be filed because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case. He told CNN the black community is upset with a situation in which 'our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys. The robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who think that they're keeping folks safer.' Sharpton, who called the verdict 'a slap in the face to the American people,' cited the example of Rodney King, the man whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police triggered rioting two decades ago after a state criminal trial found the police officers not guilty.","Grammy-award winner has vowed to boycott any state where 'Stand Your Ground' laws exist .

An Atlanta community has painted over a French artist's mural commissioned by a nonprofit organisation to improve their neighbourhood - because they say its depictions of snakes is 'satanic'. Covering a wall in southwest Atlanta by French graffiti artist Pierre Roti the art features a fantasy creation of a part-human, part-alligator, part-fish under the commission of non-profit group Living Walls. 'The fishes were satanic, the scales were satanic. You know, they just don't feel that it represents their community,' Angel Poventud, a mutually upset resident from the wall's Pittsburgh neighbourhood, told WSB-TV. Defaced: Part of French artist Pierre Roti's mural, commissioned by a non-profit group in Atlanta, is seen before upset residents covered it with paint on Friday calling it 'satanic' Upset: Seen as part alligator, part human, part fish, some residents were upset by it calling for its removal before taking matters into their own hands . Aftermath: The wall is seen on Friday morning after grey paint was rolled across it with the help of a former State lawmaker who lives nearby . Waking up on Friday morning, however, residents who had enjoyed the mural were outraged to see sections of grey paint rolled across it - just days after a petition was signed by more than a thousand residents to save it. 'To see it being defaced that way, it was disappointing and saddening,' nearby resident Adrainne Gray told WSB-TV. There with her was her young son Everrett who said he had enjoyed the mural too, making a face over the work's aftermath to show his described disgust in its covering. 'I didn't think it was nice,' he said. But what's now at the heart of the issue, however, is whether Living Walls had permission to create the mural in the first place, as fans of the mural spent the remainder of Friday scrubbing off the grey paint. Restoration: Fans of the mural spent the remainder of Friday scrubbing off the paint to restore it to its former display . Failed petition: A woman scrubs at the covered mural on Friday that was defaced despite a petition that collected more than 1,000 signatures to save it . Hard work: The 23-year-old graffiti artist, seen during its creation, spent a month working on it as one of many artists commissioned by the group world-wide . The property belongs to the Georgia Department of Transportation who have said that they never issued a permit for the mural. Arguing their case, Living Walls showed signed applications approving the mural by three Atlanta city departments. The group said they didn't realize they needed City Council to pass an ordinancy approving the work as well. 'Nobody in the Pittsburgh community knows what this represents. Nobody.

Didn't try to get a permit ... I don't think I have to. I'm a tax payer.' Amid the outcry of the work which took the 23-year-old artist a month to create for the Atlanta non-profit - whose said goal is to provide artists from all over the world an opportunity to 'create a more intimate relationship' between themselves and the community - more than 1,000 signatures were collected to save it. Future: What's now uncertain is the future of the mural despite its restoration efforts on Friday . Regardless, Mr Dean said those numbers shouldn’t matter. 'It is so wrong for them to get petitions from people who live in Capitol View and Sylvan Hills and not come to Pittsburgh and talk to us,' Mr Dean said of its location. 'All we want is a process for how to deal with artists who come to our neighbourhood and doing what they want to do. We have some art we want to do in our community,' he said.

Art imitating life: Johnny Wingfield proposed to his girlfriend Lavinia Down of three years by producing a two-minute movie of his life with her . Johnny, from Taunton, Somerset, approached the Watershed cinema in Bristol about his unique proposal idea and staff leapt at the chance to be part of the ruse. They printed fake tickets, ran trailers and fake adverts for a screening of the new documentary flick 'Stories We Tell' - and even got staff to pose as audience members. Lavinia, 25, was dragged to the cinema by sculptor Johnny last Friday, just six days after their first child, Herbie, was born six weeks prematurely.

'I began working on it on my iPad using stick figures, but it was such a laborious process it would have taken me two years, and I didn't want that.

Nasa's next Mars rover has been given a mission to find signs of past life and to collect and store rock from the the red planet that will one day be sent back to Earth. It will demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet and look for signs of life. The space agency has revealed what the rover, known as Mars 2020, will look like. Scroll down for video... Nasa's next Mars rover (plans pictured) has been given a mission to find signs of past life and to collect and store rock from the the red planet that will one day be sent back to Earth. Mars 2020 will also demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet . It will share the body of Nasa's Curiosity Rover, which is currently searching for life on Mars and beginning the journey to its final destination. The new rover will use the same landing system as Curiosity, which used a ground-breaking chassis and 'sky crane' to arrive on Mars in one piece. It will also use some of the current robot's spare parts to save time on the new design as well as money. Mars 2020 is estimated to cost a princely $1.5 billion - one billion less than its predecessor Curiosity. The new design, which will collect rock samples, marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science in Washington, said: 'Crafting the science and exploration goals is a crucial milestone in preparing for our next major Mars mission.' The 2020 mission plans on building on the accomplishments of Curiosity and other Mars missions. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, along with several orbiters, found evidence Mars has a watery history. Curiosity recently confirmed that past environmental conditions on Mars could have supported living microbes. According to the Science Definition Team, looking for signs of past life is the next logical step. The rover will use its instruments for visual, mineralogical and chemical analysis down to microscopic scale to understand the environment around its landing site. It will also identify biosignatures or features in the rocks and soil that could have been formed biologically. Jack Mustard, chairman of the Science . Definition Team and a professor of geological sciences at Brown . University in Providence, said: 'The Mars 2020 mission concept does not presume that life ever existed on Mars.' 'However, given the recent Curiosity findings, past Martian life seems possible and we should begin the difficult endeavor of seeking the signs of life. 'No matter what we learn, we would make significant progress in understanding the circumstances of early life existing on Earth and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.' There are plans for the next rover to collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil with the intention of a later mission picking them up bringing them back to Earth for more definitive analysis in laboratories. In a bid to save time and money, the Mars 2020 rover will share the body of Nasa's Curiosity Rover (a model is pictured) which is currently searching for life on Mars and beginning the journey to its final destination. The new rover will use the same landing system as Curiosity, which used a ground-breaking chassis and 'sky crane' to arrive on Mars in one piece . The science conducted by the rover's instruments aims to expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return the samples to Earth. Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington, said: 'The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system.' 'This mission represents a major step towards creating high-value sampling and interrogation methods, as part of a broader strategy for sample returns by planetary missions.' Samples collected and analyzed by the rover will help inform future human exploration missions to Mars. The rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide, which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel. Improved precision landing technology that enhances the scientific value of robotic missions also will be critical for eventual human exploration on the surface, Nasa said.","Mars 2020 will collect up to 31 rock and soil samples from the red planet and will look for signs of extraterrestrial life .

'Progenitor A' and 'Progenitor B': What parents may be called in legal terms if same sex marriage is introduced . Parents could be legally referred to as 'Progenitor A' and 'Progenitor B' under plans for same sex marriage, regardless of their sexuality, it has been claimed. A leading lawyer said, if the institution of marriage is redefined, the erosion of traditional words such as 'mother' and 'father' from British law could have 'Orwellian' consequences. Lord Brennan QC, an opponent of same sex marriage, also claimed the removal of such words from the statute books could result in legislative chaos. The Labour peer said extending the institution of marriage to include homosexual couples could require amendments to laws dating back 800 years, it has been reported. He said analysis of other countries which had already legalised same sex marriage had shown erosion of traditional words in statute, such as 'mother', 'father', 'wife' and 'husband'. Writing in the Telegraph, Lord Brennan - who is also the president of the Catholic Union of Great Britain - used Spain as a recent example, where the Socialist government introduced gay marriage in 2005. He wrote: 'The following year it was announced that Spanish birth certificates would read ""Progenitor A"" and ""Progenitor B"" instead of ""mother"" and ""father"". 'This kind of language is Orwellian. Can we really expect the same kind of thing here if marriage is redefined?' Lord Brennan's warning was dismissed as scaremongering by supporters of same sex marriage, who said the adjustment of legislative language was common practice when new laws are introduced. A draft Bill drawn up by the gay rights group Stonewall proposed amending the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 using the term 'parties to the marriage' to replace the words 'husband' and 'wife'. In current law, the word 'husband' appears 1,003 times, 'wife' 888 times and 'spouse' 2,740. Controversy: Lord Brennan QC (left) claimed same sex marriage would have 'Orwellian' consequences, while David Cameron (right) is keen to press ahead . However the QC - who is a member of . Matrix Chambers and has also represented the families of the Omagh bomb . victims - argued it would take up too much of the government's time and . energy making the amendments. He added in his commentary in the Telegraph: 'In the present grave economic situation, which does Mr Cameron think that so much government and parliamentary time and energy should be dedicated to such a change in the law, effectively obliterating vast amounts of our cultural and legal heritage?' Ben Summerskill, from the gay rights group Stonewall, said there was no evidence extending marriage to same sex couple would cause legal chaos adding: 'I doubt there is legislation from the reign of Edward I that refers to trains or traffic lights but somehow we've managed to amend it.' If the law is changed, Britain will . become the sixth European country - after the Netherlands, Belgium, . Sweden, Spain and Norway - to recognise same-sex marriage. An end to discrimination? But gay marriage ceremonies might not be allowed to take place in church . Despite fierce opposition from the . church, David Cameron has remained resolute in his determination to end . the discrimination faced by homosexual couples. However, Downing Street - in what is thought to be a bid to avert a damaging rebellion by the bishops who sit in the House of Lords - has insisted that the gay marriage ceremonies will not be allowed to take place in church. Mr Cameron faces a major revolt by up to 100 Conservative MPs who have threatened to vote against or abstain when the measure, which is backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, comes to the Commons. The coalition led by Lord Carey, which is backed by Tory MPs, peers and family groups, will warn the Government to leave traditional marriage alone. It also says the changes are not wanted by the majority of the population and will require the rewriting of 800 years of legislation. The word ‘marriage’ appears 3,258 times in UK legislation, which underlines the central role the institution plays in national law. If the change goes ahead the Government could face legal challenges from the heterosexual community. Ministers have ruled out extending civil partnerships, which became law in December 2005, beyond the gay community. Even though none of the three main political parties included the proposal in their manifestos at the 2010 election, the legislation could be in the next Queen’s Speech in May. A new grassroots organisation, the . Coalition For Marriage (C4M), opposes the redefinition of marriage . to include same sex couples. It was launched in response to the forthcoming publication of a consultation document by the Equalities . Minister, Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone, on how to introduce same-sex . marriage before 2015. Colin Hart, C4M's campaign director, said the proposed upheaval was being driven by the forces of political correctness and a handful of single-issue pressure groups. He said: ‘The word marriage is woven into the fabric of our national laws. That can’t be just unpicked in a single stroke.'","Erosion of traditional words in British statute could 'lead to legislative chaos'

Britain's first infestation of a the deadly Black Widow spider has been discovered in a machinery plant in East Norfolk. Engineers at the plant discovered the notoriously viscous spider and after a Google search to identify it called in pest control. Factory workers and office assistants were evacuated by pest control officers as the spider was sealed in an air tight container. A nest of eggs was later discovered in the same crate where the spider was originally found after more than 100 baby Black Widows hatched from a small sack the size of a pea. Scroll down for video . Aggressive: The spider, seen here through a magnified lid, was identified on site and quickly sealed in a special air-tight container . The nest of spiders was discovered once 100 babies hatched from the small sack . 'You could tell it was a Black Widow because of the hourglass pattern on the thorax and the aggressive stance the spider was taken once trapped in our containers,' said Ian Parkinson, a service manager at Abate Pest Control, who dealt with the request. ''We cordoned off the area in the yard where the spider was discovered and created a ring of insecticide around it. We then used ele4ctric and petrol based foggers on the rest of the site. 'After the factory was closed last night we then sprayed the office areas with a water-based insecticide as well. 'We are now satisfied that the premises is safe.' It is believed that the spiders had come into the country from a delivery of imported machinery goods from Texas. All products are fumigated before being exported but it remains a mystery as to how the spiders survived. Mr Parkinson believes that Black Widows can survive up to some weeks after only one large meal so it is not unlikely that they would survive during transit. Black Widow spiders are considered the most venomous spiders in North America. The southern Black Widow has the shiny, black, globular abdomen with the distinctive red hourglass on the underside. 'As far as we know this is the first time Black Widows have been found in the UK though there have been some cases of hoaxes,' Mr Parkinson added. A plan was implemented that included tracking down where antivenom is . located in the UK, which turned out to be just two hospitals, in Liverpool and London. However, no bites had been reported. The local . James Paget hospital was notified and medical advice was given should . anyone receive a bite. Jon Blake (left) and Ian Parkinson (right), the pest control officers who trapped the Black Widow in an airtight container . Jon Blake Director of Abate said: 'It was down to the fast reaction of the company who called us to deal with the problem that brought this issue safely under control. 'Black Widows are very notorious spiders identified by the coloured, hourglass-shaped mark on their abdomens. 'This spider's bite is much feared because its venom is reported to be 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake's. 'In humans bites produce muscle aches, nausea, and a paralysis of the diaphragm that can make breathing difficult. 'However, contrary to popular belief, most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage. 'We have been called out for snakes, scorpions and spiders before but never in the past 24 years for one of these deadly creatures.'The Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge has been notified about the case, however Abate have now frozen the spiders to eliminate any danger.","Believed to be Britain's first infestation of a the deadly Black Widow spider .

The Doubletree by Hilton planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre on Sheep's Green and Coe Fen by the river Cam in Cambridge. But campaigners including the A Brief History of Time author and comedian Griff Rhys Jones argued that the new build would ruin the historic view of Cambridge University, where they both studied. Cambridge City Council planners agreed with the famous alumni, as well as more than 800 petitioners, and rejected the appeal by hotel owners Ability Hotels last month. Campaigners including Professor Stephen Hawking (left) and comedian Griff Rhys Jones (right) argued that the new build . would ruin the historic view of Cambridge University . Planning inspector Simon Berkeley, from Cambridge City Council, said the extension would detract 'from the pleasure to be had by lingering to appreciate the more panoramic views of the historic centre.' He added: 'Protruding substantially into an area otherwise largely comprising green open space, it would stand out and appear intrusive.' Jane Singleton, chairman of the Residents' Association of Old Newnham, said she was 'absolutely delighted' by the ruling. She said: 'The hotel's extension would have blocked the view - effectively drawing a heavy curtain - between Coe Fen and Sheep's Green. 'These two ancient fenlands are an integral part of the fingers of green which penetrate the city. 'They are not parks but are uncultivated areas which bring the country - and the cows - right to the city's centre. Their openness must be preserved.' Cllr Rod Cantrill, who represents Newnham on Cambridge City Council, said: 'This is great news, not just for Newnham but also for the city in general, as Coe Fen and Sheep's Green form a unique green space close to the heart of the city.' Ability Hotels, which owns the Doubletree, applied for planning permission for a similar scheme in 2010 but it was rejected. The Doubletree by Hilton planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre on an area of Sheep's Green and Coe Fen by the river Cam in Cambridge . Planning officers said the expansion would have an adverse impact on nearby conservation areas. The second project was designed to sit further back from the River Cam and be clad in brick and includes tree planting. But the application was refused by Cambridge City Councillors last year and the appeal by Ability Hotels was rejected on March 22. Ability Hotels argued in the appeal that the leisure centre currently on the plot had 'little architectural merit.' It said the extension would 'respond positively to the historic surroundings' and would unlock 'significant economic investment.' But campaigners said the group's plans for the hotel did not include adequate provision for increased traffic. The no campaign described the design as 'fussy and lacking coherence' and said the extension was 'unacceptable by virtue of its height, scale, mass and bulk, the material of its construction and its position on the site'. The Ability Group declined to comment.","Hilton planned to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre .

Modern life and its trappings - financial crisis, war, the threat of terrorism and global warming - leaves many hankering after the good old days. And, according to new research, with good reason. Scientists have discovered that despite an overabundance of polyester flares and bouffant hair, 1978 was the year that the world's quality of life peaked, after which it has gradually deteriorated ever since. Australian experts used a novel method to track the social and economic progress of the world, taking into account various economic, lifestyle-related and ecological factors to come to their conclusion. Happier Times? Australian scientists used a novel method to track the social and economic progress of the world, taking into account various economic, lifestyle-related and ecological factors to come to their conclusion that 1978 was the best year . Until recently the standard method of . measuring progress in a society was by assessing its Gross Domestic . product (GDP) - basically a measure of all the money spent and earned in . a given society. But, as . the new study explained, this has its limits, and can in fact give an . inaccurate perspective on the happiness of the planet. Quality of life: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) uses economic data as well as statistics relating to pollution, housework and car accidents among other factors. The researchers found that GPI peaked in globally in 1978 and has steadily declined since then . 'GDP was never designed to measure social or economic welfare, and yet, today, it is the most commonly used indicator of a country's overall performance,' the study, led by Dr Ida Kuniszewski and Dr Robert Costanza of the University of Canberra's Crawford School of Public Policy, said. It went on to explain that the most major issue with GDP is that it interprets every expense as positive. Experts at the University of Canberra found that while global GDP - a measure of a economic progress - has increased (shown in green) over time, a more complex measure taking quality of life into account, called GPI (pictured in purple), in fact peaked in 1978 and never recovered . So, for example, an oil spill would be interpreted as a boost to GDP because large sums of money would be spent to mount a clean-up operation. They explained that 'the [enjoyable] act of picking vegetables for your own garden and cooking them for family or friends does not fall into GDP. 'Yet buying a similar meal in a frozen food aisle involves spending money and a in turn results in a GDP increase.' Popular culture: In 1978 Rod Stewart enjoyed a number one with single 'Do Ya Think I'm Sexy' and actress Farrah Fawcett (right) was one of the most desirable women in the world . World Cup Glory: Argentina captain Daniel Passarella raises the World Cup Trophy as he is carried shoulder high by fans after Argentina beat Holland 3-1 in the 1978 World Cup Final on home soil . They said that a more accurate measure of how a society is faring would need to take a variety of factors - including economy, the state of the environment, and society -  into account . One alternative measure - and the one they used - is called the Genuine Progress Indicator. (GPI). GPI starts by using the same figures as GDP, but uses 24 other factors including crime rates, pollution levels, loss of wetland, car accident rates and even the amount of people who volunteer and enjoy housework to give a country its rating. The study analysed data collected between 1950 and 2003 and followed 17 countries - equating to half the world's population - to come to their conclusion. They found that on average, where GDP steadily increased without interruption, GDI peaked in 1978 and has tapered off ever since. The 1970s economic crisis, Edward Heath's social policy, unemployment and austerity all contibuted to a sudden dip in the UK's GPI. The country has never reached the high of 1978 since . The U.S.'s trajectory was similar to the global picture, showing that there was a steady decline in GPI from 1978 onwards but that there has been a slight improvement since 2007 . Experts said the results show that social and environmental problems have cancelled out any monetary wealth the world has accrued. 'A lot of people working in the field were pretty sure it happened, but it didn't get detected in GDP,' Jacqueline McGlade of University College London, and former head of the European Environment Agency told the New Scientist. The study explained that the UK drop could be explained by Edward Heath's Tory government coming into power in 1970 and cutting social programmes, which continued throughout the Margaret Thatcher period.

Around 1993, as in the U.S., GPI did start to increase again, although it has never managed to return to the previous levels reached in the Seventies. The U.S.'s trajectory was similar to the global picture, showing that there was a steady decline from 1978 onwards but that there has been a slight pick-up since 2007. Experts said the UK dip could, in part, be put down to Tory prime minister Edward Heath's policies . The only country to break ranks and experience a perpetual rise until the data ends in 2003 is Japan. However not all experts are convinced by the accuracy of GPI, and many do not believe it is the new yardstick by which a society should be measured. Many believe that there can be no single method of measuring how a society is progressing because there are too many complex factors at play. In addition to this, many say it would be foolish to believe that those in developing countries aren't, for the most part, enjoying a better quality of life - in the past 20 years alone world poverty has fallen by 42 per cent. 'If you look at the broader picture of . things that contribute to a quality of life, I think there's no doubt . that the average person in developing countries is better off than in . the 1970s,' Marianne Fay, Chief Economist for the World's Bank's . Sustainable Development Network in Washington DC, told New Scientist. More generally, life expectancy continues to rise and many surveys in fact say that people are increasingly happy with their quality of life. The study concluded that in order to enjoy a 'desirable and sustainable future we need to rapidly shift our policy away from maximising production and consumption (GDP) and towards improving a genuine human well-being (GPI) or similar. 'This is a shift that will require far more attention  to be paid to environmental protection , full employment, social equity, better product quality and durability.' The study was published in Ecological Economics.

Hundreds of American dog breeds including the Chihuahua really come from Asia, according to new genetic analysis . Hundreds of American dog breeds including the Chihuahua really come from Asia, according to new genetic analysis. Swedish researchers believe that the canines hitched a ride from Asia to the Americas with ancient humans. Native American dogs that were once thought to be extinct, have been found to be thriving, according to the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The arrival of Europeans in the Americas has generally been assumed to have led to the extinction of indigenous dog breeds, but a comprehensive genetic study has found that the original population of native American dogs has been almost completely preserved. Generic analysis of hundreds of American . dog breeds including chihuahuas, sled dogs and hairless Peruvian dogs . has revealed that their ancient roots trace back to Asia. Peter Savolainen, a researcher in evolutionary genetics at the institute, said that 30 per cent or less of native American dog breeds DNA comes from Europe, suggesting that they traveled to the Americas with the ancient humans who established pre-Columbian civilisations. 'Our results confirm that American dogs are a remaining part of the indigenous American culture, which underscores the importance of preserving these populations,' he said. Most researchers believe that the first American setters brought dogs with them across the Bering Strait around 10,000 years ago. European colonisers also brought their own dog breeds to the Americas - as well as a cocktail of diseases in the 16th century. To trace the roots of American dog breeds, Dr Savolainen's research group compared mitochondrial DNA from Asian and European dogs, ancient American archaeological samples, and American dog breeds, including Chihuahuas, Peruvian hairless dogs and Arctic sled dogs (pictured) Dr Savolainen said: 'Many populations were wiped out and the culture disappeared with them, so there was nobody to take care of the dogs.' Many scientists consequently thought that most American dog breeds shared most of their DNA with European breeds. To trace the roots of American dog breeds, Dr Savolainen's research group, in cooperation with colleagues in Portugal, compared DNA from Asian and European dogs, ancient American archaeological samples, and American dog breeds, including Chihuahuas, Peruvian hairless dogs and Arctic sled dogs. They collected cheek swabs from 347 kennel club pure breeds from the Americas, including Chihuahuas, Peruvian hairless dog and Alaskan malamutes and then compared their DNA with 1,872 sampled from dogs in Asia and Europe. The research, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that most of the American dogs had ancestry that can be traced to Asia.

Peter Savolainen, a researcher in evolutionary genetics, said that 30 per cent or less of native American dog breeds DNA comes from Europe, suggesting that they traveled to the Americas with the ancient humans who established pre-Columbian civilisations . 'It was especially exciting to find that the Mexican breed, Chihuahua, shared a DNA type uniquely with Mexican pre-Columbian samples,' he said. 'This gives conclusive evidence for the Mexican ancestry of the Chihuahua.' The team also tested 19 stray dogs from the Carolinas and South America. Dr Savolainen believes that the data also suggests that the stray dogs carry genetic markers from Asia, not Europe. 'Most people thought they were just runaway European dogs,' Dr Savolainen told LiveScience. The findings support prior studies which found that Greenland Inuit dogs didn't have much European DNA.","Hundreds of American dog breeds including the Chihuahua originally come from Asia, say Swedish scientists .

A would-be bride who killed her husband-to-be on their wedding day has been sentenced to life in prison, but claims she still loves him. Na Cola Franklin, 32, from Eastern Pennsylvania was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of 36-year-old Billy Brewster, last August. Franklin and her fiancé had been arguing in the early hours on August 11 2012, just hours before the ceremony. Murder: Na Cola Franklin, left was convicted of killing her husband-to-be Billy Brewster, right, after stabbing him twice in the heart during an argument at their home . Brewster was found bleeding from his chest shortly after 2am in the home they shared with three children. Before she was sentenced to a mandatory life term, Franklin said she hadn't meant to kill Brewster. Franklin told the victim's mother, Barbara Obas, in court, 'I love him. I do still love him. I love him more than myself.' Speaking in the courtroom, in a calm, clear voice, Mrs Obas said her hardworking son had lots of plans, from marrying Franklin, to finding a gang-free school for their children, to finding a better job to provide for his new family. 'You killed him because you could ... you took advantage of him. You showed no concern for the father of your son,' Obas said. Behind bars: Na Cola Darcel Franklin, convicted of killing her fiancee the day of her wedding in Whitehall, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . Brewster and Franklin each had sons from prior relationships and a son together. The children were present the night of the stabbing. 'A mother killed dad with the children watching,' Obas said. 'In doing that you also took your own life.' Defense attorney John Waldron has . vowed to appeal. He argues Brewster came home drunk from an impromptu . bachelor party and attacked Franklin. He claimed that Brewster attacked Franklin and then tried to leave with the couple's 9-month-old son. Waldron argued Franklin, 32, grabbed a knife to protect her child. But prosecutors say that the child was not in danger, and claimed that Franklin showed no signs of being assaulted by Brewster. Brewster's cousin Nakia Kali and his . wife Monique - who were staying at the home with his wife for the . wedding - testified that Franklin was the one being violent, and they . never saw Brewster hit her. Landing: After being stabbed twice in the chest, Brewster crawled to the second floor landing outside of the apartment he shared with Franklin and three children .

The nail-biting rescue of a Brooklyn dog trapped on a window ledge ended in triumphant cheers from the gathered crowd below. The whole episode, which was caught on tape, involved a Chow being saved from a second story ledge in Carroll Gardens by an FDNY communications worker. The lucky pooch was successfully caught by emergency worker and safely returned to solid ground. Scroll down for video. A scared dog in Brooklyn was trapped on a second story window ledge before being rescued by an FDNY worker . James Morgan, who captured the tense rescue on his camera was shocked and nervous to see the dog in peril, he told The Daily News. Just passing by the window ledge in his Brooklyn neighborhood, Morgan originally thought the Chow was just sticking its head out the apartment window for some fresh air. 'At first, I see this dog and I’m thinking, ‘Oh, that’s cute, the dog’s getting a little fresh air,’' recalled Morgan. 'Then I noticed he had gotten through the child window barrier and couldn’t get back in,' he told The New York Post. The rescue: A FDNY civilian worker in the area was called into to help bring the dog down from the ledge using his cherry picker . Gaining trust: The rescuer offered the dog a bowl of water, but the Chow looked back at him uninterested . New tactic: After rejecting the water, the FDNY worker offered the Chow dog treats (which he places on the window ledge here) that the pooch happily accepted . Spotting the dog in danger two stories up Morgan and a crowd of concerned locals found a FDNY worker in the area who conveniently was working in his cherry picker. The civilian FDNY member is caught on camera trying to lure the dog into his cart with the help of suggestions from unidentified Samaritans below. A man at the front of the crowd is heard on video giving advice to the  worker, such as 'try to pet him slowly.' Contact: After offering dog treats the FDNY worker finally gained the Chow's trust and pictured here, pets the dog before attempting to grab it . Happy: The Chow appears to smile as the FDNY worker stroked his plush coat before grabbing him from the ledge . Leashing: At the suggestion of a Samaritan below, the emergency worker places the dog on a leash in case he tries to jump during the rescue attempt . He also told the rescue worker to leash the dog in case it tried ti jump off the 6 inch ledge. Later the same man handed the rescue worker a dog bowl filled with water that was supplied by a nearby pet store, The Post reported. However, the Chow seemed uninterested in the water. Going for it: the worker grabs the dog from under neath as the Chow, at first slightly resistant, looses his footing a little on the ledge . Safe: The rescue worker successfully gets the pooch into his cherry picker and begins to lower him back to safety on the ground . It wasn't until he was offered dog treats a few minutes later that the rescuer successfully gained the canine's trust and was able to grab him off the ledge. Though rescuers and passerby's were not sure exactly how the dog got into his precarious situation, it is believed the fluffy pooch managed to wriggle his way out onto the ledge by slipping between a small gap in the child protective railing on the window, The News reported. Landed: The cherry picker with the dog safely in tow touches down on the pavement as the assembled crowd cheers . Morgan told NBC News that watching the situation from below it was, 'pretty nerve-wracking.' 'It looked like his paws slipped a few times, like maybe he thought he could make the jump down,' Morgan told The Post. After a few attempts the FDNY worker was able to grab the dog and lower him down from the ledge to cheers from the assembled crowd.

The Apprentice (BBC1) is over, and should never be allowed back on British screens. On a scale of one to five, it gets no stars. If it were possible to earn a minus rating, it deserves a score of around - 3. That’s not just because of the slack-jawed inanity of the contestants, or the grinding repetition of the same clips and scenes for two dreadful months. Scroll down for video . Tinpot title: Lord Sugar has spent 12 episodes selecting his 'new business partner'. He wasn't hiring an employee this time; he invested £250,000 in a business, in return for 50 per cent equity . It isn’t just because the BBC has been milking the show to the last rancid drop, squeezing six hours of Apprentice programming into the past fortnight, including a whole segment devoted to childhood retrospectives of the candidates. All this, despite insipid ratings — the show launched with just six million viewers, a record low, and has struggled to make any gain on that. These figures should, on their own, be sufficient to condemn The Apprentice as television landfill. Half a century after the Moors Murders, a three-part series, Myra Hindley: The Untold Story, started last night on C5, while ITV was repeating Brady and Hindley: Possession. We can only trust Ian Brady is not given the satisfaction of watching these programmes. Worse still is the cossetting of Alan Sugar’s ego. His tinpot title is echoed dozens of times in every episode — the voiceover, the receptionists, the lackeys, the contestants all chant ‘Yes Lord Sugar’,  ‘Thank you Lord Sugar’. And when the former barrow-boy thinks he can get away with it, he starts Lord Sugaring himself. Recent episodes have seen new ‘business brains’ arriving to swell the chorus of praise. When one candidate commented on her own talents, a shocked lickspittle gasped: ‘Don’t ever compare yourself to Lord Sugar!’ The show’s worst failing is a business one. Alan Sugar has spent 12 episodes selecting his ‘new business partner’. He wasn’t hiring an employee this time; he invested £250,000 in a business, in return for 50 per cent equity. Victorious: Recent episodes of the programme - won this series by Leah Totton - have seen new 'business brains' arriving to swell the chorus of praise to Lord Sugar . Several candidates were promising multi-million-pound growth within five years — such profits are improbable, of course, but the BBC seems to have tossed away any claim to future income streams. Sugar has already been amply rewarded for his investment. There are plenty of narcissists in the corporate world who would mortgage their country cottages, their Mercs and their own mothers to be touted endlessly on primetime telly as ‘a business icon’. Sympathy for the crocodiles: In Ray Mears' Close Encounters, one croc ranger held up a hand to demonstrate what 'interaction' looked like: two fingers had been bitten off. Mears is pictured . For him to have the chance of a 1,000 per cent return or more, through a state TV channel, is utterly wrong. The BBC ought surely to have capped his profits, perhaps a maximum of double his money. Any bank would see that as a fair return. And this flags up the great unasked question of the series: if these candidates have good business plans, why not take them to a conventional investor? By handing over half their companies, and perhaps sacrificing many millions for the arbitrary seed sum of £250,000, they would almost be better off applying for a pay-day loan. It was easier to feel sympathy for the 94-stone salt-water crocodiles on Ray Mears’ Close Encounters (ITV) than for Alan Sugar. The crocs were being hauled out of Darwin harbour on ropes, before duct tape was wound around their jaws and the presenter stood on their heads to subdue them. ‘This is an outstanding example of modern conservation,’ Mears insisted. The captures helped to ‘stop interaction between crocodiles and the public’. One croc ranger held up a hand to demonstrate what ‘interaction’ looked like: two fingers had been bitten off. You can’t always blame the reptiles when tragedies happen. One man was photographed attempting to surf on the back of a croc. Two girls were pictured sunbathing on a wire cage containing a snared, and very disgruntled, ‘saltie’. ‘Alcohol is usually involved in these cases,’ Mears told us, straight-faced. Any boozed up Aussie who survives a croc attack will learn their lesson. But do BBC executives have the same basic common sense not to get bitten again?

Talking satnavs and taking your eyes off the road to peer at a small screen could soon be a thing of the past - after scientists developed a portable device that beams directions onto the inside of a car windscreen. Garmin has created a portable heads-up display (HUD) that sits on a car's dashboard and projects turn-by-turn directions on a transparent film attached to the windscreen. The directions are sent to the HUD over Bluetooth from a smartphone running the Garmin StreetPilot or NAVIGON satellite navigation apps. Satnav firm Garmin has created a portable device, pictured, that sits on a car's dashboard and can project turn-by-turn directions onto the windscreen. The directions are sent to the heads-up display using a smartphone app and projected onto a transparent film attached to the screen . The HUD automatically adjusts the brightness level of the directions based on the light conditions at the time. This makes sure the projections are clearly visible in direct sunlight or at night, pictured . The Garmin HUD can connect to any Bluetooth-enabled device including smartphones and tablets. The driver then plots their route on the phone or tablet using either the Garmin StreetPilot or NAVIGON satellite navigation apps. Turn-by-turn directions are sent wirelessly to the HUD. These directions are then beamed from the projector onto a transparent plastic film stuck to the inside of the windscreen. Alternatively, the directions can be shown on a reflector lens attached directly to the HUD. Garmin's HUD shows turning arrows, . the distance to the next turn, the current driving speed as well as the . estimated time of arrival. It even lets drivers know . what lane to be in, warns of potential traffic delays and shows the location of nearby speed cameras.

If music is being streamed to the car stereo from the smartphone at the same time the HUD will automatically . fade it out for the turn-by-turn voice prompts. The HUD will also continue to display directions if the driver takes a call on a hands-free kit. If drivers don't want to beam the directions onto the plastic film they can instead project them through a reflector lens that connects directly to the HUD. The HUD automatically adjusts the brightness level when using the film, or the lens, to make sure projections can be seen clearly in direct sunlight or at night. 'HUD redefines the navigation experience by allowing drivers to find . their way without taking their eyes off the road,' said Dan Bartel, . Garmin vice president of worldwide sales. Garmin's HUD displays turn arrows, the distance to the next turn, the current speed and speed limits as well as the estimated time of arrival.

Garmin's HUD works with the Garmin StreetPilot app, pictured, as well as the NAVIGON satnav app . 'Head-up displays currently . have their place in select high-end cars, but HUD makes this technology . available as an aftermarket accessory for any vehicle, at an affordable . price.' Garmin's latest device gets its directions from the Garmin StreetPilot and NAVIGON apps that are available on iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 handsets. The Garmin HUD will go on sale in September and cost £139. Commenting on the device, RAC's technical director David Bizley told MailOnline: 'There has been a good deal of interest in this kind of technology and we need to look more closely at how motorists would use it on a day-to-day basis. 'However, it is certainly true that current satnav screens can be a distraction and if poorly positioned can both obscure vision and cause drivers to take their eyes off the road. 'We know that head-up displays are commonly used for military aircraft because they enable the pilot to continue to look ahead without having to divert their gaze down to look at numbers and dials. 'In principle, therefore, a head-up display for satnav is a good idea – provided it is located in a position that allows the driver an unhindered view of the road ahead and operates in a way that does not distract the driver.' A recent study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the U.S. found that hands-free kits - such as Garmin's HUD - can cause an 'extensive risk' to drivers and pedestrians. The findings even suggests they may be no safer than using a phone. The research found that dangerous mental distractions exist even when drivers keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. As mental workload and distractions increase, reaction times get . slower and brain function while driving is compromised. This results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them, including pedestrians. The HUD, pictured, is due to go on sale in September and will cost £139.

For years women have been convinced that porn star style waxing and vajazzles are the quickest way to impress their other halves in bed, with nearly two thirds saying that their look down below is calculated to please their man. But it appears that it's time to wave goodbye to painful waxing for good, after a new survey found that men actually prefer a natural look. According to the poll, which canvassed 1,000 men, the most popular look is is 'trimmed and tidy' – a far cry from the Hollywood, which involves having all hair removed. Au naturel: Contrary to what the majority of women believe, men prefer a natural approach to grooming . Nearly half (43 per cent) of those who took part in the survey, which was commissioned by waxing brand, Nads, said they preferred their women to look as natural as possible but with a 'Bermuda triangle' - trimmed hair and waxed edges leaving no bikini hair overspill. 17 per cent plumped for the Brazilian, a landing strip of pubic hair, while 15 per cent liked the heart shaped 'Heart Breaker'. Just 12 per cent chose the full Hollywood, with most men saying they preferred their women to have some hair 'down there'. The style that men hated the most was the 'G Wax' – a closely trimmed small square of hair that most felt looked a bit silly and a bit of a turn off. Among the men who took part in the poll was Sidcup father of two, Mark Tailworth, who said: 'I’d hate my wife not to have some hair, I much prefer her to be well trimmed than sporting some ridiculous, unsexy design.' Ouch! The bejewelled vajazzle was popularised by Amy Childs, star of The Only Way is Essex . Others, including 27-year-old Daniel Smith from Essex, said that they did enjoy seeing the odd Hollywood or vajazzle on their girlfriends. 'I like it interesting - like unwrapping a present and finding a surprise,' said Daniel.

The Federal Aviation Administration recently conducted a study that finds over-the-counter medications have played a role in 12 percent of all fatal aviation crashes in the last decade - and it's now warning pilots across the country to pay close attention to the medications they're taking while flying. Industry and government leaders today issued a letter to the country's estimated 450,000 general aviation pilots warning them of the dangers associated with flying under the influence of seemingly harmless over-the-counter medications. OTC: Over-the-counter medications played a role in 12 percent of all fatal aviation wrecks in the last 10 years . The letter warns of medications like pain relievers, cough suppressants and sleep medications as having ingredients that could potentially make a pilot drowsy, or even fall asleep while flying. The letter notes that 'pilots might not be aware of the ubiquitous . presence of sedating antihistamines in many over-the-counter treatments . for common allergies, coughs, colds and sleep aids.' Additionally, the letter recommends that pilots wait as long as five times past the dosing intervals before flying.

According to the letter, the grandfather was flying the small plane when it came in short on the runway at an airport in Visalia in 2006. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that one of the causes of the wreck was the build up of a sedating, over-the-counter sleep aid in the man's system. The children who died were only 6 and 3 years old. The study also found that 42 percent of pilots who died in plane crashes between 2004 and 2005 had some sort of drug or medication in their system at the time of their deaths. Additionally, the study found that 6 percent of all pilots in fatal crashes between 2004 and 2008 tested positive for drugs like marijuana or morphine.

Now 'Sip and See' parties are set to be the next American cultural import to take the UK by storm. Designed to show off a new baby to adoring friends and family, the celebration has become increasingly popular over the last 12 months, with event organisers reporting a surge in bookings. The popularity of the new event mirrors the rise of baby showers, which are now so commonplace that 36 per cent of pregnant users of the website BabyCentre say they plan to have one. Drinks with junior: Sip and See parties let friends and family meet your newborn while enjoying a glass of wine . Among those rumoured to have thrown a baby shower is the Duchess of Cambridge, although whether she and Prince William will hold a Sip and See for their eagerly awaited new arrival is yet to be seen. The rise of the Sip and See party is thought to be down to a combination of social media and the influence of American TV, although the parties thrown by a series of high profile mothers have also given the concept a boost. Among them is Barbara Bush, daughter of former president George W. Bush, who hosted a soiree for twin sister Jenna and her newborn niece Mila earlier this month. While many Sip and See parties are nothing more than low key drinks at home, for a growing band of new parents, they're becoming a chance to see and be seen - and are becoming increasingly expensive as a result. The Taylor Lynn Corporation [TLC], a wedding and event organiser, told the Times newspaper that although it had organised just two parties in 2012, it is throwing eight this year - all costing between £3000 and £7000. Family: The parties can be drinks only but get increasingly expensive depending on your choice of theme . Party time: Jenna Bush (left) had a Sip and See but will the Duchess of Cambridge follow suit? According to TLC, clients have included a senior partner in a Manchester law firm who asked for a Wizard of Oz theme for his Sip and See, which was held in a marquee at his home. Terry, who didn't want to reveal his surname, said: 'We have always known about the tradition of wetting the baby's head and just thought we would take it a step further.' Speaking to the Times, his wife Susan added: 'We had life-sized characters and created our own yellow brick road in the marquee. 'We had tables dressed with witches' hats. It cost £8000 but it was worth every penny.' But not everyone who throws Sip and See parties does it for their offspring's benefit. According to Laura Caudery of Parallel Venues, whose family own the Fetcham Park venue in Surrey, some couples use the baby bash to try out ideas that they'll later use for their wedding. 'People can have more fun with it,' she explained.","Sip and See parties are thrown so newborns can meet their families .

Glum times: Chancellor George Osborne has outlined austerity lasting until 2017-18 to wipe out the deficit racked up by Labour, but further savings of £60billion would be required . Britain faces further tax rises and spending cuts totalling nearly £60billion to get the creaking  public finances back under control, the Treasury watchdog warned yesterday. The Office for Budget Responsibility said decades of austerity are required on top of the £153billion measures already planned to return the ballooning national debt to pre-recession levels. ‘It is clear that longer-term spending pressures, if unaddressed, would put finances on an unsustainable path,’ said chairman Robert Chote. Mr Chote added that future governments faced ‘difficult choices’ to tackle the costs ‘of an ageing population and upward pressure on health spending’. George Osborne has outlined austerity lasting until 2017-18 to wipe out the deficit racked up by Labour. His plans were backed yesterday by the board of the International Monetary Fund, who disagreed with recent criticism of the cuts by the organisation’s chief economist. But the OBR said further savings – possibly as much as £57billion – would be required after that to defuse the financial time bomb caused by the ageing population and soaring cost of the NHS. It means the main political parties will go into the 2020 general election with the prospect of years of austerity ahead of them. In its Fiscal Sustainability Report, published annually to examine the long-term outlook for the public finances, the OBR said it expected the national debt to fall from 85 per cent of national income in 2017-18 to 66 per cent in the early 2030s as the economy picks up. But it warned that the national debt will start rising again and reach 99 per cent of gross domestic product by 2063 as longer life expectancies drive up the cost of pensions, health and social care. ‘This would clearly be unsustainable,’ it said in the report. The Office for Budget Responsibility's Robert . Chote warned future governments faced ‘difficult choices’ to tackle the costs ‘of an ageing population and upward pressure on health spending’ Allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into Britain each year would help meet these care costs by boosting employment and tax receipts, the OBR concluded. Carl Emmerson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there will be little space for extra spending even after the current crisis is resolved. ‘Significant giveaways any time soon are looking unlikely,’ he said. Meanwhile, Ed Balls has backtracked on his apology for the Labour government’s economic failure. The shadow chancellor had admitted it was partly Labour’s fault that control of the City was too weak, but he said yesterday it was ‘a load of tosh’ that his party’s lack of financial regulation allowed the global crisis to take hold.","£153bn of planned savings not enough to return to pre-recession debt .

To be launched at London Heathrow Airport in September, it is designed to be more spacious, comfortable, quieter and greener than other planes of its kind. Passengers are also promised a ‘clean, purer and draught-free’ quality of cabin air thanks to a new filtering system which changes the air every three minutes and uses special filters to allow 15 different temperature control zones.

Parents in Alabama are seeking to ban a book on pregnancy and childbirth from a high school because they claim it displays 'pornographic' drawings illustrating how to have sex while pregnant. Teresa Offord, library media specialist at B.B. Comer High in Talladega County, told The Anniston Star that a parent petitioned the county to remove The Complete Book . of Pregnancy and Childbirth by Shelia Kitzinger. Offord said the book was moved to a reference section and only students with . parental permission were allowed to check it out. But a new investigation by the newspaper along with journalism students from the University of Alabama proves that this is only the tip of the iceberg. The team collected challenge forms from the past five years from each of the . state's public school district's to determine how many books were being . banned. Out of 132 districts, nine reported challenges, 77 reported no challenges - and 46 provided no information. But Barbara Jones, director of the American Library Association's Office . of Intellectual Freedom, says that only about 20 percent of all book challenges are typically reported - because librarians and school officials are afraid to lose their jobs. Censorship controversy: Harry Potter books (left), and The Diary of Anne Frank (right) have both been challenged in Alabama . Restricted reading: Children's book And Tango Makes Three topped the American Library Association's banned books list for its storyline featuring two male penguins who raise an egg together . 'Transparency is important for democracy,' Jones told the paper. 'School are no different. We need to know what's going on.' The pregnancy book is only the latest in a long list of books that have been targeted for removal in libaries around the country. Important works of literature such as The . Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank, praised for its insight into the . impact of the Second World War on children, was banned by a Virginia . school over the 'sexual content and homosexual themes' when the . definitive edition was released in 2010. IN 1983, Alabama's State Texbook Committee propsed banning the book because it was 'a real downer'. In 2010, a California school banned the 10th edition of the Merriam-Webster . Dictionary because it included a definition for 'oral sex'. People for the American Way reports that school and public library books . are among the most visible targets and are frequently challenged for . various reasons. The organization claims that between 1990 and 2000, there were 6,364 challenges reported to or . recorded by the Office for Intellectual Freedom, and 71per cent targeted materials in schools or public libraries.",The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth can only be checked out by students with parent permission .

Stalwart: Former Sunday school teacher Josie Hampson denies racially harassing a group of travellers . A pensioner known for her community work will appear in court today charged with racially abusing travellers camping on green belt land. Former Sunday school teacher Josie Hampson, 77, says she will fight to clear her name after a ‘humiliating’ ordeal in which she was fingerprinted and had her DNA taken by police. The case comes after a long-running feud between the community and a family of travellers who want to live near Mrs Hampson’s home in Heath Charnock, near Chorley, Lancs. The former school governor, a . grandmother, is a local legend in her Lancashire hometown, where she has . run a toy shop for six decades and has been recognised for her services . to the area. But she says she is ‘shocked’ and . ‘sickened’ by the accusations and has vowed to fight charges at Preston . magistrates’ court of racially aggravated harassment and using . threatening words or behaviour. She said: ‘I am not a racist, I never have been a racist, and certainly never will be. ‘I am a Christian and the words I have been accused of saying would never have even entered my head.’ She added: ‘I am struggling to cope and I am feeling unwell with the worry. I just can’t imagine how it has come to this.’ The pensioner, who was given a . ‘Chorley Smile Award’ by her local council to recognise her services to . the town, was interviewed by police in April. She said: ‘I’ve had to . give a statement, had my fingerprints taken and my DNA. ‘I refused to have a solicitor . because I told them that I had done nothing wrong, but now I’ve had to . employ a criminal solicitor which is going to cost more than £1,000. Accusation: Patty Linfoot has spent four years camped next . to Mrs Hampson's land. Her family are suing after claiming to have been . called 'dirty gyppos' It’s not going to be easy, but I will have to pluck up the courage to stand trial as I am completely innocent.’ The Linfoot family have been locked in a four-year battle to remain on green belt land near Mrs Hampson’s home.

Robbed: Thomas Van Straubenzee, a friend of Prince Harry, had two mobile phones taken from him when he was mugged in Battersea, South London . A friend of Prince Harry feared for his life after being ambushed by two muggers who claimed they had a knife, a court heard yesterday. Thomas van Straubenzee, one of the prince’s oldest friends, was grabbed by the throat and rugby tackled as he chatted on his mobile. One of the hooded men knelt on the 29-year-old’s throat and placed a hand over his mouth, stifling his screams, it was alleged. Kingston Crown Court heard the pair then rifled through his  pockets before making off with his wallet, £90 in cash and two phones. Mr van Straubenzee, who met Harry at Ludgrove Prep School before attending Eton with him, was not in court yesterday to see his alleged attacker, Winful Taylor. Mr van Straubenzee was left dazed, with grazes to his neck and hands. Two days later, police tracked down Taylor, 27, at a hostel where he was living in Streatham, South London. The court heard that after his arrest, officers found two phones, including Mr van Straubenzee’s Nokia. Taylor, 27, of Stockwell, south London, denies robbing Mr van Straubenzee of two mobile phones, his wallet and its contents on November 30 last year. He claimed he had bought the phone from . ‘a friend’. However, it is claimed his SIM card was used in the Nokia an . hour and 20 minutes after the mugging. Daniel Robinson, prosecuting, told the jury: 'The prosecution case is that Mr Taylor, together with another man whose identity we don’t know, committed a robbery. 'We say that the two of them robbed Mr Van Straubenzee of his mobile phones, two of them, and his wallet containing bank cards and some cash.' Mr Robinson said Mr Van Straubenzee, 29, was robbed just after 7.15pm in Albert Bridge Road, on the west side of Battersea Park, near to the River Thames. 'He was on one of his mobile phones to a friend of his, and a man approached him and grabbed him by the throat. 'A second man almost immediately ran at him and knocked him over, in something like a rugby tackle. 'One of the robbers sat on the lower half of his body, the other robber put his knee on his neck, and his mouth was covered by one of their hands. 'One of them started to go through his pockets, and the robbers told him that they had a knife. 'They took his phone off him, and Mr Van Straubenzee handed over the rest of his property, because he thought he was going to be stabbed. 'They took his two mobile phones - one a Nokia, one a BlackBerry - and his wallet with its contents. 'A passer-by came to his assistance and police were called at 7.18pm.' Mr Van Straubenzee was able to give police the IMEI number of his red Nokia phone, Mr Robinson said. That code identifies the handset and allows it to be tracked through the mobile network. Thomas van Straubenzee was walking past Battersea Park (pictured) on his way home from work when he was set upon by robbers . Police arrested Taylor two days after the robbery at a hostel where he was living in Streatham, south London. He had two mobile phones with him in a bag. One was a Samsung and one was Mr Van Straubenzee's red Nokia, Mr Robinson said. Taylor denied responsibility for the robbery, and said he bought the Nokia for £20 the previous day from a friend. 'He said he had not used the phone to make any calls, but that was a lie,' Mr Robinson said. Police found that the SIM card from . the Samsung phone had been used in the Nokia as soon as 80 minutes after . the robbery, he added. 'The . prosecution say he was caught out in clear lies about the circumstances . in which he came to be in possession of the phone,' the prosecutor . added. 'He was one of the robbers, and that's why he lied about it.' When he was arrested, Taylor told police he had been 'set up' and knew nothing about the robbery. In a police interview, he said: 'I don't know nothing about it.' He added: 'I think I was set up. I bought the phone a couple of hours and then I got arrested a couple of hours after that.' He asked officers: 'I want to know how you linked me to this robbery'. But they refused to tell him. In a statement which Mr Robinson read . to the jury, Mr Van Straubenzee said he finished work in Chelsea that . day and started to walk home. Friends in high places: Mr van Straubenzee, right, pictured with Chelsy Davy, Prince Harry and Prince William at Wembley Stadium in London . 'I was on the phone to a friend of mine and was not paying attention to anybody around me,' he said. One man approached him 'from nowhere', grabbing him by the throat with one hand and the arm holding the phone with the other. 'A second man barged into me, which made me fall to the ground on my back.' He started to shout for help, but they told him they had a knife and to stop shouting. 'I was in fear of being stabbed,' he said. Items he handed over included £90 cash and a red leather diary. A statement was read out from Simon Hempsall, a surveyor, who said that as he was walking in the area he heard 'a muffled scream'. 'I could tell someone was really scared,' he said. He then saw two men running away. 'I crossed the road and saw a male who was what I would describe as dazed and confused. He informed me he had just been mugged and his phone had been stolen.' On trial: Kingston Crown Court, where Winful Taylor stands accused of robbing Mr van Straubenzee in September last year . Mr Hempsall let Mr Van Straubenzee use his phone to tell police what had happened. Stuart Vear, a builder, also made a statement saying how he had seen the robbery outside his flat. 'I heard a shriek outside, it was loud and sounded like a person crying for help.' He looked outside and saw a struggle taking place against a fence. 'Two men then went up the road away from a third male. I quickly lost sight of them because they were running very fast.' Mr Vear and his wife shouted to the man, who said he had just been mugged, then they saw another man cross the road to help him call the police. 'The whole struggle lasted only seconds, including the two men running off,' Mr Vear said. Mr Van Straubenzee, who is also close friends with the Duke of Cambridge, first met Harry at Ludgrove Prep School. The royal brothers are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to Mr Van Straubenzee's brother, Henry, who was killed in a car crash in 2002. The second alleged mugger has never been traced.

Police are investigating whether a husband murdered his wife before killing himself at their quiet suburban home. The bodies of Kenneth McRae, 52, and his wife Jane, 55, were discovered at their home at 11.30am yesterday. Police were called to the couple's £190,000 three-storey semi-detached house in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after Mr McRae's workmates reported him missing. Tragic: A forensics team enter the house where detectives found a couple dead . Neighbours told detectives the couple had not been seen for a week. West Midlands Police used a battering ram to break into the property where they discovered the couple's bodies. Mrs McRae had suffered a blow to the head while her husband was found with neck and wrist injuries. They were both pronounced dead at the scene. Police yesterday launched a murder investigation but said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths. Detective Inspector Derek Packham said: 'We want to reassure the local community that we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this case. Investigation: The couple were described as 'quiet' by neighbours. Local people have been shocked to learn of the news . 'The families of the couple have been informed and we will continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding their deaths.' Neighbours yesterday spoke of their shock over the deaths. Dad-of-three Richard Hodgetts said: 'It is so sad.They were a very quiet couple. Nobody around here knew them and they kept themselves to themselves.' One neighbour who lived opposite the scene said: 'It's just strange really you don't expect it to happen in your area. 'We didn't really know them that well because they were quite reserved. We only knew them to say ""hello"" to.' Mother-of-two Avril Cowdell, 69, said: 'I got back from shopping about 10.45am and the police were all in the street and they asked me if I had seen them in recently. 'I told them about a week ago and I thought they had been on holiday as they like to go away a lot. 'There was a light on in the bedroom which I had thought was a bit odd.'

Concerns: Officers forced entry to the property at about 11:30am yesterday after concerns were raised about the occupants' welfare . Neighbour Chris Thompson, 35, added: 'I don't know what to say, you wouldn't really expect this to happen. 'To find out someone you live really close to, especially a couple which is quite strange - I'm just shocked really.' A woman who lives opposite the couple said: 'The light in the first floor has been on for about a week and two days and at first I thought maybe they've gone on holiday and they've left the light on for security reasons because there is no alarm on the house. 'At the same time I still thought it was strange because he hadn't gone to work because his car is still there. 'Normally the lady is out doing the front garden and I noticed her hanging basket is not there, it is normally there this time of the year without fail. 'They moved in a few months before me in 2008, they were really nice, really quiet, ever so polite, they would say hello, just generally nice.

Now the Dambusters are to be handed a key role piloting our fighter jets of the future. Some feared that the 617 Squadron – named in honour of its daring raid on dams in the Ruhr valley in 1943 – could be scrapped, as the Tornado GR4 jets it operates will be retired in 2019. Chocks away: The 617 'Dambusters' squadron will fly the RAF's new . £100million Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters when they are introduced . in three years . Normally, it would be axed because it is the youngest of the RAF’s five Tornado units. However, Sir Stephen Dalton, Chief of the Air Staff, will today announce that the 617 pilots will transfer to the £100million state-of-the-art Joint Strike Fighter, or Lightning II, when it is introduced in three years. Because of its actions during the Second World War 617 has acquired ‘privileged status’. George ‘Johnny’ Johnson, 91, from Bristol, the last surviving UK Dambuster who was a bomb-aimer over the Sorpe dam, said: ‘This is very welcome news. The squadron is here to stay. ‘It is a chip off the old block, retaining the name, values and traditions of the original squadron. Grounded: 617 squadron's Tornado GR4 jets are due to be retired in 2019 . ‘The record 617 Squadron has maintained since it was established, in Afghanistan and the Gulf, has shown it is the finest in the RAF and thoroughly deserves this honour.’ Author and historian James Holland, who wrote The Dam Busters: The True Story Of The Legendary Raid On The Ruhr, said: ‘617 is the most famous squadron and it is absolutely right it should be preserved. It is a terrific honour that it has been chosen to fly the RAF’s new warplanes. ‘It became the elite squadron during the war, with its precision bombing, use on special operations, the attack on the German battleship Tirpitz and simulating an invasion on D-Day. ‘It is wonderful symmetry that 617 will fly the first of the new aircraft. The pilots are the best of the best.’ The Lightning II will be the UK’s only stealth aircraft. The RAF and Royal Navy will jointly operate a force of 48 fighter jets, which can be flown from land or sea. War effort: One of the Dambusters squadron dropping a bomb in 1943 . Success: The Eder Dam bursting after the raid of 1943 . Formed in 1943, 617 Squadron will transfer from their current base at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland to RAF Marham in Norfolk. The Navy will fly the jet from their new £6.2billion aircraft carriers. The news comes two months after the 70th anniversary of the Dambuster raids, when the squadron carried out its historic assaults on the Mohne, Eder and Sorpe dams. The force had to fly across occupied Europe at night, so low that some were killed by power lines, and drop untried bouncing bombs designed by Barnes Wallis with pinpoint accuracy in full view of the enemy’s guns. The daring blitz - codenamed Operation Chastise - was a successful and dealt a decisive blow that crippled the Nazi war effort. But it was at great cost: eight of the 19 planes and 53 of the 133 men were lost.A Ministry of Defence source said: ‘The Dambusters have a strong heritage and special place in the nation’s history. ‘It’s fitting an RAF squadron that played such a key role in the Second World War will fulfil a leading role in the future of Britain’s airpower with the Lightning II.’","Some feared squadron would be scrapped after its Tornado jets are retired .

The parents of a four-year-old boy who was killed in a notorious unsolved murder nearly 30 years ago are furious after a picture of their son was used in a festival advertisement. The face of French boy Gregory Villemin was splashed across a poster advertising nursery services at the Montreux Jazz Festival, in Switzerland. The little boy was murdered in 1984 after a series of threatening phone calls to the parents. His body was found in the Vologne river near Docelles, in eastern France, close the to family's home, in October 1984. The face of Grégory Villemin, who was murdered in 1984, was used on an advert for nursery services at a Swiss Jazz Festival. His parents are considering suing . A picture of the last page of the 'Montreux Jazz Chronicle' daily newspaper showing the photo of Gregory used to advertise the event's kindergarten . For decades, the ongoing case to solve the murder has seen twists and turns reported in the media. But, according to the organisers of the Swiss festival, a young employee there had no idea the picture taken for the kindergarten advert was that of murdered Gregory Villemin. According to English language news service, The Local, the parents are now considering suing the festival company. Thierry Moser, a lawyer for Gregory's parents Christine and Jean-Marie Villemin, is quoted on TV station France 3 Lorrainen, saying: 'We intend to sue for compensation for the damage that has been caused,' the Local said. The parents have received a letter of apology which 'has made a good impression,' but they are considering legal action nonetheless. Gregory's parents Christine and Jean-Marie Villemin, pictured around the time of the murder, claim the use of a picture of their son on an advert was a 'stunt' Grieving: Despite several leads, from voice recognition and circumstantial evidence, the couple have never found their son's killer. Parents Christine and Jean-Marie Villemin at the funeral of their son on October 16, 1984 . Mathieu Jaton, managing director of the jazz festival, was contacted by Le Huffington Post, the French language online arm of the U.S. news service. The news site said the festival organisers noticed the error too late, and the printed adverts had already been published. The image was pulled down from the online ad, however. Despite the explanation, and the letter of apology, Gregory's parents have reportedly rejected the reason. Mr Moser told The Local the excuse was 'pitiful', 'absolutely inexcusable' and the parents believe it was a 'stunt' arranged by the festival organisers. From 1980-84, parents Christine and Jean-Marie Villemin had been plagued by threatening anonymous phonecalls. Then on October 16 1984 they received a chilling call informing them 'I have taken the boy'. A massive police search discovered Gregory's body seven kilometres from their home, face down in the Volgne river. The next day after, an anonymous letter arrived addressed Jean-Marie, which read: 'I hope you die of grief, boss. Your money can’t give you back your son. Here is my revenge, you stupid bastard.' Voice experts have been unable to identify who made the recorded calls. There have been many DNA tests, on saliva traces on the letter stamp and, later, tests on Gregory's clothes have been inconclusive. Bernard Laroche, Jean-Marie Villemin's cousin, was the main suspect, after his 15-year-old sister-in-law told police there was circumstantial proof he had murdered Grégory. But she later recanted and a judge in 1985 freed Laroche . The same day, a furious Jean-Marie Villemin vowed, in front of journalists, that he would kill his cousin. True to his word, he shot and killed Laroche a month later. In 1993, Villemin was sentenced to five years prison for the killing. Mrs Villemin was also suspected because she was seen in the post office the day of the murder and there was cord identical to that used to tie Gregory found at the home. But in 1985 a judge made a rare ruling forbidding her prosecution. Further DNA tests, even up until last year, have continued to raise hopes of finding the killer. But the case remains unresolved.

A family of fraudsters are facing jail for fleecing scores of elderly investors in a £4.5million fine-wine scam. Daniel Snelling, 38, tricked them into putting thousands into Australian wine billed as ‘the best money could buy’. With his sister Dina Snelling, 35, and their cousin Rebecca McDonald, 42, he promised to sell the wine at huge profits after three years in ‘premium’ storage. Daniel Snelling, pictured left, and his sister Dina, right, persuaded elderly people to buy fine wine in a £4.5million scam - they both face a jail sentence alongside their cousin Rebecca McDonald (pictured below) Their firm Nouveau World Wines raked in £2.5million by offering thousands of bottles of wine, but pulled the plug on the scam before investors could retrieve their cash. Snelling then reinvested their ill-gotten gains in a second scam, Finbow Wines, selling cheap Italian wine at events such as the 2010 World Cup. They took an average of £5,000 from investors, many of them elderly, and convinced some to buy 10,000 bottles a time. Yesterday the Snellings were convicted of two charges of conspiracy to defraud after a two-month trial at Southwark Crown Court. Daniel Snelling was also convicted of two counts of converting criminal property. Rebecca McDonald was also found guilty, on one count of conspiracy to defraud, with her cousins. They face sentence on September 9 . McDonald was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on a second, which has been left on the court file. All three will be sentenced on September 9. But French-speaking Simon Dempsey, 43, walked free after he was cleared by the jury of helping to front the Finbow Wines venture. Daniel Snelling launched the fraud in January 2007 as the sole shareholder and company director of Nouveau World Wines. With sister Dina as office director and McDonald, a former employee of accountancy giant KPMG, working as business development manager, they cold-called victims promising top-end wines as a better investment than stocks and shares. They pretended to have offices in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, when in fact this was just a postal address for their actual base in Greenwich, south-east London. Once potential investors had been snared with promises of 30 per cent profits and low risk, they were sent a glossy brochure pledging the wine would be stored in a premium temperature-controlled facility in Australia. Between January 2007 and August 2009, Snelling’s firm promised to make 39,000 bottles of fine wine, but in fact produced just a quarter of that. ‘When investors asked for their wine to be sold, to realise their investment, they found it was easier said than done’, said prosecutor Julian Christopher. ‘When they made enquiries about their wine, in a great many instances, they couldn’t find any.’ Facing the heat of investors who had put in £2.5million, Dempsey pulled the plug on Nouveau World Wines and ploughed much of profit into a new venture, Finbow Wines. Southwark Crown Court where they appeared - the three pretended to have offices in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, but actually operated from Greenwich, south-east London . This scam involved convincing investors to buy crates of Italian wine, which would be sold at a profit in China at the Chinese New Year and at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. But once again investors never saw a return on the money put into the scam. ‘It was a different enterprise, but unlike Nouveau, it was always going to be a short term project’, said Mr Christopher. ‘With Nouveau, investors could be told the wine shouldn’t be sold, to increase in value, which would mean it would be a long time before they discovered they didn’t actually have any wine to sell. ‘With Finbow, the wine would be sold quite quickly and the defendants had to move quickly. ‘£2million was generated in little over six months, representing something like 50 containers of wine, shipping containers used to transport by sea.’ But just two containers were actually purchased and shipped to China. Just as Snelling and his cohorts were about to pull the plug again and move on to a third wine scam venture, selling Old World wines, police moved in on March 4, 2010.’ Daniel Snelling, of Sutton, south London, denied but was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and two further counts of converting criminal property. Dina Snelling, of Chislehurst, south-east London, was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud. McDonald, of Bexleyheath, south-east London, was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud. The jury failed to reach a verdict on a second conspiracy charge, which has been left on the court file. McDonald will face sentence, together with Daniel and Dina Snelling, on September 9. Dempsey, of Sidcup, south-east London, denied conspiracy to defraud and converting criminal property, and was cleared.","They took an average of £5,000 from investors, many of them elderly .

A woman allegedly subjected to a campaign of harassment by police after she split from her PC lover claimed yesterday that he threatened to ‘make her life hell’ when she filed a report against him. Katie Bowman, who says her life was made a misery by Thames Valley Police officers, spoke out as the force finally admitted to disciplining ‘a number of officers’ following complaints by her. Thames Valley Police refused to reveal how many officers were involved or comment on the nature of the disciplinary action. Counter claim: PC Alexander Ash at his wedding in May . Miss Bowman, 24, a forensic science graduate, claims PC Alexander Ash instigated a relationship with her after texting her, having taken her number from a police report she filed about vandalism to her car. She says that when she split from him after discovering he had a girlfriend, and reported him for obtaining her number from a statement, the alleged harassment by his colleagues began. Miss Bowman said officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, stopped her more than 70 times for suspected offences including drink-driving and assault. Complaint: Katie Bowman claims her life was made a misery . Despite never being convicted, Miss Bowman claims the officers filed a wealth of intelligence reports on her which have cost her three jobs after CRB checks. PC Ash, of High Wycombe, who denies ever being in a relationship with Miss Bowman, claims it was she who pursued him and that disciplinary action taken against him related to drunken behaviour on a night out. Miss Bowman claims the pair met in 2007 when she was 18 and lived in Marlow, and had gone into High Wycombe police station to report damage to her car. ‘Later that night he took my number off the statement paper and texted me his personal number and invited me out for a ride along with him,’ she said in a radio interview. ‘We started texting and it went from there really and we became together.’ She said that after ending the relationship she made a complaint to the professional standards department about how he first made contact with her. ‘He pulled me over one day and said, “I can make your life hell for doing this”,’ she claimed. After this Miss Bowman, of Bedfordshire, who is now engaged and is pregnant with her first child, said she was breathalysed 70 times over two years – each with a negative result. Of suggestions that she was a ‘teenage tearaway’ as portrayed in the police reports, Miss Bowman claimed: ‘A tearaway is someone who goes off the rails. I didn’t go off the rails. I made the mistake of going out with this copper.’ PC Ash, 31, who married recently, said the complaint from Miss Bowman only came after he refused to date her. Miss Bowman, 24, alleges she was targeted over . 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, . Buckinghamshire, after splitting from PC Alexander Ash (file picture) He claimed: ‘It is all rubbish. I . never had a relationship with her and was with someone else at the time. She contacted me first and would follow me and other officers around. ‘She was known in the area as bit of a troublemaker who had an obsession with the police.’ Miss Bowman has won the support of local MP Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, who has written to Chief Constable Sara Thornton branding the intelligence reports on her as ‘utterly trivial’. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: ‘Ms Bowman has made a number of complaints to Thames Valley Police, some of which were unsubstantiated and some resulted in disciplinary proceedings against officers. ‘In one case Ms Bowman made a complaint against a number of officers which she subsequently withdrew. Despite the fact she withdrew her complaint, Thames Valley Police continued with disciplinary proceedings against the officers. ‘The complaints made specifically about harassment were unsubstantiated. The papers were subsequently reviewed by the IPCC which agreed with the conclusion.’","Katie Bowman said officers stopped her more than 70 times .

The CQC's new chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, admitted today the previous CQC inspections had been flawed. He said: 'We wouldn't be changing it if it wasn't.' Patients, ex-doctors and carers are to be recruited to join a 'small army' of hospital inspectors to root-out poor care. They . will form 15-strong squads with doctors and nurses which will carry out . thorough investigations of all NHS trusts over the next two years. Professor Sir Mike Richards, the new chief inspector of hospitals, said the system of checking the quality of care in the NHS was 'flawed'. He urged members of the public to sign up for paid roles carrying out two or inspections a year. He told BBC Breakfast: 'We have a limited number of people so far that we can build upon, we’re wanting to build up this small army, as I’ve described it. 'So we are very keen to have practising clinicians but alongside them perhaps some recently-retired ones, and also patients and carers who want to put themselves forward for this important business.' The . Care Quality Commission yesterday unveiled plans of a major . overhaul of the way it inspects hospitals following concerns that . substandard care was being missed. Each of the 161 acute hospital trusts will be rated as 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate', he said. If they are deemed to be inadequate they could be put into 'special measures' - as seen earlier this week with 11 hospital trusts with teams of outside experts sent-in to make urgent improvements. It followed a major investigation of hospitals with high death rates which uncovered widespread failings including desperate shortages of nurses and doctors, a lack of compassion and poor hygiene standards. But it has since emerged that nine of these 11 failing trusts had previously been passed as safe by the CQC. Only two - Basildon and Thurrock, in Essex and Buckinghamshire Health Trust - had been given warning notices and told to they needed to make improvements. Sir Mike, who will lead inspections under the new CQC regime, said: ‘We acknowledge the system was flawed and we wouldn’t be changing it if it wasn’t.’ The former Government cancer tsar who worked on improving diagnosis rates and treatment added: ‘There is too much variation in the quality of care patients receive - poor hospitals need to up their game and learn from the best. ‘I will not tolerate poor or mediocre care.’ The watchdog has been repeatedly criticised for missing poor care and last month it emerged that it had passed the maternity unit at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria as safe even though babies and mothers had died unnecessarily. And last month the chair of the CQC David Prior admitted that until recently policemen and firemen were being sent in to inspect hospitals rather than doctors and nurses. From August, teams of five to six doctors, five to six nurses and five to six patients and relatives will be sent to inspect all 170 NHS trusts in England. They will spend at least two days monitoring care and speaking to staff and relatives and will also carry out an unannounced inspection at nights and weekends. One of the wards at Nottingham University Hospital. And one of six trusts where the watchdog expects to find poor care . Each trust will be given one of four ratings - outstanding, good, requires improvement, or poor - similar to the system used by Ofsted when grading schools. Hospitals rated as poor will be put into special measures unless the CQC is confident its bosses are capable of making the urgent improvements themselves. The CQC has lined up the first wave of 18 trusts which will be inspected between August and December - and they will enable the watchdog to test its new system. They include six trusts where the watchdog expects to find poor care - based on previous inspections and complaints -which include Barking, Havering and Redbridge in Essex, Barts Health in East London, Croydon in Surrey, Nottingham University Hospitals, South London Healthcare and the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch hospitals. Another six are deemed to be of medium standard, while six are expected to be providing a high quality care. Patients and relatives wanting to join the inspection teams will undergo a series of interviews and criminal records checks. They will be paid for each inspection - although the amount has not yet been decided - and will be reimbursed for any travel costs. But they will only be allowed to inspect hospitals more than 50 miles from where they live to ensure their opinion of the hospital is impartial and not tainted by their own previous experiences.","Squads with doctors and nurses to probe care at all NHS trusts .

"By . Jill Foster . PUBLISHED: . 15:52 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:52 EST, 10 April 2013 . Last autumn, six weeks after my twin daughters Charlotte and Martha were born, I telephoned my mum for a chat. Ever since my husband Robin and I had brought our daughters home — they were born seven weeks prematurely — I’d been breastfeeding every three hours, day and night. I was desperate for sleep. ‘Don’t you think it’s time you tried them on a little formula?’ Mum suggested. ‘It will free you up to get more sleep and Robin will be able to help more’. My throat tightened as I admitted that she was right, and after I’d hung up the phone I burst into tears. Putting my babies on formula meant — in my tired eyes, at least — that I’d failed as a mum. Pressure to breastfeed: Mothers who bottle feed their babies have been labelled 'lazy', 'selfish' and even 'stupid' Reluctantly, I sloped off to the supermarket and carefully studied the labels on every brand of formula milk. As I read the sides of the packets, the overriding sense of guilt heightened. The most popular infant formulas have more than 40 ingredients and you’d need a biochemistry degree to understand them all. Demineralised whey, galacto-oligosaccharides, potassium chloride, choline chloride, taurine, emulsifier, fish oil, cytidine 5. What on earth was I giving my babies? I remember trying not to catch the checkout woman’s eyes. At home, I scooped out the powder and watched it dissolve in the hot water. Later, as I fed it to them from tiny bottles, I imagined what damage it was doing to their little premature insides and wept. Today, eight months on, I realise just how ridiculous I was being. Lack of sleep and perhaps mild postnatal depression meant I completely overreacted. My girls are healthy, thriving and are now, like thousands of other babies, fed exclusively on powdered milk. But I feel for any other new mums wrestling with similar guilt-ridden anxieties this week. Rationing: Supermarkets are trying to prevent the bulk buying of formula milk so it can't be sent on to the Far East for a profit . As news emerges that supermarkets are rationing popular brands to prevent formula being bought in bulk and shipped to China, where it can fetch three times the price, the ‘breastapo’ are out in force, berating the formula-feeding pariahs who feed our babies this manufactured ‘poison’. We have been labelled ‘lazy’, ‘selfish’ and even ‘stupid’. After all, let’s face it, fellow formula mums, we have probably brought this crisis on ourselves. The competitive mum in me was slightly irked that I didn’t manage to reach the full six months with breast milk . The restrictions — requested by the manufacturers Danone, who make Cow & Gate and Aptamil – come after students and businessmen were found to be bulk-buying the tins and sending them to China, where contamination scares mean that parents trust Western brands more than their own. Shops now insist that parents buy a maximum of two tins of formula per day, per shop. Security guards have even been hired in some shops to ensure that worried parents don’t return to the same store twice in a day. I’ve been aware of this since last month, after a rather worrying episode when we were snowed in at my parents-in-laws’ country cottage for six days. There’s no other feeling like the gnawing, primeval fear that you might not be able to feed your babies — a fear many mothers will be experiencing when they arrive at the baby aisle in the supermarket to find the shelves empty. Once again, I felt guilty for having stopped breastfeeding in the first place, and in a panic I despatched my husband on foot to buy at least four boxes. My girls get through a box every two days, so we always bulk-buy. He returned hours later with only two packets, informing me of the new ‘rule’. This is indeed worrying news for formula-feeding mums, and especially mums of multiples who get through several tins a week. After all, if our own milk has dried up, we can’t simply buy a carton of semi-skimmed and give that to our children. Babies under one can’t tolerate cow’s milk. As I read yesterday’s headlines, I pictured armies of mums looting branches of Boots. At nearly £10 a box for some brands, formula feeding is not cheap. But on eBay, boxes of Aptamil, Cow and Gate and SMA are going for more than double their shelf price. There is a telling line at the bottom of each listing — ‘Will Ship Worldwide’. Yet while such profiteering is to be condemned, the comments the crisis has elicited on some online forums make me even angrier. ‘If you want your kid to have second-rate milk, that is up to you in my opinion,’ says one. From another: ‘Has anyone tasted baby formula? I wouldn’t give it to my cat.’ Breast is best: But not all mothers are able to breastfeed and don't need a guilt trip . Well thank you, ladies. I feel so much better about my decision now. My girls were born seven weeks prematurely and spent their first 17 days in a special care baby unit. Determined to do all I could to help them survive, I knew breastfeeding was my only option. I could reel off the benefits by heart — it halved their chances of asthma, reduced the risk of cot death, would help raise their IQ. The list went on and on. At the hospital, it was heartbreaking as I was separated from my babies for 24 hours while they lay in incubators and I recovered from my C-section in the maternity unit. But if I couldn’t be with them, at least I could ensure that they had my colostrum (the ‘high-octane’ milk packed full of antibodies to protect newborns) which I painstakingly expressed over the course of several hours to send up to them. After that, although I couldn’t put them to my breast, I could at least express milk. When that ran out temporarily, they drank breast milk donated by other mothers. When I brought Charlotte and Martha home, there was no question that I would breastfeed them both, ideally for the first six months. But it was not to be. My milk production could not keep up with their demands and because they were premature, the feeding regime of every three hours meant I was utterly exhausted. Something had to give. Follow the rules . In the UK, infant formula advertising has been illegal since 1995, but advertising for 'follow-on formula' is legal . We started combined feeding of breast and bottle. At first I gave them one bottle of formula a day and gradually this grew to two, to three and four, until today when they are entirely on bottled milk. The competitive mum in me was slightly irked that I didn’t manage to reach the full six months with breast milk. Instead, I ‘only’ got to five months, three weeks. I know I should heed the advice of my fantastic health visitor, who told me encouragingly: ‘Give yourself a huge pat on the back. You’ve done brilliantly.’ But the feeling that I’m not feeding my children the ‘natural’ way has never left me. And I’m not alone. My colleague and fellow formula mum, Kitty Dimbleby, recently wrote about the pressure she felt from the breastfeeding Nazis even before her daughter, Chloe, was born last year. She attended a National Childbirth Trust class and dared to ask if there was any information for mothers about bottle-feeding, as a few friends had had problems. ‘The lovely woman in charge of the group looked embarrassed and explained that the organisation takes the same stance as the NHS, which has decreed that all its employees take a vow of silence on the issue,’ she wrote. ‘Then and since, even when it was clear for medical reasons that I would have to bottle-feed, no one would advise me.’ I am no big fan of formula milk companies, whose aggressive marketing in the Third World is well documented. But the ‘breastapo’ have no right to make mothers like me feel inferior. Besides, new studies suggest that breast milk may not be quite as superior as we’ve been led to believe. Women who breastfeed tend to be wealthier than women who don’t, so the benefit to their children may come from other factors. For instance, women who breastfeed are less likely to smoke — so no wonder their babies suffer less from asthma. Today, as I begin weaning my girls onto solids, I know their days of bottle milk will soon be over. But to discover that the greed of a few selfish eBay ‘entrepreneurs’ could put the lives of babies at risk is sickening. And it’s certainly not the time for those on the breastfeeding bandwagon to make me feel as if I’ve let my babies down.","Jill Foster wanted to breastfeed but couldn't keep up with demands from premature twins .

'I was shocked at how quick it all was - it was all very surreal. Vicky and Helen have been friends for years and we've been through so much together. 'First they were my bridesmaids and then they were my midwives.' The baby shower was taking place at Anna and Aly's home in Hedon on Saturday afternoon. The couple have been married two years. Emma, 37, who gave birth to her son Max five months ago, used some of her own labour experience to help out. Emma said: 'I only went round for a cupcake, but I got a lot more than I bargained for. 'I'd recently had Max so I was just telling Anna all the things I remembered from my labour.' Anna had started to feel pains in her stomach, but shrugged it off as her baby was not due until July 27. Happy parents: Husband Aly (L) teamed up with her friends to organise her special day to welcome the baby at their home but didn't expect little Martha to make an appearance . But when she had disappeared upstairs for a long time, her friends went to check everything was alright. Anna had first complained of stomach aches at about 2.30pm. Then at about 3.30pm, when her friends went upstairs, she was having contractions every six minutes. Her friends rang the hospital, who told them to come in when the contractions were three minutes apart. Everyone thought there was ample time to go, as first labours have been known to stretch to more than a day. Vicky, 33, who works as a media sales advisor, said: 'We soon realised the baby was coming and got her from the bathroom and onto the bed. 'Then Martha was born at 4.10pm. Surprise: Aly and Anna had decided not to find out what sex their baby was, as they wanted it to be a surprise, which it certainly was . 'We'd called 999 but the baby was born before the first responder arrived. It was all so quick.' Nervous baby shower guests were waiting downstairs in the lounge, hoping for the ambulance to show up.

"By . Paul Thompson . PUBLISHED: . 19:49 EST, 16 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:19 EST, 16 July 2013 . An eight year old boy suffered a fractured skull after being struck by a leaping sturgeon fish. Nathaniel Smith was knocked unconscious after the fish suddenly jumped from the water and slammed into his head. He was airlifted to hospital in serious condition with a double fracture of the skull following the terrifying encounter with the four foot long fish in Florida. Freak accident: Nathaniel Smith is pictured in the neck brace he must now wear as he recovers from a fractured skull he got from an airborne sturgeon that leapt over his family's boat . The youngster is now recovering at home but has to wear a neck brace until further medical tests are carried out. Two other children, his nephew Austin, 14, and 16-year-old daughter were also struck. ‘It happened so quick, and it was a big fish,’ said Nathaniel’s  father Scott. ‘When I saw it come over the boat it was too late. But I yelled, ""Watch out!""' Massive: While on the Choctawhatchee River near Vernon, Florida, a 4-foot sturgeon like this one jumped into the air and struck Smith, leaving his bleeding from the nose and ears . He said the fish leapt from the river and struck the children while he was preparing to dock the family’s 16-foot boat on the Choctawhatchee River near Vernon, Florida, last month. Scott said his son was bleeding from his ears and mouth after being struck. ‘It was the scariest moment of my life,’ he said. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Sturgeon in the Gulf area can grow up to 200 pounds and 8 feet in length. Scott Smith said the sturgeon that struck his son was at least 4 feet in length and may have weighed 100 pounds. In the spring, sturgeon migrate from saltwater to freshwater, where they live through the summer. During that time, rivers in the Florida Panhandle are highly populated by the fish, said FWC spokesman Stan Kirkland. Mystery: Florida rivers like the Choctawhatchee (pictured) are the summer home to sturgeon that can reach 200 pounds and leap six feet in the air, though scientists don't know why the fish do it . Nathaniel Smith is the second person to be injured by an airborne sturgeon on the Choctawhatchee River in the last 11 years, according to FWC. Brian Clemens, of Chipley, suffered a collapsed lung, broken sternum, several broken ribs, and damage to internal organs when he was struck in the chest by an airborne sturgeon in 2002. He had been fishing on the Choctawhatchee River. Scientists are unsure why sturgeon leap from the water, but U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish biologist Adam Kaeser said it could be a way for the fish to communicate with each other. ‘Another idea,’ Kaeser said, ‘is that they’re actually jumping to keep balance in their swim bladder, which is the organ that helps to maintain buoyancy underwater. But the short answer is we just don’t know why they jump.’ Kaeser said sturgeon can leap as high as six feet above the water. And though it’s rare that sturgeon strike people, Kirkland urges boaters on the Choctawhatchee to slow down and be observant. He also said FWC will be installing signs this week at Choctawhatchee River boat ramps to warn boaters of the sturgeon’s summer presence.","Sturgeon on the Choctawhatchee River in Florida can reach 200 pounds and leap 6 feet in the air .

The Dalai Lama has reached out to monks in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, imploring them to end recent violence towards Muslims in their countries . The Buddhist spiritual leader blamed those of his own religion for recent violent attacks in south Asia, while giving a speech at the University of Maryland. Hundreds have died and more than 135,000 people have fled their homes in Myanmar, also known as Burma, in the past year's brutal assaults. Peaceful words: In his speech at the University of Maryland, the Dalai Lama implored Buddhist monks to stop the violent and deadly anti-Muslim violence in Sri Lanka and Myanmar . In Sri Lanka, Buddhist groups have recently attacked Muslim businesses. In his speech on Tuesday, the Dalai Lama condemned all killings in the name of religion and admitted that not even Buddhists were exempt from carrying out religious attacks. ‘Killing people in the name of religion is really very sad, unthinkable, very sad,’ the Nobel Peace laureate said. ‘Nowadays even Buddhists are involved, in Burma and Sri Lanka. Buddhist monks destroying Muslim mosques or Muslim families - it's really very sad.’ Dalai Lama begged Buddhists in Sri Lanka and Myanmar to look to their own religion to end the recent escalating violence against Muslims. Cultural exchange: Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, left, rubs noses with the Dalai Lama , before he gave his speech at the University of Maryland last night . 'When they develop some sort of negative emotions toward the Muslim community, then please think of the face of Buddha.’ 'If the Buddha is there, he will protect the Muslims, he said in the speech in front of 15,000 gathered at the University of Maryland. However, his calming words may be in vain as Buddhists in Myanmar and Sri Lanka are predominantly Theravada Buddhists, which is separate from the Dalai Lama's Tibetan school, which means they do not answer to his authority. Religious violence in Myanmar flared up a year ago when mobs of Buddhists armed with machetes razed thousands of Muslim homes in the  western Rakhine state, leaving hundreds dead and forcing 125,000 people to flee. That violence has since spread into a campaign against the country's Muslim community in other regions. In March, at least 43 people were killed and 12,000 displaced in the central city of Meikhtila when Buddhist mobs rampaged through the town and police stood idly by. Most of the victims were Muslim. Last week, one person was killed and nine others injured when Buddhists stormed a township 50 miles north of the main city Yangon, ransacking mosques and burning villages to the ground. Sri Lanka, where 70 per cent identify themselves as Buddhists, compared to 9.7 per cent Muslim, is seeing a rise in attacks on Muslim-owned businesses and hate speeches in public places. Groups led by Buddhist monks accuse the small Muslim minority of dominating business on the island nation and secretly sterilising Buddhists.","Religious leader asks monks to intervene in anti-Islam violence .

A Florida woman has been charged with abuse after her disabled husband was found covered in maggots with wounds that were bone deep. Paramedics found Sharon Tillman's husband Greg living in his own excrement with severe body sores covering his body. He weighed just 90lbs and had open wounds that were so severe that parts of his bone were exposed. Charged with abuse: Sharon Tillman (pictured left) has been arrested for letting disabled husband, Greg Tillman (right), rot in bed while covered in maggots . Investigators said he became bedridden in January after suffering a bad reaction to a spider bite. Sharon, 48, failed to seek any medical attention and instead allegedly allowed him to rot away in his bed with flesh eating maggots attacking his body. One investigators stated that one of his leg wounds had been open down to the bone for so long that 'the bone was dry and skin was not growing over it.' Tillman was found at the home he shared in Pinellas Park, Florida, with his wife. Photos on the couple's Facebook page show the couple smiling and happy together. But investigators who visited the home said Tillman had been left in increasingly dire conditions after becoming ill. Arrested: Sharon Tillman pictured in her mugshot (left) for not seeking medical attention for her husband Greg (right) Family album: Sharon and Greg are pictured embracing on their Facebook page before her arrest . Police who visited the home said in an arrest report they were met by an overpowering stench of urine. Outside the home were piles of trash, urine collection bags and soiled gauze. There were also milk bottles filled with liquid. Conditions inside the home were no better with trash spread across all the rooms. 'We found medical injuries not from physical abuse, but from a lack of medical attention, and lack of care-giving by the victim's wife,' said Pinellas Park Police public information officer Brian Unmasieg. Neighbors told WTSP TV that they often wondered why they never saw Mr Tillman. 'I used to see him outside cutting his grass, and then nothing,' said neighbor Anthony Leverso. 'Sharron was always nice, so I never thought anything of it. I thought maybe they split up, or he moved away.' 'She used to come over and ask for things like butter or eggs or money. We always tried to help out because we knew they had fallen on hard times, but I never knew anything like that was going on across the street from my house,' said neighbor Tommy DiTommaso. Tillman was charged with abuse/neglect of a disabled person and is being held in Pinellas County jail. Authorities said her husband is expected to make a full recovery.","Greg Tillman was found living in his own excrement with sever body sores down to the bone .

Kieron who has a sister Billie-Jo, . nine, began to paint landscapes at the age of five on a family holiday . in Devon and Cornwall in 2008. His previous artistic talents were limited to colouring in dinosaurs which his parents had drawn for him. Mr Williamson, who plans to work in his son’s gallery when it opens in September, said: 'He is just a normal boy who loves football. Apart from being a great artist, he is also very strong for his age and athletic.' Most of his paintings are of landscapes around Norfolk where he has lived all his life and Cornwall which is his favourite holiday spot. 'Just a normal boy': In his spare time, and when he's not painting, Kieron loves to play football and other sports . Natural talent: Before picking up a paintbrush at the age of five, the only artwork Kieron had done was colouring in pictures of dinosaurs . Fan base: Kieron has fans all around the world with buyers of his artwork coming from as far afield as America, Canada and Japan . His latest buyers have come from across the UK and Europe and as far away as the United States, Japan and Canada. All the paintings which were sold last week will be exhibited at the Picturecraft gallery, along with the others which will be up for sale. Kieron’s earnings are all being channelled through his own company Kieron Williamson Limited which has his parents as directors . Mr Williamson said: 'This exhibition should take his earnings from when he started to close to £1.5million. 'He pays VAT like any other business and he has just had a massive tax bill. The house at Ludham is his and he wants to live there on his own one day. 'He is not really motivated by the money side of things. He just wants to do paintings that people will like.' Kieron will be leaving Ludham Primary School this week and will be home-tutored from next year so he can concentrate on painting. Career: Kieron Williamson finishes primary school this week and will be home-taught in future so he can dedicate more time to his painting . Striking sunset: The majority of Kieron's oil paintings and watercolours are of the surrounding landscapes near his home in Norfolk . Strong endorsement: A senior figure at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters described Kieron as the future of oil painting in the UK . Mr Williamson added: 'We have not got a problem with him being at home because he is so self-motivated. He is a bright lad and we expect to fast-track him his GCSEs when he is 13 or 14.' Adrian Hill, the managing director of the Picturecraft gallery, said: 'Kieron’s paintings continue to be overwhelming and quite incredible. 'I have seen him evolve and there has been a measured improvement in his work over the last year. 'He now seems to have elevated himself to another level. There is more confidence in his brush strokes . 'The recognition from art critics and fine artists is absolutely remarkable. A senior figure from the Royal Institute of Oil Painters who met him described him as the future of oil painting in the UK. 'People just cannot believe that he is producing work like he does and he is still only ten-years-old.' Kieron’s work first came on the market in 2009 when 19 of his paintings were sold for £14,000 in a sealed bid auction. Aspirations: Kieron hopes to display artwork by classic artists such as East Anglia's Edmund Seago and Alfred Munnings in his gallery when it opens . Starting out: Kieron's work first came on the market in 2009 and stunned the art world with 19 of his paintings selling for £14,000 . Versatile: But some of his images are centered around city scenes rather than the countryside . Progressing: Experts say that Kieron's work continues to get better and better . Three months later another 16 of his paintings were up snapped for £17,000 in just 14 minutes in his second exhibition at the Picturecraft gallery. An exhibition of 33 of his oils, watercolours and pastels sold out within half an hour for £150,000 in July 2010 with buyers flying in from Arizona, New York and South Africa. Some fans camped outside the gallery for up to 48 hours to make sure they did not miss out on one of his paintings while others telephoned in bids from Tokyo, Canada and Germany. Kieron made £106,260 in November 2011 when another exhibition of a dozen paintings sold out in just ten minutes and 50 seconds. His earnings rocketed by another £250,000 last July with the sale of 24 paintings. Mrs Williamson has now written a book detailing her son’s astonishing career, called ‘Kieron Williamson Coming to Light - The Remarkable Story of a Child’s Gift to Painting’. Striking: Kieron will likely sit most of his GCSEs early - when he is just 13 or 14-years-old . Goal: Kieron's parents say he only paints when he wants to and is not interested in the money - he just wants to create work people like . Passion: Kieron sometimes paints for months at a time but will then have a break of a few weeks . In demand: Kieron's work has attracted attention from around the world with many fans camping out 48 hours ahead of his artwork going on sale to make sure they don't miss out .","Kieron Williamson, 10, has seen his lifetime earnings soar to nearly £1.5m .

Costly mistake: Lee Neale, 43, faces a £4,000 bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing 'free' games on his iPad . A father has said he may need to sell his car and two motorbikes after his daughter ran up a £4,000 bill playing 'free' games on his iPad. Lee Neale, 43, had his bank account frozen when Lily, 8, bought in-app extras while playing on the tablet using the password she had seen him entering when downloading items. Lily ran up a bill of more than £2,000 in just six days and more than £4,000 over the course of five months topping up rewards and enhancements in 74 transactions. Mr Neale claims the schoolgirl was unaware she was being charged 'real money' for the in-game purchases and asked to Apple to scrap the charge. But Apple has refused and he now faces selling off his car and two prized off-road motorbikes to recoup the money. Mr Neale said: 'Lily is only eight and hasn’t grasped the concept of money. She probably wouldn’t know how much a bag of crisps costs. 'I was very surprised how dismissive Apple were. This was an eight-year-old girl. Basically iTunes have told me categorically that I won’t be getting my money back. 'I am also disappointed that my bank didn’t alert me to what was going on. 'Now my dad is having to lend me money in the short term and I’m in the process of selling my car, my son’s off road motorbike and probably my bike too. 'I just think these in-app purchases are terrible and people need to be aware.' Mr Neale, from Peasedown St John, Somerset, allowed Lily to use his iPad so she could play numerous games including Campus Life, My Horse, Hay Day and Smurf’s Village. Although the games are initially free to download there are numerous in-game extras that can be bought in the form of jewels, coins or upgrades. Hidden extras: Lee Neale let his daughter use his iPad to play games such as My Horse, pictured, but the eight-year-old purchased lots of in-game extras that amounted to thousands of pounds . 'Deceptive': Mr Neale criticised games such as Smurf's Village, pictured, for their in-app purchase systems . Mr Neale, an aerospace designer, said he was only alerted to the huge bill when he was prevented from withdrawing money from his bank. He added that messages alerting him to iTunes purchases were going to his work email account - which he was unable to access as he was on deployment to another company. The father contacted Apple to explain the mistake but was told 'all purchases made on the iTunes Store are final'. He said: 'There are numerous games where Lily had been inadvertently making in-app purchases, but the major culprits were Campus Life, My Horse and Injustice, a super hero game. 'Almost as bad are Hay Day, Gymnastics Events and Smurfs’ Village. She just thought it was all free. 'It was not until I grilled her that she said she had been using a password that she had seen me put in when I had downloaded free games for her. 'She is only eight-years-old. Even when I sat her down and explained that what she was doing had cost dad money, I still don’t think she really understood.' Apple was today unavailable for comment. Angry Birds, pictured, was one of the games featured in a lawsuit in America over children running up huge bills on 'free' games . Customers who accidentally rack up huge bills on iTunes do not have an automatic right to a refund. But Apple announced earlier this year that it will pay out £66million in compensation to parents in the U.S. whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps. Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents' credit cards. Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. A number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children. These 'bait apps' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game. When children purchase 'currency', their parent's iTunes account gets automatically charged. Apple started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 2011. But many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills. A . US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania . who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly . addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million). The . case involves games such as Angry Birds, pictured above, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil . Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads . on tablets such as Apple's iPad. But the company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK and any refunds are currently given on a case-by-case basis. The Restrictions menu in Apple's iOS software lets you control in-app purchases, and can even be used to stop children downloading apps entirely. Parents can set a password for in-app purchases or turn them off altogether. It's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age-restricted content. To prevent in-app purchases in iOS, open 'Settings' then choose 'General' and 'Restrictions'. Then tap 'Enable Restrictions', choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm. Now you can set restrictions from the menu below. In the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off' to stop children's ability to run up bills.","Lee Neale let his daughter Lily, 8, use his iPad to play free games .

A South Florida family woke up Sunday to find a fist-sized chunk had been taken out of the body of their car. They feared they’d been the target of vandals and Nora Ziegler said police only deepened that fear when she called them to her home. But their worries turned to total shock and confusion when the culprit turned out to be a common squirrel. Nuts: A South Florida family thought they were the target of vandals, but discovered a squirrel and not a person had been gnawing away at the body of their SUV . When Ziegler first saw the 6-inch gouge taken straight from the metal above her wheel well, she called the police. ‘They asked me if I had any enemies,’ said the flabbergasted Zeigler told WPTV.

A mother-of-six is demanding an NHS weight loss operation, despite admitting she has spent her life binging on junk food. Sara Agintas, tips the scales at a hefty 33 stone, but insists tax payers should fork out for the £14,000 operation because she’s now too fat to work and can't fit on a plane seat to go on holiday. Mrs Agintas, 43, from Milton Keynes, admits to downing 12 'small' cans of . lager a day when she was pregnant, but complained in Closer magazine, that she put on . weight after each pregnancy because she found it 'too hard to diet' and says . exercise 'hurt.' Wearing a size 36-38, she used to spend up to £200 a week on takeaways, but admitted 'I can’t work because I’m too fat to fit in an office chair and can only stand for two minutes at a time.' Part of the reason Mrs Agintas wants to downsize, is because she wants to go on holiday, but would need two seats on the plane. She is mother to Gemma, 25, Lauren, 21, Thomas, 18, Sam, 13, Hannah, 12, and Zoe, nine. Her husband and six children receive £17,000 a year in benefits. Mrs Agintas first became pregnant aged 17 by her boyfriend of just a few months. She said she was delighted by the pregnancy because she had always looked forward to being a mother, and at 6ft, she was 15st. But it was then that she developed unhealthy cravings for junk food that saw her weight go up and down, throughout the next five pregnancies. Family values: Sarah Agintas, pictured with her husband Halbin, is mother to Gemma, 25, Lauren, 21, Thomas, 18, Sam, 13, Hannah, 12, and Zoe, nine - but says it was her pregnancies which forced her to binge on junk food . 'I ate a jar of pickled onions a day, followed by three cakes and three packets of crisps. For dinner, I’d have two pork chops with veg followed by two Big Mac meals – I ate for two!,' she told Closer. She moved into a one-bed council flat when she split up with her boyfriend a few months after becoming pregnant. Sara Agintas consumes around 5,690 calories a day. This is compared with the recommended daily intake of just 2,000 calories for women. She eats: . Two 4oz pork chops, if grilled rather than fried, amounts to 260 calories. The mother also admitted to eating a whole jar of pickled onions - a 700g jar has 150 calories if it is drained. After giving birth to Gemma, Mrs Agintas weighed 16st and claims she applied for 15 jobs, but gave up looking for work and turned to cheap junk food when she was unsuccessful. Her weight crept up to 20st in 1990, when she was aged 21 and she measured a size 24. Then . she met a new partner and moved into his three- bedroom council house, . quickly falling pregnant with her second child, Lauren. She . gained three stone as her eating habits spiralled out of control, and . in one average day she would down three Pot Noodles – at 400 calories a . go – two sausage rolls and four packets of crisps. When she had her third child, Thomas, two years later, she weighed 28st and would think nothing of having four thickly buttered slices of toast for breakfast. She even fell through the stairs in her house, forcing the council to reinforce the floor. Mrs Agintas . admits doctors insisted that she needed to restrict her food intake and . make a drastic change to her diet, but she found it too difficult. Her children have been raised on a diet of junk food and Mrs Agintas . said: 'They ate what I ate – pasties and crisps. I was lazy – it was . easier to phone for a takeaway than cook. I gave them chips four times a . week,' she told the magazine. In 1993, Mrs Agintas split . with her boyfriend, who left her for another, skinnier woman and was . forced to move the family into another three-bed council house. But her broken heart was mended three years later, when she met her current partner bricklayer Halbin. After a whirlwind six month romance, the couple were married, although Mrs Agintas could not afford a big enough wedding dress, so was forced to wear a size 30 trousers and blouse. It was then she began having takeaways meals five nights a week, totalling an eye-watering £200 for the family. In 1998, she ballooned to 38st after . giving birth to fourth child Sam – in the last few months of the . pregnancy she gorged on a 24-pack of chocolate bars every day. Pregnancy: Mrs Agintas says she developed a craving for junk food when she was pregnant and her children raised on a diet of junk food and said 'I was lazy - it was easier to phone for a takeaway than cook. I gave them chips four times a week' She developed high blood pressure due to . her unhealthy lifestyle, although she did not have any complications . during her pregnancies. Sara Agintas spoke about her weight in Closer magazine . When Sam was a baby, she joined a gym, but admitted she would only do five minutes of exercise and then would then go home to a fish and chip meal afterwards - although she still lost 6st taking her down to 32st. But, in 1999, she piled 2st of the weight back on by the time she had given birth to her fifth child Hannah. At 34st, Mrs Agintas gave birth to her sixth and final child, Zoe in 2003. She admits to drinking up to 12 small cans of Heineken a day- 50 units a week- for the last few months of her pregnancy - but insists it was safe because she had watered it down with ice. Mrs Agintas, who’s now 33st, has tried to encourage her family to eat healthier, but she now suffers from arthritis, diabetes and asthma and believes a gastric bypass is her last and only option. 'I can’t afford a personal trainer or weight-loss surgery – I need help from the taxpayer. I know it’s my fault I’m fat, but my pregnancy cravings meant I couldn’t stop eating,' she told Closer.

Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner have been found guilty of harassment after putting up security cameras around their house . A former House of Lords special adviser is today  facing jail after he was found guilty of using security cameras to spy on the teenage daughter of his next door neighbours during a campaign of harassment. Political aide Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner harassed their neighbours by rigging up cameras to watch their house. Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard Hughes also stared at their daughter Talia Hancock, 18, through her bedroom window. A judge said the conduct of Hughes and his partner Clare Anderson, 55, was 'unacceptable and oppressive'. District Judge Bodfan Jenkins told Hughes and Anderson he was satisfied they were lying in evidence. And he warned the pair that he was considering all options including prison. The offence carries a maximum three month sentence. Hughes had claimed in court that the cameras were part of security advice from the security industry and senior officers from ex-forces. But Judge Jenkins told them: 'You continued pointing the cameras which had nothing to do with security or tackling crime. 'This was a deliberate course of conduct designed to create unpleasantness and to harass and distress. 'I am satisfied you are lying and that the Hancocks are telling the truth.' The judge described Hughes as a 'deeply unimpressive witness'. Hughes and Anderson were found guilty of harassing neighbours Nick and Linda Hancock and daughter Talia. The court heard the harassment began a year after the Hancocks moved next door to Hughes in the upmarket Cardiff suburb of Old St Mellons. College student Talia told Cardiff magistrates court that surveillance cameras were aimed on to their back garden and pointed directly at their drive. Miss Hancock said: 'It was directly angled. It wasn’t pointed on to his property - just ours. 'I’m certain it was pointing directly on to our garden.' And she told how Hughes and his partner constantly stared at her through her bedroom window. Hughes had claimed in court that the cameras were part of security advice from the security industry and senior officers from ex-forces. But Judge Jenkins told them he was satisfied they were lying . Miss Hancock said: 'They would always look up at my window. I was always aware of that from the moment I moved in. 'They would stand there with their hands on their hips staring up at my bedroom until I moved away from my window. 'I thought it was odd behaviour to stand and stare up at somebody. 'My mum would always tell me to ignore them but it got to the point where I felt really intimidated by them. 'Whenever I’m in my bedroom now, my curtains are always drawn.' Pc Christopher Fennessy told the . hearing that police found a number of cameras on Hughes’ property but . there was no evidence that images were being recorded. Hughes admitted owning an extensive . collection of firearms, shotguns and various explosives which were . regularly inspected by police. He admitted he had three cameras attached to both the front and back of his house when the Hancocks moved in next door.

When Rosemary McGinn sat chatting to herself or swayed backwards and forwards, her friends assumed she was just drunk - again. But two years after she began acting strangely, she was diagnosed with a rare tumor on her pancreas that caused her blood sugar to drop, starving her brain and causing the 'drunk' episodes. McGinn, a 54-year-old realtor from Rockland County, New York, was originally diagnosed with hypoglycemia and went everywhere with snacks and juices to keep her blood sugar from dropping. She gained 25 pounds, but she saw that she had little choice. Mystery: Rosemary McGinn, a 54-year-old realtor, acted drunk for nearly two years due to a tumor that was producing too much insulin, causing her blood sugar levels to drop and starving her brain of fuel . 'When my sugar would suddenly crash, it was like I was drunk,' she told Medicine Matters. 'I would become very combative, not knowing what I was saying, and sway . back and forth.' In one episode in Spring 2011, she was sent home from work early because her colleagues thought she was drunk, ABC News reported. Shortly afterwards, she was driving with her husband but could not remember where they lived. She also forgot who the president was, and the year. The next thing she could remember, she was in her kitchen with two paramedics who were feeding her candy to keep her blood sugar up. Discovery: Dr Ronald Tamler, left, found that McGinn, right, had a tumor, even though she had been previously diagnosed with hypoglycemia. But even after this initial diagnosis and treatment, her episodes continued . At this point, she was diagnosed with hypoglycemia and would regularly snack - but still, her blood sugar dropped and she found herself in the middle of her 'drunken' episodes. Rosemary McGinn was diagnosed with insulinoma, a . rare tumor on the pancreas which is made up of islets - cells which produce insulin. The body produces insulin in the presence of high blood sugar levels to reduce them. When sugar levels drop, the pancreas stops making insulin until the body has regulated the levels. But in McGinn's case, the tumor meant she continued to make insulin even when her blood sugar level dropped too low. It meant that her blood stream was fast losing sugar needed for fuel for red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Without this fuel reaching the brain, it became starved and she started to become incoherent. 'I'd be having 3,000 different . conversations with myself. It was scary,' McGinn told ABC News. 'I thought . there's no way in hell I could live like this.' Eventually having enough, she went to Mount Sinai Diabetes Center, where Dr Ronald Tamler found her blood sugar levels were dangerously low. 'A normal blood sugar is around 100 mg/dl, and most people start feeling poorly when their sugar dips below 70,' he said. 'But Rosemary had a sugar of 20. 'Some sugar needs to stay in the . blood stream. It acts as fuel for red blood cells. if the . brain doesn't get enough sugar you're in real trouble.' He said that her levels were so low she was susceptible to seizures and slipping into a coma. She was diagnosed with insulinoma, a rare tumor on the pancreas that continues to make insulin even when the blood sugar level drops too low. The pancreas usually stops making insulin until the body has regulated its sugar levels. She was immediately referred to specialists at the Mount Sinai Medical Center and underwent an ultrasound so doctors could find the tumor, which was one centimeter in diameter. Savior: The tumor was removed at Mount Sinai Medical Center in January and she has now recovered . The tumor was safely removed in surgery and during the procedure, McGinn had to be kept on a sugar IV drip to prevent her from having one of her episodes. McGinn needed to stay in hospital for three days after the surgery, which was held in January, but has since returned home and is enjoying being free of her 'drunk' episodes. She is now starting to lose the weight she piled on with all of her emergency sugary snacks. 'For almost two years, I wasn't living,' she said. 'They basically saved my life.'","Rosemary McGinn, 54, would chat to herself, suffer memory loss and sway when her blood sugar levels dropped dangerously low .

But it's fair to say this fascinating modern design of a hotel bar, using sections of giant concrete drainage pipes, has a touch of glamour and even allure about it. Techne Architects have transformed this once fairly ordinary bar into a work of art by creating an innovative extension made almost entirely from 17 concrete water pipes that now dominate the striking street facade. Work of art: This imaginative facelift of a bar in Melbourne, Australia, using concrete drainage pipes is undoubtedly intriguing . Style: Techne Architects has kitted out many of the giant pipes with leather-clad seating and wood-paneled interior, transforming the draining pipes into stylish drinking booths . Improvement: The grand, statement extension has increased the drinking area of the Prahran Hotel in Melbourne from 130m2 to 300m2 over three levels . The clever rethinking of the space has effectively turned the 130m2 back area of The Prahran Hotel in Melbourne into 300m2 over three levels . For architect Justin Northrop, the pipes add a lot more than drama to the hotel's exterior, adding an element of challenge for pie-eyed clientele. 'Inside you are climbing over the pipes, sitting in them, or on them at various levels. They have a lasting impact on the space. 'We were looking for a sense of drama and theatricality.' The inescapable concrete pipes play an integral role in the design of the building, inside and out . Drama: The aim, said the architects, was create a space with a sense of drama and theatre . Where the enormous pipes aren't seating the bar's clientele, they are used as vast plant pots, among other things . Booths can be seen from the street, and throughout the interior of the hotel. Each booth, that seats up to 12, features leather upholstered banquettes and is lined with recycled spotted gum slats and acoustic absorption mats. At its core, design 'is about conviviality' says Northrop. 'It's providing people with opportunities to interact in non-standard ways, a whole variety of seating and gathering.' To make sure there is space for serious partying, one long table on the ground floor can be dismantled to make way for an impromptu dance floor. Taking the rough with the smooth: Wood, leather, stone, and... concrete drainage pipes, create an alluring and intimate drinking booth in this vast hotel bar . Further water piping has been used to decorate other elements of this intriguing bar . Northrop made sure the redesign featured a serious DJ deck. 'After all pubs are not meant to be places of calm and reflection,' he says. Operations at the hotel's popular main bar, known as the Carlton Draught pub, continue as usual but with the addition of the vast and spectacular seating area. Theme: Even the bathrooms have been kitted out with their own concrete pipes, of course .","The Prahran Hotel, in Melbourne, Australia, has been transformed into a work of art using giant concrete pipes .

When Dustin had completed the online booking for the hotel room a month earlier he couldn’t resist having some fun when it came to the ‘special requests’ section. Dustin Wray and girlfriend Lauren Taylor decided to spent the night at the Woodlands Resort in Houston after purchasing tickets to see their favorite singer John Mayer perform there . Strange demands: Dustin Wray decided to set the staff at The Woodlands Resort an usual request . Dustin requested: ‘Three red M&Ms on the counter.

I love pictures of bacon.’ Not for a minute did he think the hotel would take his unusual requests seriously. ‘I wrote it so that if they saw it they would laugh because it was stupid, but also make it feasible if they actually wanted to fulfill it,’ he told ABCNews.com.

Atkinson, of Greenock, also assaulted her 23-year-old former partner after they took a day trip to Loch Thom in June last year. During the trial a jury heard Atkinson had also told Miss Jenkins’s mother that her daughter wasgay and they had been together for three years despite her girlfriend’s pleas for the relationship to be kept secret. She denied causing Miss Jenkins fear and alarm by her conduct at various times in 2012 and assaulting her at Loch Thom, at Greenock Sheriff Court. But she was found guilty and today appeared for sentencing. However Sheriff Rajni Swanney deferred sentence for good behaviour and ordered Atkinson to return to court in March next year. Miss Jenkins had earlier told of her ordeal at Atkinson’s hands. She said: 'I was really scared as we thought Heather would crash into us. 'She pulled up beside us and it was clear she was angry as she was pointing and shouting. 'There were points when she was dangerously close to me in the car.' She cried as she told the jury how Atkinson had wanted to reveal their relationship. She said: 'She wanted to speak to my mum to tell her about our relationship and cause upset.

Miss Jenkins' mother Elizabeth, 55, told the court she had no idea her daughter and Atkinson were ina relationship until she took the telephone call. She said: 'I thought it was a friendship. There was a closeness between the two of them. 'I received a phone call from Heather saying they had been in a relationship for the last three years. 'I said, ‘That explains a lot of things’.'

Sales of skincare products for men have risen by 20 per cent in the past five years, with particularly strong sales of prestige products . Many men may be making sacrifices amid the continuing economic gloom but looking good isn’t one of them. Sales of facial skincare products for men have risen by 20 per cent in the past five years, with particularly strong sales of prestige products. A study by market researchers Mintel found that total sales of men’s grooming products was now £58million, up 3.6 per cent on the year. Moisturiser was used by 42 per cent of men, while facial cleanser was used by almost a quarter (22 per cent). As many as 23 per cent of all men use lip balm, while 16 per cent use facial wipes. Eye cream and gels are used by seven per cent of men, while almost the same number use face masks and peels (six per cent). A further eight per cent use anti ageing products. Charlotte Libby, a Mintel analyst, said: ‘Prestige products have benefited from the “Lipstick Effect”, which has seen sales of luxury beauty products remain strong despite the economic downturn, as consumers treat themselves to small items. 'Additionally, increased and improved distribution channels will have no doubt buoyed the prestige sector.' Top of the range products have risen by almost 10 per cent with people treating themselves despite being strapped for cash. Meanwhile, overall, women are more sceptical about facial skincare claims than men. More than half (52 per cent) of women don’t always believe the claims made by facial skincare products compared to 32 per cent of men. A study by market researchers Mintel found that total sales of men's grooming products was now £58million, up 3.6 per cent on the year . Ms Libby said: 'While many of the nation’s men are adopting a regular skincare regime, it remains that a lower proportion of men use facial skincare products than women. 'Additionally, 19 per cent of men agree they only use facial skincare products when their skin visibly needs it. 'Men’s reactive approach to their skincare regime is the biggest challenge facing the industry. 'Encouraging men to adopt a more preventative approach to their skin’s needs could help drive sales in the category.' Soap is the biggest loser from the sales, with the proportion of female users falling from 58 per cent in 2012 to around a third (36 per cent) in 2013.","Market researchers Mintel found sales of grooming products now £58million .

They say the apple never falls far from the tree - and the old adage certainly proved true for this lollipop man when he decided to track down his real father. Not only did Darren Wardle, 47, who was adopted as a newborn, discover his biological father was also a lollipop man, he was stunned to find the two men had even applied for the same job. Mr Wardle, from Cannock in Staffordshire, was given up for adoption by his parents - who were both just 15-years-old when they had him - a few days after he was born. What are the chances? Darren Wardle, right, tracked down his biological father Paul Ferris, left, only to find they were both lollipop men - and had both applied for exactly the same job . Incredibly, Mr Wardle's adoptive mother, his wife, and his mother-in-law have all also worked as school crossing attendants. Mr Wardle has now been reunited with his biological father Paul Ferris, 62, after he decided to search for him following the death of his adoptive father. After contacting Mr Ferris' daughters - Mr Wardle's half-sisters - through Facebook, he learned his biological dad was living in nearby Tamworth. Mr Wardle wrote to him and father and son were reunited for the first time since Mr Wardle was given up for adoption. 'It was an emotional thing, but I was just so surprised when he told me he was applying to be a lollipop man at the same council as me,' Mr Wardle said of the reunion. 'Due to the fact I am a mobile lollipop man, I don’t have a fixed station so it would be very rare for our paths to ever cross.' Like father like son: Darren Wardle, seen in 1968 as a two-year-old, was adopted at just a few days old . Coincidences: Darren, seen left with his adopted sister Trina in Torquay in 1976, and right as an 16-year-old in 1982, said his adoptive mother, his wife and his mother-in-law have all worked as school crossing guards . Now both father and son work for Staffordshire County Council helping to guide schoolchildren safely across roads. Father-of-five Mr Wardle, who has two grandchildren, said: 'Both my parents had me at just 15 years old, they were children themselves so I was put up for adoption from birth . Growing up: Darren, seen as an 18-year-old in 1984, was reunited with his biological father in 2010 . 'Around . 25 years ago I decided to trace my mum, I went to our old house and . asked a neighbour who had lived in the street since the houses were . built if she knew where my mum may have moved to. 'She . told me the area of Tamworth, I immediately looked in the phone book . and found an Uncle, he then put me in touch with my mum and the rest is . history, it literally took around three hours,' Mr Wardle explained. 'After . speaking to my mum, she gave me some information about my dad but I . didn’t search for him until four years after my adopted father . died of cancer. 'I . hadn’t seen my dad for 44 years and I managed to get in touch with his . daughters, my half-sisters via Facebook, they told me to write to him, . so I did. 'Just a few . days later, he got back to me, he phoned me and we decided to meet at . his house in Tamworth in May 2010,' Mr Wardle said. Mr Ferris said: 'I was obviously delighted to meet up with Darren, and we found it particularly amusing that after all that time we were both going to be lollipop men. Like father, like son I guess. 'I was an engineer by trade and when I retired I decided to have a go at being a lollipop man to keep myself busy. 'I love the work.

A similar proportion can only do maths aimed at pupils in their final year of primary school, according to a report by the Commons defence select committee. The Army, Royal Air Force and the Naval Service have a good record in improving the maths and English skills of young recruits and trainees who join with low levels of qualifications, the study found. MPs' warning: Almost two fifths of Army recruits have the reading level of an 11-year-old. In this file picture, a British Army Jackal is seen on patrol through the Eastern Desert in Helmand province, Afghanistan . The minimum requirement of new recruits is ‘entry level 2’, the report says - equivalent to the standard expected of a seven or eight-year-old in literacy and numeracy. Of those who were recruited in 2012, all of those who joined the Naval Service or the RAF were above entry level 2, found the study, which looked at the education levels of the armed forces. But 39 per cent of the Army had a literacy level of an 11 year old, and 38 per cent had this level of ability in numeracy. It also found that 3.5 per cent of the Army were reading at the level of a seven or eight-year-old, while 1.7 per cent were at this standard in maths. The Ministry of Defence had told the committee that it recruits service personnel at whatever level of attainment is available, the report says, adding that if this is the case, then it should take action when entry standards are particularly low. It says that in light of planned changes to the three services, ‘it may be that recruiting personnel with higher levels of attainment would better meet the future needs of the armed forces.’ ‘The MoD should identify how it might raise the basic entry level and still recruit sufficient personnel,’ the report says. Education: The report said 39 per cent of the Army had a literacy level of an 11 year old, and 38 per cent had this level of ability in numeracy (file picture) The . committee goes on to suggest: ‘Whilst we recognise that some recruits . may not have done well in their previous academic careers and may not be . eager to take further academic exams, the MoD should encourage more . recruits to undertake English and Maths GCSEs which would stand them in . good stead for future employment.’ Provisions: Committee chair James Arbuthnot said it is 'vital' that service personnel receive 'excellent education' Young . servicemen and women are being offered ‘challenging and constructive’ education and employment opportunities, the cross-party group of MPs . acknowledge. The committee also raises concerns that the Army is dependent on recruiting 16 and 17-year-olds. More . than one in four (28 per cent) of Army recruits are under the age of 18 . when they join, compared with 5 per cent for the Naval Service and 8 . per cent for the RAF. ‘We support the armed forces' provision of challenging and constructive education and employment opportunities for young people,’ the report says. ‘But we would welcome further information on why the Army is so dependent on recruiting personnel under the age of 18 years compared to the other two services, and whether steps are being taken to reduce this dependency.’ Committee chair James Arbuthnot said: ‘It is vital we provide excellent education for our personnel not just for their own career development but also to give them confidence that when the time comes to leave the service they will be able to transfer to a civilian career.' The Conservative MP for North East Hampshire added: ‘They are more likely to remain in the service if this is the case. 'We welcome the work that has been done to increase the number of areas where personnel can acquire a civilian qualification and we would like to see this work further extended.’","Army, RAF and Naval Service have good record in improving skills .

Outgoing NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson faces questions from MPs again today after revelations about secret severance payments . Hospital bosses have spent more than £2million on 52 secret severance payments, igniting new controversy over the gagging of whistleblowers. The revelation will increase the pressure on outgoing NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, who had promised to investigate the problem. He remains in his £270,000 post until next year despite presiding over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal which cost the lives of 1,200 patients. In March, it emerged that Gary Walker was paid £500,000 to go quietly under  judicial mediation from his post as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust. Sir David told an influential Commons committee this was ‘a one-off’, but promised to look into the issue. Asked if there were any other examples, he replied: ‘It is the first time in my  experience that I have ever seen that done. I have asked around and I do not think there is another example.’ However, figures uncovered by Conservative MP Steve Barclay through Freedom of Information requests flatly contradict Sir David’s assertion. Mr Barclay has discovered that 32  hospitals spent more than £2million in 52 judicial payments to whistleblowers in the three years to March. Six more hospitals have admitted making similar gagging payments, but refused to disclose the amounts. Another 50 hospitals have not replied, which indicates the final figure is likely to be higher. Two consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals were paid £300,000 and £265,000 respectively. The payments were made in February – a month before Sir David assured MPs the deal with Mr Walker was an isolated case. The two consultants even worked for a hospital  in the same county as Mr Walker. Northampton General Hospital paid £50,000 to a whistleblower in 2011/12 and £95,000 to another the following year. The Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust went through a mediation before paying £128,000 to four outgoing staff in 2010 (although no gagging orders were made). And Great Ormond Street . Hospital handed over £38,000. Gary Walker, former chief executive of the United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust, was paid £500,000 to go quietly . Today, Sir David appears before MPs on the Public Accounts Committee again to explain the apparent contradictions. Mr Barclay said: ‘I find it hard to believe that this  practice had been going on for so long and Sir David knew nothing about it. He is the accounting officer for the NHS and so it is his duty to know how the money is spent. ‘After Sir David gave evidence in March, I repeatedly asked his office about the progress of his investigation. ‘As no information was forthcoming I decided to find the information myself. ‘I was staggered that there had been so many secret  payments to gag potential whistleblowers. I’m even more staggered Sir David apparently knew nothing. Far from being one off, this is a systemic problem. ‘I’m concerned these gagging payments are much more widespread. These new figures apply only to hospital trusts. ‘I suspect the ambulance, mental health service and community trusts will have used the same method.’ Northampton General Hospital paid a total of £145,000 to two whistleblowers . Margaret Hodge, chairman of the MPs’ committee, will also be furious. The Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, which is in her East London constituency, made a secret payment of £28,000 earlier this year. The statistics have forced Health Minister Daniel Poulter to change the rules. He said approval for judicial mediation payments will now be needed from the Chancellor or Health Secretary. In April, NHS Employers, which represents trusts on staff issues, said the payments must be ‘exceptional’ and have Treasury approval. The six who refused to publish the costs of their gagging deals include Guy’s and St Thomas’s NHS Trust, which is yards from the Commons. In March, Mr Barclay found that in the three years to 2011, there were 598 ‘special severance payments’ costing £14.7million in the NHS with strict confidentiality clauses. Unlike the mediation payments, they were signed off by the NHS and Treasury. Articles in June about secret severance payments to NHS staff said that two consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust were paid ‘hush money’. We are happy to clarify that while the consultants in question were paid £300,000 and £265000, they were not asked to sign gagging orders and continue to work for the trust.","Revelations increase pressure on NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson .

He later explained that the 28-year-old is being protected by 'additional security arrangements' as he carries out his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. Speaking on BBC 2's Newsnight last night, he said: 'Clearly there are fall-back plans and I can't go into the detail of them - but once we knew on Friday night that the perimeter at Bastion had been breached he would have been moved to a secure position under effective guard.' Asked by presenter Jeremy Paxman if that meant Prince Harry was not treated the same as every other soldier, the Defence Secretary said: 'You asked me whether he was at any greater risk. 'And I've told you that in combat he's at the same risk as any other Apache pilot. 'Clearly if we had a VIP in theatre and frankly if I was there or, Jeremy, if you were there in Camp Bastion and there was a breach of the perimeter security, anybody who might, by nature of who they are, be a target, they would be put in a secure location.' He added: 'He is serving there as an ordinary officer but clearly there are additional security arrangements in place that recognise that he could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is.' Rogue security forces have carried out . 37 attacks this year, killing 51 coalition troops.

A former Tory minister denounced the Government’s planning policies as an ‘environmental disaster’ yesterday. Nick Herbert said new planning rules are leading to a ‘greenfield first’ building that is concreting over the countryside. Warning that the Tories have ‘reneged’ on their manifesto pledge to give local people a say over new building in their neighbourhoods, he declared: ‘Localism is dead.’ Rolling countryside of Hampshire. Fears that the Tories have reneged on their manifesto pledge to give local people a say over new building in their neighbourhoods . Mr Herbert, who used to serve in the Department for Communities and Local Government which drew up the new National Planning Policy Framework, called for planning inspectors to be stripped of the right to overrule local building plans. He spoke out in a planning debate in the House of Commons yesterday during which several former Conservative ministers and irate backbenchers lined up to confront Planning Minister Nick Boles. The NPPF requires councils in England to promote ‘sustainable development’ in planning decisions and draw up local plans to provide land for development. Nick Herbert accused developers of abusing the system by buying up brownfield land for development . Mr Herbert accused developers of abusing the system by buying up brownfield land for development and sitting on it rather than building houses and then persuading planning inspectors to let them build on greenfield land. He said: ‘We are effectively moving not to the brownfield-first site policy that we should have but to a greenfield-first policy. That is an environmental disaster.’ Former prisons minister Crispin Blunt, the MP for Reigate, said: ‘The national policy planning framework is not working to protect the green belt. ‘There is greenfield development in the green belt designated for my constituency at the behest of a planning inspector, rather than local people, which is evidence that our system is not working.’ Former Tory frontbencher Nicholas Soames MP said that the planning system was at risk of being corrupted by developers and their lobbyists. He said: ‘The process is susceptible to well-funded lobbyists and developers promoting pet projects that local people believe are out of all proportion to what they want in their community.’ And Zac Goldsmith, a former green adviser to David Cameron, said that green field sites should be spared development because ‘vast tracts of land are available for development but lying idle’. Mr Herbert, a former Home Office minister, said he thought builders were responding to a ‘signal’ from the government to submit plans for greenfield building that are then were waved through by the planning inspectorate. He said: ‘I believe that those developers are responding to a signal that has been sent to them. ‘There is now a growing risk that we will return to the bad old days of planning by appeal, under which the plans put together by local authorities are effectively overturned by the inspectorate.’ Mr Herbert pointed out that the Conservative party manifesto at the last election said: ‘To give communities greater control over planning, we will abolish the power of planning inspectors to rewrite local plans’. ‘That is the promise that this party made to local people, yet we are now effectively allowing the inspectorate to do exactly that,’ Mr Herbert said.

Crispin Blunt, MP for Reigate, said: 'The national policy planning framework is not working to protect the green belt' ‘In my constituency, one chief executive of a district council told a group of parish councillors who were discussing with him their proposed neighbourhood plan, “Localism is dead.” ‘When we have told people that they will be in charge in their local communities and when we have put on them the responsibility for planning sensibly, we must uphold their ability to do so. ‘Allowing a quango, through the back door, to reimpose the top-down housing targets that we said we would abolish is damaging to the process of localism, to public trust and, if we persist, to the Government themselves.’ Planning Minister Nick Boles said it was necessary to keep the planning inspectorate because the alternative would be that planning decisions were made in expensive court cases. He told MPs that it was vital councils developed local plans, setting out clearly where new homes can be built for the next five years. ‘The easy solution would be simply to abolish the inspectorate, but I say to them that all such decisions would then be taken by judges in courts. ‘Developers will not stop challenging local decisions that they think do not accord with local or national policies. ‘They will simply challenge them in the courts, at much greater cost to the taxpayer and, I suspect, to the not much greater contentment of residents.’","Warning that the Tories have 'reneged' on their manifesto pledge .

An RAF crew whose remains were discovered more than 65 years after they were shot down over Italy are to be given a funeral with full military honours. Amateur historians located the remains of three war heroes in the wreckage of the Douglas A-20 Boston after their bomber plane crashed into a field and burst into a huge fireball. The trio, all aged 21, died and a fourth crew member, an Australian, who was attached to the RAF was also killed in the crash which took place just two weeks before World War Two ended. Pilot flt sgt David Raikes, radio operator flight sgt Alexander Bostock and navigator flt sgt David Perkins were all members of the RAF Volunteers and attached 18 Squadron based at Odiham in Hampshire. The squadron which carried out numerous operations across Europe during World War Two is famous for dropping an artificial leg to war legend Douglas Bader and its motto is 'With Courage and Faith'. The Australian pilot John Hunt, 21, was the aircraft gunner and all four are listed on a war memorial in Malta dedicated to RAF servicemen who lost their lives during the War. They were initially listed as missing in action and then officially declared dead a few months later but Commonwealth War Graves records show that no burial site or remains were ever found for them. Poignant: Amateur historians using metal detectors unearthed a ring inscribed 'Chris, with love' at the crash site . Historians located the wreckage in a field at Copparo near Ferrara two years ago and using metal detectors they also unearthed personal items belonging to crew including a ring and a wristwatch. The ring is thought to belong to Perkins and is engraved with his initials and the words 'Chris, with love' while the watch has gunner Hunt's name on it and his service number. Sgt Raikes, whose father was a Lt Colonel in the RAF, was from Redhill, Surrey and educated at Oxford University and was famous after the war for a collection of poems he wrote put together by his teacher. According to war office records Sgt Bostock was from Kimberley, Nottinghamshire while his colleague Sgt Perkins was from Sydenham, south London. Uncovered: This ring, thought to belong to David Perkins, was found at the site, near the town of Copparo, close to Ferrara . Following the discovery of the remains, an appeal was launched for relatives to get in touch and the hunt was led by the British Embassy and military historians in London and Canberra. Relatives have now been traced and family members of all four crew members will be travelling to the ceremony which will take place on July 18 at a Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Padova. Records show that the Boston had taken off from Forli airfield near Bologna in the late evening of April 21 1945 to attack a river crossing at Taglio di Po before going on an 'armed reconnaissance mission.' Poetry: A volume of David Raikes' poems was published in 1954 by a don who had taught him at Trinity College, Oxford . Simone Guidorzi who led the hunt said: 'We knew the rough area where the plane crashed from speaking to locals who are still alive and were children at the time. 'They said they saw the plane crash with one of its wings broken off and an engine ripped away. It burnt for two days and once the locals managed to get close they salvaged some of the valuable metal parts. 'No remains were recovered and over the years the remains just sank into the ground but we decided to investigate and have now recovered the remains of the plane and human body parts. Secret report: The RAF document showing that the bomber had disappeared on its service in northern Italy . 'A watch belonging to Hunt was found and a ring with Perkins initials was also recovered using metal detectors.' Flt sgt Raikes was a pupil at Radley College, where a poetry prize in his name is given out each year and a book of his works was published posthumously in 1954. In one of his poems, Let It Be Hushed, he wrote: 'These men knew moments you have never known,/Nor ever will; we knew those moments too,/And talked of them in whispers late at night;/ Such confidence was born of danger shared./We shared their targets, too; but we came back. Lightly we talked of it. We packed their kit,/ Divided up such common useful things/ As cigarettes and chocolate, rations stored/ Against a rainy day that never came.' In a statement British embassy in Rome said: 'Relatives of the four men will be meeting for the first time, coming from the United Kingdom and Australia, in what will be a very moving occasion commemorating the life of these men who lost their lives at such a young age. 'Some of the wreckage of the aircraft and some surviving personal belongings will be presented to the relatives of the four servicemen.' The event is being organised by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force with the help of the British Embassy in Rome. Participating in the event will be serving representatives of both Air Forces, including members of Queen’s Colour Squadron and 18 Squadron, as well as Italian military and civilian representatives.","RAF bomber was brought down days before end of World War Two in Italy .

Callers spent £56million on  premium-rate government phone lines last year – with half their time spent on hold. Factoring in the value of time waiting to speak to a ‘real person’ would bring the actual cost closer to £150million, said spending watchdog the National Audit Office. Its report found that despite attempts to limit them, ‘084’ numbers continue to be used ‘extensively’ across Whitehall. Nearly half of the 120 phone lines served vulnerable or low-income groups such as pensioners, the bereaved, pregnant women and the unemployed, who faced ‘eye-watering’ costs. The taxman, the National Pensions Centre, a redundancy helpline, the Bereavement Service and the CAFCASS information line aimed at children all use the lines. However, the NAO said £26million was  spent by callers just waiting for an advisor to pick up the phone. In total people spent 880million minutes on premium calls and nearly half of that time was spent on hold. Its report said: ‘In addition to the direct charges for calling government telephone lines, there is an opportunity cost to callers of the time spent waiting on calls. ‘Assuming that callers value their time at around 25p per minute, the value of time waiting on higher rate lines would be £100 million.’ It said that estimating the value of the time lost was a ‘useful measure’ that should make departments assess the quality of their phone services. The NAO called for government departments dealing with vulnerable or low-income people to stop using 084 numbers. Those connected to the costly lines spent nearly half their time - 46 per cent or 402million minutes - waiting to speak to an advisor . Callers spent 1.45 billion minutes connected to government phone lines, of which 880 million minutes were on higher rate lines. Those connected to the costly lines spent nearly half their time – 46 per cent or 402 million minutes – waiting to speak to an advisor. There were also glaring inconsistencies between departments, with some using the lines while others gave out toll free or lower cost numbers on local dialling codes. The worst offenders were the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and HM Revenue and Customs. The Department of Health is the only major department to rule out the use of 084 numbers. Some 63 per cent of all telephone calls to government phone lines were made to the premium cost lines, which are also used by 8 per cent of GP surgeries in England and 4 per cent of local authorities. Margaret Hodge, chairman, of the Public Accounts Committee, said the amounts being shelled out to use them were ‘eye watering’. She added: ‘It is not acceptable that vulnerable people are facing some of the highest charges to call central government about important issues such as benefits and redundancy.’ She called for regulator Ofcom to ‘get to grips’ with the ‘confusing charging system’. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: ‘The most vulnerable callers, such as low-income households, face some of the highest charges.’ The average call cost to 0844 numbers is 5.6p from a landline and 17.1p a minute from a mobile. For 0845 numbers, it costs 4.2p a minute from a landline and 17.6p from a mobile. But local code numbers are usually 3.4p from a landline and 1.1p a minute from a mobile, while 03 numbers are usually the same rate. David Hickson, of the Fair Telecoms campaign, said the ‘penal cost’ of 084 numbers was ‘disenfranchising’ many from accessing government services . And Labour MP John Healey,  who has called for a ban on the ‘scandalous’ use of 084 numbers, said callers had no choice but to use them, however, they are charged ‘rip-off rates’. HM Revenue and Customs has already switched to 03 numbers for its busiest lines and pledged to phase out higher rate numbers. The Department for Work and Pensions had also promised free calls from mobiles to its 0800 benefit claims hotlines. Changing all higher rate helplines to 03 numbers would save callers £29 million a year, while using only to 0800 numbers would save £46 million, says the NAO.","Despite attempts to limit them, '084' numbers still used across Whitehall .

Abby Huntsman has become the latest footnote in the long history of children of high-profile politicians becoming television news contributors. The daughter of 2012 Republican presidential also-ran Jon Huntsman has inked a deal to become co-host of MSNBC’s ‘The Cycle.’ As Huntsman adds ‘a dose of moderate rational conservatism’ to the afternoon political talk show, she’ll join long list of politic kids turned media personalities that includes Chelsea Clinton, Jenna Bush, Meghan McCain, and more. New gig: The daughter of Utah governor and presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman will now be seen on MSNBC's The Cycle . The Utah native, whose father ran the Beehive State prior to his presidential bid, announced her new gig on HuffPost Live, her most recent job. The 27-year-old University of Pennsylvania grad was an original host and producer on the web-based show. ‘It’s this next chapter of my life, I’m very much looking forward to,’ she said on the live streaming show Wednesday. ‘It’s very bittersweet.’ Huntsman has also worked with ABC News and Good Morning America and appeared as a commentator on MSNBC and CNN since the 2012 elections. Experienced: Abby Huntsman, 27, has worked with MSNBC before and will leave a job hosting Huff Post's live streaming web show to join The Cycle July 29 . Since she comes complete with a history of working in the media, Huntsman will actually be among the more experienced of the elite group of political offspring turned media hosts. At their start on television, names like Chelsea Clinton and Jenna Bush were familiar to viewers. But as subjects of the media, not producers of it. Clinton notably faced scrutiny when it was announced in 2011 she’d be joining the NBC News team. Though her job as a ‘special correspondent’ entailed little on-air time and no hard hitting subject matter, hardened media professionals were unimpressed. Good company? Huntsman will join the ranks of Chelsea Clinton, who hosts the occasional segment for NBC News . Fellow journalist: Huntsman will also have a colleague in Meghan McCain, the daughter of Arizona Senator John McCain and contributor for MSNBC and the Daily Beast . ‘Just another spoiled, aimless child of rich, successful parents,’ the New York Post’s Andrea Peyser wrote at the time, saying Clinton was ‘chauffeured through adulthood by Mommy and Daddy’s connections.’ Meanwhile, Jenna Bush was far more experienced as the butt of media jokes about her underage college drinking when she became a member of the media. Meghan McCain might be a better parallel for Huntsman. The daughter of John McCain has contributed to MSNBC, as well, and written for the Daily Beast. Someone to look up to? Liz Cheney is among the list, too. The daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney has been a common face seen on Fox News for years. Cheney recently announced a U.S. Senate bid . McCain’s reputation has largely been made on her ability to stir the press, albeit from the inside, than for her work. Liz Cheney might be a comparison more to Huntsman’s liking. The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney has been a popular fixture on Fox News for years and recently announced her bid to run for U.S. Senate in Wyoming. So, while we wait for her to come full circle and run for political office, viewers can catch Huntsman's time with MSNBC’s The Cycle starting July 29.","Other notable examples include Chelsea Clinton, Jenna Bush, Meghan McCain, and Liz Cheney .

Tesco chiefs made an ‘unreserved apology’ in court after one of its flagship stores was plagued by rodents. Mouse droppings were found on the shop floor and on bakery packaging at Tesco Metro in Covent Garden, central London - where 55,000 shoppers flock each week. Inspectors found what they described as a ‘super mouse’ in one of the food crates. It was much larger than a standard mouse because it had been gorging on protein. Disgusting: A large mouse, sitting on a crate of food at a Tesco store. The retail chain's chiefs made an 'unreserved apology' in court after dead mice and droppings were found throughout the store . Food waste was also discovered across the store’s warehouse and storage areas, while the floors were covered in grease and dirt. Staff also failed to fix doors, pipes and loose ceiling tiles allowing mice to enter fridges and food crates at the Bedford Street store. Health inspectors also found dead rodents in the dairy section in the store warehouse which provided a ‘large risk of contamination’ to food, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard. Customers alerted Westminster City Council after spotting mice scurry across the shop floor on 23 March last year. Vile: A food crate containing raw meat and mouse droppings at the store . Tesco chicken pieces that mice have gnawed on and covered with their droppings . Environmental health officers warned staff there was a mice infestation, but the janitor was left to clean the store before a second inspection three days later. Health inspectors then had to issue an emergency hygiene prohibition notice and close the store when they found that virtually no progress had been made. ‘During the inspection of the premises a number of breaches of food hygiene regulations were uncovered,’ said Paul Sharkey, for Westminster City Council. ‘The first visit by an environmental health officer was after a complaint was made by a member of the public about a mouse being sighted on 23 March 2012. A food crate with a mouse in it. The officers ordered the store, one of the capital's busiest, to close under emergency measures . ‘A further complaint was received from a member of the public on 26 March about pests in the store. ‘As this was the second complaint within five days, it was decided to visit the store again and see what progress had been made. ‘Two officers spoke to the store manager who said cleaning work had not been completed and that Rentokil should have been called which had not happened. ‘The officers then inspected the bakery and found a large number of mouse droppings on plastic storage boxes and 17 mouse droppings where pastry was kept. ‘Food debris was also found in the bakery on top of shelves. ‘There was poor pest proofing with the suspended ceiling often used by mice in the building as ‘runways’. The horrid discoveries continued in the warehouse and kitchen areas, the court heard. Mr Sharkey added: ‘The floor of the kitchen was very dirty. No cleaning had taken place since the first inspection three days before. ‘In the dairy area one of the officers was overcome with a strong smell of decomposing pests in the unit. In the dairy area one of the officers was overcome with a strong smell of decomposing pests in the unit . ‘Mouse droppings were found on packaging of items in the bakery and on plastic containers. ‘Given the density of the mouse droppings, the officers decided that there was a large risk of contamination in the fridge. ‘There was clear gnawing of other packaging and pieces of raw chicken had been eaten. ‘There was multiple mouse droppings on the chicken.’ Mouse droppings and food waste were also discovered across the store's warehouse and storage areas, while the floors were covered in grease and dirt . The officers ordered the store, one of the capital’s busiest, to close under emergency measures. A random inspection two days later had to be abandoned because mouse droppings were still found in the store’s shop and basement floors, the court heard. Mark Watson, representing Tesco, said: ‘I make an unreserved apology on behalf of the company for the conditions of the premises and the offences that arose from these premises. ‘Its 3,100 stores do generally maintain very high standards.’ He added: ‘There was in the aftermath a full review of management structures and maintenance staff. ‘The store manager was replaced and full retraining of all staff took place.’ District Judge John Zani was shown pictures taken by health inspectors in which live mice could be clearly seen in certain snaps. He said the store’s failing of the third health inspection proved that it had not put its customers first. ‘On a further inspection environmental health officers had to be sent away - a store that had 55,000 customers a week,’ he said. ‘If I were a member of the public I wouldn’t be bothered or concerned if it was the local manager’s fault. ‘If I contracted food poisoning there is no point saying: ""I’m sorry - that manager wasn’t very good and has been replaced"". ‘That manager was good enough to be employed by Tesco as of that date.’ Judge Zani could have fined Tesco up to £30,000 but decided his powers were insufficient and sent the case for sentence at Southwark Crown Court. The Tesco Metro in Covent Garden, central London, has 55,000 customers a week . Council health inspectors also found mice on the shop floor and droppings were also left behind the pick ‘n’ mix counter and next to the crisps shelves. A plastic bag used to cover a drainage pipe on the shop floor had also been gnawed away which meant mice were free to roam the stores while customers were shopping. The court heard Rentokil had first identified the mouse infestation in January 2012 yet little had been done by store staff to get rid of the rodents. Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, employs around 300,000 people in over 3,100 stores in the country. The supermarket chain, which was recently embroiled in the horsemeat scandal, has been fined three times since 2008 for breaching food hygiene practices at stores in Cardiff, Ipswich, and Towcester, Northamptonshire. Tesco will face sentencing at Southwark Crown Court at a later date after pleading guilty to six counts relating to food hygiene offences at the Bedford Street store. Judge Zani could have fined the supermarket a maximum of £5000 on each of the six offences but a judge crown court will have greater sentencing powers.","Health inspectors discovered the rodents and droppings at busy Tesco .

The former England captain said there should be 'compulsory education for townies about what happens in the country' He is almost as well known for his laid-back persona as he is for his prowess on the cricket field. But David Gower has directed a furious broadside at Britain’s ‘townies’, whom he claims are ignorant of countryside issues and should be  tested on rural affairs before being allowed to vote. The former England captain said there should be ‘compulsory education for townies about what happens in the country’. He said: ‘It’d be really good for town and country folk, when they’re at school, to learn more about each other. There’d be a low-level exam. If you fail twice, you’re not allowed to vote. Unless you understand the issues, you’re not qualified.’ Mr Gower, who lives in a sprawling mansion in Hampshire, also attacked politicians who are ‘allergic to grass’, saying they make unpopular decisions about countryside matters. The 56-year-old said: ‘The rural economy has kept many employed, happy and healthy for a long time. 'I live in the country and find it irritating when issues that affect it are decided by city dwellers, many of whom love tarmac, are allergic to grass and find it hard to understand where Morris dancing comes from.’ The cricketer lives in Braishfield, Romsey, with his Icelandic wife Thorunn and two daughters, Alexandra, 19 and Sammi, 17. He made the comments to Reader’s Digest magazine. He also defended the controversial countryside pursuits of fox hunting and pheasant shooting, saying they provided an effective form of pest control and conservation. Mr Gower, who lives in a sprawling mansion in Hampshire, also attacked politicians who are 'allergic to grass' Mr Gower, irreverently nicknamed Lord . Gower because of his aristocratic ancestry and public school education, . said: ‘I’d permit fox hunting and encourage tolerance of other country . pursuits. I’ve no desire to hunt foxes, but I don’t want to stop others. I shoot, and I have interesting discussions with people about firing at . defenceless pheasants. ‘I do worry about a time  when townies decide to arm pheasants and they start shooting back. ‘But land that’s devoted to shooting is well tended, with cover crops and woods. The landowners I know are responsible people who want to preserve their estates for future generations. And the shooting community is very clear that everything that’s shot should be eaten. ‘Many of these issues apply to fox hunting – conservation and also pest control. I’d ask city-dwellers what they think when confronted by urban foxes, which have proliferated.’ Mr Gower played professional cricket for 18 years between 1975 and 1993. After retiring from the sport he went on to appear on BBC panel show They Think It’s All Over and now works as a pundit for Sky Sports. Last year, TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh was branded a ‘complete muppet’ by environment secretary Owen Paterson for criticising the Government’s countryside policies. He had warned that the Conservative party had lost its roots in rural areas.","Mr Gower attacked politicians who are ‘allergic to grass’, saying they make unpopular decisions about countryside matters .

One of Britain’s most high-profile fashion bosses has quit her job at the age of 56 – prompting an ageism row. Kate Bostock walked out of fashion giant Asos earlier this week after just seven months as director of product. Explaining her departure founder Nick Robertson said: ‘Strategy wasn’t the issue. It was more about cultural fit and time of life.’ Influential: Kate Bostock, previously head of merchandising at rival retailer Marks & Spencer, has quit a senior post at Asos . And in what some are calling an . admission of discrimination, the 44-year-old added: ‘Our average age is . 27 or 28. People get to a stage in their career where they’re either up . for a very big challenge or they’re not.’ One headhunter who specialises in recruiting retail executives said she was appalled by Mr Robertson’s comment. ‘It’s an absolute ageist comment that . was directed at Kate because she was a woman,’ said Moira Benigson, . managing partner of executive search group MBS. ‘If the job had gone to a . man of the same calibre would people have said that? ‘They are suggesting she is past her . sell-by date, so when’s the cut off? Is it when menopause starts? Asos . will have to behave like a mature business someday, but it is still . young and entrepreneurial.’ Brief stint: Nick Robertson, chief executive of Asos, said he was 'disappointed that things haven't worked out' as Ms Bostock's departure was announced . Kate Bostock's career trajectory has seen her work her way up from a design role at a now defunct knitwear manufacturer in the East Midlands to become a key player at some of the biggest names in British retail. Fresh out of fashion college in Derby, Bostock secured a position at the now dissolved clothing manufacturer Klynton Davies, before moving on to Bent & Son, party plan firm Pippa Dee and Charnwood Designs. She joined high street staple Next in 1995, where she would remain as director of kidswear until 2001 when she moved to Asda as product director for the supermarket giant's George clothing brand. She spent three years at Asda before being hired by Marks & Spencer in 2004, where she rose to become executive director of general merchandise on a package worth almost £1m. Last July Marks & Spencer reported dismal quarterly figures and announced that Ms Bostock would be leaving as head of clothing as part of a management shake-up. She stepped down from the board in October 2012. Online retailer Asos set about courting Ms Bostock and she took up a position as director of product and trading in January 2013 in what was widely hailed as a major coup for the firm. The 56-year-old's latest post came with an undisclosed salary that reportedly represented a cut on what she was earning at rival retailer Marks & Spencer. On Tuesday, after just seven months at Asos, it was announced that Ms Bostock had quit after agreeing with chief executive Nick Robertson the firm was 'not the right platform for her talent'. Miss Bostock said simply: ‘Sadly I’ve . concluded that Asos is not the right place for me.’ Announcing Miss . Bostock’s departure on Monday, multimillionaire retail tycoon Mr . Robertson said: ‘Kate and I have agreed that Asos is not the right . platform for her talent. 'Of course we are disappointed that things . haven’t worked out and Kate leaves with our very best wishes.’ He was reported as saying: ‘I’d love . to say it was more sinister and complicated, but she gave it six months . and decided it wasn’t for her’. Insiders said that while it was Miss . Bostock’s decision to leave, it was potentially driven by something of a . culture clash. She joined Asos after last year . leaving Marks & Spencer, where she was considered the queen of . fashion, having risen to run its clothing business. Marks & Spencer is traditional in . its approach to retailing and its products are aimed at a broader church . of shoppers whereas Asos is aimed at 20-somethings, with an internet . focus. Previously she had worked at Next, which she joined in 1995, . working her way up to director of childrenswear before moving to Asda in . 2001, where she worked as product director for its George clothing . brand. Her experience meant she was regarded as one of the key voices in the fashion retail world. She was brought in as Asos retail . director on an undisclosed salary after Mr Robertson said he had wanted . to appoint a ‘big retail hitter to take the business on to the next . level’. One retail executive said: ‘It was . never going to be a marriage made in heaven – she’s hardcore and he’s . king of flying by the seat of his pants.’ Asos, which stands for As Seen On . Screen, started life in 2000 marketing copies of clothes worn by famous . people. It now sells a wide range of clothing, from high street names to . high-end fashion. It is also running a trial selling items for Primark, which has no other online presence. Mr Robertson has grown Asos into a £3.6bn business, in which he has a 9.4 per cent stake, currently worth £345million. Asos, which stands for As Seen On Screen, started life in 2000 marketing copies of clothes worn by famous people . Back in 2000, a website called As Seen On Screen launched to little fanfare. Marketing copies of clothes worn by famous women to celebrity-obsessed girls, the site was manned by a staff of just three. Thirteen years and an abbreviated title later, Asos is now a global retail phenomenon that employs staff in Australia, the U.S., France and Germany and attracts in excess of 20million internet shoppers every month. The website offers fashion-conscious 20 and 30-somethings instant access to thousands of items from a vast array of major brands - along with its own creations following the launch of the Asos Own label for women in 2004. In 2010 came the launch of Asos . Marketplace, a treasure trove of vintage fashion where users can browse . the wares of small boutique brands or sell their own creations. Having well and truly shed its early reputation as a purveyor of rip-off versions of celebrity outfits, Asos is now a one-stop destination for everything from the high street to high end, with River Island or Zara dresses, vintage gems, and premium brands like Current Elliott or Equipment separated by just a few clicks of a mouse. Having this year opened new international offices in Lille and Munich, the retailer's spectacular growth shows no sign of slowing down. Asos reported a remarkable 45 per cent rise in sales to £194million in the three months to May 31, compared with the same period in 2012. And while its offering has expanded over the years to include designer diffusion lines and edgier, more expensive brands alongside its high street lines, the retailer's commitment to fast, affordable fashion was evident in its decision to feature items from Primark for a trial period last month. The decision to team up with the discount clothing store appears to have been welcomed by Asos' ever-expanding customer base, as chief executive Nick Robertson described the response to the Primark trial as 'phenomenal'.","Quit as executive director of product and trading at online fashion giant .

Die-hards fans of disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen have taken to sending empty butter wrappers to her former sponsors as a protest at what they believe is her unfair treatment after admitting to using racial slurs. The ‘We Support Paula Deen’ campaign is the brainchild of John Schmitt, a hotel night auditor in Indianapolis. When a host of sponsors - including Walmart, Target and the Food Network - severed ties with Deen following her infamous ‘I is what I is’ interview on . the Today show, he decided to do something to show his support for her. What started out as the defense of a civil lawsuit has turned into an operation to try and salvage what's left of Deen's business empire after she lost a host of major sponsors and her slot on the Food Network . A message for her ex-sponsors: Hardcore Paula Deen fans are sending butter wrappers to the companies that dropped her as a protest . ‘In a lot of ways, she reminds me of my mom - this funny, gracious lady from a different era,’ he told CNN. ‘My mom probably used that word and she wasn’t a racist.’ He describes her sponsor's actions as a ‘betrayal’. First he setup the 'We Support Paula Deen' Facebook page, which has attracted over 600,000 likes. Then he and fellow supporters hit upon the idea of sending butter wrappers to her old sponsors as a form of protest - inspired by her favorite cooking ingredient. Butter for Paula: A website has been launched providing fans with addresses for the companies that have severed ties with her . The ‘We Support Paula Deen’ campaign is the brainchild of John Schmitt, right, while another fan, left, posts a photo on the group's website to mourn the closure of the Paula Deen Buffet chain . ‘The butter itself is Paula and these wrappers are void of butter, just like these companies are void of Paula,’ explained supporter Chris Ford. Initially Schmitt wanted to mail actual butter sticks until he realized that would get very messy. Schmitt and his fellow Deen fans don’t expect that the sponsors will take her back as a result of their efforts, but they wanted to do something to express their support for her and what they feel has been a witch hunt against their favorite celebrity chef. ‘I sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck-a-lucks down at the Food Network probably wouldn’t even open it,’ wrote Liz Vannah, a supporter from Connecticut, in a Facebook message. ‘But I felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading, for whatever hidden-agenda-ed reason it happened, is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public.’ As well as the Facebook page there is also the ‘Butter for Paula’ website which features the slogan – ‘A corporation without Paula Deen is like a butter wrapper without butter’. https://www.facebook.com/WeSupportPaulaDean/photos_stream paula dean . Joyce Dixon, from Claxton, Georgia, volunteers her time to helping run the campaign and believes Deen has been made a scapegoat. ‘It wasn’t about the N-word; it was about the extortion thing, about this one crazy employee,’ Dixon told CNN. ‘My interest is in Paula’s business. To me, it’s about a self-made woman. You have to ask yourself, “If she was a man, would this happen? If she was from the North would this happen?” And you know, I don’t think it would.’ Footage of Deen openly admitting to using the N-word will probably never see the light of day now after a judge blocked the incriminating video's release earlier this week. In the deposition  tape, the disgraced celebrity chef says 'yes of course' she used the N-word in the past, sparking the firestorm that has destroyed her reputation and cost her millions. Firestorm: The controversial video sparked a firestorm and caused Deen's sponsors to leave her in droves . According to TMZ, . Deen was terrified the ex-employee accusing her of promoting a racist . and sexist work environment in a $1.2 million lawsuit would leak the . video to the media. As such, she filed court documents last week asking the judge to block the 'colorful' video. The small victory comes after Deen . fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs . scandal that have sunk her career. According to court documents, Deen has replaced Savannah-based firm Oliver Maner with Grace Speights, a Washington, D.C.-based partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Labor and Employment practice. Grace Speights is considered something of a pioneer as the first African-American woman to become a partner at her law firm. She has also been a keynote speaker at the Attorneys of Color Conference. The hiring could be seen as a cynical move by Deen who is keen to point out she is not a racist after her recent troubles. Legal team: Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has fired her entire legal team in the ongoing fallout from the racial slurs scandal that have sunk her career . ‘She and her team decided the previous attorneys were out of their depth,’ a source close to the Deen family told People. Deen has assembled a new legal team of acclaimed 'heavy hitters' that also includes Patricia Glaser, one of the country's top entertainment lawyers, and Savannah-based Harvey Weitz. Glaser earned a reputation as a 'tough, take-no-prisoners litigator' after securing a $32.5 million payout from NBC for Conan O'Brien for the remainder of his 'The Tonight Show' contract in 2010. The new 'All Stars' legal team will be charged with defending Deen . against the lawsuit filed by Lisa Jackson, a former manager of . Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, owned by the chef with her . brother Bubba Hiers. Replaced: Deen has replaced Savannah-based firm Oliver Maner with Grace Speights, (left) a Washington, D.C.-based partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Labor and Employment practice. She also fired her longtime agent Barry Weiner (right) It was in a legal deposition connected with the case that Deen admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Since then she has suffered a dramatic fall from grace and her earnings have crumbled following the departure of major sponsors including Target and Walmart. Securing a victory in the upcoming civil action against Jackson will be imperative to rebuilding Deen's public brand. Since the scandal broke, she has been working with reputation expert Judy Smith, the inspiration behind . the Olivia Pope character in ABC's hit drama Scandal. Last week Deen split with longtime agent Barry Weiner, who had helped make her a star. Deen had worked with Weiner for more than a decade. She . has said he was instrumental in getting her show 'Paula's Home Cooking' on the . Food Network in 2002. Scene: Lisa Jackson worked at the restaurant, pictured, in Savannah, Georgia between 2005 and 2010 . 'Paula Deen has separated from her agent,' Deen's spokeswoman, Elana Weiss, . said in a prepared statement. 'She and her family thank him for the tireless effort . and dedication over the many years.' After the N-word scandal, the Food Network passed on renewing Deen's contract and yanked her shows off . the air. Smithfield Foods, the pork producer that paid Deen as a celebrity . endorser, dropped her soon after. Retailers including Walmart and Target quickly announced that they would no longer sell Deen's products and publisher Ballantine scuttled plans . for an upcoming cookbook even when it was the No. 1 seller on Amazon. Even . the diabetes drug company that made the much-criticized deal to hire Deen as a . paid spokeswoman dumped her. Weiner had worked to turn Deen into a comfort-food queen since she was little . more than a Savannah restaurant owner and self-publisher of cookbooks who earned . raves for her fried chicken. In her book 'Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin,' Deen recalled . meeting Weiner through TV producer Gordon Elliott, who was convinced they could . turn her into a star. 'Barry and Gordon felt like there was a show somewhere inside this Paula . character that could be very successful,' Deen wrote. 'They probably courted . Food Network for two years trying to push me at them.' Deen also noted in her book: 'Barry is affectionately known in my family as . Barry Cuda. Perfect name for an agent.' The chef's business deals began falling apart after she was questioned under oath . in May as part of a civil lawsuit filed last year by Lisa Jackson, a former . manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, which Deen co-owns with her . brother, Bubba Hiers. Jackson says she was sexually harassed and worked in an . environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo. Family: Bubba, left, allegedly made repeated sexual jokes in front of co-workers . Ultimately it was Deen's own words that proved damaging. Asked in her . deposition if she had ever used the N-word, she replied: 'Yes, of course.' That . she also insisted 'it's been a very long time' seemed to matter little to the . companies paying to use her name and image with their products. Neither were . they swayed by Deen's apologies in online videos and in person with the 'Today' show's Matt Lauer. Forbes magazine last year ranked Deen as the fourth-highest-earning celebrity . chef last year, figuring she had hauled in $17 million. Her company Paula Deen . Enterprises generates total annual revenue of nearly $100 million, according to . Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource . Group. Deen cast no blame in her statement announcing her split with Weiner. It . ended by saying, 'Paula wishes him well in all future endeavors.'","Fans of Paula Deen are sending butter wrappers to the companies who dropped her as a protest .

Sir David Nicholson should step down immediately for ‘misleading’ parliament about the scandal  surrounding gagging clauses, MPs said yesterday. The outgoing chief executive of the NHS was grilled yesterday about revelations that at least 52 staff have been silenced by law and handed £2million in secret severance payments. Unlike other payoffs to gag health workers – of which hundreds have been handed out in recent years – the so-called judicial mediation deals were agreed by hospital trusts without Treasury or Department of Health scrutiny. One for £500,000 was handed to whistleblower Gary Walker, the former head of United Lincolnshire Hospital NHS Trust, where hundreds of patients are feared to have died. He broke his silence earlier this year to tell of ‘dangerous’ conditions and a bullying management culture. In a combative session of the public accounts committee yesterday, MPs challenged Sir David’s claim three months ago that he thought Mr Walker was an isolated case. The NHS boss admitted he had not checked how many had been handed out since he was ordered to by Parliament three months ago. ‘I didn’t... maybe I should have,’ he said. Requests for data under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that at least 52 payoff deals were agreed at 38 hospitals in England. Dozens more hospitals did not reply. But the embattled health service boss, who has already agreed to step down from his £210,000-a-year job next year following the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly, denied there had been a ‘cover up’. Sir David accepted the use of gagging clauses was ‘not acceptable’. He admitted their use was ‘widespread’ in the health service and the private sector and said they did not all apply to people raising safety concerns. In a rambling defence to MPs, he claimed he had always tried to support whistleblowers in the NHS and said: ‘I can absolutely refute that I have ever been involved in any kind of cover-up in relation to the expenditure that’s identified. ‘I have been absolutely honest and truthful with this committee... I have always supported people who have stood out against the system.’ Gary Walker, former chief executive of the United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust, was paid £500,000 to go quietly . Sir David tried to blame the . Treasury, saying it had told the NHS by letter in 2011 that no approval . was needed for payoffs under so-called judicial mediation. A hapless Treasury official then hold . how ‘there was confusion as to what judicial mediation meant’ in his . department and they ‘did not understand it’. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the . committee, said she was ‘gobsmacked’ that the payments were agreed with . no scrutiny. She said Sir David’s failure to disclose how many had been . made was ‘impertinent’. Northampton General Hospital paid a total of £145,000 to two whistleblowers . MP Steve Barclay, whose Freedom of . Information request uncovered the figures, revealed that between 2008 . and 2011 there were 598 ‘special severance payments’ costing . £14.7million – not including the 52 judicial mediation payments. They include two consultants at . Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals, who were paid £300,000 and . £265,000 respectively in February – a month before Sir David assured MPs . Mr Walker was an isolated case. Mr Barclay, Tory member for North . East Cambridgeshire, said it ‘stretches credulity’ that Sir David did . not know about the payments and called for him to step down now. ‘He . should have immediately sought to investigate,’ he said. ‘It is a clear conflict of interest . for a hospital, where a member of staff has raised concerns, to use . taxpayers money to pay people off with no external scrutiny. ‘That does not include payments while they were suspended and potentially massive legal fees, so it’s the tip of the iceberg. ‘When asked to investigate, Sir David agreed to do so as soon as possible and failed to. Either he didn’t know when he should have or he’s misled parliament. I . think he should do the honourable thing now and step down.’ Sir David was accused in Parliament earlier this year of presiding over a ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ culture in the NHS. He claimed he had ‘no idea’ about the . unfolding disaster in Mid Staffordshire, ‘no access’ to published . statistics revealing high death rates and did not know the extent of . gagging orders. Articles . in June about secret severance payments to NHS staff said that two . consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS . Foundation Trust were paid ‘hush money’. We are happy to clarify that . while the consultants in question were paid £300,000 and £265000, they . were not asked to sign gagging orders and continue to work for the . trust.","NHS chief executive insists he did not try to disguise scale of contracts .

The two New York City police officers who posed for a photograph with a topless model on the street are facing an internal investigation, it has emerged. Model Cheyenne Lutek, 19, was photographed with the officers on Sunday, a week after she exposed her bare breasts at Verso Restaurant in Alphabet City while astounded patrons looked on. After she was told to cover up by staff, the glamorous blonde upped the ante by taking the X-rated stunt on to the streets of Manhattan and posing with the officers near their Housing Bureau station. Law and order: Cheyenne Lutek poses half-naked with two grinning NYPD cops. It is entirely legal for women to appear in New York City streets partially nude but the officers are now under investigation . Photographer Allen Henson told the New .

After . snapping the shot, Henson tweeted: 'A nice stroll on a New York Summer . evening. With @Cheyenne_Lutek and a couple of NYC's finest boys in . blue.'

This unidentified woman walked into a restaurant, sat down clothed, then too her shirt off while a man snapped photos . In May, the New York City Police Department released an official memo cited by The New York Times . informing all police officers that it is not illegal for women to walk . around the city shirtless, and that they should not be cited for public . lewdness or indecent exposure. The . order given to the city’s 34,000 cops stems from a 1992 New York State . Court of Appeals, which states that baring one's chest in public is . legal for a woman as it is for a man. Miss Lutek and Mr Henson hit a trendy Italian restaurant last weekend where the photographer pulled out his camera and proceeded to snap pictures of the X-rated scene. Verso's owner Labinot Baraliu rushed over the table and demanded that the half-naked woman put her clothes back on. Hot spot: The owner of Verso restaurant in Alphabet City promptly rushed over and asked the woman to put her shirt back on, but she protested she had the law on her side . In response, Miss Lutek insisted that it was 'perfectly legal' to go topless in the restaurant. 'In 15 years [in the restaurant business] I've seen all kinds of things, but not this,' Baraliu explained to the East Village blog EV Grieve. 'It was funny, but at the same time I was like ""WTF - is this really happening?""' After exchanging a few words with the owner, the couple were escorted out of the bistro.

Loyal: Michelle Perra became a qualified life coach to help sex addicts - after supporting her own husband get over his addiction to porn and prostitutes. The couple pose together happily last year . After discovering her husband was addicted to porn and prostitutes, Michelle Perra had every right to end the marriage. She was devastated after husband Craig confessed to cheating on her with a stripper and eight call girls. But instead of leaving the love of her life, she decided to support him get over his addiction - and became a qualified life coach to help other sex addicts. The mother-of-two says it not only made their marriage stronger - it inspired her to help other women in her position. Now she and former lawyer Craig, 42, are both qualified sex and porn addiction coaches and counsel addicts through their company Feed The Right Wolf. Mrs Perra, from Sacramento, California, said: 'Some people don't understand why I took Craig back but they don't see the side of him that I do. 'He is an amazing husband and father but when his addiction took hold he became someone else. 'I had vowed to stick by him when I married him and that's what I did. 'After everything we've been through I'm still sure that he's the man I'm meant to be with for the rest of my life.' Mr Perra, who was molested as a child, was secretly logging on to porn websites at home several times a day and visiting strip clubs after work just months after marrying Michele in 1998. But his addiction escalated and by 2011 he was paying for sex up to four times a week, spending thousands of dollars on prostitutes, strip clubs and porn. And, at its worse, he would disappear from the family home he shared with his wife and their two children for cheap one-night stands. Mr Perra said: 'It was a dark ugly time. I was hurting the ones I love, Michelle and the kids. I had no love for myself and none to give. Happy: This image shows Michelle and Craig Perra on their wedding day in 1998 . Ordeal: Michelle stuck by her 37-year-old husband after he cheated on her with a stripper and eight call girls. They are pictured on their wedding day . 'The turning point came when I realised I was ruining my life and hurting Michelle. It hit me that this was completely unacceptable and I had to stop.' After a bender which lasted two months, Mr Perra finally broke down and confessed everything. Mrs Perra said: 'I spent hours crying at night, wondering why I wasn't good enough for my husband. 'It was devastating but I saw Craig was broken man and I wanted to help him for the kids' sakes. 'I helped him to find a therapist and very slowly we built up our trust again.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been described as 'distrusting, confused, emotional and desperate' as he sweats on the verdict of his application for temporary asylum to Russia. That is the verdict of a handwriting expert who has anaylsed the 30-year-old's official handwritten request exclusively for the MailOnline. Believing Snowden to tired, 'drained' paranoid and low on confidence and options, expert Linda Lauren feels that Snowden has a 'lack of understanding of the big picture and his role in it.' And on the former technical contractor's intelligence, the MailOnline's dissection of his writing reveals him to 'not as intellectual as he is analytical'. Scroll down for video . Script: In this image made from video provided by RTR TV on Wednesday, July 17th, 2013, is Edward Snowden's handwritten application for asylum to Russia . Psychic profiler and handwriting expert Lauren was provided with a picture of Snowden's July 15th application to Russia, which he filed three weeks after arriving at a Moscow airport from Hong Kong. Over those past few weeks he has been holed up trying to avoid prosecution in the United States on espionage charges. 'This signature is indicative of someone who is insecure and quiet, yet calculated. He keeps things close to him and is not as intellectual as he is analytical. This is the hand of someone who is distrusting, confused, emotional and desperate.  I intuit the handwriting to belong to someone with little options and a lack of understanding of the big picture and his role in it.  He is extremely drained and his confidence is low, exuding high emotion.  It's the writing of someone who will not be able to compromise with his own two opposing personalities.' Snowden is seeking refuge in Latin America after leaking details of U.S. government surveillance programmes, but has not risked taking any flight that might be intercepted by the United States since flying to Russia from Hong Kong on June 23. Russia's state RIA Novosti news agency quoted lawyer Anatoly Kucherena as saying that Snowden submitted the asylum request to Russia's Federal Migration Service. The service had no immediate comment. The lawyer said Snowden made the move to request temporary asylum after a meeting at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. 'He reached the conclusion that he needs to write an application for . temporary asylum (in Russia), and this procedure has just been done,' Anatoly Kucherena, a lawyer who met Snowden on Friday along with human . rights activists. 'For now he is not going to go anywhere. For now he plans to stay in . Russia,' he said, adding that if Snowden were granted temporary asylum, . he should have the same rights as other citizens and be free to work and . travel in Russia. The asylum application could end his . time in limbo but risks deepening tension between the United States and . Russia, which has refused to expel him to his homeland for prosecution. Seeking temporary asylum: Former NSA employee Edward Snowden, pictured centre during a press conference he gave in Sheremetyevo airport, Moscow, on Friday, has applied for temporary asylum in Russia . Stop off: Edward Snowden, pictured on Friday, said he would only stay in Russia until he can safely reach one of the Latin American countries ready to give him political asylum . The head of Russia's Federal Migration Service (FMS) confirmed the . agency had received Snowden's application. Anti-secrecy group Wikileaks, . which has been helping Snowden, said on Twitter that he had applied for 'a temporary protection visa'. Snowden, 30, is trapped in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, an area between the runway and passport control which Russia regards as neutral territory. Decision: Officials have said the decision will be made by Russia's Federal Migration Service - not by President Vladimir Putin, pictured yesterday during his visit to the island of Gogland 110 miles west of St Petersburg . Relations: Russian President Putin has invited President Barack Obama, pictured, to a summit in Moscow in September and said he does not want Snowden to harm already strained relations with Washington . He said on Friday he would seek refuge in Russia only until he can travel to one of the three Latin American countries ready to give him political asylum - Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua. He said the United States and its allies were preventing him from reaching those countries. Washington has revoked Snowden's passport and urged other nations not to help him reach an asylum destination. Kucherena said he expected a decision on Snowden's asylum request 'soon', though the Federal Migration Service has up to three months to decide on the application. The process for seeking temporary asylum is different from that for political asylum, which Kucherena said would require a decree from President Vladimir Putin. 'If we are talking about temporary asylum, then this is an issue not for the president but for the Federal Migration Service,' Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Stranded: Mr Snowden arrived at Sheremetyevo airport on June 23 and has remained in the transit lounge ever since . Source: Lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, pictured outside Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow, has revealed Snowden applied for temporary asylum . Putin has rejected repeated U.S. calls . to send Snowden to the United States, but has said he does not want the . fugitive to harm already strained relations with Washington. Mr Putin yesterday described Snowden's arrival as an unwelcome present foisted on Russia by the United States. He said Snowden flew to Moscow intending only to travel on to another country, but the U.S. intimidated other countries into refusing to accept him, effectively blocking the fugitive from flying further. Snowden previously sought Russian asylum, which Mr Putin said would be granted only if he agreed not to leak more information. Snowden then withdrew the bid, the Kremlin said. During Friday's meeting in Sheremetyevo's transit zone, Snowden argued that he had not hurt U.S. interests in the past and has no intention of doing that. Mr Putin did not say if that would be sufficient grounds for asylum, adding that Snowden apparently did not want to stay in Russia permanently. Wanted: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, an analyst with a U.S. defence contractor, is wanted in the United States on espionage charges . Snowden is useful as a propaganda tool for Putin, who accuses the U.S. government of preaching to the world about rights and freedoms it does not uphold at home. But Putin has invited President Barack Obama for a summit in Moscow in September and both countries have signalled they want to improve ties. Putin has said twice that Snowden must stop all activities 'aimed at harming our American partners' if he wants political asylum in Russia, but he has not made clear whether the condition applies to temporary asylum as well. Temporary asylum is granted by the FMS, but Putin would be expected to make the final decision himself, even though he has tried to distance himself from Snowden's predicament. Putin said on Monday he hoped Snowden would leave as soon as he could, but left the door open for granting him asylum, saying there were signs the American fugitive was moving towards meeting the conditions he has set. Temporary asylum can be granted for up to a year, with the possibility of extension. Attack: U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns (left) criticised China for failing to extradite Mr Snowden when he was in Hong Kong following two days of high-level talks between the US and China on security and the economy .

Over 40 people in four north Texas counties have become ill after falling victim to the food-borne Cyclospora parasite, leaving them with a myriad of symptoms that can last for months if untreated. Infections have risen steadily in the state over the past few years, according to reports. Health officials have told local media they believe the parasite has been caught by people eating fresh produce. Dangerous: Raw fruits and vegetables with Cyclospora droppings are giving north Texans 'explosive bowel movements' Explaining that the parasite is endemic to tropical or sub-tropical fruit, Dr. Peggy White, chief epidemiologist for Collin County (TX.), told the Dallas Morning News that ‘it could be coming in from fruit that was brought in from a tropical or subtropical region.’ Transmitted through raw fruit and vegetables, the cyclospora parasite causes serious gastrointestinal discomfort including ‘watery diarrhea, frequent and sometimes explosive bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, and bloating, according to the paper. If infected, the problem is treated with antibiotics. Exposed: Cyclospora, which have caused hundreds of people to become sick across the midwest, are shown here under two different microscopes .

Sausage factory: Nick Clegg defended schools reforms plans against claims pupils were being over-tested . Nick Clegg has defended plans for tougher tests for young pupils, insisting he did not want primary schools to become 'exam sausage factories'. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted it was right for children's academic ability to be tested as soon as they start primary school aged four or five. Under the shake-up 11-year-olds face being ranked against their peers across the country to better prepare children for secondary school. Unions warned of a 'bureaucratic nightmare' for teachers who would spend their time 'drilling' pupils to pass exams. But Mr Clegg insisted: 'I don’t want my children to become part of some exam sausage factory - far from it.' He said too many primary schools see pupils leave having already fallen behind their peers. He added: 'All we’re . saying is it can’t surely be right that under the current standards a . school is deemed to be doing okay if four out of ten of the children who . leave primary school are judged not to be ready to have a good start at . secondary school. 'This is . not to try and either humiliate or celebrate, it’s to give teachers and . parents an idea of how that child measures up to other children in the . school system. That’s all it is. 'I . saw some comments from teaching unions this morning that somehow this . was a lurch back to a name-and-shame approach, it’s not at all. 'So . it’s higher standards, more money, and the aspiration, the hope is . simply to make sure everybody gets the best possible start in life.' The changes would see primaries having to . ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school or risk . triggering an Ofsted inspection. Pupils . could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put . in 10 per cent achievement ‘bands’, showing, for example, if they are in . the top 10 per cent. The consultation document contains a reference to a ‘new benchmark’ to assess ‘progress that has been made by 11-year-olds’. It . says the ‘baseline’ test ‘could be at age seven, as now, where teachers . assess pupils; or a simple check of a child’s ability in the early . weeks of a child’s career at school’. Pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put in achievement 'bands' But teaching unions were critical of the plan, warning over-testing could be counter-productive. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said: 'The Government has a fondness for testing young children in the belief that the tests create reliable measures of performance. They don't. 'And, by relying only on what can be measured, they risk missing what matters. There is far more to being 'secondary ready' than a score on an hour's test. A teacher's judgment, built up over four years, has much to contribute.' Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said: 'It is difficult to see how a 25 p increase in the primary floor standard between 2010 and 2016 could be realistically achieved without wide-scale teaching to the test and other inappropriate drilling techniques.' Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'School level assessments are fine in principle but in the context of current high stakes accountability, with no framework for support or provision of resources, the outcome is likely be a bureaucratic nightmare for teachers which could undermine high standards.' Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested last month that children should be tested in basic language and literacy even before they start formal education. He warned testing pupils at the end of their reception year was already too late, adding: ‘Children may have lost a vital year of learning by then.’ Currently just 60 per cent of 11-year-olds in a school are required to reach Level 4 in maths and English Sats – the standard expected of their age group. Schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by Mr Clegg yesterday could be judged to be under-performing. They could be taken over and turned into academies. Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw has called for children to be tested n basic language and literacy even before they start school . The current marking system will also be axed, although its replacement has not been confirmed. The point at which children are judged to be on track to start secondary school will also be raised. At present, achieving Level 4C – the bottom third of the Level 4 pass range – is considered acceptable. Yet just 47 per cent of these children go on to get five good GCSEs, including maths and English. Mr Clegg confirmed the pupil premium – extra funding for disadvantaged pupils – is to increase from £900 to £1,300 in primary schools from next year to help improve standards. Around one in seven pupils qualify for the financial support. Critics have previously voiced concerns about pupils spending too much time preparing for tests instead of  learning at school. After taking national tests at seven, they sit more Sats in maths, English and science when they are 11. Some take their first GCSEs the following year and complete them when they are 16, making four sets of exams in ten years. AS-levels and A-levels bring the total to six in 12 years. Mr Clegg’s planned test would make it seven in 12 years.","Testing at aged seven could be moved to first year of school .

Halloran told the former agent Bulger . or his partner, Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, would probably kill him . if they found out he was cooperating, Montanari said. 'He . said that if Bulger or Flemmi had any indication that he was . cooperating with the FBI that they would go to any extreme, even if it . meant killing innocent bystanders, including his family,' Montanari . said. Bulger is charged with . opening fire on a car Halloran was in a few months after he turned . informant. Halloran and Michael Donahue, an acquaintance who had offered . him a ride home, were killed. Bulger, . 83, has pleaded not guilty to participating in 19 killings during the . 1970s and '80s while he allegedly led the Winter Hill Gang. He . has also denied prosecutors' assertions that he was a longtime FBI . informant who ratted on the rival New England Mafia and other criminals. Murdered: Edward Brian Halloran reached out to the FBI in 1981 about a murder Whitey Bulger had been involved in. By 1982 he was shot dead as he was being driven home by a friend . Montanari . said Halloran was a 'mid-level strong-arm type' who acted as an . enforcer for the gang. He said Halloran reached out to the FBI at the . end of 1981 about Wheeler's death. The FBI made arrangements for Halloran and his family to live in a rented house on Cape Cod to protect him, Montanari said. He . said the FBI believed if Halloran abided by the guidelines given to . him, including that he not go to Boston, 'we felt this would be . sufficient security for him.' Montanari . said he and another agent met with Halloran dozens of times over a . period of two to three months, and he told them about various crimes he . said were committed by Bulger, Flemmi, hit man John Martorano and . others. Halloran had agreed . to wear a recording device to capture conversations he had with a Bulger . associate who played a role in the Wheeler killing, Montanari said. Partners: James 'Whitey' Bulger, left, walking with his former right hand man, Kevin Weeks. Weeks took the witness stand at Bulger's racketeering trial and described double killings, multiple extortions and drug dealing . Prosecutors . say Bugler learned of Halloran's cooperation through former FBI agent . John Connolly, who was Bulger's handler while he was an FBI informant. Halloran was gunned down in May 1982, near a restaurant in South Boston. Montanari . said the FBI told Halloran before his death that they were closing him . as an informant because he would not take a lie detector test and was . waffling on whether to go into the witness protection program. In . other testimony Monday, Martorano's former girlfriend, Patricia . Carlson, described living with Martorano while he was on the run after . he was indicted in the late 1970s. Partners in crime: A number of former drug dealers have come forward to explain how Bulger banned them from selling drugs in South Boston. Here James 'Whitey' Bulger (left) is shown with Kevin Weeks . Carlson, . who was then Patricia Lytle, said she began dating Martorano when she . was 15 and he was 35. She said one day he asked her if she wanted to go . to Florida for a vacation. 'We ended up staying there 20 years,' she . said. They had a son together, James Stephen, now 27. Martorano testified earlier that his son was named after Bulger and Flemmi. Carlson . described a series of cash payments she received from Bulger's gang, . including a $10,000 payment that was left at her mother's house in July . 1996 after Martorano was arrested. She also testified that she told numerous lies when she appeared before a federal grand jury in 1995. 'I . was worried that I was going to cause more problems for Johnny. I was . concerned with what was going to happen with my 8-year-old boy, and . Johnny told me to lie,' she said. Carlson . said she only recently admitted she lied after she spoke to her . attorney and he told her that the statute of limitations for perjury had . expired. Under . cross-examination by Bulger attorney Hank Brennan, Carlson said that up . until last month, the government had not contacted her since her 1995 . grand jury testimony to provide information about Martorano's illegal . activities. In other . testimony, Dr. Richard Evans, the retired chief medical examiner for . Massachusetts, reviewed reports in all 19 killings and listed the cause . of death for each one. He said most of the victims had multiple gunshot . wounds.","Trial is now in its sixth week of testimony .

A witness told deputies, according to a sheriff's office report obtained by the Orlando Sentinel: 'When the victim fell and hit the concrete... she could hear the victim's head hit the concrete three car lengths away.' Soon after, a doctor and his wife, a registered EMT, arrived at the restaurant for dinner and when they saw the man laying motionless in the parking lot, rushed to help the victim. The couple began performing CPR on the older Harris who had stopped breathing and lost his pulse. A Fire Rescue crew arrived moments later and managed to resuscitate him before he was transported to Dr. Phillips Hospital and later to Orlando Regional Medical Center. He was then flown back to Mississippi for further treatment. Restaurant: The son stormed away from the table at Dave & Buster's, pictured .

The families of dozens of dead children whose names were stolen for use in undercover missions will never be told, police revealed yesterday. The ‘Day of the Jackal’ deception was branded ‘morally repugnant’ by one chief constable who said Scotland Yard hijacked the identities of up to 61 children. In a disturbing twist, the review revealed that a secret 2002 inquiry discovered 1,200 passport applications for dead children had been made. Revelations: The review said that the use of dead children's identities was common practice among police forces and security agencies . The high number could mean that criminals, as well as police and spy agencies, were also using the tactic to forge new lives. Chief constable Mick Creedon apologised to families who have complained but said they would never know for certain if their children's identities were used . Mick Creedon apologised to grieving . relatives but said they can never know for certain because of the risk . to the lives of former spies if they are ‘outed’. The Derbyshire Chief Constable admitted the . controversial practice was probably far more widespread and was . sanctioned at the ‘highest level’. Unveiling his report into the . scandal, Mr Creedon said it was commonplace among highly secretive . police units for at least 35 years. He said: ‘The people working from 1968 onwards were doing so in a very different environment and times. ‘They made the operational decision to use this tactic because it was necessary to protect their operatives. ‘Some of those deployments were at . the top end and extremely sensitive. Undercover officers in the UK have . been subjected to serious harm and beatings. ‘Overseas, officers from other . agencies have been murdered. If they are going to go into groups of this . calibre you have got to give them the backstop of cover. ‘It is not some kind of salacious and . immoral use of identities - it was seen at the time as operationally . necessary and justified.’ Revelations that police stole the . identities of dead children to help them infiltrate criminal gangs and . protest groups provoked outrage two years ago. A way in: Dead children's identities were used by undercover offices to infiltrate violent gangs and demonstration groups . Scotland Yard announced an . independent review would take place to examine the scale of the tactic . and whether it was unlawful. It discovered that the names of at least 42 . children who died between the ages of four and eight were stolen up . until 2003. The provenance of a further 19 . identities remains under investigation and the total figure is likely to . be far higher as the tactic was also used by other forces and spy . agencies. Between 1968 and 2008 a total of 106 . false identities were created, of which 45 were entirely fictitious. Police now use different methods to create fake personas. The report examined tactics by . members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) and the National Public . Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU). The SDS was created in 1968 in . response to violent protests against the Vietnam War and went on to . investigate animal rights protesters and other extremist groups. Mr Creedon said hand-picked officers . developed their own tactics, recording their best ideas in an informal . book known as the ‘Trade Craft Manual’. He said their work was conducted amid . conditions of ‘extreme secrecy’ and was given the green light at the . ‘highest levels’ of Government and policing. Apology: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said sorry for the 'shock and offence' caused . The units were directly funded by the . Home Office because of thirst for intelligence among top politicians . about the activities of dissident groups. Speaking about his experience, one . former head of Special Branch said: ‘It was for Queen and country and . peace and democracy. It was the way it was done.’ Police were inspired by the film, The Day of the Jackal . Families who suspected their . children’s names may have been used by police reacted with anger to the . police decision to keep their activities secret. Lawyer Jules Carey, who represents . Barbara Shaw who fears her son Rod Richardson’s name was used, said she . feels her concerns have been ‘swept under the carpet’. He said: ‘What we heard was not an . apology but a PR exercise. The families of the dead children whose . identities have been stolen by the undercover officers deserve better . than this. ‘They deserve an explanation, a . personal apology and, if appropriate, a warning of the potential risk . they face, in the exceptional circumstances, that their dead child’s . identity was used to infiltrate serious criminal organisations.’ Mrs Shaw and a further 14 families . who suspected the identities of their children may have been used will . receive personal apologies from the Met. The first use of a dead child’s . identity in a spy operation was in 1943 when a corpse carrying false . documents was planted off the coast of Spain to dupe German forces. In 1971 it was popularised by . thriller author Fredrick Forsyth as it became an accepted practice for . undercover officers who chose their own new names from official records. A wider multi-million pound inquiry into a host of allegations against undercover officers may not report for another two years. A series of former Home Secretaries, . Met commissioners and top civil servants face being questioned amid . claims some officers fathered children with their targets. Officials are also investigating . claims the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence were smeared by . police and allegations undercover officers lied on oath. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised for the ‘shock and offence’ caused by the ‘Day of the Jackal’ tactic. He said: ‘I believe the public do . understand the necessity for police and others to do things like this to . protect against a much greater harm. ‘It was never intended or foreseen . that any of the identities used would become public, or that any family . would suffer hurt as a result.’","Met police confirm they will not reveal names of dead children used .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 07:05 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:08 EST, 18 July 2013 . David Cameron and Nick Clegg today stepped up government pressure on Muirfield golf club to end its ban on women members. As the prestigious Open Championship began at the historic course, the Prime Minister condemned policies which 'look more to the past than they do to the future' while his deputy tore into the 'inexplicable' and 'anachronistic' rules. Culture Secretary Maria Miller is boycotting the Open in protest as her Labour opponent Harriet Harman called for male-only clubs to be banned by law. Row: David Cameron and Nick Clegg spoke out against the 'anachronistic' male-only rules which they said belong in the past . Teeing off: The controversy erupted as play got under way at the Open Championship which is being held at Muirfield Golf Club, East Lothian but boycotted by senior ministers . Muirfield, in East Lothian, has been home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers - one of the oldest clubs in the world - since 1891. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, . Culture Secretary Mrs Miller and Sport Minister Hugh Robertson have . all announced they will boycott this week’s golf for its perceived . sexism. However it has faced a storm of controversy in the run-up to the Open because it still refuses to admit women members. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mr Cameron was not attending the Open and 'entirely understands' why Mrs Miller was not going. Asked about all-male clubs, he added: 'The Prime Minister has a great deal of sympathy with the view that exclusive memberships of this sort look more to the past than they do to the future.' Mr Clegg used his LBC 97.3 phone-in . to voice his opposition to the male-only policy: 'I was just dismayed . and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age. 'I find it so out of step with everything else that's happening in the rest of society. 'I think many people will just shake their head and say ""how on earth is this still possible in this day and age?"".' Demand for action: Maria Miller wants further action after the offensive comments were made . However the head of golf's governing body claimed male-only golf clubs are ‘for some . people a way of life that they rather like’. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the . Royal and Ancient, insisted that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs. He said yesterday: ‘I really don’t think that a golf club . that has a policy of being a place where like-minded men or indeed women . go, play golf together and do their thing together, ranks up against . some of these other forms of discrimination. ‘For some people, it is a way of life . they rather like. I don’t think they are intending to do others down. You can dress it up to be a lot more if you want. ‘But if on a Sunday morning the guy, or . the lady, gets out of the marital bed, if you like, and plays golf with . his chums and comes back in the afternoon - that is not on any kind of . par with racial discrimination or anti-Semitism.’ The row comes after Culture Secretary Mrs Miller also delivered an extraordinary attack on the BBC’s sexist sports coverage. In a scathing letter to the director-general Lord Hall, she expressed her anger at presenter John Inverdale’s remarks about Wimbledon singles champion Marion Bartoli. Mrs Miller, who also called for better coverage of women’s sport, demanded updates on ‘further action that is likely to be taken’ over the comments, which prompted hundreds of complaints to the BBC. Earlier this month Inverdale, who is thought to be paid about £600,000 a year, said of Miss Bartoli during coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final: ‘I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe: “Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. ‘“You are never going to be somebody like a [Maria] Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5 feet 11, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that. You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it.” And she kind of is.’ The comments generated more than 700 complaints, and led to demands that Inverdale should be sacked. But the 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final. French tennis player Marion Bartoli, was the subject of Inverdale's comments. The beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance . She told Lord Hall: ‘I am writing to express my concern over the comments made by John Inverdale about Marion Bartoli, during the BBC’s radio coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final.’ She added: ‘It is ... a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the UK’s, and indeed the world’s, sporting calendar. ‘I am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport, and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport, and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience. ‘Whilst I note that Mr Inverdale has . apologised both on-air and in writing to Ms Bartoli, I would be grateful . for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken . following [the] complaints, and whether there may be positive steps that . the BBC could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and . commentary on female athletes, and women’s sport generally, are as . positive and inclusive as possible.’ The 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final . The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. Inverdale . is already set to be replaced as the BBC’s main athletics presenter by a . woman, Gabby Logan, who agreed that his comments on Bartoli ‘wasn’t . appropriate’. The beleaguered Inverdale faced down criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance. In a radio interview with Zara Phillips in 2006, he asked if his studio colleagues could remember the name of the horse Princess Anne rode when she won the European Championship in 1971. When no answer was forthcoming, he suggested: ‘Camilla.’ His latest comments drew a furious response from other sports stars and politicians. Men’s singles champion Andy Murray’s mother Judy described it as a ‘huge gaffe’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has made clear that John Inverdale’s comments were unacceptable and fell well beneath the standards expected of our presenters. ‘John sincerely regrets that he made such an inappropriate statement and for the offence caused. As he said on-air the following day, he has written to Marion Bartoli to apologise and the BBC has also apologised for John’s remarks.’ He added that ‘the BBC has a proud record of supporting women’s sport, with the current coverage of Euro 2013 [the women’s football European Championships] the most recent highlight in a summer of unprecedented coverage’. Of the 16 Euro 2013 matches it will show, 14 will be on BBC Three, with just two on BBC Two. The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten . The spokesman also stressed that the BBC has appointed an ‘editorial lead’ for women’s sport ‘which has helped ensure significantly increased coverage across our daily sporting output’, while the company as a whole ‘is taking steps to clearly communicate to those who work for us what constitutes inappropriate behaviour or language’. A BBC source claimed the Inverdale controversy was a ‘one-off’. However, the outrage following the Bartoli comments does not mark the first time the BBC’s sports coverage has been criticised due to sexism. Jacqui Oatley, who became Match of the Day’s first woman commentator in 2007, said she had a ‘very difficult time’ due to outdated attitudes. ‘Mentally it was a huge  challenge. I didn’t enjoy it for a second, I can’t pretend I did,’ she said. The BBC also drew criticism when no women made the ten-strong shortlist for the Sports Personality of the Year award in 2011. In the row over Muirfield’s men-only policy, Mrs Miller is to be joined in her boycott of the Open by sports minister Hugh Robertson and Alex Salmond. Last weekend Mrs Miller accused golf of turning a blind eye to sexism, saying: ‘The Open Championship is the biggest tournament in golf and it sends out completely the wrong message for it to be held at clubs that don’t allow women members. ‘Sport’s governing bodies should be doing all they can to promote equality and address the sexism that still exists in some quarters, not turning a blind eye to it.’","Prime Minister leads chorus of disapproval at ban on women members .

"By . James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 16:41 EST, 30 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:18 EST, 1 July 2013 . Like many a National Lottery winner before him, David Ashcroft pledged that his £12.3million jackpot would not change his life. Now, 16 years after that lucky day, it seems he has stuck to his promise – and has spent hardly any of his winnings. Mr Ashcroft, 46, still works as a furniture restorer and still lives with his elderly parents in the terraced home they shared before his win. Secret millionaire: David Ashcroft cleaned outside his garage, near his home in Liverpool . Unassuming: Neighbours say Mr Ashcroft acts like his win never happened because he is happy with his life . And the only visible sign of substantial spending at the family home is new double glazing. Mr Ashcroft has, of course, spent a little more than that – though no-one would accuse him of going mad. A new work van has been bought as well as a caravan in North Wales and a 4x4 Mitsubishi. The car is thought to have been for his parents. He has also dabbled in the local property market, buying a handful of homes to rent out – although the entire portfolio is worth less than £250,000, according to records at Companies House. Jackpot: Mr Ashcrosft vowed he would not let his 12.3million win in May 2007 change him. The only frivolities he has allowed are personalized number plates . By contrast, a shrewd investor could by now have more than doubled Mr Ashcroft’s original fortune with timely investments in property. Perhaps the only frivolities he has allowed himself – or rather his family – are personalised number plates for his father’s van and a Ferrari, which he gave to a relative. Following his May 1997 win – which back then was the fourth biggest in Lottery history – Mr Ashcroft admitted he had never had a girlfriend or travelled abroad, and said his only passion was fine furniture. After leaving school aged 16, he trained as a cabinet maker and furniture restorer, and despite the huge change in his circumstances, he insisted he had everything he wanted in life. ‘I’m an ordinary, quiet introvert,’ he said at the time. ‘This may change me but I hope not.’ On the subject of romance, he said: ‘Any girlfriends from the past will probably come from my days in kindergarten. Miss Right may be out there. Who knows what fate may bring.’ And it seems Mr Ashcroft continues to resist the temptations of wealth which most of us can only dream about. New windows: David Ashcroft has not moved from the family home he shares with his parents . Recently, he was seen tidying up outside his workshop in an unassuming suburban garage attached to a hairdressing salon, just a few minutes’ walk from his home in Liverpool. Armed with a shovel and wheelie bin and dressed in blue jeans, a checked shirt and sensible black shoes, passers-by would hardly have guessed they were watching one of the wealthiest men in the city. ‘It’s almost as though his Lottery win never happened,’ one neighbour said. ‘Most people would have used a fortune like that to fulfil all their dreams, but evidently David’s perfectly happy as he is.’ At the family home, it is clear it has been treated to a lick of paint recently, as well as hanging baskets to smarten it up, and a satellite dish belies another little luxury. His parents, Roy, 76, and Jean, 74, arrived at the house in their six-year-old Mitsubishi. When asked whether her son had ever embraced a millionaire lifestyle, Mrs Ashcroft replied: ‘He’s not gone anywhere.’ However, she declined to discuss whether he had finally found his Miss Right. Mr Ashcroft is not the only lottery winner to try to hold on to their old life. Mary Jones, from Bala in North Wales, scooped £9.3million in 2004 aged 62 but carried on working as a cleaner at an activity centre.","David Ashcroft, 46, still works as furniture restorer and lives with his parents .

Just days after Paul Ryan was forced into a humiliating U-turn after falsely claiming that he once ran a marathon in under three hours, questions are now being asked about the vice-presidential candidate's claim to be a prolific mountain climber. Mitt Romney's running mate told his hometown newspaper that he had scaled 'close to 40' of Colorado's 54 'fourteeners' mountains, each of which is at least 14,000ft tall. Although Mr Ryan made this claim three years ago, it is now under scrutiny after he admitted on Saturday that he hasn't run a marathon in under three hours, as he had boasted last month on a radio show broadcast across the U.S. Exaggerating? Paul Ryan, pictured on the campaign trail in Adel, Iowa, yesterday, claimed he has scaled 'close to 40' of Colorado's 'fourteeners' range of 54 peaks . Popular with climbers: Colorado's 'fourteeners' mountain range contains 54 peaks which are all at least 14,000ft tall . The conservative Wisconsin congressman was forced to admit that he misstated his time by more than an hour. It turns out he actually took more than four hours to finish the marathon and not under three, as he had said. Now experienced climbers are pouring doubt on Mr Ryan's mountain claims, reports TheAtlantic.com. One expert at climbing website SuperTopo said: 'To have climbed 40 and not be a resident [in Colorado] means that you would have had to devote entire summers to climbing fourteeners, in essence becoming a 'lifestyle' hiker/scrambler. 'I doubt Ryan had the time or dedication to fourteeners to take the required time out from his political career. 'Even if you did four a summer, that would be ten summers devoted to travelling to Colorado for the purpose of high altitude hiking. Even if you live here and can drive to the trail heads, forty is a huge commitment of time and energy.' Athletic: The scepticism comes days after Mr Ryan admitted he actually ran a marathon in over four hours and not in under three, as he claimed last month . The climber added: 'Why does it . matter that Paul Ryan -as seems likely in light of his marathon . fabrication - is not a 'mountain man' and is lying about his fourteener . record? 'Because there is . no better index of character. It tells of someone's desperation to . connect to the voters of a swing state, his ability to make stuff up . without conscience, and ruthless ambition to obtain power through any . means. 'It also indicates his contempt for the citizens of Colorado. He apparently believes that Colorado voters are clueless and that the press is a lapdog that has lost any ability to check facts. 'Dedicated hikers, scramblers, climbers, hunters, fishermen and other aficionados of the Colorado high peaks do not need to exaggerate their visceral connection to the Colorado high country and need not apply to become a faux mountain man, like Paul Ryan.'] . Mr Ryan admitted his actual marathon . time after Runner's World magazine unearthed evidence he had completed a . single marathon in 1990, and finished in just over four hours. That time stands in stark contrast to what he had previously said, when he proudly bragged to radio host Hugh Hewitt that he had run a 'two hour and fifty-something' marathon. That would make for a pace of less . than seven minutes per mile for the 26.2 mile course - a blazing speed . for recreational runners. 'Under . three, high twos. I had a two hour and fifty-something,' Mr Ryan . reportedly told Mr Hewitt, to which the shocked radio-man expressed . reportedly exclaimed, 'Holy smokes.' 'I was fast when I was younger, yeah,' Mitt Romney's running mate quipped in reply. The . Ryan campaign told Runner’s World magazine that the House Budget . Chairman ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old. That was the . Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. The running magazine reports . he finished in four hours, one minute, and 25 seconds. It turns out Ryan is slower than Sarah Palin, but faster than Al Gore. In the running: Republican vice president nominee with presidential nominee Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Working the room: Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan shaking hands and high fiving supporters . Mrs Palin reportedly has a best time of 3:59; John Edwards has run 3:30; George W Bush has run 3:44; while Mr Gore trails the vice presidential bunch with a 4:58. A spokesman for the Romney/Ryan campaign contacted TheAtlantic.com to defend the vice-presidential candidate's comments on his experience of climbing in Colorado. Brandon Buck said: 'We're not sure where this started, but he's not said 40 different peaks, it's nearly 40 climbs - with a number of peaks climbed more than once. 'He's been doing them for more than 20 years. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article from  2009 doesn't say 40 separate summits, but instead : . 'He is fairly careful about what he eats, performs an intense cross-training routine known as P90X most mornings, and has made close to 40 climbs of Colorado's fourteeners.' A 'fourteener' is a term unique to mountaineers in the U.S. It refers to a mountain peak that is more than 14,000ft above sea level, of which there are 53 in Colorado, known as the Colorado Fourteeners. The tallest is Mount Elbert, which is part of the Sawatch Range and stands at 14,440ft tall. In 53rd place is Sunshine Peak, which is part of the San Juan Mountains range and is 14,009ft tall. Other popular fourteeners include the 14,110ft tall Pikes Peak, which inspired the poem 'America the Beautiful' and 14,255ft tall Longs Peak, which resides inside Rocky Mountain National Park.

ITV has ducked a head-to-head news battle during Baroness Thatcher's funeral by choosing to pit Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby against David Dimbleby. The BBC will run a three-hour special from a studio overlooking St Paul's Cathedral this Wednesday but ITV still plan to run Daybreak and This Morning, cutting away to events as they happen. ITV bosses have shown faith in the This Morning team after a series of scandals in recent months. Head to head: The BBC has chosen to have a three-hour special hosted by David Dimbleby but ITV will cut to and from Phllip Schofield and Holly Willoughby's This Morning during Baroness Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday . In November Mr Schofield and ITV today agreed to pay Lord McAlpine £125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to David Cameron which contained his name. Will you be watching Baroness Thatcher's funeral on BBC or ITV? Tory peer Lord McAlpine was subjected to lurid online claims falsely linking him to sexual abuse at a north Wales care home which Schofield attempted to bring to the Prime Minister's attention live on This Morning. McAlpine's lawyer Andrew Reid said the incident has 'embarrassed the Prime Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client'. Three months later they were forced to make another grovelling on-air apology after pictures showing the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in her bikini were shown to millions of viewers. Map: This is the route Lady Thatcher's coffin will take to the doors of St Paul's, which will be watched by millions in Britain next Wednesday . 'Misjudged camera angle': The extraordinary moment Phillip Schofield handed the list of names to David Cameron which prompted a huge financial settlement . There has also been criticism of Holly Willougby's abilities as a presenter, which will be tested during the Iron Lady's final journey. Criticism: Agent Jon Roseman, who represented Jill Dando and Natasha Kaplinsky, questioned Holly Willoughby's abilities as a presenter this week . Super-agent Jon Roseman, who represented Jill Dando, Anne Diamond, Natasha Kaplinsky and Fern Britton described her as a 'bimbo' this week. 'Just in case you ever wondered what was so wrong with television today, you need look no further than presenter Holly Willoughby and the news that she is on her way to amassing a £10 million fortune,' he said. 'How has she done it? Not by showing a single flicker of talent, that’s for sure. 'Every word that drops from Holly’s finely formed lips proves just how ill-equipped she is to be a television frontwoman. Indeed, the fact she’s got the job at all, let alone that she’s so well-paid, shows just how far female presenters have sunk today'. 74-year-old Dimbleby has been the mainstay of state occasions for the BBC, covering the funerals of Princess Diana and the Queen . Mother. Lady Thatcher's funeral will be particularly significant for him as . his father Richard commentated on Winston Churchill's in 1965, before . dying himself a year later. He was said to be shocked and upset that Huw Edwards was given the honour of hosting the BBC's royal wedding coverage, ahead of David Dimbleby. Edwards was chosen despite his older rival having been the voice of most state occasions in recent decades. Dimbleby was widely expected to front the broadcast, having covered Princess Diana's funeral and the Queen's golden jubilee, but it was reported that he will have no involvement as he is now seen primarily as a political anchor. ITV and the BBC will both be covering Baroness Thatcher's funeral, but in very different ways. State occasion stalwart David Dimbleby will commentate for the Corporation during a three-hour special from St Paul's while ITV will cut to it during its normal shows, including This Morning presented by Holly Willoughby.

After freely admitting that he fired his weapon, Barton’s tale didn’t sway police. Following his arraingment, Barton said that he was simply following the vice president’s advice. ‘I did what Joe Biden told me to do, I went outside and fired my shotgun in the air,’ he told the station. Barton, of course, was referring to a YouTube town hall meeting in which Vice President Biden said that ‘if you want to protect yourself, get a double-barreled shotgun.’ Self defense: Barton claims he was defending his property from being robbed by firing his shotgun into the air . ‘I said ‘Jill, if there’s ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here … put that double-barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house,’ Biden colorfully added. Authorities have said that there is no evidence to suggest anyone was on Barton’s property, but neighbors told the station there was a loud party involving high school students the night Barton decided to blast away.

Exorbitant: Stephen Kavanagh, currently deputy assistant commissioner in the Met Police, will earn £192,000-a-year when he becomes the new Essex Police Chief Constable . A chief constable is set to earn nearly £200,000-a-year, despite swingeing cuts to police forces across the country. Stephen . Kavanagh, the incoming chief constable in Essex, will rake in £192,000 – . more than ten times the starting salary of a new recruit. He will earn £17,500 more than his predecessor, despite the force having to find £44 million a year in savings, after Whitehall slashed policing budgets by 20 per cent. His salary, £50,000 more than the prime minister, and nearly three times more than the average MP, has provoked strong criticism from taxpayer groups. The TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Such a huge increase in pay for the role is impossible to justify when families struggle to make ends meet and rank and file officers see their pay frozen. ‘This appears to be case of one rule for a fortunate few and a totally different one for everyone else.’ January, Theresa May announced the starting salaries of new constables would be cut from £23,000 to £19,000. But . the Essex Police and Crime Commissioner Nick Alston, who hired Mr . Kavanagh – currently deputy assistant commissioner in the Met Police – . has defended the enormous salary. Cuts: Mr Kavanagh will earn £17,500 more than his predecessor, despite Essex Police having to find £44 million a year in savings, after Whitehall slashed policing budgets by 20 per cent. Pictured is Essex Police HQ in Chelmsford, Essex . ‘During the selection process, Stephen's passion to lead Essex Police for a full four years and to serve the people of Essex was crystal clear,’ said Mr Alston, who was elected to his position in November. ‘We had an outstanding field of candidates, of whom Stephen was the very best. ‘Therefore, I have decided to use the discretion given to me under the legislation to ensure that Stephen is remunerated at the top end of the agreed national range. Savings: Essex Police and Crime commissioner Nick Alston has defended the savings, while Home Secretary Theresa May announced in January that the salary of new police recruits would be dropped to £19,000 . ‘Essex Police is one of the largest employers in Essex, and I find it hard to imagine a more important job than keeping us all safe.’ But if Mr Kavanagh’s salary wasn’t enough, his pay package also includes a housing allowance, which is given to officers who joined the police before September 1994. Under new police pay regulations, signed off by Home Secretary Theresa May, police and crime commissioners are allowed to increase the starting salaries of incoming Chief Constables by up to ten per cent. Mr Alston, acknowledged, however, that the Mr Kavanagh’s salary could rile rank and file officers who have seen their pay frozen and the salaries of newly recruited constables slashed. He added: ‘I'm sure there will be some concerns about it. ‘But what I want to explain to officers is that they need a good leader to take them forward who is interested in their work and is committed to keeping Essex safe.’ Conservative MP Simon Burns, an Essex MP, told the MailOnline: 'I’m disappointed that the salary is not only more than the previous incumbent’s salary but also more than the prime minister of this country. 'In a time of austerity it does seem a little perplexing that the new Chief Constable of Essex should be getting such a generous salary.' Stephen Kavanagh was born in Basildon, Essex, and will join the county’s force from a high profile role in the Metropolitan Police, where he started as a constable in 1985. In 1998, he took on the role of Homicide Senior Investigating Officer for East London, leading on 50 murder investigations. He is currently deputy assistant commissioner in London and he played leading roles in the wake of the 7/7 bombings, the phone hacking probe and the riots in 2011. In the past he has also been in charge of protecting the Royal family and the Palaces of Westminster. He is a real ‘Essex Boy’, who grew up in Clacton, Colchester, Chelmsford and Tolleshunt D'Arcy – all in the county.

Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast was walking near the United Nations yesterday when he was noticed and confronted by the angry mob on Second Avenue near East 48th Street, said NYPD spokesman Paul Browne. The scuffle was captured on video, in which Mehmanparast was called a murderer before chants of 'terrorist' and 'Yeah, you scared s**t run away and go stand next to the police'. The mob also shout: 'Get lost and go back into your hotel… What are you doing in New York you sick criminal?' Scroll down for video . Iranian Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast was escorted from the street near the United Nations headquarters after being involved in a scuffle with a small crowd . Ramin Mehmanparast flagged down police officers, who helped him get to a safe spot. Browne said the threats were believed to have been verbal. The incident followed a speech by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the U.N. General Assembly. Outside the building, thousands of anti-Ahmadinejad demonstrators rallied in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza opposite the world body. Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the U.S. and Israel, said before the General Assembly that there is a 'continued threat by the uncivilised Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation'. Outside, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who ran for president earlier this year, challenged President Barack Obama to take stronger action against Iran as it threatens to become a nuclear power.

The group is a major anti-Ahmadinejad force that was allied with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s.

Lib Dem internal rules say that anyone bringing the party into disrepute is liable to be expelled. Sources said Mr Huhne was told that activating ‘arcane’ party disciplinary procedures to expel him formally could take a long time and it would be better if he quit. News that he had been forced out emerged just as Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg heaped praise on his former Cabinet colleague. Speaking at the party’s Brighton spring conference, he said: ‘Chris was an outstanding constituency MP, a powerful thinker and very effective Secretary of State on the green agenda before he left.’ Addressing a conference fringe meeting, Mr Clegg highlighted the fact Mr Huhne had written two chapters in a new book designed to shape the future of Lib Dem environmental policy. Mr Clegg said: ‘The fact he has contributed on important issues is very good to see and I hope people will register that.’ The party leader has previously said he was ‘shocked and saddened’ at Mr Huhne’s fate.

Assistant Chief Constable Gordon Fraser died after stepping in front of a train . The widow of a police chief will not face trial for allegedly taking his speeding points because she was left to look after their children alone when he committed suicide. Teresa Fraser, herself a detective, had been accused of helping her husband Gordon to escape a penalty for driving too fast by falsely claiming she was at the wheel, in an echo of the Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce case. But Mr Fraser, 48, former Leicestershire assistant chief constable, killed himself last October by stepping in front of a train three days before the couple were due in court. He had also been under investigation over an alleged Florida timeshare fraud. Now the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has dropped the charge of perverting the course of justice against his widow because of her personal situation. A CPS spokesman said: ‘The CPS has considered the case against Teresa Fraser and concluded it would no longer be in the public interest to prosecute. Mr Fraser committed suicide in the run-up to the trial and Mrs Fraser was left with sole responsibility of their three young children. Consideration was given to the welfare of Mrs Fraser and her family in these very difficult circumstances.’ Mrs Fraser, 42, had been accused of ‘falsely accepting responsibility’ for a speeding offence committed by her husband in Scotland in September 2011. Although she no longer faces criminal charges, she remains suspended from West Midlands Police as part of the investigation into the overseas property business run by her late husband. It is claimed he borrowed from US banks to buy holiday homes then offered them for sale to police officers, but the property slump left investors out of pocket.","Former minister's partner Carina Trimingham has quit her party membership .

He said: ‘The earlier part of the season was poor for dolphin sightings because of a bad run of salmon.’ ‘But both the salmon and mackerel numbers have increased rapidly in the last week or so. ‘This has a knock on effect with the amount of dolphins that we see. ‘If the dolphins feed well during the . summer and sustain this, then this will have the females in great . condition for giving birth.

"By . Lucy Osborne . PUBLISHED: . 19:43 EST, 7 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 7 April 2013 . The recent portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge was widely criticised by both critics and the public. And now it seems that when it comes to producing art, the royals might be better off keeping it in the family. A new documentary will reveal how generations of royals, from Mary Queen of Scots through George III and Queen Victoria to the present day, have displayed great artistic talent. The Royal Paintbox, an ITV programme to be broadcast on April 16, recounts how the Queen showed creative promise as a young girl when she made a lino cut of a circus horse. Impressive: The Queen's handiwork, which she signed 'Elizabeth of York' According to her eldest son, the Prince of Wales - who she has always . actively encouraged to paint - Her Majesty created the work when she was . just eight or nine years old. The programme - a slightly longer version of which will be shown in . cinemas - will centre around the Prince of Wales and follow him on a . trip to Scotland where he goes to sketch and paint. It features several of his recent works including Lochnagar Mountain near Balmoral and the snowy Cairngorms. Angelic: A portrait of Princess Elizabeth as an eight-year-old . Charles says his grandmother, the Queen Mother, also encouraged him from a young age 'to look and observe'. Queen Victoria turned to her paint box for comfort after her husband . Albert died in 1861. Interestingly, she often painted people while he . was alive, but only landscapes after he died. Also on the programme, Lady Sarah Chatto, the daughter of Princess . Margaret and a professional painter, discusses her work and shows a . teapot designed by her mother in 1956. 'My mother was very creative and artistic, and my father [Lord Snowdon] . is a photographer, so I think I was in a very creative family . background,' she says. Another insight into the royal family's leisure time was revealed . yesterday when one of the sailors from the Royal Yacht Britannia spoke . out about the time he spent with the Queen. Ellis 'Norrie' Norrell, the longest-serving Britannia crewman who worked . on board for 34 years, told of The Sunday Times about the times he . babysat a young Prince Charles, reprimanded the Princess of Wales, and . had the Queen in fits of laughter with his comedy act. The 79-year-old described the boat as 'somewhere where she would kick her shoes off and relax.' When Charles and Princess Anne were young, one of the sailors would be assigned as a 'Sea Daddy' to look after them. 'We made games and treasure hunts for them so they could play around. They took turns on the wheel of the yacht, steering it like driving a . car,' he said. Years later, a grown-up Charles introduced the first double bed to the yacht for his honeymoon with Diana. 'One night Diana was playing the piano in the lads' bar,' Mr Norell said. Keen on Scotland: The programme follows the Prince of Wales to Scotland where he likes to paint. He is seen here with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William on a recent visit to Dumfries House in Ayrshire . '""Your Royal Highness,"" I said, ""you should not be here. I'm quite happy to escort you back to your quarters.""' Afterwards, the commodore said, 'I was talking to the princess and she said you made her feel like a naughty schoolgirl.' During her 44 years' service, Britannia sailed more than a million miles . and undertook 968 official visits, including the handover of Hong Kong . to China in 1997. The sailors would often entertain the Queen, during the more informal times. 'We used to do concerts for the Queen,' Mr Norrell said. 'We used to . sing the Ovaltinies songs [popular in the 1950s and 1960s] but change . the lyrics. We had the Queen in hysterics.' Britannia was decommissioned in December 1997. The clocks on board are . stopped at 3.01pm, the time the Queen stepped off for the last time and . was reportedly seen to shed a tear. Bob Downie, chief executive of the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, said: . 'In the 1970s, a note went out in the Royal Navy saying sailors should . no longer be referred to by their nicknames, but the Queen asked if she . could carry on calling Norrell 'Norrie'.","Prince Charles shows off new artwork by the Queen entitled 'The Circus'

"By . Tom Leonard and Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 06:42 EST, 18 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:11 EST, 19 April 2012 . Website: The controversial photographs appeared on the LA Times website this morning, sparking condemnation from officials . Nato forces in Afghanistan are braced for a violent backlash after pictures emerged of U.S. soldiers posing with the mangled bodies of enemy bombers. In one photograph, grinning soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division are shown holding up the severed legs of a suicide bomber whose remains they were sent to identify. Others taken several months later show paratroopers in the same platoon posing with the bodies of three insurgents who had accidently blown themselves up with a roadside bomb. Two soldiers are seen holding a corpse’s hand with the middle finger raised while, in another photo, a soldier smirks as the still-attached hand of one of the dead men rests on his shoulder. In another image, a soldier holds his unit’s unofficial badge – which reads ‘Zombie Hunter’ – next to a corpse. The photos, taken in 2010 in the Taliban stronghold of Zabul province, were among 18 passed to the Los Angeles Times by a soldier. The newspaper has published two so far. Its source said he wanted to highlight a breakdown in leadership and discipline among troops engaged in the bloody conflict with the Taliban. The paratroopers’ 3,500-strong brigade lost 35 men during its year-long tour. Nearly all of them were killed by homemade explosives or suicide bombers. The U.S. government condemned the photos, with its ambassador in Kabul, Ryan Crocker, calling the behaviour shown in the pictures ‘morally repugnant’. Leon Panetta, the U.S. defence secretary, promised that those involved would be punished – but also criticised the LA Times for ignoring a request from the Pentagon not to publish the photos. White House Press Secretary: Jay Carney said today that the Obama administration was disappointed with the LA Time's decision to print the pictures two years after the event . A U.S. defence department spokesman said the photos were not representative of its forces, but warned that they had the ‘potential to indict them all in the minds of local Afghans, inciting violence and perhaps causing needless casualties’. He said the U.S. military had taken the ‘necessary precautions to protect our troops in the event of any backlash’. The U.S. commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, General John Allen, said there was a strict policy for the handling of enemy remains that dictates they must be processed as humanely as possible. The pictures, which could also have dangerous repercussions for the 9,500 British servicemen in Afghanistan, mark the latest in a string of scandals that have poisoned U.S.-Afghan relations. 'Foolish behavior': U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta strongly condemned the pictures today after he appeared during a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State in Brussels . White House spokesman Jay Carney says the soldiers' conduct does not represent the standards of the U.S. military and added the president believes the situation needs to be investigated and those responsible should be held accountable. He said the president is also 'disappointed with the decision to publish...two years after the incident'. The LA Times released photographs this morning allegedly depicting U.S. soldiers posing next to the mangled remains of suicide bombers in Afghanistan in 2010. The . paper said it received 18 pictures from a solider with the 82nd . Airborne division - who provided them on condition of anonymity - and . after strong consideration made the decision to print a selection this . morning. The photographs show a number of . paratroopers smiling as they pose with Afghan police next to the severed . legs of one suicide bomber. Another shows the hand of a dead, wide-eyed Afghan man on the shoulder of a grinning U.S. troop. Big news: The front page of the LA Times newspaper showing U.S. troops posing with Afghan remains from Wednesday, April 18, 2012 . Meanwhile Mr Panetta apologised for the photos at a press . conference at the NATO headquarters in Brussels and said he . 'strongly condemns' the behavior displayed, but said that in war, . 'people can make foolish decisions'. He added that he is not excusing the behavior but does not want the incident to bring more harm to U.S. troops in Afghanistan. By way of explanation, Times editor Davan Maharaj explained why the paper ran with the photos: 'After careful consideration, we decided that publishing a small but representative selection of the photos would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the American mission in Afghanistan, including the allegation that the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering U.S. troops.' This decision has been condemned by . officials as it comes at a time when relations between the U.S. and . Afghanistan are particularly sensitive due to a string of damaging and embarrassing episodes which have taken place since the start of the year. According to the Times, the . paratroopers were told to check that Afghan police had recovered the . mangled remains of a suicide bomber in February 2010 and to collect iris scans and . fingerprints for identification. Anger: U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen said he strongly condemns the release of the pictures and said a full investigation is underway . After they arrived at the police . station in Zabol province, they did what was required but took things . one step further - they posed beside the severed legs of the suicide . bomber as two Afghan policemen hold them up for the camera. Months later, the same platoon were . sent to investigate the remains of three insurgents who were said to . have accidentally blown themselves up. The same thing was required from them, collect the identities of the bodies, ensure the remains had been recovered. The platoon was able to obtain some fingerprints from the corpses for a database maintained by U.S. forces. Again the soldiers pose for . photographs, with one holding a dead man's hand with the middle finger . raised. Another soldier leans over the wide-eyed bearded corpse while . clutching the man's hand. Someone placed an unofficial platoon patch reading 'Zombie Hunter' next to other remains and took a picture, according to the Times. Before the pictures were even released, Gen Allen released a statement saying: 'The actions of the individuals photographed do not represent the policies of ISAF or the U.S. Army. This behavior and these images are entirely inconsistent with the values of ISAF and all service members of the fifty ISAF countries serving in Afghanistan. 'We continue to work with our Afghan and international partners to resolve any issues related to improper treatment of remains. This incident is being thoroughly investigated by U.S. national authorities. 'These actions undermine the daily sacrifices of thousands of ISAF troops who continue to serve honorably in Afghanistan. 'We will collaborate with Afghan authorities and carefully examine the facts and circumstances shown in these photos. As part of this process, we will determine responsibility and accountability of those involved.' Past damaging incidents: A video posted online in January claimed to show four Marines urinating on dead bodies in Afghanistan . January incident: One of the men can be heard saying, . 'Have a great day, buddy' as his colleagues laugh and another jokes, . 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!' The solider who provided the pictures tried to explain the actions of the men in his division by saying all of them had friends or comrades who were killed or wounded by homemade bombs or suicide attacks. In the February 2010 mission, the solider said the Afghan police willingly posed with the platoon and the severed legs because the suicide bomber's explosives detonated as he tried to attack a police unit. On the second mission, to the morgue in Qalat a few months later, Afghan police told the platoon that explosives had detonated as three insurgents were preparing a roadside bomb, according to the soldier. He told the paper the men felt 'satisfaction' after learning they were killed by their own explosives. 'They were frustrated, just pissed off, their buddies had been blown up by IEDs. So they sort of just celebrated.' Lt Col Margaret Kageleiry, an Army . spokeswoman, told the LA Times most of the soldiers had been identified . and 'appropriate action' was being taken. In January, a video was released . which showed four U.S. marines urinating on Afghan corpses and in . February, the inadvertent burning of copies of the Koran at a U.S. base . triggered riots that left 30 dead and led to the deaths of six . Americans. In March, a . U.S. Army staff sergeant Robert Bales allegedly went on a nighttime . shooting rampage in two Afghan villages, killing 17. Army Staff Sgt Robert Bales has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and is being held in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after allegedly going on a shooting spree in an Afghan village . Tragedy: Bales is accused of shooting 17 . Afghans, including nine children like this one being shown by her . grandmother, and setting many of them on fire . According to the LA Times, the soldier who provided them with the photos served in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne's 4th Brigade Combat Team from Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He told the paper he was releasing them because he believed the safety of the troops was being compromised due to a breakdown in leadership and discipline. ISAF has a strict policy for the handling of enemy remains and dictates they be processed as humanely as possible. The Pentagon press secretary said Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta 'strongly rejects the conduct' of the soldiers depicted in the photos. In a statement, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker called the actions in the photographs 'morally repugnant', saying they dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. Captain John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, released a statement saying the conduct depicted 'most certainly does not represent the character and the professionalism of the great majority of our troops in Afghanistan. 'Nevertheless, this imagery — more than two years old — now has the potential to indict them all in the minds of local Afghans, inciting violence and perhaps causing needless casualties.

Some four decades ago, an Alabama couple decided to build their home underground to beat the high price of fuel during the oil crisis of the 1970s. Now Jim Mortenson and wife, Mickey, are still happily nestled in their extravagant bamboo-lined bunker in Bagely, having raised two children there and, not only, saved on energy costs but survived scores of savage storms. During the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 and 1974, the Mortenson's, like the rest of the United States, were struggling with the high price of fuel and looking for ways to cut usage. Home sweet home: Jim Mortenson walks out the front door of his underground home in Bagley, Alabama, on Tuesday, July 16, 2013 . Then Mr Mortenson read a magazine article about how underground living reduced the cost of heating and cooling and they were intrigued. 'We told our families, and they didn't tell us we were crazy,' he laughed in an interview with The Daily Mountain Eagle. 'We were young and didn't know what we were doing.' The couple set to work in 1975, when their daughter Terra, was born, building the intriguing residence themselves, mostly on weekends. They moved in eight years later, in 1983 -- the year their son, Joshua, was born. And even then the house was 'a work in progress.' Decades underground: The Mortenson's have spent the last 30 years living in an underground house they built themselves over an eight-year span . 'By then, I think the inspector just felt sorry for us so he let us move in,' Mr Mortenson, who is now a grandparent, told The Eagle. The house is constructed of concrete walls that are heavily waterproofed. The roof area is decorated with tropic plants, such as banana trees and several types of elephant ears and bamboo, which Mr Mortenson started growing commercially 15 years ago and now ships all over the country. The only help the couple hired was a plumber, a concrete block layer, and someone to smooth the concrete floors and roof slab of the 2,500 square foot house. Oil embargo: During the oil embargo in the 1970s, the Mortenson's and the rest of the country were struggling with the high price of fuel and looking for ways to cut usage . Everything else, they did themselves, according to an earlier article from AL.com. As for energy efficiency, Mr Mortenson said the home is easy and cheap to cool in the summer though humidity can be a problem. The couple installed a furnace a few years ago to heat the property They also have underground power and utility lines. But Mickey Mortenson said the shelter the home provides from wild weather was a huge benefit they overlooked. Inside: Jim Mortenson read a magazine article that talked about how underground living cut the cost of heating and cooling and he was intrigued . 'I didn't realize how much I'd appreciate the fact that it's storm proof,' she said. 'These last few tornadoes I tell the kids to come down when ever there's a bad storm. We usually have a houseful of people when the weather's really bad.' Mr Mortenson still marvels at the house the couple built so boldly all those years ago, after simply reading book after book on architecture and construction. 'I was in my 20s,' he said. 'There is something wonderful about youth - you just get up and go. It was fun in a way.'","Some four decades ago, an Alabama couple decided to build their home underground to beat the high price of fuel during the oil crisis of the 1970s .

Eight-year-old Dylan Williams, pictured, died of blunt force trauma after being hit on the head with a baseball . An eight-year-old schoolboy has died after being hit on the head by a baseball in front of his devastated father. Dylan Williams, eight, was playing at a youth all-star game practice in Union City, Indianapolis, when he was knocked out by the nine-inch ball. Dylan went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to Riley Hospital for Children where doctors battled to save his life on Tuesday. He was pronounced brain dead at the hospital after brain was deprived of oxygen for 40 minutes and his parents decided to switch off his life support on Wednesday. Dylan's father, Erick Williams, was coaching at the game and witnessed the moment his son was hit with a ball. He told television station WHIO-TV: 'He was playing first base and they went to throw a ball to him and he wasn't really looking, and to me it looked like it hit him in the side of the neck and he just dropped to the ground. 'He was a great kid. Loved baseball, loved his teammates.' Dylan’s mother Georgiana Williams said other parents should 'hug and kiss your kids as much as possible' because you never know what might happen. The coordinator of the all-star baseball team Michael Fulk said no decisions had been made about play for the rest of the season following Dylan's death. An autopsy by the Marion County . Coroner's office showed Dylan died from 'complications of blunt force . trauma to the right side of his head and neck. Devastated: Dylan's father Erick was coaching the baseball team practice and saw his son get hit by the ball . Union City Mayor Bryan Conklin told digtriad.com that Dylan's death has affected the whole Union City community which has a population of around 5,000. The father-of-two said: 'It's probably one of the saddest things I've ever heard. For a kid to be playing something he likes to do, and then...it's just heart-breaking.' Union City Police Chief Colbie Wells said they are still investigating the incident.

An Oakland neighborhood is in shock after an 8-year-old girl was killed and two young children were injured when an apartment was left riddled with bullets Wednesday night. Alaysha Carradine, 8, was killed and two of her friends, Amara York, 7 and her 4-year-old brother, ended up in the hospital when a gunman opened fire on the house they were in just at about 11:15 Wednesday night, according to reports. York’s 63-year-old grandmother was  also shot in the leg, but her injuries are non-life threatening.  Khamel Hardin,22,  was upstairs at the time of the attack and went unharmed. Police have not yet released the names of the other victims. Dead: Aspiring model Alaysha Carradine, 8, was shot to death by an unknown gunman while sleeping over at a friend's house . ‘It was like it was a bomb, an explosion, just going off so quick,’ Hardin told the San Francisco Chronicle. The attack came when York ran to answer the doorbell, thinking it was her mother, according to KPIX. Instead, she was met with a hail of bullets but somehow survived the attack. Bullets tore through both the security door and the wooden door behind it, as well as the walls of the apartment and a back window, blood could be seen on the carpet inside. Senseless: The front door was shot up with a barrage of bullets, most of which hit Carradine, Amara York, 7, and her 4-year-old brother . Carradine was at the apartment, where she is reportedly a regular visitor, because her mother was away on vacation in Washington, D.C., according to reports. Jesse Fowler, 24, also of Oakland, and the girl’s step father, was left to tell the dead eight-year-old’s mother the terrible news. ‘I just want to know why you would shoot up a houseful of kids. Where do you get the satisfaction in that?’ Fowler asked a number of local reporters after saying he was at a loss to understand such a senseless act. Fowler added that Carradine is also survived by a younger brother that he and her mother will have a hard time explaining to why his sister is no longer around. 'I know the kids didn't do anything to deserve this,' Sharon Smith, who was watching Carradine and let her stay over York's house told multiple local reporters, adding 'it's just heartbreaking.' Set to join the third grade in a few months, Carradine loved school, reading and  modeling, according to reports. She was planning to go to a modeling competition with York Thursday afternoon, KPIX noted. A tragedy: Carradine was only weeks away from starting third grade when she was shot to death Wednesday night . ‘She's not doing too good,’ Fowler told NBC Bay Area of Alaysha's mother, ‘She doesn't want to accept it.’ Saying he has heard gun shots before, neighbour Fre Lee, 52, told the paper that he ‘used to see those kids laughing, playing out front… they were so sweet.’ Horrific: Blood stains were visible inside the apartment where three children and an elderly lady were mercilessly shot late Wednesday night . Interim Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent and Mayor Jean Quan visited the two injured children at a local hospital Thursday, teddy bears in-hand, according to reports. Officials have not named any suspects, but have announced a $25,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest.","Alaysha Carradine was staying over a friend's house while her mother was on vacation across the country in Washington, D.C.

According to her family, little Ireland does not appear to fully acknowledge yet  that both her legs had been severed below the knee and that her left hand was left injured. Tragedy struck last week when the girl's father, Jerry, was riding his lawn mower in their backyard when he backed up and ran over his daughter, who wandered next to the machine. Recovery begins: Little Ireland Nugent, 2, pictured for the first time with her amputated legs and mangled left hand bandaged in the aftermath of a lawn mower accident .

Heartbreaking outcome: doctors had not amputate Ireland's shredded legs below the knee to prevent infection and put her on the path to recovery . Since the accident, the local . community has rallied around the Nugents, with donations pouring in from . friends and strangers alike wanting to help the sweet little girl in . her awful predicament. 'I just didn't know people could care that much,' Jerry Nugent told Tampa Bay Times, marveling at the outpouring of support or his family. Former professional wrestler Steve Chamberland, who also lost a leg in a bike accident, approached the Nugents and vowed to help Ireland with the cost of prosthetics and physical therapy through his foundation, 50legs.org . Readers who wish to donate money for Ireland's recovery can do so by going on the site of Trinity Presbyterian Church. The church also set up the Ireland Nugent Support Facebook Page for well-wishers. Little Ireland had to undergo four surgeries to clean her wounds and amputate of her shredded legs at mid-calf. While her body has likely been permanently altered by the ordeal, her loved ones say the toddler's spirit has not been broken. After being taken off sedatives Wednesday, the girl appeared happy, chatting with her parents and laughing. Loved ones say she even ate a banana and some cereal, and drank apple juice. 'She . spilled her Fruit Loops — that was just the funniest thing in the world . to her. She burst out laughing,' said Pastor Dennis Reid, from Trinity .

Bright future: Doctors plan to fit the toddler with prosthetic legs in a few weeks once her wounds dry and heal . Ireland, who is still connected to monitors and other medical equipment, was even rolled out of the pediatric intensive care unit for a tour of a hospital game room. Her father said his daughter really wanted to get up and play. The girl's family say that once Ireland’s wounds dry and heal, which could take six to eight weeks, she will be fitted for prosthetic legs. As his daughter's small but resilient body is beginning to bounce back from the injuries, her father is struggling to come to terms with the guilt as he continues to be haunted by traumatic memories. 'I've been fighting that. It's been an internal battle since the accident — all the things I could have done differently,' he told the paper. Then I realize I have to go forward. I can't go back. 'Everybody's been telling me not to blame myself. It's easier said than done, obviously. There's times when I'm alone, and I get myself in trouble, when I've been thinking too much.' Speaking to ABC Action News earlier this week, Jerry Nugent tearfully recounted the devastating 15 seconds that changed their lives forever. He explained that he thought Ireland was on the back porch behind a locked screen door whle he was riding on the mower. 'She called my name out and I said, ""Honey, I will be in in a minute, thinking that she could not get out. Victim: Ireland Nugent, 2, lost both of her feet and part of an arm in the Wednesday accident . United front: After initially being treated for hysteria following the accident, Nicole and Jeremiah Nugent stood by each other during a press conference on Thursday . 'But next thing you know, I am in the . driveway and I am blowing off the driveway and my wife comes out and . there was a miscommunication with the hand signals and that is when my . world came to an end,' he said. Mr Nugent said he could actually feel the blades slice into his daughter's flesh. Afterwards, the parents said the little girl asked them where her legs were, indicating that she knew something terrible had happened. When Ireland woke up Wednesday, Jerry . Nugent said he was hoping that her first words would be, 'Daddy, I love . you.' That did not happen yet, but he got the next back thing. 'I asked can I have a kiss and she . put her heads up towards me and put her lips out and I was able to give . her a kiss and that was touching,' he said. Accident: Jeremiah Nugent, 47, was pulling into his garage to park the ride-on lawnmower when he reversed after seeing his wife wave to tell him he was going to run over something . During a press conference after the . accident, Ireland's mother, Nicole, told reporters: 'She will continue . to succeed. She will do great things in her life. This will not stop . Ireland.' Police said the father, 47-year-old . Jeremiah 'Jerry' Nugent, was going to park the mower into the garage at . the family's Palm Harbor, Florida home at around 7pm last Wednesday. He is said to have not noticed that his daughter had tripped behind the machine, and he only realized that something may be wrong when he saw his wife was alerting him that he was about to drive over something. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the man responded by putting the mower in reverse, running over his daughter. According to police, the father dragged the little girl down the driveway of their subdivision and onto the street before he realized what had happened. Once he did, Mr Nugent immediately turned off the mower, and the woman called 911. Authorities say the child's feet were severed above the ankles. Her left hand was punctured but intact. She was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital with her distraught parents where she is undergoing treatment. Pastor Dennis told MailOnline in an email Thursday that doctors placed a pin in Ireland's broken thumb and her hand is expected to make a full recovery.

Police told ABC News that it will not be possible for the girl's limbs to be reattached, but her mother told a group of reporters that their neighbors have banded together and begun raising funds so that the Nugents will be able to pay for prosthetic limbs for Ireland. 'Never in my life did I think this would happen to my child,' Mrs Nugent said according to NBC News. She was taken to Tampa General Hospital. The girl's parents were treated at the hospital for hysteria immediately after the incident, but showed a positive, united front alongside their family pastor during the press conference.","Doctors had to amputate whatever was left of little Ireland Nugent's shredded legs below the knee .

Images have emerged showing actor Cory Monteith with what appears to be injection marks on his arm, almost a year before he died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol. The pictures, taken on July 9 2012 in Los Angeles, show the actor on a lunch date with his girlfriend Lea Michelle and with visible marks on the inside of his left arm. The Glee actor was found dead at the age of 31 alone in his hotel room on Saturday in Canada. Marked: Cory Monteith was pictured on July 9 2012 with what appears to marks on the inside of his arm . According to RadarOnline Cory was seen again with what appeared to be ‘track marks’ on his arm while in New York a month later in 2012, suggesting it would have been obvious to most people that he was using. Troubled: The marks suggest the actor may have been using heroin for over a year . It is thought his girlfriend and co-star Lea, who was a driving force behind his second entry to rehab in April of this year, didn’t know he was using heroin again. The actress is believed to have taken over planning his memorial service and other aspects connected to his death. His mother meanwhile is reported not to have any part in the planning. TMZ report that sources connected to Lea and Cory say she tried to protect her boyfriend as much as possible, in particular when it came to his drug problems. The website claims that according to one relative the actor was messed about in Hollywood by ‘a zoo of piranhas’ and Lea took it upon herself to protect him once they became a couple. It’s thought that while Lea was with Cory she could guide him about his substance abuse, however it was on his visits to Canada that her control went out the window. The British Columbia Coroners Service revealed the autopsy results on Tuesday, adding that the investigation into his death is continuing, and that no further details were available at this time. It was noted that at this stage there is still no evidence to suggest that Mr. Monteith's death was 'anything other than a most-tragic accident'. In control: It has been reported that Lea played a big part in protecting the actor in life and is now in control of planning his memorial service . Police Constable Brian Montague said, 'There was evidence in the room that was consistent of a drug overdose,' said Constable Brian Montague, adding that he wouldn't 'go into specifics'. The cause of death has come as a shock to some after it was initially reported that police did not believe drugs to have been involved, but Montague explained they need to err on the side of caution. 'It was the opinion of the investigators that it was a drug overdose, but we didn’t want to speculate,' he said. 'The last thing we would want to do is speculate a drug overdose and then have that not be the case.' Autopsy: Cory died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol, it has been revealed . A medical team from the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority performed the postmortem exam. 'Mr. Monteith was alone [in his hotel room] when he died,' a Vancouver Police Department spokesperson said. 'He took the heroin when he was alone by himself.' Monteith was found dead in his hotel room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in Vancouver on Saturday around noon. It is still unclear what happened to Monteith in the hours leading up to his death. He and his manager dined on Thursday night with Maureen Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, who said the actor 'looked so good, so healthy'. According to authorities, Monteith and three unidentified people left his hotel room on Friday night and that the actor returned alone at around 2:15 a.m. Hotel staff found his body shortly after noon when Monteith didn't check out.","Images were taken on July 9 2012 while the actor was out for lunch with girlfriend Lea Michele .

A fourth son was also injured crossing the 12-lane highway plagued by pedestrian deaths, police said. Khusen Akhmedov, 23, of Lancaster, and Ahmen Holloman, 30, of Philadelphia, were arrested Wednesday night. Facing murder charges: Khusen Akhmedov (left) and Ahmen Holloman (right) were arrested in relation to the Philadelphia car crash and are facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges . Investigators believe they may have been drag racing. The pair also faces charges of homicide by vehicle, recklessly endangering another person, aggravated assault, simple assault and aggravated assault by vehicle stemming from the crash on Tuesday night. Listed telephone numbers for the suspects couldn't immediately be located, and it wasn't clear if they had attorneys. Samara Banks, 28, and three of her sons were killed as they crossed Roosevelt Boulevard at a point with grassy medians dividing the traffic lanes, but no crosswalk or traffic light. Her 23-month-old baby Saa'sean died at the scene, nine-month-old baby Saa'mir died after reaching hospital and her four-year-old son Saa'deem died yesterday. Her oldest, a five-year-old, survived with bumps and bruises. Banks often called a cab to take her and her four little boys home from family visits on the other side of the boulevard, relatives said. But on Tuesday night, she thought temperatures had cooled down enough to walk the mile back home from her aunt's house. Victims of the crash: Samara Banks, 28, and her three youngest sons were killed as they crossed Roosevelt Boulevard . Smashed: The driver of an Audi struck the family as they crossed a road in Philadelphia . 'The cab service knows her well,' said LaTanya Byrd, an aunt who described Banks as a devoted mother who . had helped raise siblings after her own mother died. 'Last night, it got . a little cooler and she felt she could walk.' Roosevelt . Boulevard had the nation's 2nd and 3rd most dangerous intersections in a . 2001 insurance company study, which tallied 618 crashes at those two . intersections alone in a two-year period. The . speed limit is 40 mph where Banks and her boys were killed, but drivers . frequently go 10 or 20 mph above that to make — or run — a light, . neighbors said Wednesday. Many . residents of the lower-income area don't have cars and are left to . traverse the boulevard on foot to get to schools, parks and stores. Just . hours after Banks and her boys died, Iris Rolon chose the same . mid-block route to cross with her 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old . niece.

And 36-year-old pedestrian Brenda Rodriguez was struck and killed in June 2009 after she and a friend picked up Chinese food. Witnesses said she was struck as two drivers were racing each other; both of them fled. The deaths continued even after the city started installing red-light cameras to try to calm traffic. 'Every . time I cross the boulevard, I see somebody running the light. I think . they don't know there's a camera there,' said Angel Mendoza, 32, who . lives a block away.

'She was a great parent,' Byrd said. 'When her mom passed, she just took over and got things done.'

Manipulative: Elizabeth Carolan, 59, created a fantasy world in an elaborate plot to have sex with the youngster . A woman seduced a vulnerable young girl by writing hundreds of letters to her from fictional characters, including one from a ghost called Steve. Elizabeth Carolan, 59, created a fantasy world in an elaborate plot to have sex with the girl, who was aged 16 at the time. Carolan, had denied four sex assault charges, but was convicted by a jury and was sentenced to six years in prison. The judge said the case was bizarre and told her: 'You behaved in a wicked way towards this vulnerable girl - just to satisfy your own sexual gratification.' Charlotte Newell, prosecuting at Canterbury Crown Court in Kent, said that some of the attacks happened at a holiday camp and a swimming pool. She said Carolan, from Hythe, bombarded the girl, with more than 170 letters from fictitious people - including soldiers, a character called Daddy and a ghost called Steve. Ms Newell added: 'The girl needed love and support. Carolan knew that and knew that she was vulnerable and was an easy target. 'Instead of mollycoddling, showing her love and support, she undid this girl’s bra. 'She had a sexual interest in this girl and manipulated her as it was easy to do.' Obsession: Carolan, from Hythe, bombarded the girl with more than 170 letters from fictitious people - including soldiers, a character called Daddy and a ghost called Steve (file pic) It was then that Carolan started to write fake letters - in an effort to manipulate her victim. The . prosecutor added: 'She had a rather twisted and strange view of the . world, encouraging an apparent correspondence with a number of males . that she (the victim) had never met and which (the victim) now believes . was simply invented by Liz. 'At the time, she believed a whole cast of characters were writing to her and creating a fantasy world. She said the reason was because Carolan wanted to ensure the girl, who is now 18, would not seek 'a real-life boyfriend who might take her away from this situation.' The . prosecutor said: 'Liz created a fantasy family for this girl, letters . from many characters including Tony and Rob ... and a ghost called Steve. 'None of these people ever materialised, never seen in person. We say they never existed.' Strong words: The judge at Canterbury Crown Court in Kent, said the case was bizarre and told her: 'You behaved in a wicked way towards this vulnerable girl - just to satisfy you own sexual gratification' Ms Newell added: 'Steve was the ghost, an invention of course, but an invention who wrote letters of his own but also passed information. 'This was, the Crown say, a device to explain how the apparent author of one of the letters, who was allegedly in a hospital after having his arm blown off in Afghanistan, might know of a row with Liz that day. Ms Newell told the court that the ghost was a device to explain how the characters would know about events in the teenager's life.

A big cat prowled the Devon countryside more than a century ago, rediscovered remains from a museum’s vaults have shown. Scientists identified the creature as a Canadian lynx, a predator more than twice the size of a domestic cat. Records show that the animal, thought to have escaped or been released from captivity, was shot by a Devon landowner in the early 1900s after it killed two dogs. Scientists identified the creature as a Canadian lynx, a predator more than twice the size of a domestic cat. Records show that the animal, thought to have escaped or been released from captivity, was shot by a Devon landowner in the early 1900s after it killed two dogs. The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is a member of the cat family, Felidae, and around twice the size of a domestic cat. It is a secretive and mostly nocturnal animal, although it may be active at any time of day. It usually feeds on snowshoe hares, but will also eat rodents and birds, and sometimes hunt larger prey such as deer. It is the first proven case of an exotic big cat being at large in Britain. 'This Edwardian feral lynx provides concrete evidence that although rare, exotic felids (cats) have occasionally been part of British fauna for more than a century,' said lead researcher Dr Ross Barnett, from the University of Durham. 'The animal remains are significant in representing the first historic big cat from Britain.' Sightings of mystery 'beasts' have largely been blamed on the introduction of the 1976 Wild Animals Act, which curbed a growing fashion for exotic and potentially dangerous pets. Some owners were thought to have freed their animals into the wild to avoid falling foul of the law. The new research provides further evidence debunking this theory, say the experts. In fact there is a long history of big cats being at large in the UK, they claim. 'You definitely shouldn’t scoff at people reporting eye witness testimonies of big cats in Britain, but these are rare events,' said Dr Barnett. Canadian Lynx in the wild.It is a member of the cat family, Felidae, and around twice the size of a domestic cat . 'If everyone who thought they had seen a black panther in the British . countryside had actually seen one the population would be so large that . we would see them all the time. 'The jury is still out on the local big cat legends - until someone . finds a body of a big cat, that would be the conclusive proof people are . looking for.' Dr Barnett ruled out suggestions that the lynx, or a relative of it, . could still be roaming the Cornish moors as the ‘Beast of Bodmin’. He said the lynx is grey and is not believed to have mated, while the . Cornish cat is reported to be black and was only spotted many years . later. Although he said he is “sure this will fuel speculation” a giant cat prowls the area. How the lynx made its way to British shores remains a mystery but . experts say it would have survived the by devouring rabbits and other . small mammals. Humans had little to fear from the usually solitary beast, which only attacks man if it is being attacked or captured. Face to face: The animal's skeleton and mounted skin was analysed by a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and researchers at Southampton, Durham, Bristol, and Aberystwyth universities and found to be a Canadian lynx . The carnivorous predator, which is twice the size of a normal domestic feline, is the earliest example of an 'alien big cat' at large in Britain and will fuel rumours the mysterious Beast of Bodmin is its descendant . A wild Lynx, which usually feeds on snowshoe hares, but will also eat rodents and birds, and sometimes hunt larger prey such as deer. The lynx skeleton was recovered from an underground storeroom at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Records also unearthed at the museum show that the animal had originally been mislabelled by curators in 1903 as a Eurasian lynx. The Eurasian lynx was once an indigenous British species but had almost certainly become extinct by the 7th century AD. Laboratory analysis of the Bristol specimen’s bones and teeth indicated that it had been kept in captivity long enough to develop severe tooth loss. Dr Darren Nash, from the University of Southampton, who co-authored the research published in the journal Historical Biology, said: 'There have been enough sightings of exotic big cats which substantially pre-date 1976 to cast doubt on the idea that one piece of legislation made in 1976 explains all releases of these animals in the UK. 'It seems more likely that escapes and releases have occurred throughout history, and that this continual presence of aliens explains the ‘British big cat’ phenomenon.' Colleague Dr Greger Larson, from the . University of Durham, said: 'Every few years there is another claim that . big cats are living wild in Britain, but none of these claims have been . substantiated. 'It seems that big cats are to England what the Loch Ness monster is to Scotland. Records also unearthed at the museum show that the animal had originally been mislabelled by curators in 1903 as a Eurasian lynx. It will now go on public display at Bristol Museum . 'By applying a robust scientific methodology, this study conclusively demonstrates that at least one big cat did roam Britain as early as the Edwardian era, and suggests that additional claims need to be subjected to this level of scrutiny.' The lynx is now on public display at the Bristol Museum. Julie Finch, head of Bristol's Museums, Galleries & Archives, said: 'Bristol Museum, Galleries and Archives were pleased to be a part of this ground-breaking research, which not only highlights the importance of our science collections, it establishes the pedigree of our 100-year old Lynx and adds to our knowledge and understanding of 'big cats' in the UK.' Dr Ross Barnett, of Durham University's Department of Archaeology, said: 'This Edwardian feral lynx provides concrete evidence that although rare, exotic felids have occasionally been part of British fauna for more than a century.'","Researchers found the animal in a museum storeroom .

A teenager banished from the insulated world of the Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church (FLDS) has spoken about how his life has dramatically changed since being forced out of the polygamous sect. Willy Steed, 19, together with his parents and six sisters were among a group of between 500 and 600 people banished by the sect’s leader - and so-called prophet - Warren Jeffs, who has spent the past seven years behind bars after being convicted of sexual abuse of young girls. The Steed family received help of a group called Holding Out Help, a nonprofit for those leaving polygamist groups. Write caption here . Willy was placed with a couple called Pam and Ron Jenson, who have helped him to reclaim his lost childhood and experience a number of things for the first time - including his first ride on a rollercoaster, his first birthday cake and even Facebook. Like most boys in the FLDS, Steed was pulled out of grade school to work and so he has also had to learn to read for the first time. Steed's life also took an unexpected turn in June, when he met a photographer who believed he had model potential and invited him to a photo shoot. The invitation to become a model shows just how far Steed's physical and emotional transformation has come since leaving the sect. Willy Steed, left with his back to the camera, visits the spot where several of his friends died in a car crash after a beer party . ‘Someone saw me for who I was and singled me out and picked me because of that,’ Steed told ABC News. ‘All my life [I] never believed in myself. It was so easy for me to get lost in the crowd of family, but out here it's so easy to be seen in a crowd and not get lost.’ Steed is one of the lucky ones. Just weeks after he left several of his close friends died in a car crash after a beer party. Under the FLDS' strict religious code, boys and girls are forbidden from speaking to one another in their community and so many attend the secret desert parties. ‘There's a reason the young boys go out at night, and the young girls go to those parties,’ he told ANC News. Under the FLDS' strict religious code women are forced to wear long-sleeved prairie dresses and aren't allowed to cut their hair . Willy Steed has joined Facebook since leaving the FLDS and has posted several pictures of his adventures since . 'It's because they can drink, they can be themselves and they can put away all that stress.’ According to church teachings, anyone who attends these parties becomes a ‘son of perdition.’ ‘Son of perdition means you are Satan's property, and that you will burn in hell when you leave this life for what you have done,’ Steed explained. The community lives a lifestyle far removed from the modern world with no internet, no television and little contact with the outside world. Every aspect of life - what people wear, what they eat, even whom they marry - continues to be controlled by Jeffs, even though he is behind bars. Some of is more recent bizarre edicts have included banning toys, bicycles and the eating of corn. Criminal: Warren Jeffs continues to run his 'church' from behind bars after being imprisoned for sexual assault on a 15 and 12-year-old . Cult: Jeffs was said to have been married to an estimated 80 women as he lead the polygamous sect . The community, which has up to 10,000 members worldwide, still believes in their 'prophet' even though he is serving life plus 20 years for sexually abusing children. Approximately 8,000 people still reside at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas and they are still reportedly receiving instructions from him. 'We know he is innocent,' Dr. Maryam Holm, primary health care provider at the Yearning for Zion Ranch, told ABC. 'And we all yearn for his deliverance,' she added. When questioned about why Jeffs is still allowed to give guidance from the jail cell, officials say there is little they can do. 'If somebody comes in and visits with him, and he gives them . instructions and they take them back by word of mouth, there’s just . nothing we can do to control that,' John Hurt, director of public . information at the Texas Department of Corrections, told ABC News. Shocking: Members of the sect are escorted onto a bus in Eldorado, Texas after a raid on a compound built by Warren Jeffs, jailed leader of The Fundamentalist Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints . Followers of the movement had also congregated in sites in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. Arizona's Attorney General Tom Horne in February announced a criminal probe of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office, which serves as a small police force in the twin polygamous towns Hildale and Colorado City. A highly publicized raid in 2008 on the sect's community - the Yearning for Zion compound in Eldorado, Texas - revealed to the world for the first time the society Jeffs had been developing. The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history. Pictures showing members' unusual . appearance, particularly of the women in the community who wear . restrictive floor length dresses and are forbidden from cutting their . hair, were broadcast across the world as 400 children were put in . temporary custody for the duration of the police investigation into . sexual abuse. The FLDS temple at the YFZ Ranch near Eldorado, Texas . During his trial, jurors wept as they heard a graphic tape of the twisted sexual instructions Jeffs gave his brides - some of whom were just children. He warned God would reject them if they did not to submit to his instructions and DNA evidence presented during the trial proved he had fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl. 'If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,' Jeffs wrote in a chilling journal entry from 2005 - one of thousands of pages of notes seized by authorities. He was given life behind bars for one count of aggravated sexual assault and an extra 20 years, to be served consecutively, for the second count of sexual assault - the maximum allowed for each count.","Willy Steed, 19, is enjoying his freedom after leaving the polygamous sect .

Alison Dove, 26, was punched to the ground by Mark Davies and his son Mitchell after venturing outside for the first time after the explosive BBC documentary was aired. She was one of 11 members of staff recorded by an undercover BBC Panorama team abusing residents at the private hospital in Hambrook, South Gloucestershire. Attacked: Alison Dove (left) was punched to the ground by Mark Davies (right) and his son after the documentary was aired on the BBC . Alison Dove was one of 11 members of staff recorded by an undercover BBC Panorama team abusing residents at Winterbourne View care home (pictured) Dove was filmed squirting shower gel in the face of a mentally disabled woman and has since been jailed for 20 months. She kept a low profile after the show was aired in May 2011 but ventured out to the pub with a group of family members for the first time in August, Bristol Crown Court heard. Mark and Mitchell Davies were also at the The Royal Archer pub in Kingswood, Bristol, when trouble flared. Dove became involved in a row with members of the Davies family when Joanne Davies, Mark's sister, told her 'you should be in prison', it was said. A row kicked off and Mark, 39, scuffled with Dove's brother Simon, before Mitchell, 20, intervened to help his dad. Dove waded in to help her brother but was punched in the face, fell to the ground and kicked in the face by both the Davies men, the court was told. Dove suffered two jaw fractures and chipped teeth, and had to have four metal plates and 16 screws inserted as well as a tooth removed after the ruckus in a Bristol pub. Mark and Mitchell Davies, of Kingswood, were initially charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm, but the prosecution accepted guilty pleas to the lesser charge of affray. Dove was jailed for 20 months for her role in the Winterbourne View abuse scandal, after admitting seven charges of ill-treating patients . Winterbourne View was closed in the wake of the scandal which exposed abuse at the hospital . In the Panorama programme, Dove squirted shower gel in a patient's face at Winterbourne View care home . Mark Davies was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and 150 hours of unpaid work. His son was handed a nine-month suspended youth custody sentence, plus a supervision order and 100 hours of unpaid work. Sentencing, Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC, said: 'This was a disgraceful incident, quite disgraceful. 'Quite how it started, quite what roles each of you played, quite what happened outside is not entirely clear to me, but what is clear to me is that you both played a significant part in it. 'I sentence you on the basis that this incident was, essentially, out of character.' Winterbourne View was closed in the wake of the scandal, with the judge praising the television investigator for stopping what had been ‘systematic abuse’. Last November, Dove was jailed for 20 . months for her role after . admitting seven charges of ill-treating patients. In the Panorama programme, she was heard saying resident Simone Blake 'loved pain', before hitting her, pouring water on her and squirting shower gel at her face. Along with other staff members, Dove was also filmed holding Miss Blake down as a nurse forced medication into her mouth. It is believed she has already been released from prison on licence.","Alison Dove, 26, was punched to the ground by Mark Davies and his son .

But it seems Winston Churchill's extraordinary appeal is as strong across the Atlantic as it is in the country he lead to victory against the Nazis in World War II. An exhibition entitled Churchill: The Power of Words has opened in America to astonishing success. Power of his words: Prime Minister Winston Churchill, pictured addressing a joint session of Congress in the Senate Chamber of the Capitol in Washington, in January 1942, possessed a rare gift for oratory . Tens of thousands of people have been flocking to the Morgan Library and Museum in New York for a glimpse at rare memorabilia from the great orator and writer. The displays, including Churchill's hand-written notes and annotations on some of his famous speeches, delivered to lift the people's spirits during the nation's darkest hours, and other documents have been drawing unprecedented crowds. More than 30,000 have so far passed by the rarely seen displays - a 50 per cent increase in visitor numbers, which has shocked even the curator with its success. Declan Kiely of the Morgan Library told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It's been thrilling to witness the unprecedented emotional engagement and visceral response of many visitors, some of whom emerge openly weeping after listening to Churchill's speeches.' Moving: An exhibition of Churchill memorabilia, including his annotated drafts of famous rousing speeches, has provoked an emotional response from visitors . Churchill's reciprocated affinity with America was well documented. He was the son of Jennie Jerome, an . American socialite, he made four official transatlantic visits to . America during his second term as prime minister in an attempt to . maintain the special relationship. He became the only living person awarded an honorary citizenship in 1963 by President Kennedy and is also the only non-American to have a warship named after him. But his appeal with the latest generation of Americans seems to be just as strong. A passage in one famous Churchill . speech seems to have struck a particularly powerful chord with New . Yorkers - one delivered on September 11, 1940, decrying the use of . terror tactics against the population of a city. Resonance: Winston Churchill's powerful speech lifting the nation after the Nazi's unleashed the Blitz on the East End of London has struck a chord with New Yorkers shaken by the 9/11 atrocities . On that day more than seven decades . ago - two days into the Blitz - Churchill told the House of Commons that . Adolf Hitler 'hopes by killing large numbers of civilians, that he will . terrorise and cow the people of this mighty imperial city... Little . does he know the spirit of the British people.' It is a speech which the exhibition's curators have found holds particular resonance for New Yorkers in a post-9/11 world. Visitors . to the exhibition are also being given the rare chance to see around 65 . documents and items - including his 1953 Nobel Prize for Literature and his secretary's typewriter on which many speeches were drafted - usually kept out of public view in the vaults of . the Churchill Archives in Cambridge.

He said Borodowski angrily waved a badge at a driver who cut him off on Interstate 87. 'Words were exchanged,' Becerra said. The other driver and his passenger 'felt they were intimidated by this individual and he was purporting to be a police officer.' The passenger videotaped some of the encounter, he said. The footage is not being released.Borodowski surrendered  at a state police barracks in Hawthorne and was charged with the misdemeanor form of criminal impersonation. He is due in court July 29. The rabbi was already appearing in court today in Mamaroneck, just north of New York City, on his first arrest, which came in June. His lawyer said Rabbi Borodowski suffers from bipolar disorder and recently was hospitalized. The . rabbi who grew up in Argentina, is accused of pulling his car alongside . a woman's car, flashing a badge and shouting: 'Police! Police! Pull . over!' The woman's lawyer said he 'just laid on the horn and started screaming at her' as she obeyed a 20-mph limit in a school zone. Police . said the rabbi told them, 'That girl was driving too slow, and I hate . when people do this.' However, he denied posing as a police officer. He said that he was simply telling the woman that he would be 'calling the police.' The rabbi has been dismissed from a position at the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan . He had a badge, which read Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Officer 1338, which has been confiscated by police. Judie . Glave, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, . which oversees the bridge and tunnel authority, said the badge is . 'totally fake.' Borodowski's . lawyer, Andrew Rubin, acknowledged that the rabbi's behavior has been . 'manic' and said he's suffering from bipolar disorder. Prosecutor Diana Hedayati agreed to reduce the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. The revision means the rabbi is much less likely to be jailed if he's found guilty. The Westchester district attorney's office said the charge was reduced from felony status because the rabbi's behavior did not include intent to commit another crime while impersonating an officer. Judge Daniel Gallagher ordered a psychiatric evaluation and adjourned that case to Sept. 12. Borodowski did not speak during the proceeding and refused to answer questions outside the courthouse. Richard Clifford, a lawyer representing the woman who reported him, said he was not disappointed that the charge was reduced. 'Putting everyone in jail is not a solution,' he said. Borodowski is still listed as rabbi on the website for Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont (pictured) In . the first incident which happened in White Plains, New York, but only . came to light after the Mamaroneck arrest, motorist Peter Moses said . Borodowski tailgated him, 'obviously trying to make me go faster' than . the 40-mph limit. When . the rabbi pulled alongside, he shouted, 'I'm a police officer. Pull . over!' Moses said. 'He's got this little badge that he's . waving at us. I told my wife, ""That's not a police officer.' A third driver handed State Police a video of a confrontation in April on Interstate 87 near Yonkers. The . man, who has not been named, claimed that he swerved in front of a . driver who then flashed a badge and demanded that he pull over. Preacher: The synagogue of Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont, New York where Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski is still listed as the leader of the congregation. Police in White Plains have accused him of doing the same thing there in May . 'He . was holding up this tiny badge, and I knew the guy could no way be a . cop in any sense of the word.' The . three complaints prompted the trustees of Temple Emanu-El to fire Borodowski as executive director of the Skirball Center for Jewish . Learning 'in the best interests of the Congregation,' said Mark . Weisstuch, administrative vice president. Borodowski was still listed as rabbi on the website for Congregation Sulam Yaakov in Larchmont. The synagogue's president wrote a letter to the congregation saying members should help the rabbi 'recover from his illness and ... welcome him back as our spiritual leader at the appropriate time.'","Rabbi Alfredo Borodowski, 49, has appeared in court in New York .

Daniel Parker from Grand Rapids Michigan, was looking forward to spending the evening at Mojo’s Dueling Piano Bar but he was turned away with a friend at the door, because he was wearing gold-colored shorts made of Lamé, a metallic fabric. Mr Parker posted on Facebook earlier this week claiming he was discriminated against. Entry denied: Daniel Parker was told he would not be allowed into the Grand Rapids piano bar because his shorts violated the dress code and looked like they were from a costume . The offending articles: These shiny sleek shorts were deemed to be outside of Mojo's dress code . Gossip: Daniel said he could hear the door staff talking about him in the line even before he asked to be let in . If you're wearing gold shorts, you're not coming in: Daniel Parker was told by the doorman (pictured) that his colorful choice of shorts were not suitable for the bar. The owners have since apologised to him . He was told by the doorman that Mojo’s was 'a bar with standards and a dress code' and his shorts were too costume-like. He took to Facebook to rant not only at the bar but at the city of Grand Rapids too, citing the city's cultural intolerance. 'I'm so hurt that Grand Rapids can claim to be up and coming in the world, yet still be so culturally behind. It should be noted that this is not the first bar my wardrobe has been an issue at.

'Our employees acted as they believed was necessary to enforce our establishment’s dress code. However, it is clear that our dress code needs to be modified in order to accommodate for individuals whose fashion selections may be a little more fashion forward than we are accustomed to.' The bar did state that 'there are certain guidelines we will continue to uphold' in regards to a dress code. 'No . excessively holey jeans, no cutoff shirts, etc.,' the post read. 'But . Mr. Parker's attire is something we have not previously been presented . with at Mojo's and, thus, requires addressing.'

Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the government was behind the Boston Marathon bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured . The Florida college professor who sparked controversy after saying that the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School may not have taken place is now infuriating even more people by saying that the Boston Marathon bombings were an inside job. James Tracy, a media professor who writes extensively about conspiracy theories, said that last week's bombing appears as if it was planned by the government. 'The event closely resembles a mass-casualty drill, which for training purposes are designed to be as lifelike as possible,' he wrote in a blog post. Other topics of rumination on his site include a number of the classic conspiracy theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and Fukishima have all been of interest. Mr Tracy, a tenured professor at Florida Atlantic University, argues that the media and 'play actors' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 180 injured. He takes particular issue with the endless stream of photos supporting the popular belief that the bombing did in fact happen. He writes that the multitude of pictures 'suggests the possibility of play actors getting into position after the detonation of what may in fact have been a smoke bomb or similarly benign explosive.' Picking a fight: Tracy argues that the media and 'play actors' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 180 injured . Still at work: James Tracy, 47, has been teaching at Florida Atlantic University for 10 years and refuses to lessen his stance against the official version of events regarding the Sandy Hook shooting . 'Since it is mediated, however, and primarily experienced from afar through the careful assemblage of words, images and the official pronouncements and commentary of celebrity journalists, it has the semblance of being, for all practical purposes, ""real.""’ University officials had a similar reaction to his latest rant as they did for the Newtown shooting. 'As with all postings on his personal blog, Florida Atlantic University does not agree with Mr. Tracy’s views or opinions,' the University spokesman said in a statement to FoxNews.com. 'His editorialized postings do not reflect the positions of the University or its leaders. 'The University stands with the rest of the country in our support of the victims of the Boston Marathon tragedy. We, too, are Boston Strong.' Placing blame: Tracy says that the national media has not done enough to unearth the 'truth' One difference between his comments on the Sandy Hook massacre and the Boston bombing was the amount of time that he left in between. Last time, he waited nearly a month after the 20 young students and six school administrators were killed at the elementary school before making his controversial comments. This time he waited just nine days. The . 47-year-old professor based his outrageous allegations largely on the . flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the . shooting was released throughout the tragic day. 'I think that the entire country mourned . about Sandy Hook and yet, once again, the investigation that . journalistic institutions should have actually carried out never took . place as far as I'm concerned,' Tracy said at the time.","Professor James Tracy asserts the bombing was a staged drill .

Professor Sir Roger Boyle told the BBC that care at the centre at the Leeds children's heart unit was 'on the edge of acceptability' One of the country’s most senior doctors who raised the alarm over high death rates at a children’s cardiac unit is ‘considering his position’ after being asked to resign by the NHS medical director. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh has called for Prof Sir Roger Boyle,  the former heart tsar, to step  down over his claims that he  would still not want his daughter  to receive treatment at Leeds General Infirmary – even though  it has reopened following a Government review. The call for his resignation came despite Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisting that a new ‘friends and family test’ is a crucial way to determine whether services are safe to use. Prof Boyle, director of the National Institute for Clinical Outcomes Research (NICOR), which oversees NHS mortality data, argued on Friday that the death rates at Leeds were still ‘on the edge of acceptability’ and that he would not send his children there. ‘I would go somewhere else,’ Prof Boyle said. ‘I would go to Newcastle.’ Prof Keogh, who has insisted the unit is safe, described the comments as ‘not very helpful’ and was ‘very puzzled’ about why they had been made. Asked if Prof Boyle should step down, he replied: ‘I think the answer to that is yes.’ Prof Boyle said he was now ‘considering his position’ following the criticism, but he defended his comments over the Leeds unit. He said: ‘This is not just about data, where they are close to the levels which would prompt an alert, but about a whole range of things – concerns expressed by other surgeons about the way the unit operates, parents not being able to send their children elsewhere, women being cajoled into having abortions because  their children have a diagnosis  of congenital heart disease. Children's heart surgery at the hospital was suspended at the end of last month after data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres. It re-opened again on Wednesday . ‘I am considering my position, but . actually it really worries me that yet again we are seeing that when a . person raises concerns they end up being vilified, just as Steve Bolsin . [the anaesthetist who blew the whistle on the Bristol baby deaths . scandal, in which more than 30 babies died] was.’ The latest war of words comes  as one . mother demanded a full investigation into her daughter’s death at the . Leeds unit just days before all surgery was suspended there last month. Siobhan Casey, 25, lost her . four-year-old daughter Mylee Weetman following an operation on March 15 . to remove a build-up of muscle on her heart. The little girl, who had a . congenital heart condition, died on March 21. Siobhan, who also has a two-year-old . daughter, Mia, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have to know what happened – I . think any parent would want that. The coroner couldn’t find anything . that would naturally cause her death so her organs have been sent to . London specialists. I’ve sent a list of 27 questions to Leeds and just . want some answers.’ Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS . Foundation Trust said: ‘We extend our deepest sympathy to Mylee’s family . and have been speaking to her mother about the family’s concerns and . have arranged a meeting with her next week to discuss these further.’ Professore Boyle's comments . will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at Leeds General . Infirmary. They want him to be sacked, accusing him of  ‘conducting a . cynical vendetta’. Paediatric heart surgery at Leeds . was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by Sir Roger . appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average. Surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive. But . others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 . hours after the High Court quashed plans to close the centre as part of . measures to streamline  children’s heart services. The hospital insisted the data was incomplete and that full figures would confirm the unit to be safe.Surgery resumed earlier this week and NHS England said it was satisfied that immediate safety concerns had been dealt with. However, Sir Roger’s comments on Radio 4’s The Report programme will reignite the controversy . He . insisted that, despite safety assurances, a comprehensive analysis of . the data showed the unit should remain under supervision. ‘We find they’re just on the edge of what we call an alert. ‘In other words, showing that they were right on the edge of acceptability,’ he said. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said that the quality of its  service had been independently  verified during a rapid review. A spokesman added: ‘This was publicly reconfirmed at a meeting of councillors in Leeds on Wednesday when the deputy medical director of NHS England reaffirmed that all child heart surgery units in England, including Leeds, are safe to undertake surgery.’ The Save Our Surgery campaign group said Sir Roger’s involvement in deciding which child heart units should close means he is far from impartial. His comments, added spokesman Sharon Cheng, were ‘extremely unhelpful and undermine the progress made over the last few days to begin to rebuild heart patients’ families’ trust and confidence’. Greg Mulholland, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, called for Sir Roger to be sacked.He said the remarks had caused huge and unnecessary distress to families as well as slurring the  reputation of those working at the unit. NHS medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, took the decision to suspend treatment at the unit but said he now ‘disagreed’ with Sir Roger. ‘Having reviewed the unit, having reviewed the data, the performance in Leeds is in keeping with good national standards and I would be very happy to have my child operated upon in Leeds,’ said Sir Bruce.","Professor Sir Roger Boyle is the Government's former head of heart disease .

Now throat surgeon Dr Steven Zeitels has told how he knew surgery on Adele’s vocal cords had been a success when the singer gave him a ‘beautiful’  private rendition of her hit song, Rolling In The Deep. Dr Zeitels, whose patients have included Julie Andrews, Lionel Richie, and Roger Daltrey, treated Adele at the end of 2011 after a sore on her vocal cords caused her to lose her voice. Star surgeon: Dr Steven Zeitels, left, says he not only saved Adele's (right) voice but improved it . He claims that not only did he save her voice, he even improved it. In a two-hour operation, he used microsurgical instruments and a laser to remove a polyp and repair a burst blood vessel with skills he claims are the result of a teenage passion for sewing leather bags. Dr Zeitels, 55, has told of his pride at the singer’s spectacular comeback, with an Oscar for Bond theme Skyfall this year. The professor of laryngeal surgery at America’s renowned Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, said: ‘There was an overwhelming epiphany that I had restored this beloved voice that would bring joy to and inspire millions of people. Sought help: Dr Zeitels has also treated other big names such as Dame Julie Andrews, left, and Lionel Richie, right . ‘I could see using my laryngoscope that she seemed to have healed properly, but I had to see how her singing voice was faring. ‘I asked her to test her singing voice and she sang Rolling In The Deep beautifully. If anything, her voice sounded cleaner and clearer than before. Who are you: Roger Daltrey also sought Dr Zeiteil's help . 'Of course, I was overjoyed … It was a wonderful moment for both of us and one of the most memorable in my career.’ Sound of Music star Julie Andrews, 77, sought Dr Zeitels’s help after a routine operation with another surgeon in 1997 went wrong. Despite seeing Dame Julie four times, Dr Zeitels was unable to restore her voice completely. Adele has recalled how her voice was reduced to a whisper after developing the polyp. Reappearing after surgery, at the Grammy Awards in February 2012, she thanked Dr Zeitels on stage in the first of six acceptance speeches. The 24-year-old, whose full name is Adele Adkins, said: ‘It was a bit traumatic. Thank God my voice healed. I stuck to all of the rules they gave me.’ She has admitted surgery changed her voice, saying it is  ‘not as husky’ and is higher than it used to be. The surgeon, who also treats throat cancer, said: ‘Cancer surgery is rather like a fight with  a club, but voice-restoration surgery for benign lesions is more  like fencing. ‘With the singers I’ve operated on, I don’t just have to think how it looks at the end of the procedure, but also how it will look and mechanically vibrate in several weeks when it’s healed as well as in years or even decades to come.’ Dr Zeitels is developing a gel which he claims will restore vocal cord elasticity if injected into the throat regularly.","Dr Steven Zeitels treated Adele when she lost her voice in 2011 .

A former New Jersey police officer has lost his disability pension after footage emerged showing him wrestling and chasing monster trucks on a reality TV show. Joseph Derrico started receiving monthly payouts of $5,808.61 - nearly $70,000 a year - in 2010, claiming he had sustained a leg injury while working for Hamilton Township police. But doctors have now concluded that his disability . no longer exists after NBC4 and the New . Jersey Watchdog discovered footage of him taking part in TruTV's Bear Swamp . Recovery. And in yet another twist, it has emerged that the police officer was approved for the tax-free pension even though he had been indicted just one month earlier on receiving stolen goods charges. Scroll down for video . Oops: Joe Derrico, circled, has lost his state-paid disability pension after he appeared on reality TV show Bear Swamp Recovery. He claimed he had a leg injury but on the show he was filmed running and wrestling . Derrico resigned from the police force in October 2010, three months after he was indicted. The charges stemmed from stolen jewelry he accepted while working at Hiram's Gold and Coin Exchange in Ewing, a gold-buying service which he co-owned. He was behind the counter when the thieves brought the loot to the store and Derrico asked few questions before paying around $1,000 for the bag of jewelry, the watchdog reported. The day after the burglary, investigators went to the store to ask about the items and Derrico denied the youngsters had been at the store. However, the store had been under surveillance by Ewing police, who suspected . burglars were using Hiram's to get rid of stolen items. Derrico promptly changed his story. A month later, Derrico was indefinitely . suspended from his police job, with charges against him . including misconduct and untruthfulness. Physical: Derrico, left, is seen running and fighting in the show, which only had one series on TruTV . He was indicted by a grand jury on July 14, 2010 on a charge of third-degree theft by . receiving stolen property, which could have seen him locked up for five years in . prison. But just a month before the indictment, Derrico had applied for retirement and a disability pension, claiming he had injured his leg twice while on the job in July 2009 and January 2010. 'I feel my injury will prohibit me from . doing my job safely and at the level needed, it will put me or other . officers in danger,' Derrico concluded, according to documents in his state pension file. The pension office did not know he was under indictment and he was granted the pension. The . payout was a staggering two-thirds of his $104,555 annual salary, and . it was to be paid to him, tax-free, for the rest of his life. As he was retired, all charges against Derrico were dropped in September 2010. A year after he received his first . payment, it emerged that he had been cast as a minor character in the . reality TV show Bear Swamp Recovery, a one-season show about a repossession business. 'Fake': Despite his appearance on the show, he was receiving nearly $70,000 a year for a leg injury . Questionable: The former Hamilton township cop received the state-paid, tax-free pension even though he had been indicted on receiving stolen goods charges and dismissed from the force . Clips of the men - one of whom was Derrico’s partner in the gold buying business - were recently posted to YouTube and show him running and wrestling. He is seen chasing after a monster truck, pulling a man . down from the driver's seat, throwing him to the ground and climbing inside before driving off. When the video emerged, he was sent back to the doctor who originally examined him, and the doctor said Derrico was no longer disabled. It was sent to the Police and Firemen's Retirement System who approved it 10-0. Across the state, at least 5,300 retired police officers and firefighters are receiving disability payments. Pension payouts total $198 million per year and soar by $20 million each year. 'Is this one in a million?' John . Sierchio, a member of the PFRS board of trustees, asked during an . interview with The Times of Trenton. Appearance: Derrico can be seen left in one episode of the show, which followed a repossession business . Fight: He is seen tackling a man to the ground - even though he said his leg was too injured for him to work . 'No, I don't believe this is one in a million. I think there are a lot of people out there who are using the system to fill their needs.' Derrico's resignation remains in effect, according to Hamilton business administrator John Ricci. 'So . he resigned with disciplinary charges pending, which happens,' Ricci . said. 'We don't have to take him back… but he doesn't have a pension . anymore.' But in April, P.J. Vinch, a friend of Derrico's, told NBC4 that the reality TV show had been staged. 'There's no way that he could have ever been a police officer with the injury that he sustained,' Vinch said - but the board disagreed. 'We had to stop his pension,' Sierchi said. 'Otherwise, this would go on in limbo forever. And he would be collecting a pension, not being disabled and pretty much laughing at everybody.' Derrico may appeal the decision to the Office of Administrative Law, a process that could take years.","Joseph Derrico was receiving nearly $70,000 a year from his pension .

The Liberal Democrats are preventing David Cameron from taking tougher action on immigration and stripping the workshy of benefits, the Prime Minister said. Mr Cameron firmly rejected claims that only Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was being forced to compromise in the coalition. 'We've all had to make compromises,' he told BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright in the Afternoon. Prime Minister David Cameron chats with BBC Radio 2 presenters Steve Wright and Tim Smith after his interview . 'If I was running a Conservative-only Government I think we would be making further steps on things like immigration control or making sure that our welfare reforms were absolutely making sure that if you're not prepared to work you can't go on welfare. 'I think we'd be tougher than that,' he said. 'We make compromises, we make agreements, but as a Government I think we're delivering a lot of good things for the country.' Mr Cameron conceded that the coalition 'has its problems' but that it was generally working well. He denied that major policy issues were decided between himself and the Deputy Prime Minister in their regular Sunday evening telephone calls. 'We often have a conversation on the phone on a Sunday night to scope the issues that we need to settle, the problems that the Government faces and some of the issues that are under discussion in the following week, but we also have very ordered meetings, as we did this morning,' he said. 'I think the coalition works well. We haven't had one for 65 years, it's very different. Mr Cameron said Nick Clegg, left, wasn't the only one who had made concessions while he admitted he 'admired' some of Mr Blair's work despite his mistakes . 'But the idea of two parties coming together, burying some of their differences and acting in the national interest, for the national good, I think is working. It has it's problems but...' Mr Cameron defended the Government's tough deficit-reduction package and attacked Labour's calls for a slowdown and tax cuts. 'The programme of cuts is absolutely necessary to keep us out of the danger zone. My worry is that plan B as suggested by Labour, plan B stands for bankruptcy. 'It stands for not living within your means, not paying down your debts. And eventually you can end up in a situation which we see on our television screens, like Greece, where people lose all confidence you're going to be able to pay down your debts. 'I would say the greatest stimulus we can give is to keep those interest rates low, so businesses can borrow money, so people can get on the housing ladder, so investment and the economy can grow. Cameron hopes to improve his table tennis skills so that next time he plays Barack Obama he can 'thrash' him . 'Of course it's choppy, it's difficult. I know that households are suffering because inflation is high and petrol prices have gone up, and food prices are up, and people's budgets are very tight. 'But interest rates are low, the economy is growing and the last unemployment figures were pretty encouraging - the biggest monthly fall I think for 10 years.' The Prime Minister said he was going to practise his table tennis so he would be able to 'thrash' US President Barack Obama when they next meet. 'I used to play table tennis a bit, I'm going to have to restart so next time he comes I'll thrash him,' he said after being shown up by the president's skills during a visit to a school. Asked to choose his ideal dinner guests, dead or alive, Mr Cameron plumped for Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth I, to hear her first-hand account of dealing with the Spanish Armada, and celebrity cook Nigella Lawson to prepare the spread because he is 'very greedy' and loves food. Forced to choose one style of food, he said it would be Italian. He also said that he 'admired' some of what Tony Blair did in reforming public services but that the former Labour premier had made many mistakes.","The PM admits the coalition 'has its problems' but works well .

More than 850 BBC employees have come forward to raise concerns about bullying and sexual harassment at the corporation, it has emerged. The staff members have contacted private consultants brought in by the BBC as part of an internal inquiry set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Rose Review, overseen by human rights lawyer Dinah Rose QC, was launched last October following a wave of damaging claims from female presenters including Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig who said they were routinely groped while working for the BBC. Staff were asked to detail their experiences under a guarantee of anonymity, while one-to-one sessions have also taken place between BBC staff members and an outside company, Change Associates. It is believed that one senior BBC executive is the subject of more than 20 complaints of bullying. Rose is now expected to report back at the end of this month and make recommendations on how the BBC can improve. In an email to staff, the BBC’s director of human resources Lucy Adams told colleagues that some of the testimony is ‘uncomfortable to hear’. She wrote: ‘Over 850 of you got in touch one way or another and gave your thoughts on respect, behaviour and culture at the BBC today, including issues such as harassment (including sexual harassment) and bullying.’ Among the hundreds who came forward to the enquiry, up to 20 former employees initially thought they would not be give evidence because they been paid off and made to sign contracts to stop them turning whistleblower. Gagging clauses are typically part of ‘compromise agreements’ signed when an employee agrees to drop an employment tribunal claim in return for a pay-off. Inquiry: The Rose Review was launched last October and has seen 850 employees step forward to file complaints about bullying and harassment at the corporation . However, it is understood that, following negotiations, their evidence was eventually allowed to go forward.

The TSA has additional screening authority through its Visible Intermodal Prevention Response program, or VIPR, which is authorized by the Department of Homeland Security. The program allows TSA to work with law enforcement officials to 'augment security of any mode of transportation' - which translates to a surge in screenings on highways, in train stations, at airports, or other transportation hubs.

Former colleagues of Stuart Hall have told how the disgraced broadcaster was unable to 'talk to a woman without touching her' and bedded 100 in three months as it emerged police raided a sordid pool party held at the star's home weeks after he abused a young girl. Linda McDougall has revealed how Hall made her life a misery when they worked together at BBC Manchester in the 1960s while other colleagues have told how he used his fame to lure naive women into bed with him. Ms McDougall alleges that Hall, who last week pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to 14 sex attacks that occurred across the 1960s, 70s and 80s, would use any excuse to molest his female colleagues. New revelations: Linda Mcdougall, pictured left, has told how Stuart Hall, pictured right leaving court, would you any excuse to touch up female colleague while they worked together at BBC Manchester in the 1960s . Golden boy: Stuart Hall pictured while working as a presenter for the Look North news programme . Ms McDougall told the Sunday Times: 'If you were female, at the slightest opportunity he would put his arms around you and force his body against yours. 'Never a day would go by that he did not touch me. He tried everything. He could stroke your knee or tweak your stocking top, put his hand on your breast or rub your back. 'For me — and my female colleagues — Hall was a damned nuisance. He was offensive and seemed unable to talk to a woman without touching her.' Her comments come amid revelations that police raided a party at the home of the It's A Knockout presenter in August 1986 after complaints by his neighbours. Shamed: Broadcaster Stuart Hall pictured outside Preston Crown Court on Thursday . Officers discovered the presenter naked in the garden of his £2million mansion as a female guest swam in the nude in his pool. According to the Sunday Mirror, a friend quoted at the time of the incident said: 'Stuart's mouth dropped open when the policemen walked round to the back of the house. He recovered his cool and covered up with a towel. Everyone was having a great time.' Officers warned Hall to keep the noise down and left the party. The incident occured just a few weeks after Hall abused an 11-year-old girl. Ms McDougall, who only spoke out about Hall's behaviour after he admitted his crimes in court last week, said she had no idea he was a paedophile. She said everyone at the Corporation must have known what was going on but he was 'local hero' and if she complained, she would have been the one who was sacked. Another colleague, rugby league commentator Eddie Waring, told how Hall once boasted that he had bedded more than 100 women over the course of filming one series of It's A Knockout - which typically took around three months. Mr Waring, who died in 1986, confided in a friend how he was left stunned by Hall claiming he lured naive girls back to hotel room by telling them he could make them famous. According to The Sunday People, Mr Waring told the friend: 'I was astonished by what he was telling me. 'If he wasn't trying to bed the show's Score Card girls, he was trying to pull the sexiest girls in the crowd. He told me most were in their late teens. 'He was shameless and once revealed he had slept with 100 girls during one series.' And another former studio worker has told The Mail on Sunday how floor manager Peter Barlow was nicknamed 'The Pimp' and lured victims for Hall to the BBC’s Manchester studios for fake auditions. The source claims that the women were lured to a room where Barlow filmed them having sex with the It’s A Knockout host. The new accusations increase pressure for an inquiry, similar to the Jimmy Savile investigation, into how bosses turned a blind eye while Hall molested girls at BBC studios. The latest incidents were said to have happened in Hall’s dressing room, next to the office of news editor Tom German and regional manager Ray Colley. On one occasion it is claimed Hall and Barlow even approached the studio’s production team to have the films processed. The allegations echo an account of one of his victims, Susan Harrison, who told how when she was 16 the presenter picked her out at a school speech day and persuaded her to visit him at the BBC on the pretext of recording a song. He later got her drunk and molested her in his car. Detectives believe other BBC staff may have helped Hall, now 83, trick girls seeking fame into visiting him. Presenter: Stuart Hall pictured in 1968. Detectives believe that other BBC staff may have helped Hall trick girls into visiting him . Last night the former employee said . the abuse took place at the studio for regional news programme Look . North from the late 1970s until the show moved offices in 1981. The ex-staff member said: ‘It was an . open secret that Stuart Hall used to film sex videos in his dressing . room with women procured for him by Peter Barlow. Peter’s nickname was . The Pimp and he was very close to Stuart – he used to drive him to Look . North and It’s A Knockout. ‘Peter . would tell women to come into the Look North studio for an audition and . the pair would pretend to film the women while they presented the . weather forecast. ‘Afterwards they would take  them to Stuart’s dressing room and Peter would film him having sex with them. ‘On one occasion they approached the processing team to process a video but they point-blank refused, they wouldn’t go near it. ‘Women would come by Stuart’s dressing room on a daily basis. 'Stuart . liked the women aged about 18. He would meet them on It’s A Knockout, . some of them were score girls, or he also picked up the pageant winners . from beauty contests he used to judge. ‘Everyone . knew what was going on but no one did anything about it because he was . the golden boy. As far as the bosses were concerned, as long as he read . the news he could do what he liked. It was total mismanagement by the . BBC. 'Next to Stuart’s . dressing room were the offices of Tom German and Ray Colley. They . weren’t stupid and it was obvious these women were having sex in . Stuart’s office. This all needs to be revealed, as it was with Savile. Honour: Hall pictured receiving the OBE for his services to broadcasting and charity last year . ‘I . felt sick when I found out Stuart had been abusing underage girls. It’s . awful because we used to visit schools around Lancashire and get . children to take part in cookery competitions. 'It’s awful now to think back and know that probably helped him do those disgusting things. ‘There were odd things about Stuart. We used to collect tins for charity. 'I remember getting some salmon and Stuart kept it because he said the pensioners we were collecting for wouldn’t know what to do with it. It’s little things like that that really tell you about someone’s character.’ MPs and Hall’s victims have called on the BBC to investigate his behaviour after he admitted assaulting 13 girls, the youngest of whom was nine, between 1967 and 1986. In the aftermath of his guilty pleas, it emerged the married father of two told staff that girls he took to his dressing room were his ‘nieces’. Peter Barlow died aged 86 in 2007 and Tom German died aged 66 in 1992. When approached by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Colley, 83, said: ‘While Stuart Hall is awaiting sentence it would be inappropriate to comment.’ The BBC has no plans to set up a separate inquiry into Hall, saying it has passed any information on to the Dame Janet Smith Review, which is looking at practices at the BBC during the years of Savile’s abuse. However, last night Conservative MP Rob Wilson said: ‘My gut instinct is the BBC are not using the Smith Review to get to the truth and are instead using it to do the minimum necessary to carry on as before.’ A spokesman for The National Association for People Abused in Childhood said: ‘It’s disgusting the BBC gave Hall unfettered opportunities to carry out his abuse. ‘The BBC owes it to his victims to open a new inquiry that can scrutinise his behaviour and the colleagues who may have helped him.’ Hall and the BBC are facing potential compensation payouts after six victims contacted solicitor Alan Collins, a partner at the law firm Pannone who is also pursuing the BBC over the Savile scandal. The BBC said: ‘All allegations that have been made to the BBC in relation to Stuart Hall have been passed on to the police or the Dame Janet Smith Review.’","Linda McDougall worked with Hall at BBC Manchester in the 1960s .

Complaint: Murdock says that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice . But Rice was not disciplined until Murdock showed him the footage in November.

When asked about the suspension at the time, Pernetti said: 'I was made aware of some things within the last couple of weeks. We commenced a thorough, lengthy and fair investigation and this was the result of that investigation. 'There was obviously some things that are not to the Rutgers' standard that we evaluated and decided upon.' In an interview with WFAN, Pernetti said university president Robert Barchi saw the tape and concurred with his actions against Rice. ESPN aired the videotape on Tuesday and it has many on social media criticizing Rutgers, including NBA superstar LeBron James. Murdock stayed with the team for two years until July 2012, when his contract was not renewed. Murdock claims he was fired after he reported Rice’s antics, a claim Pernetti denies.

But a Scottish lawyer who also played Gerry Lane - as the actor's body double - took home a slightly more meagre fee - £4.44 an hour. David Patterson, 26, an Edinburgh-based solicitor from Lasswade in Midlothian, started filming at 6am and had to be on set for 18 gruelling hours of filming in Glasgow. He was told not to speak to Mr Pitt, engaged to fellow superstar Angelina Jolie, and took home a modest £80 for his efforts. Disparity: David Patterson, the body double for Brad Pitt in World War Z, earned just £4.44 an hour. By contrast, the superstar actor earned £9million for his role as a UN worker trying to survive an undead outbreak . Yet car-lover Mr Patterson, whose job takes him the length and breadth of Scotland, was glad to be involved in such an epic movie, which cost an estimated £250million to make, and said he didn't do it for the money. He said: 'I basically had to be Brad for the day and copy everything he did on screen. 'Brad was there the entire time, and they were filming over the course of months, so it must have been quite tough.' Despite his role in the film, which is tipped to have a sequel filmed next year, he told the Daily Mirror he hasn't yet found the time to watch it. He also wasn't invited to the UK premiere and didn't even get an autograph.

Pitt, as a UN operative, is forced to battled the undead in the film, which is tipped for a sequel . Yet he still relished the experience. Many of his scenes with Mr Pitt were filmed in a supermarket in Glasgow. He followed the actor around, mirroring his actions as he ran through the shop desperately salvaging food as apocalyptic events rage outside. Amazingly Mr Patterson made the spur-of-the-moment decision to try out as an extra during a shopping trip in Glasgow and didn't expect anything to come of it. He told the Scottish Sun: 'I was actually in court when I got the message. 'I had to ask my boss if I could go but they were very supportive.' 'I needed to appear like I wasn’t starstruck — but I was.' Mr Patterson was selected because his physique is similar to the Tinseltown sex symbol and had to wear identical clothes for the shoot. He added: 'I had the same physique as him – we were both slim-built – though not any more, as I’ve put on weight since then.

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 06:32 EST, 7 September 2011 . The U.S. could once again be hit by a similar terrorist attack to 9/11,  according to the country's Defense Secretary. Pentagon chief Leon Panetta said citizens must remain 'vigilant' and that the threat of a repeat of an event like Sepember 11 was 'very real'. He added that the terrorist threat had, since the capturing or killing of Al Qaeda's top leaders in recent months, now evolved - with Yemen currently posing the biggest threat. Sombre: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta (left) pictured in front of the Survivor Tree with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (right) during a visit to the site of the World Trade Center 9/11 Memorial . His comments came during a visit to Ground Zero, where he walked through the National September 11 Memorial Park and Museum with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Speaking from the 10th floor of 7 World Trade Center, the first completed office tower at the site of the attacks, he said: 'The potential for that kind of attack remains very real.' New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has urged Americans to stop referring to the site of the September 11 attacks as 'Ground Zero' to help the nation move past a term linked with the World Trade Center's destruction. New Yorkers started calling the World Trade Center site Ground Zero shortly after suicide hijackers destroyed the twin towers and killed nearly 3,000 people. 'We will never forget the devastation of the area that came to be known as ground zero. Never. But the time has come to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum,' Bloomberg said in a speech on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. Ground Zero originated as a term to describe the site of a nuclear explosion and later was used to refer to the point of any dramatic or violent event. Tribute: The World Trade Center North Tower memorial pool . For several years the site was also known as 'the pit' because reconstruction of a new World Trade Center was stalled, leaving a large hole in the ground. But today it is an active construction site with two of four planned skyscrapers under construction and the memorial plaza set to open in time for the 10th anniversary of the attacks. Mr Panetta was given an early glimpse of the memorial during his trip.He was shown its 30-foot man made walls of water that hug the sides of one-acre reflecting pools, that lie where the Twin Towers once stood. The water is meant to signify falling tears. And he also visited the Survivor Tree, a non-fruit bearing pear tree rescued from the site after the attacks, and took a peek inside the still being built entrance to the museum. Reflection: A view of the World Trade Center North Tower memorial pool at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in New York today . But a visit to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, was cancelled because of bad weather. It meant he was unable to see the area where hijackers flew United Airlines Flight 93 into the ground, killing all 40 passengers and crew shortly after the coordinated terrorist attack began in New York. The 9/11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, including 184 at the Pentagon. The names of every person who died in the attacks, including those at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, are inscribed in bronze panels that edge the reflecting pools at the Twin Towers site. Mr Panetta's spokesman, Doug Wilson, said the Pentagon chief wanted to visit Shanksville and New York to highlight the role the military has played over the past decade in preventing further attacks on the homeland. Tragedy: The 9/11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, including 184 at the Pentagon . Accompanying him on his trip yesterday were five service members - one each from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. The visit also recalled the most memorable event of Panetta's tenure as CIA director - the killing of Osama Bin Laden in May. Mr Panetta, who was a private citizen on the day of the attacks but who happened to be on Capitol Hill at the time, will attend 9/11 memorial events at the Pentagon on Sunday. Bloomberg noted that lower Manhattan has thrived in recent years since the fall of the twin towers, gaining 4,000 new school seats, 19 new hotels, $260million in new parks and more new residents in the past decade than Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia combined. The area now boasts its highest population since the 1920s, he said. Speaking to community leaders at the Association for a Better New York breakfast, Bloomberg continued: 'New York has come roaring back faster than anyone thought possible,' Bloomberg said, adding, 'I believe the rebirth and revitalization of Lower Manhattan will be remembered as one of the greatest comeback stories in American history. 'And I believe it will stand as our greatest monument to those we lost on 9/11.' When completed, the tallest tower at the reconstructed World Trade Centre site will soar to 1,776ft - making it the tallest tower in the U.S. upon completion.","Pentagon chief tells Americans to 'remain vigilant'

Archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in Leicester. It seems an unlikely resting place for a monarch. Historians believe they have finally discovered where King Richard III is buried – under a council car park in Leicester. According to records, the last medieval king of England was buried in a Franciscan friary in the area after being killed by the army of Henry Tudor during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. The friary was, however, knocked down during Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, and the exact location of the burial site has been one of Britain’s enduring historical mysteries ever since. Now, after closely examining ancient maps, archaeologists believe the most likely site for the church is a car park of a social services office in the centre of Leicester. Yesterday, they began digging it up. Richard was King of England for two years, from 1483 until the Battle of Bosworth. His death at the age of 32 marked the end of 30 years of civil war, known as the Wars of the Roses, and the end of the middle ages. It also marked the dawn of the Tudor dynasty and the demise of the Plantagenets. His clothes and armour were removed and his naked body carried on horseback to Leicester, where the corpse was displayed in public for three days. He was then buried in the Franciscan friary, known as Greyfriars, but just over 50 years later the church was destroyed. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists prepare for the dig at Greyfriars car park in Leicester watched by actors dressed as Knights from Historic Equitation Ltd during an archaeological search for the lost grave of Richard III. Legend says the body was removed and cast into the river Soar, but historians hope to prove wrong this disputed version of events by finding it at the council site. The archaeologists, from Leicester University, along with members of the Richard III Historical Society, hope finding the remains will help to change the way the monarch is viewed historically. Richard III is traditionally seen as a tyrant who murdered his way to the throne, disfigured by a hunchback and a withered arm. Claire Graham uses ground penetration radar (GPR) at Greyfriars car park in Leicester as the search for Richard IIIs remains gets underway . In a field behind Fenn Lane Farm near Leicester, the treeline marks the spot where Richard III is believed to have been killed in battle. The 69p stamp featuring Richard III . Born . in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 . until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. According to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into battle, your head shall be broken on the return'. On the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle . He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a . hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an . image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by . Shakespeare. Many historians, however, claim that a distorted image of the king was deliberately created by the Tudors, the most notorious example of which is Shakespeare’s play about him. The Richard III Historical Society said it hoped the excavation, which is projected to last two weeks, would end ‘the enormous disparagement’ of his reputation. The site of the friary was bought by Alderman Robert Herrick, the Mayor of Leicester, in 1612, after the church was demolished in 1538. He built a mansion there. In 1914, Leicestershire County Council bought the land, later turning it into a car park. Archaeologists will start by digging two long trenches across the car park, hoping to find remains of the church and narrow down the search. They will also use ground-penetrating radar to find the best places to dig. Richard Buckley, co-director of the Archaeology Service at the university, said: ‘It is quite a long shot but it’s a very exciting project. We don’t know precisely where the body would have been buried but we suspect it would be in the choir or near the altar.’ If bones are found they will be assessed for trauma to the skeleton. Richard was hacked down after being surrounded and one historical account suggests that the blow which finally felled him was so hard that fragments of his helmet were left in his skull. They will also be subjected to DNA analysis. The remains will be matched against the DNA of Joy Ibsen, a 16th generation descendant of Anne of York, the sister of Richard III. Mrs Ibsen died four years ago, aged 82. At the site yesterday, Mrs Ibsen’s son Michael, 55, watched as the search began. The furniture-maker, who was born in Canada but now lives in London, said his mother would have been thrilled by the project. ‘The family were entertained when she got the call several years ago from a historian claiming she was a descendant,’ he added. The Chiddingly Boar, medieval silver-gilt livery badge of Richard III, helped researchers pinpoint the location of the battle of Bosworth when is was found in east Sussex in 1999 . Archaeologist Dr Glenn Foard shows today how the badge of the boar led them to pinpoint the battlefield and where the king fell. 'This is almost certainly from a knight in Richard's retinue, who rode with him to his death on that last charge,' he said .

A depiction of the carnage during the Battle of Bosworth Field by 18th century painter Philip James de Loutherbourg (1740-1812) The Battle of Bosworth Field was . fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War . Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and . Lancaster. One of the . most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard . III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best . known quotations. The leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks. The battle marked the final . confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger . Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster. The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483. Support . for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger . brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel. Following . an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, . Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485. Gathering . support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and . intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. After . Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII . and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted . until 1603.","Dig hopes to uncover the church of the Franciscan Friary, known as Greyfriars .
