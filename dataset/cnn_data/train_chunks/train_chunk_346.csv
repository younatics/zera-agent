"(CNN) -- Lemony Snicket's ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" will now be told as a TV series. According to reports, Netflix is developing a small-screen version of the popular children's book series written by Daniel Handler, who crafted them under the pen name Lemony Snicket. Handler's stories followed a trio of siblings encountering one disaster after another, starting with the death of their parents in a fire. The stories can be dark, but they're also engaging and humorous -- the kind of stuff that a family could enjoy together, said Netflix's Cindy Holland, vice president of original content. ""On the search for fantastic material that appeals to both parents and kids, the first stop for generations of readers is 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' "" Holland said in a statement to Deadline. ""The world created by Lemony Snicket is unique, darkly funny and relatable. We can't wait to bring it to life for Netflix members."" Snicket, speaking from an ""undisclosed location,"" told The Hollywood Reporter that he couldn't believe the news. ""After years of providing top-quality entertainment on demand, Netflix is risking its reputation and its success by associating itself with my dismaying and upsetting books,"" the ""Unfortunate Events"" narrator said. Audiences have seen Snicket's tales brought to life before with Paramount's 2004 live-action movie starring Jim Carrey, Jude Law and Meryl Streep. Paramount Television is producing this original series with Netflix, along with author Handler as the executive producer.","Netflix is adapting ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" into a TV series .

"(CNN) -- If a young Robin Wright had gotten her wish, she would've wed Cary Elwes. The now 48-year-old actress recalls in the June/July issue of Town and Country magazine that she had a definite crush on her ""Princess Bride"" co-star as they were working on Rob Reiner's 1987 film. ""Cary was so good looking,"" Wright says. ""I was convinced we were going to be married."" At the very least, she got to have an on-screen happy ending with the actor in the cult favorite film, which tells the story of Princess Buttercup's longing to reunite with her true love, Elwes' ""As you wish"" Westley. ""It was my first film experience, and so you might say that I fully immersed myself in the role,"" Wright tells Town and Country. ""I did not act. It was mostly telling myself, 'Don't be an idiot in front of Mandy Patinkin and Christopher Guest.' "" Wright's come a long way since her days playing princess, and she now co-stars with Kevin Spacey in Netflix's praised ""House of Cards."" Although fans -- and critics -- love her as the calculating wife of Spacey's politician, Frank Underwood, Wright has begun to enjoy working behind the camera more. In the second season of ""House of Cards,"" she makes her directorial debut in the 10th episode. ""I've been in this business almost 30 years, and I'm such a control freak. You're sitting around knowing how a scene should be blocked or the direction an actor should be given, and biting your tongue,"" Wright tells the magazine. ""I loved being in the driver's seat. I honestly don't want to act anymore."" Part of that ambivalence might have something to do with the roles she's been offered; if the main duty was just to stand and be pretty, Wright says she's had no problem passing them up. ""Hollywood is difficult to navigate if you have integrity, so I opted not to work if there wasn't enough to do in a role, which doesn't have to do with the role's size,"" she says. ""If there's nothing for me to do as an actress, that's frustrating. ... I'd rather go work at a menial labor job, where I can actually get my hands dirty."" It's a good thing portraying ""House of Cards'"" Claire Underwood involves plenty of dirty work.","Robin Wright talks about her first feature film role in ""Princess Bride""

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are bracing for a rough election night next Tuesday, and top leaders are making a major push for rank and file members to open their wallets to help save those vulnerable Democrats who are in danger of losing their seats. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep Steve Israel, D-New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, held a conference call Tuesday afternoon with House Democrats and told them it was time to pony up -- and gave them a Friday deadline. According to a source on the call, a dozen House members and two Democratic candidates pledged almost $500,000 during the session. Several Democratic sources told CNN that members are expecting Republicans to pick up some seats, but they still believe that many House Democrats in competitive districts are positioned to survive if they get support. The DCCC has invested heavily in field operations with 950 staff in 40 districts. But the surge of outside money from GOP groups on new television and radio spots, combined with contributions from several wealthy GOP candidates, has Democrats concerned. In a memo circulated to House Democrats, the DCCC chairman argued that the uptick in GOP spending by outside groups was something the committee was prepared to counter. Israel wrote that despite the effort by Republicans and their allies, ""not a single Democratic incumbent is out of contention. This is a stark contrast from 2010, where many incumbents were already down and out despite our best efforts."" But Israel also said, ""This climate is incredibly challenging and only getting harder."" So, with seven days left before the midterms, the leaders stepped up the pressure on members to give now. The DCCC has consistently out-raised its GOP counterpart over the course of the 2014 election cycle. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, House Democrats have raised over $172 million for the midterms, while House Republicans have raised about $131 million. For Democrats, much of the money has been brought in by top leaders like Pelosi, Israel and Rep Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat. The purpose of the call on Tuesday was to make it clear that they expect others, especially those who were given plum committee posts by their leaders, to lend a hand. There are always members in both parties who sit on money in their campaign accounts at the end of an election cycle. Some of these members might be considering a bid for the Senate or governor, or may be reluctant to share the cash with their colleagues. But the ones who spent hours hosting fundraisers and trekking over to the Democratic headquarters to dial donors for dollars are frustrated with colleagues who don't reach their targets and don't seem to suffer major repercussions. According to a DCCC dues sheet obtained by CNN, about 90% of House Democrats have contributed to the campaign committee, but 77 -- less than half of the House Democratic caucus -- have paid the full amount of dues for the 2014 midterms. Leaders were expected to raise between $450,000 and $800,000 for this cycle, and data from the DCCC shows 37 House Democrats exceeded their goals. Democrats on key committees overseeing banks, telecommunications companies, and other industries who donate to campaigns are also expected to raise significant money -- between $200,000 and $500,000 per election cycle, depending on their committee and seniority. But the 2013-2014 dues sheet shows many of those committee leaders fell short on their fundraising goals. For example, Michigan Rep Sander Levin, who is the top Democrat on the tax writing committee, gave $525,000 -- more than his assigned $500,000. But California Democratic Rep Henry Waxman, who is the most senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel, and a close ally of Pelosi's, has sent in $10,000 of his $500,000 in dues. Waxman's office did not respond to an inquiry from CNN. Internal tallies of members' campaign contributions are regularly shared among House Democrats. Making sure fellow Democrats see the spreadsheets that show who is paying up and who isn't is a tool leaders hope will shame those who haven't given significant amounts yet to write checks. But it's also a list leaders keep in mind when they decide who gets to keep slots on powerful committees in the next Congress.","Democratic leaders seek campaign donations from rank and file representatives .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Obama sent a direct message to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weeks before this month's disputed election, Iranian sources said Wednesday. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calls for an end to protests last week at Tehran University. The letter requested dialogue and engagement between the two nations, the sources said. The sources said that Khamenei has yet to reply to the letter but that nonetheless it ""had set the negotiating table in order for both sides to sit around it after the election."" The White House refused to ""get into the specifics of our different ways of communicating,"" a senior Obama administration official said. ""We have indicated a willingness to talk for a long time and have sought to communicate with the Iranians in a variety of ways,"" the official said. Khamenei made an indirect reference to the letter in his sermon on Friday at Tehran University. ""The U.S. president said that we were waiting for a day like this to see people on the street,"" the Iranian leader said. ""Some people attributed these remarks to Obama, and then they write letters to say we're ready to have ties, that we respect the Islamic Republic, and on the other hand, they make such comments. Which one should we believe?"" One Iranian source said, ""We thought President Obama would send congratulations to President Ahmadinejad,"" and before the election, his senior advisers prepared a response to the anticipated note, which never came. The Iranian source said the election dispute is wasting time on the issue of starting U.S.-Iranian negotiations.  Watch how the reported letter is part of a new policy of engagement » . ""The longer it is delayed,"" the source said, ""the less likely [U.S.-Iranian talks] will happen."" Another Iranian government official said there is still ""no trust"" between Iran and the United States. The source said he is waiting for ""real change"" even though the Iranian government welcomed the change in tone of the Obama administration before the current election turmoil in Iran. The official went on to cite a recent gesture by Iran toward Obama: the release of journalist Roxana Saberi. The official said Iran accepted Obama's assurances that she was not a spy and had allowed the Iranian citizen to leave the country. Since, under intense scrutiny amid growing concerns over Tehran's violent crackdown on street protests, Obama has sharpened his language on Iran. ""The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days,"" Obama said Tuesday, adding that he strongly condemns ""these unjust actions."" He has not spoken in support of Ahmadinejad or his main rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supporters have taken to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term. Obama's letter to Khamenei is in keeping with his publicly stated aim of engagement with Iran and his New Year's message in which he described a new way forward. The Obama administration has ""made it clear that any real dialogue -- multilateral or bilateral -- needed to be authoritative,"" according to the senior administration official. The official noted that the Iranians have yet to respond to a diplomatic outreach made during talks on Iran's nuclear program April 8. At that time, the administration asked the European Union's international policy chief, Javier Solana, to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany. But the administration's tack toward Iran may be changing, as senior officials in Washington said the Obama administration is seriously considering not extending further invitations to Iranian diplomats for July 4 celebrations overseas. Some invitations had been sent and will not be rescinded, senior administration officials said. The officials said intense discussions on the issue were taking place, but the final decision had not been made. The Obama administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of Obama's policy of engaging the Iranian regime. As part of that engagement, Obama videotaped a message for the Iranian people on the Persian new year, and U.S. officials have engaged members of the Iranian government. CNN's Elise Labott and Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","White House refuses to ""get into the specifics,"" administration official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Barion Perry was detained at the crime scene, handcuffed after being suspected of breaking into cars. Without specifically being asked by police to identify the suspect, a neighbor pointed out Perry from a nearby window as the alleged thief. Now, the Supreme Court has found that initial identification was not overly suggestive and did not violate the due process rights of the defendant. The 8-1 ruling Wednesday is a victory for the state and for law enforcement. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned police and prosecutors in general to be careful about the trustworthiness of eyewitness testimony, when such evidence may be generated and manipulated by police. She said, however, that was not the case here. ""We do not doubt the either the fallibility or the importance of eyewitness evidence generally, or the caution appropriate whenever suggestive circumstances may have influenced an identification,"" she wrote for the majority. ""Safeguards built into our adversary system [of justice] can serve to inhibit juries from placing undue weight on eyewitness and other testimony of questionable reliability... Absent improper police conduct, these safeguards, we hold, keep the introduction of eyewitness identification evidence within constitutional bounds."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissenter. The court's narrow ruling was not likely to open the legal floodgates to a range of new exceptions of evidence jurors would be excluded from hearing at trial, as some states had feared. The Perry appeal also raised larger questions about the unique power of eyewitness identifications to sway jurors, and whether innocent people are unfairly being sent to prison, particularly to death row. The court has not taken a hard look at the issue since 1977, and the opinion Wednesday only dealt indirectly with the concerns. The unique facts of the Perry case in fact, left a clear rule on the boundaries of using unreliable identification evidence even more elusive and muddled, despite the high court's current intervention. The message from the high court: A broader rule on the use of all eyewitness testimony is now not necessary, and that judges and juries can make those discretionary decisions, depending on each individual case. Several justices noted during November's oral arguments Perry's lawyers presented strong evidence, and that reforms may be necessary. But others on the bench wondered whether such changes are mandated under the Constitution, and if they would apply in other areas of criminal justice where evidence is problematic. The incident happened in August 2008 in Nashua, New Hampshire. A black male was reported at the back of an apartment parking lot in the middle of the night. A city police officer arrived and found Perry carrying two amplifiers, which he claimed he found on the ground. An apartment resident then approached police and said his car was broken into, information relayed by his neighbor. While Perry was detained in the parking lot, that officer went to the apartment to interview the neighbor. When asked to describe the suspect, she said it was a ""tall black man,"" but offered no other physical details. When asked by the officer for more information, the neighbor looked back and said ""it was the man that was in the back parking lot standing with the police officer,"" according to court records. Later at the police station, the female neighbor was unable to identify Perry from a photo lineup. Perry was then arrested, subsequently convicted of theft, and given a three- to 10-year prison term. He appealed, saying the eyewitness testimony should have been suppressed. Subsequent state courts rejected his claims that due process protections apply even when the suggestive circumstances were not ""intentionally orchestrated by the police.""Eyewitness identification has been closely scrutinized by a range of legal groups and social scientists -- some 2,000 empirical studies, in fact, over the past three decades, according to one legal brief filed with the high court. It has also become a staple of crime dramas: a witness rises from the stand, points to the defendant and says ""That's the man who did it, I'm sure, your Honor."" But not always. A variety of all-too-human factors can distort, manipulate, or mislead a person's memory, whether spurred by police involvement or not. A new book by law professor Brandon Garrett called ""Convicting the Innocent"" found the initial 250 DNA exonerations around the United States came about after 190 of the prisoners were convicted based on mistaken eyewitnesses. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution mandates the government not ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" That has led to a long line of jurisprudence over what areas of the criminal justice system are covered by the broad provision. The conservative high court majority two years ago said inmates could not go to court to demand, under due process, DNA testing to establish their innocence. ""We are reluctant to enlist the federal judiciary in creating new constitutional code of rules for handling DNA,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts at the time, suggesting that was best left to legislatures. The eyewitness case is Perry v. New Hampshire (10-8974).","The justices rule 8-1 on an issue of identification in a criminal case .
The ruling finds that an initial identification did not violate due process .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A U.S. Marine videotaped throwing a puppy over a cliff while on patrol in Iraq has been kicked out of the Corps, and a second Marine involved has been disciplined, according to a statement released by the Marines. YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site's terms of use. Lance Cpl. David Motari, based in Hawaii with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, is being ""processed for separation"" and received non-judicial punishment, officials said in the statement Wednesday night. The Marine Corps would not specify what that punishment was because of privacy regulations. The statement said Motari received the punishment for his role in the ""episode which generated international attention."" The incident appeared on the Internet web site YouTube in March, sparking outrage from animal rights groups around the world. In the video, Motari is seen throwing the dog off a cliff as it yelps. A second Marine, San Diego-based Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion, received non-judicial punishment as well. Janice Hagar, a spokeswoman for the Marines in San Diego, said Encarnacion shot the video. Marine officials at the Pentagon would not disclose the severity of the disciplinary action against Encarnacion, also because of privacy regulations. CNN did not receive a response from the Marine Corps in San Diego to questions about the case. The statement said the Marines conducted an investigation as soon as the YouTube video came to the attention of commanders. ""The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated,"" according to the statement. On the video, Motari smiles as he is holding the puppy and then hurls the dog over a cliff. An unknown person operating the video cameras is heard laughing and another voice saying ""that's mean, Motari."" In a statement, the Humane Society of the United States applauded the Marine Corps' decision to punish those involved. ""The bad actors in this case have been dealt with by the Marine Corps, which rightly recognizes that harming animals is unacceptable conduct,"" said Dale Bartlett, the group's deputy manager for animal cruelty issues. ""Now, the Department of Defense and the Congress must step up protection from cruelty for all animals under the law governing military conduct.""","Hawaii-based Lance Cpl.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court gave its blessing Wednesday to a federal law giving copyright protection to millions of international books, music and other artistic creations that had once been in the free-access ""public domain."" The 6-2 ruling is a setback for a coalition of groups that had sought to keep works by foreign artists easily available in the United States without payment of royalties. At issue was whether the Constitution's ""Progress Clause"" prohibited Congress from taking such works out of the public domain. A group of artists, film archivists, and educators sued after an international treaty signed by the United States restored copyright protection to thousands of once-royalty-free works originating in other countries. The plaintiffs made a free-speech argument, claiming the ruling would create an artistic vacuum, making a large body of songs and films out of their reach, if they had to pay fees. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, downplayed such concerns. ""Neither congressional practice nor our decisions treat the public domain, in any and all cases, as untouchable by copyright legislation,"" she said. Provisions in the law do ""not unconstitutionally abridge speech."" The plaintiffs were supported by the ACLU, Internet website giants like Google, and library groups. The big winners in the dispute are larger media and publishing companies, which hope this high court decision will now lead to greater reciprocal access to foreign markets for American books, music, films, television and other creative endeavors. Among the works in question were Pablo Picasso and M.C. Escher artwork, novels by Virginia Woolf and J.R.R. Tolkien, and music by Sergei Prokofiev, composer of ""Peter and the Wolf""-- which is frequently performed in community orchestras. One of the original key plaintiffs was American musician Richard Kapp. He had created derivative recordings based on several compositions of the classic Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, but was later prevented from releasing them. Kapp died in 2006. ""Libraries and digital repositories are using new technologies to make our cultural commons more accessible than ever, but they need a robust and stable public domain to be able to do that crucial work,"" said Julie Samuels, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which filed a brief supporting Kapp and others. The federal provision ""has up-ended a basic tenet of copyright law: once a work enters the public domain, it stays in the public domain."" The 1994 law in question was designed to put the United States in compliance with global treaties on intellectual property-- the Berne Convention and the so-called Uruguay Round. The federal legislation created copyrights to foreign works that had not previously been covered. The U.S. Copyright Office told the high court that millions of works would now receive copyright restoration. Public domain works can be freely reproduced, performed, downloaded and shared. ""Congress determined that U.S. interests were best served by our full participation in the dominant system of international copyright protection,"" said Ginsburg. Justices Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito dissented. ""The (federal) statute has significant First Amendment costs,"" wrote Breyer. ""... By withdrawing material from the public domain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow of information."" Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case. She recused herself after earlier being involved in defending the law while serving as solicitor general in the Justice Department just before joining the high court in 2010. The case is Golan v. Holder (10-545).","The ruling means royalties will have to be paid for some foreign works .

"PLEASANT GROVE, Utah (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court wrestled on Wednesday with how to handle a small religious group's effort to erect a granite monument in a Utah park, next to an existing Ten Commandments display, in a free-speech case involving competing faiths, politics and social norms. The U.S. Supreme Court hears a case mixing religion, politics and social norms with national implications. On one side is Summum, a tax-exempt religious organization that believes in mummification, the rites of transference, and ""The Seven Aphorisms,"" which include the Principle of Psychokinesis and the Principle of Vibration, among others. Opposing them are the elected leaders of Pleasant Grove, Utah, who control the small patch of public land in question. At issue is whether such donated monuments on public property represent ""private"" or ""government"" speech. A ruling from the justices clarifying the difference would affect municipalities nationwide, as well as a range of expressive memorials, from 9/11 victim tributes to battlefield markers. ""The heart of the question is whether the government may discriminate based on content, and that's a First Amendment question,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. Local officials in Pleasant Grove want the discretion to decide the kinds of permanent displays that can be erected in the park, because they would claim ultimate ownership and control. Summum, a Salt Lake City-based group, wants to put up a three-foot granite slab on the ""Seven Aphorisms of Summum,"" at their expense. Necessary permits were denied, so Summum sued, saying it was being discriminated against. A Ten Commandments monument was placed in the park in 1971 by a private group, the Fraternal Order of Eagles. The justices appeared uneasy with arguments from both sides, posing a range of hypotheticals to explore the free speech limits cities and private groups should enjoy. ""You have a Statute of Liberty, do we have to have a statue of despotism?"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""Or do we have to put up any president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore?"" ""Suppose they only accept Democrats who are sculptors,"" for donated artworks, asked Justice Stephen Breyer, ""and they reject all the Republicans?"" The Bush administration supports the Utah town. Deputy Daryl Joseffer told the court that municipal ownership implies control. ""It chooses to display it, and then it can do whatever it wants with it. It can move it, modify it, destroy it, drop it to the bottom of the ocean, sell it on eBay."" But Justice David Souter warned about unfettered government discretion to approve or disapprove a particular message. ""That is control with a vengeance,"" he said. ""The government says: OK, we'll take the Eagles monument. We will not on identical terms take the Summum monument because we disagree with the message... Why isn't that a First Amendment violation?"" ""There is a fundamental difference between opening up a forum, taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go in,"" said Jay Sekulow, head of the American Center for Law and Justice, which is representing the city, ""and another situation where the government is clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason."" ""But really, in this case, the debates as to whether the policy justifications are a sham are relevant,"" countered a skeptical Justice John Paul Stevens, ""You just put up those monuments that agree with the message."" ""Isn't this just government endorsement of this memorial?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Summum was founded in 1975 by Summum ""Corky"" Ra, who said alien visitors -- or ""advanced living beings""-- visited him one day after work, appearing hairless and blue and revealing to him the Summum concepts. After spreading the word and launching his legal fight to erect his monuments, Corky died earlier this year. Classified as a tax-exempt church, the roughly several dozen members of Summum prefer to call themselves a philosophical group. They have no over-arching doctrine or supreme being, but their movement is extensively laid out in pamphlets, on a Web site, and in Internet radio broadcasts. A 27-foot-tall, 40-foot-wide copper-shelled pyramid sits on the group's one-acre site in Salt Lake City. Scattered about are preserved animals encased in bronze, Egyptian symbols, sofas and candles; bright murals adorn the walls. Off to the side is a large stainless-steel fermentation tank, where alcoholic, sacramental ""nectars"" or ""liquid knowledge"" are produced for meditation sessions. Next door is a building where the rite of mummification is performed. It is a key aspect of Summum, central to the idea, says group leader Su Menu, that ""the soul moves forward."" Using resins and fiberglass, the lengthy, sophisticated procedures are performed on site, on pets and humans. Also key are seven principles, or aphorisms. Taking a different path from traditional Christian faith, followers believe Moses first descended from Mount Sinai with the aphorisms instead of the Ten Commandments. ""All we want to do is share what we have with everyone else. I mean, it's not like proselytizing,"" said the 53-year-old Menu, who is a piano teacher. ""Not everyone follows the Ten Commandments, so maybe people are looking for something else, and all we want to do is show them the possibility."" The aphorisms are the seven principles of creation according to the group: psychokinesis, correspondence, vibration, opposition, rhythm, cause and effect, and gender. Pleasant Grove was founded by Mormon settlers in 1850. With a population of 30,000, it lies between Salt Lake City and Provo and is a bedroom community for both. A centerpiece of the town is Pioneer Park, where along with an old schoolhouse and wagons, the Ten Commandments monument sits tucked near a 9/11 memorial placed by a local Boy Scouts troop. ""This park is dedicated to the history of the people, the founding of the city, and significant citizens who have lived and contributed to the community,"" said Mayor Mike Daniels. The Eagles have erected similar monuments in hundreds of other communities since the 1950s. Daniels says that group's long-standing ties to the community and their continuing charity work were reason enough to allow the Ten Commandments to be displayed. A federal appeals court ruled for Summum, concluding parks are a ""public forum"" to which private groups have access under free speech protections. By allowing Ten Commandments displays for decades, the judges concluded, various cities have historically been treating permanent displays on public property as private speech. Summum says the alternative would be for cities to simply ban all such displays, including the Ten Commandments. Although the appeals court dealt strictly with the case as a free speech issue, the justices raised concerns about religious freedom and the constitutional ban on government favoring one religion over another. The Supreme Court has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments, taking a more case-specific approach. Ten Commandments displays in public schools were banned in 1980. But the justices in 2005 allowed a 57-year-old Ten Commandments granite monument to stay on the Texas statehouse grounds, where it stands amid a series of nonreligious symbols. A similar display in Kentucky was ordered removed after the high court concluded it violated the separation between church and state. Unlike Utah, those cases involved efforts to remove the monuments. Then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted there was ""no exact formula"" to determine when such a display crosses the constitutional line. The high court is now being asked to adopt such a distinction. The case is Pleasant Grove v. Summum (07-665). A ruling is expected by June.","Religious group wants to place three-foot granite monument in public park .

"Washington (CNN) -- Justice Clarence Thomas is marking his two decades on the Supreme Court in his characteristic low-key manner. His former law clerks are organizing a reunion, a chance for him to get back in touch with his ""kids,"" as he calls many of the young lawyers who served the prestigious one-year job under him. He is prepared for the court's new term, having spent the summer as he always does, touring the country in his 40-foot-motor home, with his wife Virginia alongside. And there was a recent teaching stint at the University of Nebraska, where he remains a big Cornhuskers football fan, although he was never a student there. All seems good for the 63-year-old jurist, a sharp contrast to the tumultuous weeks of his October 1991 confirmation hearings. The nationally televised drama delved deeply and embarrassingly into his private life, a spectacle that helped usher in an escalating focus on the federal courts -- and the often nasty politics that play out to this day. ""Like the Robert Bork confirmation hearings before them, the Thomas hearings were built on the flames of ideological fights,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a prominent appellate attorney and founder of Scotusblog.com. ""He was regarded as extremely conservative, which he is, and liberal progressives were really very bent on trying to block him from getting on the Supreme Court. They failed initially and then, when the Anita Hill allegations came out, the whole process exploded."" For an institution that values continuity and experience, Justice Thomas now enjoys a professional renaissance of sorts, becoming a key behind-the-scenes force on the right-leaning bench. ""There are obviously some who agree with the mark that he's left and others who disagree,"" said Gregory Garre, a former U.S. solicitor general who has argued several cases before Thomas and the court. ""But I think one thing is certain, and that is that he has left an important mark on the law."" _______________ . Sources close to him say the memories of his wrenching Senate confirmation in October 1991 are not forgotten by any means, but the experience, they say, has given him a greater appreciation of the unique role he now occupies. The Pin Point, Georgia, native was nominated to the high court by President George H.W. Bush to replace an icon -- Justice Thurgood Marshall. There were concerns raised by both Republicans and Democrats over whether Thomas would become the ideological opposite of the civil rights legend, since he had barely a year of judicial experience before being tapped for the Supreme Court. Many people may not remember there were actually two Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Thomas. The first session went pretty much to form, and with little judicial record to go on, lawmakers found little about which to criticize the nominee. Then Anita Hill stepped forward. She was a lawyer who had been hired by Thomas to work in the Education Department and later at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which he headed in the Reagan years. She claimed Thomas made sexually suggestive comments on the job, which Hill considered sexual harassment. In stunning nationally televised testimony, the poised Hill offered lurid details and called Thomas' alleged actions ""behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the court."" Many senators offered both sympathy and skepticism to both Hill and Thomas. He received the final word, telling the committee, ""This is a circus. It's a national disgrace. It is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves."" He was confirmed 52-48, the narrowest margin for a high court pick in a century. _____________ . For most Americans, Thomas slipped into virtual anonymity after he took his judicial oath. He shuns interviews and rarely speaks during arguments. In fact, he has gone five years without speaking when cases are presented in the public sessions. That concerns some private lawyers, including those who count Thomas among their friends. ""I wish, candidly, he would ask the lawyers questions, just to give us an opportunity to at least say something about him,"" said Carter Phillips, who has argued 72 cases before the high court. ""Because there almost invariably are issues in argument that are not briefed in the case, so you feel as though, in one sense, an important participant is kind of marching on a parallel path that's completely removed from your efforts and advocacy."" But those close to the justice say you don't know the real Clarence Thomas. ""Justice Thomas is known as being quiet and taciturn, and hasn't asked a question in years,"" said Carrie Severino, a 2007 law clerk who remains close to him. ""He's actually an incredibly ... great storyteller. He could talk for hours very easily. If you do get into a conversation with him, it's normally a very long and engaging process."" Behind the closed marble hallways of the court, Thomas is well known for his booming voice, hearty laugh, and friendly manner. Colleagues say they are amazed he seems to know every one of the several hundred employees by their names, as well as their families and their problems. He shatters the mold in many ways, and is especially close friends on the court with Justice Stephen Breyer, whose views are considered liberal. The two can often be spotted on the bench whispering in each other's ears, sharing an occasional laugh. ""There are a lot of people who don't like the fact that he breaks their expectations,"" Severino said. ""They expect him as an African-American to be toeing the liberal line, and he's his own man. You know, he's his own man among conservatives. He's not following Justice Scalia, he's not following Chief Justice Roberts. He's going to do his own thing. And the people who might expect him to follow their lead are going to be disappointed."" Doing his own thing has often meant Thomas is a lone dissenter in cases big and small, in issues ranging from state-federal authority to executive immunity and government regulation. The consistency of his conservative views has earned him a quietly influential power base among his colleagues, which only recently has begun to attract public notice. ""In several of the most important areas of constitutional law, Thomas has emerged as an intellectual leader of the Supreme Court,"" wrote CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin, in an essay for The New Yorker. ""Since the arrival of Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005, and Justice Samuel Alito in 2006, the court has moved to the right when it comes to the free-speech rights of corporations, the rights of gun owners, and potentially, the powers of the federal government; in each of these areas, the majority has followed where Thomas been leading for a decade or more. Rarely has a Supreme Court justice enjoyed such broad or significant vindication."" But criticism -- personal and professional -- has not gone away. The latest complaints: calls from liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups for Thomas to pull out of deciding a monumental appeal over President Obama's signature accomplishment, health care reform. Twenty Democratic lawmakers on Thursday formally asked the Justice Department to investigate the justice's appearances before conservative groups, and his failure over the years to publicly disclose about $700,000 of his wife's income, as required under federal law. ""To believe that Justice Thomas didn't know how to fill out a basic disclosure form is absurd,"" said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, on behalf of her colleagues. ""I cannot determine guilt or innocence, but I can request that the government do our due diligence in investigating a situation that strikes me, and many members of Congress, as suspicious."" But even liberal activists say there may be little to force Thomas himself to pull out. ""It's really almost entirely self-enforced,"" said Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. ""So recusal motions, if there is one filed in his case, go directly to Justice Thomas. And there's really no process for his colleagues or anyone to second-guess the decision whether he should recuse or not. So it really is his decision."" Many colleagues wonder whether going his own path in life has been worth it for Thomas. Sources close to him say he admits being concerned about his legacy, but more interested in doing his job as he sees fit, and ultimately being comfortable with the result. Writing in his 2007 autobiography, the justice said his life was ""the story of an ordinary man to whom extraordinary things happened. Putting it down on paper forced me to suffer old hurts, endure old pains, and revisit old doubts. ... Rightly or wrongly, I have an abiding faith that my story will be important to someone.""","Justice's former law clerks are arranging a reunion of his ""kids""

"Washington (CNN) -- Few Americans have any real idea how the Supreme Court operates, since cameras are barred, and the case arguments and opinions are often dry and confusing for nonlawyers. That's too bad because the high court's impact on Americans is incalculable. When disputes arise, the nine justices serve as the final word for a nation built on the rule of law. They interpret the Constitution and all that it brings with it: how we conduct ourselves in society, boundaries for individuals and the government, questions literally of life and death. As the late justice William Brennan once wrote, ""The law is not an end in itself, nor does it provide ends. It is preeminently a means to serve what we think is right."" And whether right or wrong, when it came to deciding who won the 2000 presidential election, it was the court's conclusions that ultimately ended the issue, but not the controversy. Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' A similarly epic constitutional showdown is now before the court over challenges to the health care reform law promoted by congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama -- and opposed by a coalition of 26 states. Article Three of the Constitution says, ""The Judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court ... the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior."" Read a transcript of Monday's court arguments on health care . Here's a look at the history of the court, how it works and how you, the citizen, can interact with it: . Court goes back the late 1700s . The Supreme Court first met in 1790, as the ultimate part of the judicial branch of government. There are nine justices, led by the Chief Justice of the United States (that's the official title). All justices -- and all federal judges -- are first nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. They serve for as long as they choose. The court has occupied its current building in Washington only since 1935. Previously, it borrowed space in Senate chambers in the Capitol Building. The Constitution's framers envisioned the judiciary as the ""weakest,"" ""least dangerous"" branch of government. And while the court has often been accused over the years of being too timid in asserting its power, there is little doubt when the justices choose to flex their judicial muscle, the results can be far-reaching. Just look at how cases such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954 -- integrating public schools), Roe v. Wade (1973 -- legalizing abortion) and even Bush v. Gore (2000) have affected the lives of Americans. Blockbuster decisions by the high court over the years . Traditionally, each term begins the first Monday in October, and final opinions are issued usually by late June. Justices divide their time between ""sittings,"" where they hear cases and issue decisions, and ""recesses,"" where they meet in private to write their decisions and consider other business before the court. Court arguments are open to the public in the main courtroom, and visitors have the option of watching all the arguments or only a small portion. Tradition is very important. You will notice the justices wearing black robes, and quill pins still adorn the desks, as they have for more than two centuries. Where to sit? Seniority counts . The justices are seated by seniority, with the chief justice in the middle. The two junior justices (currently Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan) occupy the opposite ends of the bench. Before public arguments and private conferences, where decisions are discussed, the nine members all shake hands as a show of harmony of purpose. In the past, all lawyers appearing before the court wore formal ""morning clothes,"" but today only federal government lawyers carry on the tradition. The solicitor general is the federal government's principal lawyer before the federal bench. As the gavel sounds and justices are seated, the marshal shouts the traditional welcome, which reads: ""Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the court is now sitting. God save the United States and this Honorable Court."" Frequently asked questions about the court and the case . Arguments usually begin at 10 a.m. and since most cases involve appellate review of decisions by other courts, there are no juries or witnesses, just lawyers from both sides addressing the bench. The cases usually last about an hour, and lawyers from both sides very often have their prepared oral briefs interrupted by pointed questions from a justice. This give-and-take, question-and-answer repartee can be entertaining, and it requires lawyers to think concisely and logically on their feet. And by the tone of their questioning, it often gives insight into a justice's thinking, a barometer of his/her decision-making. You can listen if you like . No cameras are allowed, but the public sessions are audio recorded, and are available for listening, usually several days later. The health care arguments -- for this week -- will be available only shortly after each of the four separate arguments end, at the court's website. After the arguments, conferences are scheduled, where justices discuss and vote on the cases. In these closed-door sessions, the nine members are alone. No clerks or staff are allowed. No transcripts of their remarks are kept, and it is the role of the junior justice (Elena Kagan for the past two years) to take notes and answer any inquiries from the outside. Justices spend much of their time reviewing the cases and writing opinions. And they must decide which cases they will actually hear in open court. When asked just before her 2006 retirement what the jurists do most of the time, Sandra Day O'Connor said bluntly, ""We read. We read on average 1,500 pages a day. We read. Sometimes we write."" Added Justice Antonin Scalia: ""We try to squeeze in a little time for thinking."" Want your case heard? Don't get your hopes up . Each week, the court receives more than 150 petitions for review, decisions by lower courts appealed to the high court. Relatively few are granted full review. About 8,000 to 10,000 such petitions go on the court's docket each term. Only 75 to 85 cases -- about 1% -- are accepted. Oral arguments will then be scheduled, but final opinions may not be written in all such appeals. In addition, some 1,200 legal applications of various types are filed each year that can be acted on by a single justice. Those include stays of executions. The rulings are handed out in both written and electronic form, but the justice writing the majority opinion will usually deliver an oral summary at the beginning of a public session. In extraordinary occasions, the lead dissenting justice can demand equal time with an oral rebuttal. The court's opinions are final. The only exception is the court itself, which can over time overturn its own precedent, as it did with racial segregation. But most justices rely on the principle of ""stare decisis,"" Latin for ""to stand by a decision,"" where a current court should be bound by previous rulings. Case arguments and the opinions are posted on the U.S. Supreme Court's Web site: www.supremecourt.gov.","Court's in session: The marshal shouts the traditional welcome -- ""Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!""

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Televisions are getting wider and thinner, their edges shrinking to make room for displays that pack in more and more pixels. But the real evolution of the TV set isn't taking place with the glossy hardware. It's happening inside. Major TV manufacturers, including Sharp, Sony, Samsung, LG and Panasonic, announced their latest television sets this week at the Consumer Electronics Show here. They all had variations on the same splashy hardware features that were previewed last year -- Ultra HD and OLED screens, more inches (60, 85, 110) -- but now they're closer to being available on consumer products. However, it's the smaller, tablet-inspired features that could end up being more enticing to average consumers. These include improved software interfaces, Internet connectivity and social integration, tablet and smartphone pairing, apps and more options for content sources other than cable. The new Ultra HD 4K screens have four times the number of pixels as standard High Definition TVs. On its own, Ultra HD isn't a compelling reason to upgrade unless you are a video buff, especially since you would have to sit extra close to the set or have an enormous TV to notice the difference between 4K and a lower-resolution screen. Price tags are still sky high for these top-of-the-line TVs. LG said its 55-inch OLED HD TV -- OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode, a technology that provides a crisper picture than most other displays -- will cost $12,000 when it arrives in the U.S. in March. There's also a very limited amount of content in the new pixel-heavy Ultra HD format, though more will likely be churned out in the coming years. More in demand now are features for the growing number of users who want to watch TV on all their screens, big and small, and pull from a large selection of content options, not just the cable feed and their DVR. 5 fun and off gadgets from CES . These are some of the popular new software features from this year's crop of televisions at CES. Many of these new options are already available with less expensive set-top boxes and game consoles that can be paired with your existing TV: . Smartphone-like interfaces . We spend so much time swiping around intuitive smartphone interfaces that navigating through TV menus feels like a harsh trip back in time. Manufacturers are making big efforts to update their user interfaces to be more intuitive. Some models are even running the Android-based Google TV platform, which aims to simplify channel browsing. Samsung showed a revamped, busy interface called the Smart Hub that will appear on its next generation of smart TVs. It is divided into five sections for live TV and recommendations, streaming content, media stored on the computer, social features and apps. One new feature retailers will love is T-Commerce, which will serve up shopping information for the products and outfits you see in your regular TV shows. The new Panasonic DT60 set has a customizable home screen and voice commands. Streaming content and recommendations . In 2013, having hundreds of mediocre channels to choose from isn't enough. And DVRs are limited in their own right. These days people want the option to stream content and order video on demand from Amazon, Netflix, Apple and other sources. Smart TVs are adding support for these Web-based services. For example, Samsung is adding a way to search multiple content sources at once, similar to Matcha.com and CanIStream.it. There's also been a lot of buzz at CES about TVs that offer tailored recommendations. Some feature built-in ""assistants"" that track your viewing habits and then tell you what other shows you might also like to watch, much like Netflix does with its delightfully odd categories. Death of the boring remote . The Channel Up and Down buttons aren't much use when you're bopping between Facebook, HBO, Amazon and photos of your last vacation. TV makers are adding new ways to navigate between these, including gestures and voice control. It's a little bit Wii, a little bit Siri. TV makers also are making apps that can turn tablets and smartphones into remote controls for your set. LG's latest Magic Remote, announced on Monday, acts like a mouse, letting you navigate a pointer around the TV screen by moving the remote. It supports voice-recognition commands and lets you switch channels by waving the remote around to spell out numbers. Samsung's televisions also add more gesture controls so you can zoom in and out on photographs or swipe through the many panes of its new interface. More screens . One giant screen isn't enough for many modern viewers. Smartphones and tablets have become popular as second-screen devices for people who multitask while flipping channels. Just open Twitter during any major televised sporting event to see how people are using a second screen to share commentary about the action. Viewers want the option to start an episode of ""The Vampire Diaries"" on the big TV in the living room and finish it in bed on a tablet. Services such as Netflix and Amazon are already multiscreen, offering streaming video on mobile devices, computers and even your TV through devices such as Xbox and Apple TV. Now smart TVs are adding support for these streaming services plus features that lets your tablet show you a mirror of what's on your TV -- sometimes alongside your social networks. Sony's latest KDL-R550A sets and Panasonic's DT60 have integrated near-field communications (NFC) that allow you to tap your NFC-enabled smartphone or tablet (no Apple products have NFC) to mirror what's on the set or bring up related social content. An upgrading alternative . Smart TVs are expensive, so Samsung has come up with an interesting product to let you upgrade your existing TV without buying a new model. (Cleverly, it doubles as a way to make money from TV buyers between new models.) The Evolution Kit is a black box on the back of a Samsung smart TV that you can replace to upgrade the TV's software and some specifications. The company didn't announce a price for the upgrade module, which was first announced at last year's CES, but says it will be available early this year. The box can update your software to add the newest features and improve your processors for a speedier TV experience. But it can't upgrade the resolution of your screen.","Major TV companies are unveiling their big, ultra high-definition TVs at CES .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Egyptians took part Monday in the funeral of Marwa Sherbini, an Egyptian woman who was stabbed to death last week in the German city of Dresden in a crime believed to be racially motivated. Egyptians take part in the funeral of Marwa Sherbini, who was murdered in Germany last week. Sherbini, 33, was stabbed to death Wednesday in a courtroom as she prepared to give testimony against a German man of Russian descent whom she had sued for insult and abuse. The man, identified in German media as Alex A., 28, was convicted of calling Sherbini, who wore a headscarf, ""terrorist,"" ""bitch"" and ""Islamist"" when she asked him him to leave a swing for her 3-year-old son Mustafa during an August 2008 visit to a children's park. He was fined and appealed the ruling. The two were in court Wednesday for that appeal when Alex A. attacked, pulling out a knife and stabbing Sherbini 18 times. He also stabbed her husband three times and attacked another person. According to Arab media, police officers tried to intervene to end the fight, and a number of shots were fired. One hit the husband, who fell unconscious and is currently in intensive care in the hospital of Dresden University. Sherbini was three months pregnant at the time of her death. Hundreds attended Sherbini's funeral in Alexandria, Egypt, her hometown, among them government officials, including Egyptian Manpower Minister Aisha Abdel Hadi and Telecommunications Minister Tariq Kamel, Egyptian media reported. Many shouted hostile slogans against Germany and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to take a firm stand on the incident. Egypt's grand mufti, Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, demanded the severest punishment to be issued against Alex A. Berlin witnessed angry protests on Saturday, when hundreds of Arabs and Muslims demonstrated after a funeral prayer that called her killing an outrageous racist murder against Muslims. In a phone call with Al Arabiya, Marwa's brother, Tariq Sherbini, said, ""Extremism has no religion. My sister was killed simply because she wore the veil. This incident clearly shows that extremism is not limited to one religion or another and it is not exclusively carried out by Muslims."" ""We are only asking for a fair punishment,"" he said, adding that his sister was not a radical. ""She was a religious woman who prayed and wore her headscarf, but she was killed because of her belief."" Anger about Sherbini's death smoldered online, as Twitterers and bloggers pushed the cause. ""She is a victim of hatred and racism,"" tweeted Ghada Essawy, among many other Arab twitters and bloggers. Essawy called Sherbini ""the martyr of the veil."" Various videos circulated on YouTube calling on Egypt to take action and urging Germany to address what their makers saw as a new wave of hatred against Arabs and Muslims in its community. One video showed various pictures of a young happy Marwa saying that ""The woman stood up for her rights and she was killed. May God bless her."" The English font in the video presentation asked ""when will Egypt cares for its citizens' rights inside Egypt and abroad."" Sherbini and her husband moved to Dresden in 2003, after the husband received a grant to study genetic engineering in the renowned Max Planck Institute. He was scheduled to present his Ph.D. thesis in the coming days. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Sherbini killed in courtroom as she prepared to give testimony against man .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- December was the first month since the beginning of the Iraq war in which there were no U.S. combat deaths, the U.S. military reported. There were three noncombat fatalities. ""That is a very significant milestone for us as we continue to move forward, and I think that also speaks to the level of violence and how it has decreased over time,"" said Army Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. Since the beginning of the war more than six years ago, 4,373 U.S. military members have died -- 3,477 from hostilities and 898 in non-combat incidents. Combat fatalities have decreased significantly since June, when the United States started withdrawing troops from Baghdad, Iraq's capital, and other urban areas. The United States also started a troop drawdown in 2009 from about 160,000 to the current level of around 110,000. The U.S. military suffered double-digit combat-related deaths in February, April, May and June 2009. The highest was 17 in May. There were also eight non-combat deaths in May, making for the highest monthly total in 2009. Since July, U.S. forces have suffered no more than five combat-related deaths each month. There were five in July, three in August, four in September, two in October and four in November. Non-combat deaths outnumbered combat fatalities in March, September, October, November and December. The last U.S. combat death in Iraq reported by CNN occurred November 22, when Sgt. Briand T. Williams, 25, of Sparks, Georgia, died in Numaniyah after insurgents attacked his Army unit. Casualties also have decreased among Iraqis, with Interior Ministry officials reporting in late November that the civilian death toll fell that month to its lowest level since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. According to the Interior Ministry, 2,773 civilians were killed and 8,900 were wounded in 2009. In addition, 242 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 612 were wounded in 2009. In December, the ministry said, 306 Iraqi civilians were killed and 1,137 were wounded; 13 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 32 were wounded. Also in December, 48 Iraqi police were killed and 119 were wounded. November recorded the lowest casualty figures for Iraqis since the U.S.-led invasion, with 88 civilians killed and 332 wounded. In addition, 12 Iraqi soldiers died in November and 44 were wounded. Among Iraqi police, 22 died and 56 were wounded. Previously, January 2009 had the lowest Iraqi civilian casualty figures since 2003. Since then, figures had been fluctuating, with August being the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians in more than a year. Daily violence has drastically dropped across the country over the past two years, but sporadic spectacular attacks, including high-profile suicide bombings against government buildings on August 19, October 25 and December 8, continue to claim hundreds of lives and shake confidence in the abilities of Iraq's security forces. President Obama has said he plans to withdraw all U.S. combat forces from Iraq by August 2010 and all remaining troops by December 2011. Britain, the United States' major ally in Iraq, ended combat operations in April.","NEW: Casualties decreasing among Iraqis with civilian death toll at its lowest in November .

"(CNN) -- Tsunami waves that raced across the Pacific Ocean triggered warnings in more than 50 countries and territories Friday, but there were few immediate reports of major damage outside of Japan. The National Weather Service warnings were later downgraded to advisories for the U.S. state of Hawaii, and the coastal areas of California and Oregon. Warnings remained in effect across wide swaths of the Pacific. Advisories also were in effect along the California-Mexico border and in the coastal areas of Washington, British Columbia and Alaska, the weather service reported. The initial warning list included Russia and Central American countries including Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  The quake, which struck near the coast of Honshu, Japan, on Friday afternoon local time, unleashed powerful pulses in the Pacific. Japan was the first nation to be hit, as a wall of water rushed inland, leveling houses and bashing cars in its path and killing hundreds. The waves also spread out across the ocean.  ""The tsunami is more than one wave, and the waves can be separated by 20 minutes or half an hour. So just because you see a wave come up and then go back in the ocean again, that doesn't mean it's over,"" said Gerard Fryer of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Tsunami waves can travel at speeds of 800 kilometers, or nearly 500 miles, per hour. Sirens sounded in Hawaii around 10 p.m. Thursday, warning residents they could expect tsunami waves five hours later. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said Kauai was the first Hawaiian island hit by the waves, which swept across the remainder of the island chain as 6-foot ocean surges pushed waves ashore. By 8 a.m. Friday, emergency management officials in the Hawaiian island of Oahu had issued an all clear. Still, significant damages were reported at Oahu's Keehi Lagoon, with some 200 vessels affected, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The islands of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii escaped virtually unharmed. On island of Guam, police reported no damage or injuries as the tsunami warning was lifted. Indonesia also lifted its warning after residents rushed to higher ground as emergency officials corralled those in low-lying areas. The northern California counties of Del Norte and Humboldt kept their evacuation orders in place, according to Emergency Management spokesman Brad Alexander. Seven-and-a-half-foot waves crashed into Crescent City, California, causing significant damage there as Coast Guard helicopters circled overhead, he said. San Mateo County had also issued evacuation orders, as had areas in southern California stretching from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border. More than 1,000 residents filled 20 evacuation centers in the state. In southern California's Orange County, all beaches, harbors, piers, marinas and coastal roads were reopened in the cities of Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente as of 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday, county authorities said. But the waterfront in Huntington Beach and Seal Beach remained closed until 4 p.m., authorities said. In the Philippines, the government evacuated 20 coastal areas. Officials said they were getting reports from Isabela province of ""unusual waves"" hitting the coastline. The country's disaster management director, Benito Ramos, said waves had hit the coastal areas of Aparri, Cagayan and Basco, Batanes. Ramos said the tsunami alert remained at level two as a precaution. The administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said employees are ready to assist state and local officials. ""We remind everyone who lives in the region to monitor their local news for instructions from their state and local officials and if told to evacuate -- evacuate,"" Administrator Craig Fugate said. Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said more than 11,000 people living in dangerous areas had been evacuated after a tsunami warning was issued for the Kuril Islands. Ships docked in open ports were heading back out to sea to avoid being hit by tsunami waves, the ministry said. ""This is a very large earthquake,"" Chip McCreary of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. ""We've evaluated it as about the same size as the earthquake last year in Chile. However, it's much closer to the Hawaiian islands than the Chile earthquake."" In Chile, officials upgraded a tsunami warning to an alert for residents of Easter Island Friday evening and urged coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground, CNN Chile reported, citing the country's interior minister. In Mexico, the Interior Ministry issued tsunami warnings that reflect a ""moderate risk"" for the country, warning tourists and fishermen in coastal areas. The National Weather Service list included Japan, Russia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and the United States. Numerous Pacific islands, including some U.S. territories, were also on the list. Friday's 8.9-magnitude temblor in Japan was the largest earthquake since a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck the Banda Aceh area of Indonesia on December 26, 2004, causing a massive tsunami that killed about 250,000 people in 14 countries and washed away entire communities. The tsunami caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations. Friday's earthquake was initially reported as 7.8 magnitude before being upgraded to 8.9. ""When you jump a magnitude from 7 to 8.9, it's not 10 times stronger, it's 1,000 times stronger,"" CNN International meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. ""With an ... earthquake that shallow, that close to shore, there will be more than one tsunami."" CNN's Kyung Lah, Matthew Chance, Hannah Belcher, Samira Said, Kevin Voigt and Catherine E. Shoichet and journalist Steve Lunt contributed to this report.","NEW: Chile upgraded a tsunami warning to an alert for residents of Easter Island, CNN Chile reports .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forget about baseball, football and the Academy Awards. The hottest new fantasy-league game involves the Supreme Court. A month-old Web site called FantasySCOTUS.net allows people to predict all of the high court's pending cases. Josh Blackman, a law clerk for U.S. District Judge Kim Gibson in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, created the game in his spare time. ""In the digital age, everyone has an opinion and is eager to share it,"" Blackman said. ""They know how a case will come out, and this gives them a way to play a justice."" The growing fantasy league has 2,000 members, mostly students, who can sign up for free. Professionals and other individuals can join for $10 or less. The rules are simple. Thirteen points are up for grabs in each case, and they are awarded as follows: . • One point for correctly predicting the outcome; . • Three points for correctly predicting how the vote is split -- for example, 5-4 or 6-3; . • And one point for every justice's vote correctly predicted. The court will hear about 80 cases before wrapping up in late June. Blackman said the league's winner will then receive the first ""Chief Justice Award."" The court itself is not involved in FantasySCOTUS, and it does not endorse it. Court sources say, however, that several justices are aware of the fantasy league and find it interesting. Blackman said that to his knowledge, no judges -- federal or state -- have signed up to play. ""Most of the participants are students, I'd say about 90 percent,"" he said. ""I've been contacted by high schools and middle schools across the country. Teachers are having their students play. They say it's a great way to get them involved in understanding the Constitution and how laws are interpreted. They can wrap their hands around it. It's an experience you don't get by just reading a text."" The case everyone is now following, Blackman said, deals with a potential overhaul of federal campaign spending. Such an overhaul could give corporations and labor unions more power to spend their own money on political messages. So far, about two-thirds of FantasySCOTUS players predict the conservative-majority court will undercut the current spending limitations imposed by Congress. A ruling isn't expected until next month at the earliest. Blackman said the campaign spending case inspired him to create his Web site last month. ""A friend asked me how I thought the case might turn out, and I wondered, 'If [Las] Vegas put odds on it, what would it be?' "" Blackman said. ""And I thought, why not create a site to do just that?"" Blackman said no money is wagered on his league, which requires serious gamers to do at least some research on current and past cases. ""We'll never know what goes on behind chambers, when the justices decide these very important cases,"" he said. ""But when you get past the grandeur, the mystery of the court, this league is something where anybody can participate. It's not just for the legal nerd. The cases come down to facts, to law. It makes people feel like they are more involved in understanding what goes on up there."" Sotomayor settles in . The high court has begun a four-week recess, but new Justice Sonia Sotomayor will not be sitting still. She heads to Puerto Rico on Wednesday to be honored at a series of events in the island commonwealth where her parents were born. Since being sworn in as the 111th justice in August, Sotomayor has had a relatively smooth transition in her new chambers. She began hearing cases with her colleagues in September, and last week, she issued the first ruling of the term, a relatively small case dealing with attorney-client privilege. Court sources say that the 55-year-old justice has found the caseload a bit overwhelming at times and that she has been working long hours and spending many late evenings at the court. They also say that she has been friendly and open to her new co-workers and that her eight benchmates have helped her fit in as the ""junior"" justice. Off the bench, Sotomayor has given several interviews and attended several parties and galas, including a black-tie event in September sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. There, President Obama praised his high-court selection as ""our own royalty."" Friends say privately that Sotomayor has taken her love of exotic cuisine to her new hometown and that she has been seen at a variety of Washington restaurants, often ordering take-out. Asian cuisine is a particular favorite for this ""adventurous diner,"" as one friend called the justice, and the native New Yorker is still looking for a convenient place to get a good bagel. Late Chief Justice Rehnquist honored . A marble bust of late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was recently unveiled at the Supreme Court's Upper Great Hall. Designed by sculptor Mark Fondersmith, it was placed in the broad entrance area outside the ornate courtroom. The nine current justices attended the unveiling ceremony, along with Rehnquist's family. Rehnquist's successor praised him at the ceremony, saying he was well-liked and admired inside the court. ""Despite his modest and unassuming ways, he has left a permanent impression on this institution, both as a great justice and a great chief justice,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts, who was a law clerk to Rehnquist and counted him as a mentor. Rehnquist, the 16th chief justice of the United States, died of thyroid cancer in September 2005. He was elevated to chief justice in 1986 after serving as an associate justice for nearly 15 years. Justice John Paul Stevens, who joined the court four years after Rehnquist, called his friend ""a first among equals in every wonderful sense.""","A new online game allows people to try to predict the outcome of high court cases .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister held his first meeting Thursday night with leaders of Taksim Solidarity Platform, a loose coalition of various groups of demonstrators from Gezi Park, platform leader Eyup Muhcu said. The meeting came after 24 hours of calm in Istanbul and followed a Wednesday evening gathering between the prime minister and a group of individuals attempting to act as mediators for the protesters in Gezi Park. Earlier, the prime minister called on protesters camped out in the park to pack up and leave. ""We are running out of patience,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan told members of his party in the capital, Ankara, on Thursday. ""I am making this warning for one last time."" The government has been delivering conflicting messages. On the one hand, it appeared to slightly soften its stance by saying it would hold a referendum on Gezi Park's fate, but at the same time, the government delivered yet another ultimatum Thursday for the demonstrators to evacuate. Erdogan intensified his heated rhetoric, at times pushing into the absurd. Gezi Park reeks, making it high time for police to clear it out, Erdogan said. ""It stinks of pee. In fact, some of them even poo in there."" He lashed out at rowdy demonstrators, whom he called ""vagabonds"" and ""thugs."" But he also told peaceful protesters they need not complain about the actions of his police, because they had put themselves in the line of tear gas fire by associating with the wrong people and illegal groups. ""Where dry wood is burning, fresh wood will also burn unnecessarily,"" Erdogan said. He vowed to continue routing out rowdies and ordered peaceful protesters out of the park, asking them to leave police alone with ""illegal groups."" ""Come forward, mothers, fathers, please, claim your children. Let those children withdraw from that area,"" he said. ""We are on the one hand waiting for the judiciary process. On the other hand, we would take a step towards a plebiscite and we'll follow whatever Istanbul people decide. ""But please own up to your children, take them out,"" he continued. ""Otherwise we cannot wait any longer, because Gezi Park does not belong to occupation forces; Gezi Park belongs to Istanbul people and the whole nation."" Erdogan's party has organized counterprotests for the weekend to give a voice to Turkey's ""quiet majority to the people and the world,"" he said. They will show the international community ""a real, true picture of Turkey."" Two rallies will be held away from anti-government protests to avoid possible confrontations, he said. Negotiations . On Wednesday, the prime minister met with protest mediators for four and a half hours, but some leaders, such as with the Taksim Solidarity, one of the main protest groups, backed out because of what it described as heavy-handed police measures Tuesday night in the square. But on Thursday night, leaders of Taksim Solidarity were heading to meet with the prime minister in Ankara. Harsh actions against protesters could strain Erdogan's strategic friendships with much of the West -- relationships that are particularly critical in light of the civil war ravaging Turkey's neighbor, Syria. Turkey is a NATO ally with a democratically elected government. Opinion: Past and future collide in Turkey clashes . The anti-Erdogan protests show no sign of abating. What began in late May as a demonstration focused on the environment -- opposition to a plan to build a mall in Gezi Park -- has evolved into a wider protest against Erdogan that's spread around the country. Letters from Turkey, with pride . International criticism . Erdogan also dealt a slap to the European Union for a resolution it passed Thursday condemning his country's police crackdown on protesters and the suppression of opposition voices. ""The European Parliament's decisions about us, I am not recognizing those decisions,"" he said. The comments triggered a thunderous standing ovation and roaring cheers from party members. ""How dare you make such decisions about my country?"" His angry words were echoed by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said the European Parliament had no right to censure Turkey if it didn't do the same when other European nations tackled protests in similar ways. For example, he said, water cannons and tear gas were used by German security forces at an Occupy protest in Frankfurt on June 1, the same day as they were deployed in Turkey, without drawing criticism. ""Turkey will always support the freedom of demonstration ... but if this is misused, we distinguish between the innocent demonstrators and the marginal groups who try to misuse the right of demonstration,"" he said. He accused some people of trying to damage Turkey's image in the eyes of the world. Turkey has for many years expressed the desire to become a member of the European Union. Experts and human rights groups say Erdogan's government lags when it comes to human rights and freedom of expression by opponents. ""Prosecutors and courts continued to use terrorism laws to prosecute and prolong incarceration of thousands of Kurdish political activists, human rights defenders, students, journalists and trade unionists,"" Human Rights Watch wrote in a 2013 report on Turkey. Turkish journalists are afraid to write anything critical of the government, and media companies are slapped with huge tax fines for covering uncomfortable topics. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkish authorities have targeted journalists with detention for covering the protests. The prime minister has said many times he will not back down. On Wednesday evening, Taksim police took two foreign nationals into custody on grounds that they resisted police, according to the Turkish Radio and Television Corp. official website. It was reported that the two men were journalists working for a Canadian television and covering the protests in Taksim Square. On Thursday, the U.S. Embassy in Ankara issued a security message to American visitors, highlighting a risk of terrorist attacks on U.S. diplomatic, consular and military facilities in Turkey. ""The U.S. Embassy has received an increased number of reports indicating terrorist organizations are targeting these facilities,"" the advisory said. It said U.S. diplomatic facilities will remain open for business ""in the absence of specific and credible threat information that cannot be otherwise countered."" What's driving unrest and protests in Turkey? CNN's Ivan Watson, Nick Paton Walsh, Gul Tuysuz and Arwa Damon reported from Istanbul; Josh Levs, Ben Brumfield and Greg Botelho reported from Atlanta.

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The Korean Peninsula is a tinderbox. One miscalculation can quickly lead to all-out war and hundreds of thousands of military and civilian casualties on both sides. Millions of North and South Koreans live very close to the DMZ. The North also has a million heavily armed troops on their side of the DMZ; the South nearly has many. There are also nearly 30,000 U.S. troops along the frontier with thousands of artillery pieces and missile launchers facing each other. The North is widely believed to be building a nuclear arsenal. I believe this is the most dangerous spot on Earth right now. We certainly packed a lot into six days here. After receiving our visas at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, we arrived on Thursday, December 16, on a regularly scheduled North Korean commercial flight from Beijing on Air Koryo flight 252. It was a newish Russian-made Tupolev 204-300 aircraft and a very smooth 90-minute flight accompanied with patriotic music and a video showing the heroic struggle of the North Korean people. The attractive flight attendants wore red suit jackets and white gloves. We flew back to Beijing on Tuesday, December 22, a day after our original plan because of an incredibly thick fog. The flight back was on Air China flight 122, a Boeing 737. The flight attendants did not wear white gloves. Pyongyang airport is very small. It has only two or three flights a day to only a handful of destinations. This is not a very busy airport. See more of CNN.com's Koreas coverage . CNN Beijing-based photographer Miguel Castro and I were covering the visit here of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations experienced in Korean diplomacy. Sharon LaFraniere, a Beijing-based correspondent for The New York Times, was the only other journalist invited by Richardson and approved by North Korea to cover this trip. Richardson was joined by his senior adviser, Tony Namkung, who's been to North Korea 40 times going back to 1990. He is very impressive with a wealth of knowledge about both Koreas, China and Japan. Also joining Richardson was Gilbert Gallegos, his deputy chief of staff; Gay Dillingham, chair of the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board; and State Police officer Mo Arteaga. The North Koreans took our passports, return flight tickets and cell phones upon arrival at the airport. They returned everything when we were about to board our flight back to Beijing. I think it's fair to say we all had an eye-opening experience. It was a roller coaster of emotions -- ranging from real fear of war on the Korean Peninsula to relief that the North had stepped back from the brink and even accepted some of Richardson's proposals. Maybe Richardson had played a positive role in calming down his hosts, including the chief nuclear negotiator, First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan; the new Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho; the military officer in charge of the armistice and Demilitarized Zone, Major Gen. Pak Rim Su; and the country's Vice President, Kim Yong Dae. We arrived convinced the Korean Peninsula was on the verge of a war, the worst crisis since the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War. This was my first visit to North Korea, though I had been to South Korea, the DMZ and China. When Richardson called me and asked me if I wanted to go with him, I immediately accepted and am glad I did. I have known him for 20 years going back to his days in Congress -- long before he became U.N. ambassador and energy secretary during the Clinton administration. I was apprehensive going in, worried about whether I would actually get out. I was concerned that they would shut the airport if war erupted, and I would be stuck inside North Korea. I even began wondering about the prospects of driving across the North Korea-China border if necessary. Was that even doable? Every time I heard some martial music on North Korean television and radio, I wondered whether the regime was preparing the country for war. I've covered wars and other dangerous situations over the years and usually go through a before, during and after cycle -- nervous before I leave about all the worst case scenarios; not all that worried while on assignment because my adrenaline is pumping and I'm in the midst of a big story; but wondering after the trip whether I should do it again. Covering this story brought back memories of my early overseas assignments in the Middle East in the '70s and '80s: no internet, no cell phone, no Blackberry. I had a hard-line phone in my Pyongyang hotel room and could make outgoing calls to the United States at about $10 a minute. (No credit cards accepted; only cash and only crisp bills.) I could not receive incoming calls from the United States. They would not let us broadcast live via satellite but we took hundreds of still pictures and shot about eight hours of video which we are now going through. Get ready to see the best on CNN and cnn.com. I did get CNN International in my hotel room -- Zain Verjee, Anjali Rao and Richard Quest never looked better -- but no newspapers. Still, six days isolated without e-mail or a cell phone; it was quite a transition for me, but I sort of got used to it and even liked it. I had 983 e-mails waiting for me when I eventually got back to Beijing. The hotel and elite restaurant food was very good, especially if you like Korean food. I stuck with scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast; chicken soup and white rice and steamed veggies for lunch; and usually some grilled Korean chicken or fish for dinner. We had North Korean officials with us all the time -- and I mean all the time. They spoke English well and were very intelligent, polite and even nice. I never felt threatened. They had a job to do, and we understood. Let's not forget this is a communist, totalitarian regime. We were restricted as to where we could go, what we could film and to whom we could talk. They want to showcase the best and keep us way from the worst. We constantly pressed for more access and they sometimes relented. Sharon from The New York Times was especially persistent and her efforts occasionally paid off. Still, we saw a lot of the North Korean capital and even managed to get into the countryside to see a huge apple and fruit-tree orchard where thousands of farmers work what the orchard director said were some 2.2 million trees. That number seemed exaggerated but whatever it was, it was impressive. Once you get outside Pyongyang, you see very few cars on the roads. People are walking along the sides of the roads; some are riding bikes. It's eerie being in the only car on the road. This is a very poor country. Even as we feared there could be a war, we were taken to a silk thread factory where 2,000 women work diligently. We rode the jam-packed subway system from Prosperity Station to Glory Station. We went shopping -- again cash only and only crisp U.S. dollar bills. They really don't like the old, wrinkled bills. We spent one afternoon with well-dressed students at Kim Il Sung University and later at a foreign language high school where very bright 16-year-olds were learning English complete with American slang. I heard one student say: ""That's very cool."" He wasn't referring to the weather. We saw the computers at their national library. They were decent but not state of the art. There's a huge music room at the library where people can simply listen to CDs of great artists. When I was there, they played a Kenny Rogers song for me. He apparently is very popular here. They also took us sightseeing. We saw their Arc de Triumphe (supposedly bigger than the one in Paris); their huge stone tower (apparently taller than the Washington Monument); and their sports complex complete with indoor and outdoor stadiums and ice skating rink. I saw the North Korean girls' ice hockey team jogging one afternoon and briefly caught up with them. They laughed as I ran with them -- probably thinking who is this crazy foreign person carrying a little hand-held camera. Later, when it looked like the North Koreans would retaliate for South Korea's live-fire military exercise, I thought of these girls and all the young people I had seen in North Korea. They seemed so vulnerable, and I worried about their fate if there were a war. I'm not embarrassed to say I got sentimental and emotional worrying about them and their counterparts in South Korea. Huge pictures of the late Great Leader, Kim Il Sung, and his son, the Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, were all over the place. I didn't see pictures of the next generation's expected leader, Kim Jong Un. Electricity is a huge problem in North Korea. It was bitter cold outside. Indoor heat is at a premium. The students were in the classrooms wearing their warm overcoats. The rooms were not well-lit. There were no lights in the tunnels on the roads outside the North Korean capital. Outsiders have been predicting its demise for 60 years, but I didn't get the impression this country was on the verge of crumbling. We were not taken to the Yongbyon nuclear facility or their side of the DMZ even though we and Richardson repeatedly asked. The North Koreans pointed out this was an especially tense time. They said I could come back on another occasion and perhaps visit these places. By the way, 2012 is going to be a huge year for North Korea. That's the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung. The North Koreans are preparing major events. Since they invited me back, I might go back then; maybe even sooner though I hope it won't be to cover a war.

"Washington (CNN) -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg proudly points out a recent empirical study finding her ""the least funny justice who talks"" when cases are argued on the Supreme Court's nine-member bench. But the court's oldest member certainly knows funny and knows the often-austere bench does not always take itself so seriously. A warmly humorous speech she gave Friday in Cooperstown, New York, provided a helpful summary of the past term, which ended last month. She even provided a ""greatest hits"" list of some of the more unusual, even bizarre, quotes from the justices at oral arguments. Those public sessions are a time for the court to pose hypotheticals and offer their analysis of the case at hand, to help them later reach some sort of binding decision. The 78-year-old Ginsburg judiciously said the questions were ""rich"" in nature. Let her explain, in her own words: . ""Questions from the bench ranged from the historical: 'What did James Madison think about video games?' (Samuel Alito) to the practical 'Isn't evidence always destroyed when marijuana (once possessed by a suspect) is smoked? Isn't it being burnt up?' ""Colleagues have been fearful: 'Does al Qaeda know all this stuff?' (Antonin Scalia), occasionally philosophical: 'Why are you here?' (John Roberts), 'Why are we all here?' (Stephen Breyer), and sometimes openly exasperated: 'I know your client doesn't care. But we still have to write (an opinion). So what's the answer?' (Breyer). ""Queries ran from the natural: 'Is the snake covered?' (Scalia) to the unnatural: 'Where is the 9,000-foot cow?' (Breyer) to the supernatural: 'What do you think about Satan?' (Scalia)."" Ginsburg added: ""From the foregoing samples, you may better understand why the court does not plan to permit televising oral arguments anytime soon."" Notice too that she did not mention any colorful quotes from herself or her two female colleagues, but she noted that was not a sign they had nothing to say from the bench. ""We sit left, right and center of the bench, and as transcripts show, Justice Scalia is getting a run for his title as the justice who asks the most questions."" Ginsburg told her audience of the ""joy"" she has found having three women on the court for the first time in history. She especially singled out the newest justice, Elena Kagan, who was sworn in August. ""She has already shown her talent as an incisive questioner at oral argument,"" Ginsburg said, ""and a writer of eminently readable opinions."" Among the court's biggest cases were a ruling against the father of a fallen U.S. Marine. A Kansas-based group, the Westboro Baptist Church, had picketed Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder's funeral with graphic anti-homosexual rhetoric. The majority said the father could not sue the church since the protesters' message, however hateful, related to issues of public concern, such as the war in Iraq. ""The First Amendment, we reminded, protects even the most hateful views,"" Ginsburg told the group of local lawyers in her speech. And the high court, in its last ruling of the term, tossed out an Arizona election reform law that gave additional taxpayer dollars to underfunded candidates who accepted public financing. The ""matching funds"" laws was designed, said its opponents, to ""even the playing field"" in political campaigns. Ginsburg and her liberal colleagues dissented, and she commented that it would continue to open the floodgates to uncontrolled corporate spending on elections. ""All the democracy money can buy, I believe, is not what the First Amendment offers,"" she said. Ginsburg offered no hint she planned to leave the court anytime soon. In fact, court sources have said in recent months she plans to stay on for several more years if her health holds up. Those sources say she just enjoys her job too much to think about retirement. In her speech, she noted her New York City roots, which she shares with Scalia (Queens), Sonia Sotomayor (Bronx) and Kagan (Manhattan). Alito is from neighboring Newark, New Jersey. ""With justices now bred in four of New York City's five boroughs, should another vacancy arise,"" the Brooklyn native remarked, ""Staten Island jurists should stay close to their phones.""","Ginsburg cites rulings on election reform, picketing at funerals .

"(CNN) -- Swiss star Roger Federer faces a race against time to be fit for the Davis Cup final against France. The 33-year-old Federer pulled out of the final of World Tour Finals against Novak Djokovic Sunday due to a back injury, raising doubts over his participation in the showpiece match that starts in Lille on Friday. ""We will have to see how severe those back problems are and we hope that Roger will be able to recover until next Friday,"" the Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi said in a statement on Facebook, referring to the final that is being staged November 21-23. ""He now has to rest,"" added Luthi. ""Our team doctor Roland Biedert has come to London and, together with our physiotherapist Daniel Troxler, will work on Roger's fast recovery."" But speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Federer sounded cautiously optimistic. ""My back is better than it was Sunday, but not good enough for practice yet. But I'm hopeful,"" he said. After pulling out of Sunday's final against Djokovic, Federer adopted a more optimistic tone than Luthi. ""This back spasm [or] whatever it might be, it's just not a fun thing to have during the day,"" Federer said on the official Davis Cup website. ""It's just uncomfortable. But I'm positive and I'm hopeful that it's going to go away very soon."" Federer was plagued by back issues in 2013, largely contributing to a subpar campaign -- by his illustrious standards. He has enjoyed good health in 2014, though, one of the reasons the 17-time grand slam champion was able to No. 2 in the world rankings. The Swiss star picked up the injury in the third-set tiebreaker of his late-night 4-6 7-5 7-6 (6) victory over Davis Cup teammate Stan Wawrinka Saturday. Wawrinka crunched a backhand at Federer when the latter was at the net and also, at one stage, Wawrinka jawed at the Federer camp, seemingly unhappy with something that was said to him. The Davis Cup title, along with an Olympic singles gold medal, is one of the few gaps in Federer's resume.","Roger Federer faces fitness battle to be ready for Davis Cup final .

"(CNN) -- An 85-year-old American man detained in North Korea has apologized for his actions, including for killing troops and civilians during the Korean War, North Korea's state-run news agency reported Saturday. KCNA released a statement it claimed was from Merrill Newman -- a Palo Alto, California man who, his family says, has been held in North Korea for more than 30 days. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to the ""apology"" reported by KCNA. Is U.S. man detained in North Korea a bargaining chip? His statement ends: ""If I go back to (the) USA, I will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people are leading."" In addition to this statement, KCNA ran a story alleging Newman came to North Korea with a tourist group in October and afterward ""perpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and slandering its socialist system."" Searching for spies . This story claimed that Newman tried to ""look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK."" Investigators determined that, as a member of the U.S. military, he ""masterminded espionage and subversive activities ... and, in this course, he was involved in the killings of service personnel of the Korean People's Army and innocent civilians."" ""The investigation clearly proved Newman's hostile acts against the DPRK, and they were backed by evidence,"" the KCNA story added. ""He admitted all his crimes and made an apology for them."" Until now, Pyongyang had not explained why it was holding Newman. Family begs for his release . There was no apparent immediate response from the U.S. government to the reported apology or the accompanying North Korean official news report. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, and it has been working through Sweden -- the U.S. protecting power in North Korea -- to obtain information about the American. The retired financial consultant was last seen aboard a flight from Pyongyang to Beijing. Just minutes before the plane was to depart, he was removed from the flight by North Korean authorities. According to his family, he had been on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea. From phone calls and postcards he sent, the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem, his son said. Family begged for his return . Newman's family could not be immediately reached for comment about the North Korean claims or the reported apology. But in recent days, they had voiced their concern about him. In an interview with CNN on Monday, his wife said they hoped he'd be home for Thanksgiving. ""We need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays. And we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home,"" Lee Newman told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. She said Newman has a heart condition and only packed enough medicine for the trip. She has sent packages of medication, but said she does not know whether he has received them. Other detained Americans . Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea. The other one, Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor.

"(CNN) -- Delvin Barnes, who allegedly abducted a Philadelphia nurse's assistant and held her for three days, made a court appearance Friday to plead not guilty to kidnapping charges. He was indicted Thursday, according to the Philadelphia U.S. Attorney's office. Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's abduction on November 2 was captured on a surveillance video in Philadelphia and sparked a manhunt involving the FBI, Philadelphia police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Marshal's Service. Freeland-Gaither, 22, was found in Jessup, Maryland on November 5. Barnes, 37, was arrested that same day after police tracked him down using his car's GPS device. Barnes allegedly forced the victim to lie bound and cold in the trunk of his car as he drove from Philadelphia to Maryland, court documents said. When he was arrested in Maryland, he was in the back seat of his car, lying next to the victim. If convicted, Barnes faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. A month before Barnes allegedly abducted Freeland-Gaither in Philadelphia, he hit a teen with a shovel in Virginia and stuffed her into the trunk of a car, authorities said. Before he appeared in court for the alleged Philadelphia abduction, he was booked and processed in Virginia in connection with the other alleged kidnapping. Maryland extradited him to Virginia, where he was booked and processed Thursday night. Freeland-Gaither was abducted after she got off a bus in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area. As she walked the few blocks to her home, the suspect's car passed her and quickly parked. A man then got out and met Freeland-Gaither at an intersection, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson said. Then her abductor pounced. Surveillance video showed Freeland-Gaither forcibly led away to a car after a brief tussle on the ground. During the struggle, her glasses and cell phone fell to the road. She kept fighting -- even breaking a passenger side window -- but the car sped away. Barnes admitted to the abduction, according to a criminal complaint. The alleged abductor left behind a string of clues. A day after the kidnapping, the suspect allegedly used her ATM card at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland. The same day, he allegedly used her card to make a purchase at a convenience store. Police released surveillance video of both transactions. A car dealer identified Barnes from the videos and alerted authorities that he had placed a GPS device in the suspect's car because of concerns about his bad credit, authorities said. The GPS device in the suspect's car is used to alert customers when they're behind on payments and also allows dealers to track down the vehicle and stop it, said PassTime USA CEO Stan Schwartz, the head of the company that made the unit. Barnes, who made his initial court appearance in Philadelphia on Wednesday, will be tried there before being turned over to authorities in Virginia. The 16-year-old victim in the Virginia case was sexually abused and doused with bleach and gasoline before she managed to get away, police said. In Virginia, Barnes is charged with abduction, forcible rape and malicious wounding with a chemical, among other charges.

"(CNN) -- The stars of ""Boy Meets World"" had a busy, wedding-filled weekend. On Saturday, actress Danielle Fishel -- Topanga to ""Boy Meets World"" fans -- enjoyed ""one of the most amazing days"" of her life as she wed Tim Belusko in a Los Angeles ceremony. ""The love in the room was palpable and overwhelming in the best way possible,"" the 32-year-old newlywed tweeted after the nuptials. According to her Tumblr, Fishel met Belusko, 25, when she went back to school at 27 to get her college degree, which she happily announced she acquired last December. She didn't completely fit in at school at first, Fishel wrote, but ""I persevered and sometimes I wasn't the oldest person in class, some of the whisperers became good friends, and I did so well in math, I even became a tutor. And that is how I met my fiancÃ©.""

"(CNN) -- It is a familiar tactical strategy at the Supreme Court: when an oral argument gets too dense over regulatory interpretation-- turn it into a sports analogy. An Obama administration lawyer did that Tuesday in closely watched environmental appeal, comparing federal efforts aimed at curbing air pollution to basketball scores. The court seemed impressed, with Chief Justice John Roberts calling it a ""pretty good"" analogy. After that the athletic aphorisms just would not stop. At issue is whether an ""upwind"" state that is polluting a ""downwind"" state is free of any obligations under the so-called Good Neighbor provision, unless and until federal regulators have quantified the upwind state's contribution to downwind state's air pollution problems. The case is an important test of federal regulatory power, and the rules issued two years ago by the Environmental Protection Agency are being challenged by a coalition of 15 states, as well as several energy companies and labor unions. Leaders in some mostly conservative states say lost jobs and higher energy costs are at stake from what they see as arbitrary and ambiguous regulations. But the administration and its environmental allies counter Americans' health should come first, and that as many as 45,000 deaths could be prevented each year if the Cross-State Pollution Rule would be allowed to go into effect. Overall, it appeared the EPA may prevail in the complex regulatory case, based on the comments from the justices during 90 minutes of arguments. It would be a rare environmental victory in a conservative majority court, if that were to occur. The arguments come just hours after eight of nine governors from the affected downwind states signed a petition urging the EPA to force nine southern and midwestern upwind states to reduce smog and soot emissions from power plants. The one downwind governor who did not sign was Gov. Chris Christie, the New Jersey Republican. Those Democratic or Independent governors criticized a federal appeals court ruling last year against federal oversight, saying it ""allows upwind states to postpone the costs of air pollution controls for years, while in the interim downwind states and their residents are forced to suffer the present consequences of that pollution."" Enforcement of what is known as the Transport Rule was adopted by the EPA in 2011, but remains on hold while the court cases work toward a final conclusion. In Tuesday's session, Justice Department lawyer Malcolm Stewart got the ball rolling when he said the EPA should be allowed to use the somewhat discretionary standard ""contribute significantly,"" when determining a state's cost-based share of transported air pollution. ""There are various reasons to think that EPA reasonably construed that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement,"" he said of a downwind state's inability to comply, in the face of continuing pollution from its neighbors. ""We might say that dunking a basketball is a more significant achievement for somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6 feet 10."" Roberts took up the challenge when sharply questioning the lawyer representing corporate and union interests, Peter Keisler. ""If you ask the coach what significantly contributed to the loss, he's going to talk about the missed layup rather than the missed desperation throw,"" said the chief justice, ""even though as far as amount, each was going to count for two points."" Justice Antonin Scalia used the metaphor to turn the point on its head. ""The question you should ask the coach, when you lost 101 to 100: which of the 101 points contributed most to your loss?"" he asked, bringing laughter in the courtroom. ""I mean, he would not answer the one that was the layup. He'd say what do you mean? All of the 101 points."" Scalia added the proposed EPA rule changes were not what Congress had in mind when it passed the landmark Clean Air Act. Adding to the sports talk, he said the agency has ""hidden the ball"" with its ambiguous standards. ""We're not going to tell you what the target is,"" he said, relying on his own interpretation of what federal regulators are doing to some states. ""It's up to you to come up with a SIP (state implementation plan) and we'll tell you after the fact whether that SIP happened to meet the target that we've invented."" Among the provisions being challenged is the EPA's cost-based formula, using what it calls a balance between an upwind state's obligation to reduce coal-fired pollution, and the amount of money that would be required for a downwind state to feasibly meet its own obligations. That calculation was a key part of the oral argument, which critics of the policies say unfairly punishes some states more than others, by placing a greater financial burden for their share of unhealthy air particulates. Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, representing one of the states challenging the rules told the court, ""EPA's actions in this case have written the states out of the Clean Air Act. ... EPA has left the states completely in the dark about the meaning of the phrase 'contribute significantly.'"" Justice Stephen Breyer called it a tough problem and questioned the upwind states' position. ""But it's supposed to advance the ball"" using yet another sports reference. ""So there is a procedure for the states to come in if they can come up with a better plan. That's what you've just heard, and so do it. So what's arbitrary or capricious about such a system?"" Mitchell said it was up to the EPA to issue clear guidelines before enforcing those standards, and the burden was on the federal government, not the states. Breyer, in response: ""There's six states that contribute to the seventh state's pollution, and how much each state can cut back depends. It depends on what it costs. It depends on how much they contribute. It depends upon what the other states will do. It depends upon where the wind blows, and that changes all the time,"" he said. The justices next February will hear a related case: can the EPA tighten emission standards for ""stationary"" greenhouse gas sources-- such as power plants-- in what the government says is an effort to stem the effects of global warming. The high court in 2007 affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant, but that case just dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. The high court will decide if the agency properly extended its regulatory authority. The consolidated cases argued Tuesday are EPA v. EME Homer City Generation (12-1182) and American Lung Assn. v. EME Homer City Generation (12-1183). A ruling is due in the next several months.","States that pollute are under fire from those that don't .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Isaac Lidsky arrives in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, stops suddenly and, upon hearing a voice, extends his hand in greeting almost instinctively. Isaac Lidsky graduated from Harvard University at 19. Retinitis pigmentosa has seriously impaired his vision. Seemingly simple gestures such as a hello don't always come easily for a man who is legally blind. But this hasn't deterred the ex-Justice Department prosecutor from pursuing a promising legal career, one that will take him inside the nation's highest court in a few weeks. The Florida native will join 36 of the nation's top young attorneys as law clerks to Supreme Court justices for the 2008-'09 term. He will be the first legally blind law clerk in the court's history. Lidsky, 28, will work with the retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and will be assured of long days writing and researching cases. ""I certainly am nervous to the extent I am eager to be helpful to the justice and productive,"" he said. ""I just want to do good work.""  Watch as the lawyer will break new ground at the court » . Lidsky, a one-time actor, may be vaguely familiar to adults of a certain age. He played the lovable geek Barton ""Weasel"" Wyzell on the NBC series ""Saved by the Bell: The New Class"" in the 1990s. ""There's a little bit of a cringe factor because my character was not necessarily the coolest kid in school, but certainly, [there's] fond memories,"" he recalled. ""It was an incredible experience for a kid to have."" Around that time, the 13-year-old was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease that already had struck two of his older sisters. The symptoms were slow to develop, so Lidsky came to terms early with the idea of losing his vision. Now his sight is seriously impaired. Lidsky said his parents, Betti and Carlos Lidsky, did not allow self-pity and encouraged him to help others like himself. ""Right away my parents really led the charge on saying, 'How can we take this challenge and turn it into something positive?' "" he said. ""So for 15 years we have been doing just that."" Acting was never going to be a career for Lidsky. It was the law that always attracted him. As a child he went to court with his father, a prominent Miami lawyer. Becoming a Supreme Court law clerk, he said, was a lifelong dream. After graduating at 19 from Harvard University, he earned a degree from its law school, with a brief stop in between as an Internet business entrepreneur. In 2004, he began a clerkship with Judge Thomas Ambro of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ambro became a mentor to the bright young lawyer and witnessed a sudden decline in his vision. ""You could tell things were getting worse,"" Ambro said. By the end of the one-year assignment, ""he now needed a cane and was using a guide dog. Once he had no idea I was in the same room with him until I spoke."" But that did not dull Lidsky's drive to succeed. ""He had a real good sense of what he was facing,"" Ambro said. ""He's determined to make it in the same way as other people who succeed. For him it was simply a matter of getting the tools to do it."" Those tools include optical character recognition software, which scans printed words electronically and reads them back to him, and a Blackberry-type communication device that sends and receives e-mail audibly. Friends said he was a little reluctant over the years to embrace much of the technology, as he sought to preserve his independence as long as possible. After his clerkship came a stint in the Justice Department's Civil Division, where he argued about a dozen cases in federal courts. He said his acting skills came in handy when pleading before often skeptical judges. With the recommendations of Ambro and others, Lidsky applied four times to be a Supreme Court law clerk but was rejected. A meeting with longtime federal Judge David Tatel, who also is blind, convinced Lidsky he should not give up his dream. Then came the call from O'Connor. ""Sitting in her chambers, here I was worrying about having to recall the minutiae of legal doctrine"" for the personal interview, he recalled. ""But we fell into talking about our families and philosophies, and she made me feel very warm and welcome."" O'Connor was not available for an interview, but former clerks said they remember her as a nurturing type who nevertheless demands much from them. ""I have no doubt Justice O'Connor will keep me very busy,"" Lidsky said. In addition, Lidsky likely will be assigned to an active justice to sort through the 9,000-some appeals that reach the high court every year. In that capacity, he would recommend which cases should be accepted for review and help write early drafts of opinions. O'Connor also will continue her practice of sitting in on several appeals court cases a year, so Lidsky will assist her on those, along with the 78-year-old's busy schedule of teaching, speeches and public advocacy. Lidsky will have to scale back involvement in his foundation, Hope for Vision, which he created with his wife, Dorothy, and some friends to raise awareness of blinding diseases. His group is launching a campaign this week to find a cure for blindness by 2020. ""We have communities of Hope across the country that do events to raise awareness and funding for research,"" he said. ""It's purely volunteer-driven, very grass-roots. Over 98 percent of the money we raise goes directly to scientific grants."" As for the future, Lidsky plans to go to London, England, after his clerkship ends, so his wife can finish her master's degree. He would be set to rejoin his law firm, where he has taken a leave of absence, but has no specific career goals. ""In 10 or 15 years, I would bet he will be a man still on your radar screen,"" Ambro predicts. Lidsky appears more modest. ""I'm not out there to set any kinds of records or prove anything to anybody,"" he said. ""As odd as it may sound, losing my vision has in a lot of ways been a very rewarding experience for me."" CNN's Kelli Arena contributed to this report.","Isaac Lidsky is set to become first legally blind law clerk at U.S. Supreme Court .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Late-night talk show host David Letterman offered a ""heartfelt"" apology before a live studio audience Monday to his wife and female staffers over last week's ""sextortion"" revelations, fans at the taping said. David Letterman has mined private events in his life for very public jokes on his show. ""He really handled it head on, but it was funny too,"" audience member Larry Lefkowitz of Brooklyn Heights, New York, told CNN after the taping. ""You could tell he'd been though a difficult situation and that he was sorry that he hurt other people, but he was also able to keep it funny, throw humor into it too,"" Lefkowitz said. Letterman revealed on his show Thursday night he had sex with members of his staff and that he testified about those liaisons before a New York grand jury for a case involving an alleged attempted extortion. A CBS producer is accused of threatening to go public with allegedly embarrassing information about Letterman's private life, unless the 62-year-old funnyman paid $2 million. Monday's mea culpa marked his first public remarks since last week's admission. ""The staff here has been wonderfully supportive to me, not just through this furor, but through all the years that we've been on television. ... So, again, my thanks to the staff for, once again, putting up with something stupid I've gotten myself involved in,"" Letterman said, according to excerpts released Monday by production company World Wide Pants. ""Now the other thing is my wife, Regina. She has been horribly hurt by my behavior, and when something happens like that, if you hurt a person and it's your responsibility, you try to fix it. And at that point, there's only two things that can happen: Either you're going to make some progress and get it fixed, or you're going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed, so let me tell you folks, I got my work cut out for me."" Another audience member said Letterman's apology to his wife appeared to evoke sympathy from some in the crowd. ""When he made the apology to his wife he was very serious, not looking for any laughs, when he said he had a lot of work -- a lot of work to do on the homefront,"" said a man who identified himself as John. ""That was very heartfelt, a lot of women in the crowd -- I could hear them literally saying, 'awww,' that they felt for Dave and the dilemma he's probably going through."" Although Letterman first admitted the plot and sexual relationships very publicly on his show, most videos of the segment were taken down from YouTube this weekend at the request of CBS. The New York Times reported an unnamed source said CBS made the copyright infringement claim at the request of Worldwide Pants Inc., the production company owned by Letterman which produces his show. CBS and Google, which owns YouTube, both had no comment about the videos being taken down. At least some fans appear willing to forgive Letterman for his admitted dalliances. ""I still think he's the king of late night comedy,"" Lefkowitz said. CNN's Doug Ganley contributed to this report .","""I got my work cut out for me,"" David Letterman says of his marriage .

"(CNN) -- It all started with some boxes that had not been opened for 80 years. ""There was a rumor that there were archives in the Condé Nast offices in New York that nobody had known about,"" says Todd Brandow, a photography curator. ""It was difficult to get access, but when I finally got in, they told me that it had all been sold and nothing was left. ""But then the archivist rolled out these boxes of 2,000 prints. It was one of those great 'oh my God' moments."" Among the prints were photographic portraits of Winston Churchill, Katharine Hepburn, HG Wells, George Gershwin, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, WB Yeats, Fred Astaire, and countless other luminaries of the 1920s and 1930s. None of the pictures had seen the light of day for eight decades, and all had been taken by the pre-eminent photographer Edward Steichen (1879-1973) for Vanity Fair and Vogue. Also included in the stash were Art Deco-style portraits of women modeling designs by Chanel, Lanvin, Lelong, Schiaparelli and many others. The photographs are now being exhibited at London's Photographer's Gallery, where they will show until 18 January. The Picasso of photography . ""It was a kid-in-a-candy-store feeling,"" Brandow recalls. ""They were taken almost 100 years ago but the pictures felt so contemporary, that's what really excited me. All the poses were so natural, and the vision was so fresh. ""Many of them were fashion pictures, but the women looked like they'd been born wearing those clothes, that they wore them every day. That was Steichen's skill: he could make people look natural in every sense of the word."" During his lifetime, Steichen was recognized as the most important photographer of his age. Even today, says Natalie Herschdorfer, an art historian who co-curated the exhibition with Brandow, he is ""one of the top five photographers of all time"". ""He was the Picasso of photography,"" she says. ""He had a 70-year career covering the whole 20th Century. All the genres of modern photography are represented in his work, from the pictorial style of the 1900s to the modernist period. It's very rare."" At the height of his fame, Steichen -- who borrowed from a range of aesthetic movements such as Impressionism, Art Nouveau and Symbolism to create a distinctive Art Deco style -- was being paid the equivalent of $1 million a year by Vanity Fair and Vogue, plus another $1 million by commercial clients. But after his death he fell from prominence because his widow, Joanna, was extremely protective of the rights to his work, making exhibitions very difficult. Now, says William A Ewing, the third of the exhibition's co-curators, the time has come to reintroduce Steichen's work to the world. ""The skill of any great portrait photographer is to gain an immediacy, an intimacy,"" he says. ""You feel as if Steichen lives with his subjects. He doesn't turn them into gods. He brings out their humanity. ""He turned fashion photography into portraiture. He looked first and foremost at a woman wearing a dress, not the dress for its own sake. That's what connected so powerfully with the viewers."" From steerage to First Class . The story of how Steichen came to take these iconic photographs -- and become a household name -- reads like a Hollywood rags-to-riches story. In the early 1920s he had gone through an acrimonious divorce, and had large alimony bills that placed him in financial jeopardy. He was determined to dedicate his life to his art, and had changed his style to a modernist approach, with clean lines, strong diagonals, and high contrast. But he didn't know how to make it pay. In a letter to his sister, he wrote that the outlook was bleak and that he was considering abandoning photography for film, which he thought may have a more secure future. He traveled from Paris, where he had been during the First World War, to the United States in steerage, alongside impoverished immigrants. After he arrived, he stumbled upon an article in Vanity Fair in which, to his surprise, he was named as ""America's greatest portrait photographer"". He contacted the magazine and was offered a job. Within a few weeks he was returning to France to photograph Paris Fashion Week. But this time he was on a big salary, and traveling First Class. ""He went from rock bottom to being on top of the world almost overnight,"" says Ewing. ""You can see this reflected in his pictures, which had a sense of exuberance and confidence."" How Steichen worked his magic . It was Condé Montrose Nast himself who had the vision to attract Steichen's talents to his magazines. In their discussions, Steichen was quite open about the fact that he had no interest in haute-couture. But Nast persuaded him that ""it's not about fashion, it's about photography"". ""Those were the days before professional models,"" says Ewing. ""People used to photograph society women. But Condé Nast went to Broadway and hired actors and dancers, who knew how to get into character for the camera. ""This enabled Steichen to work his magic."" It was this unique approach towards fashion photography, which was firmly rooted in the tradition of portraiture, that was one of the keys to Steichen's success. Steichen lived the high life for several years, photographing the world's most famous faces. But in 1935 he burned out, and resigned to spend his time on horticultural photography, which was his great passion. ""He really was one of the greats,"" says Brandow. ""He was the founding figure of modernism in photography and the modern woman in fashion photography, as well as modern portraiture. ""Revealing these secret photographs will finally bring him back to the prominence he deserves."" The future Underground: London's new spaceship-style tube trains .

"(CNN) -- A bell tolled, ground zero fell silent. At 8:46 a.m., hundreds who gathered at the site of the fallen World Trade Center towers paused in silence to mark the moment when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the north tower -- the opening salvo of a terrorist attack that brought down the iconic buildings, killed 2,977 people and launched more than a decade of war.

'Escape from Camp 14' a true North Korea survival story . ""I had never felt that kind of attachment and love that people outside of prison camps feel towards them,"" he told CNN. ""So they were just one of many criminals in a prison camp."" Those, like Shin, who have tried to escape a North Korean political or hard labor camp and have survived to tell the tale, talk of starvation, torture, betrayal and executions. By informing on others, many say inmates could hope for more food or less beatings. Horrific heart-breaking accounts of being quite literally worked to death have emerged over recent years. But the camps continue and Pyongyang still refuses to acknowledge their existence. South Korea's government is trying to officially document the atrocities for the first time, collecting disturbing firsthand accounts from those who have managed to make it to South Korea, including Shin who got out in 2004. A 381-page report from the National Human Rights Commission of Korea is based on the testimony of 278 defectors has recently been published with names of prison guards who carried out torture or executions. ""We felt a necessity to systematically manage the examples of human rights violations, this can be used as preliminary data for compensation by the country after unification,"" said Lee Young Ken, head of the Commission's North Korean department. ""This could also psychologically put pressure on North Korean officials who will definitely be able to see this compilation."" Human rights group Amnesty International believes up to 200,000 prisoners are being held ""in horrific conditions in six sprawling political prison camps."" In its annual human rights report released last week, it said, ""The combination of hazardous forced labor, inadequate food, beatings, totally inadequate medical care and unhygienic living conditions, resulted in prisoners falling ill, and a large number died in custody or soon after release."" Amnesty: World's leaders let protesters down . These camps have been used by the Kim dynasty for years to crush political dissent. Amnesty believes they have been in existence since the 1950s. One defector, who wanted to be identified only as Kim as he has family members still inside North Korea, told CNN inmates face a slow and painful death. He was sent to a labor camp for a year and a half after being caught crossing into China. ""We received 120 grams of rotten corn for daily food. So many people with the same year and a half sentence as me didn't survive their term and died of hunger."" Kim describes seeing many of his fellow inmates die and having to bury them on a nearby hill. The only hill, he said, where flowers grew well due to the large numbers of decaying bodies beneath the ground. ""When I went to bury my friend, I found the hole was too small,"" he said. ""When I asked why, the guy said there was no more room to make a bigger hole. When I dug up the ground with my shovel, I saw about four layers of bodies and human bones."" Kang Chol-Hwan is now a journalist in South Korea, a world away from his previous life where he spent ten long years in a prison camp. Sent at the age of nine as his grandfather fell out of favor with the elite, he says he almost died three times from malnutrition and exhaustion. He remembers being forced to eat mice, insects and grass to stay alive. ""It was like Hitler's Auschwitz concentration camp, not as large and there is a difference in the way people are killed. Hitler gassed people, Kim Jong Il sucked the life out of people through starvation and forced labor."" Kim Jong Un took over from his late father in December 2011 and appears to have changed nothing in the political prison camps. Amnesty says North Korea's State Security Agency detained over 200 officials in January this year, part of an apparent power succession plan. It says some were feared executed, the rest sent to the camps.","S. Korea's National Human Rights Commission documenting abuses in N. Korean labor camps .

"(CNN) -- Dennis Hopper, the one-time Hollywood enfant terrible who portrayed such indelible characters as ""Easy Rider's"" biker Billy and ""Blue Velvet's"" huffing villain Frank Booth, died of prostate cancer Saturday morning at his home in Venice, California, his wife said. He was 74. Hopper, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer last October, was surrounded by his children when he died, his wife, Victoria Hopper, told CNN. Funeral arrangements have not been decided, but Hopper's wish was to be buried in Taos, New Mexico, ""his heart home,"" Victoria Hopper said. The American film icon made his last public appearance on March 26, 2010, when his star was dedicated on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Over almost six decades as a performer and director, his career spanned a range of Hollywood trends: TV's live ""Golden Age,"" films about disillusioned teenagers, a variety of Westerns, anti-establishment dramas, offbeat indie films, action blockbusters and edgy cable series. He often played villains, occasionally lost souls, almost all with a force and empathy. Share your tributes, memories of Dennis Hopper . There was Dennis Hopper before ""Easy Rider,"" generally known as a clean-cut, if rebellious, character actor who had built a career of supporting roles in Westerns, youth-oriented films and TV shows. There was Dennis Hopper after ""Easy Rider,"" for years one of Hollywood's wild men, an actor with a penchant for alcohol, drugs and outlandish behavior, and later a go-to performer to play villains and commanding misfits. And then there was ""Easy Rider,"" the 1969 film that he directed and co-wrote, and in which he played a dissolute, countercultural biker named Billy. Thanks to the film, Hopper helped blaze a trail for the young, aggressive filmmakers who would take Hollywood by storm in the 1970s. Dennis Lee Hopper was born in Dodge City, Kansas, on May 17, 1936. He grew up in San Diego, California, and established an early reputation for stage work. Making his way to Hollywood while still in his teens, he quickly earned roles in TV shows and films, including ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955), in which he met James Dean, who became a friend and lifelong model, Hopper once said. Dean was ""a guerrilla artist who attacked all restrictions on his sensibility. ... I imitated his style in art and in life. It got me in a lot of trouble,"" Hopper recalled. Hopper also appeared in ""Giant"" with Dean, who died in a car accident in September 1955. ""He's the greatest actor that I ever saw. I never saw anyone that could even touch him,"" he told CNN's Larry King in 2005. ""He moved better than any actor. He's like an expressionist to me. He not only filled himself with emotion, but he, like -- he did things that were so unbelievably physical."" Hopper maintained a somewhat uneven career through the mid-'60s, appearing in such films as the John Wayne vehicle ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965) and the Paul Newman classic ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) as well as several TV shows -- often Westerns. But it was 1967's psychedelic ""The Trip,"" directed by ""King of the B's"" Roger Corman, that exposed the actor to an anti-establishment audience and two of his ""Easy Rider"" colleagues, actor Peter Fonda and ""Trip"" writer Jack Nicholson. In early 1968, Hopper led the group through his own low-budget film, a biker road movie about two disenchanted riders who -- thanks to some drug money -- travel from Los Angeles to New Orleans. ""A man went looking for America and couldn't find it anywhere,"" went the words of its famous tagline. ""Easy Rider"" was finally released in the summer of 1969, and became a sensation -- after 1967's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Graduate,"" the breakthrough that set free the Baby Boomer generation on Hollywood. (Ironically, another of Hopper's 1969 films was ""True Grit,"" an old-fashioned Western that earned John Wayne an Oscar.) The film, made on the fly by Hopper and co-star Fonda for less than $500,000, became one of the highest-grossing movies of its time and helped make a star of Nicholson, who played an ill-fated, alcoholic lawyer. ""It was just a very special time when the lunatics really got to take over the asylum for a minute,"" Hopper told Reuters in 2008. ""For a brief moment there, there really seemed to be an independent film movement. Then it was over."" iReporter captures Walk of Fame ceremony . But even at the height of ""Rider's"" success, Hopper was developing a reputation as a difficult artist, using drugs and drinking heavily. He and Fonda -- best friends in the movie -- weren't that way in real life, he told People in 2002. ""Peter and I weren't friends. By the time we started the film, Peter tried to have me fired. He considered me out of control, and I was,"" Hopper said. ""We made a good film, but it wasn't made out of love."" Given carte blanche to direct his next movie, Hopper made ""The Last Movie"" (1971) an indulgent failure that made the list of the Medved brothers' ""50 Worst Films of All Time"" in their 1978 book of that name. Hopper descended into drug and alcohol abuse in the '70s. A marriage to Mamas and Papas singer Michelle Phillips famously lasted eight days in 1970, and he barely sustained his career as an actor, though he gave a notable turn as the crazed photographer in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). ""The alcohol was awful. I was a terrible alcoholic,"" Hopper told CBS' Charlie Rose. ""I mean, people used to ask how much drugs I did. I said, 'I only do drugs so I can drink more.' I was doing the coke so I could drink more. I mean, I don't know any other reason. I'd start drinking in the morning. I'd drink all day long."" After hitting bottom -- he had a breakdown in a Latin American jungle -- Hopper entered rehab in the early '80s, and his career began a renaissance. He was determined to do 1986's ""Blue Velvet,"" about the sordid underbelly of a small town, reportedly telling writer and director David Lynch, ""I've got to play this part, David, because I AM Frank."" Frank Booth -- fond of profanity, Roy Orbison and inhaling a mysterious gas -- earned Hopper wide acclaim. He received a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his next film, ""Hoosiers"" (1986), in which he played the drunken father of a high school basketball player. Hopper never strayed far from the A-list after that, giving notable turns in ""Speed"" (1994),"" ""Basquiat"" (1996), ""Jesus' Son"" (1999) and the TV show ""Crash."" iReport: Hopper became honorary mayor in 2009 . In recent years, Hopper was as well known for his political views -- he self-identified as a Republican in liberal Hollywood -- as his work. (He did play a Democratic presidential candidate in 2008's ""Swing Vote,"" however.) Among his recent roles were a villain in the TV series ""24"" and an officer in the short-lived TV show ""E-Ring."" He was starring in the TV version of the Oscar-winning film ""Crash"" at his death, playing a conniving record producer. He was named a chevalier of France's Order of Arts and Letters in 2008. Hopper was married five times and had four children, ranging in age from 47 to 6. His personal life continued its ups and downs to the end. In January, while Hopper was suffering from prostate cancer, he filed for divorce from his fifth wife, Victoria. Hopper's lawyer argued in the divorce case that his estranged wife's presence was hampering his fight with cancer, but the judge allowed her to continue living in the family's Venice compound with their daughter. But it's his films for which he'll be remembered -- and there was something for everybody, he told People in 2002. ""I can be in the 24-hour grocery store at midnight, and suddenly someone come up and says, 'Man, you know I loved you in 'Chainsaw Massacre 2,' "" Hopper said with a laugh. ""Well, 'Chainsaw Massacre 2' is not my favorite film to be remembered for. Then there was 'Hoosiers,' which was a very likable, inspirational sports film. Kids will come up asking for the coach's autograph. ""Somewhere in my strange career, someone has liked something.""

"(CNN) -- A top U.S. congressman expressed concern about the ""stability"" of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after months of provocative statements and behavior from the nuclear-armed communist state. ""You have a 28-year-old leader who is trying to prove himself to the military, and the military is eager to have a saber-rattling for their own self-interest,"" said Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""And the combination of that is proving to be very, very deadly."" North Korea launched a satellite into orbit atop a long-range rocket in December, conducted its third nuclear weapons test in February and announced earlier this month that it was abandoning the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War. On Saturday, it announced that it would not negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, challenging arguments that its weapons program was a bargaining chip that might be traded away for economic benefits. Rogers, R-Michigan, told CNN's State of the Union that North Korea ""certainly"" has the missile capability to strike the United States. Analysts say North Korea is years away from being able to accurately deliver a nuclear weapon atop a long-range missile. But Rogers said the fact that the North is willing to openly threaten the United States with a nuclear attack ""is problem enough."" ""This is very, very concerning, as we just don't know the stability of their leader -- again, 28 years old,"" Rogers said. ""We're just not confident that we know he wouldn't take those steps."" Pyongyang disregarded numerous warnings to conduct February's test and threatened afterward that it was prepared to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike to defend itself. The U.N. Security Council stiffened sanctions on the North after the test, with its leading ally, China, making the vote unanimous. The North has also renewed its threats toward South Korea, warning of ""strong physical countermeasures"" after the sanctions vote. Kim is the grandson of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the North Korean state. He rose to power in December 2011, after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. Victor Cha, a longtime North Korea analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the North's recent actions have fueled debate about whether Kim ""really is fully in charge, or whether the military is in charge."" ""The three top military generals that were with him when his father died are all gone now, and we don't know what happened to them,"" Cha said on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS. ""That could be a sign of him taking control, but it could also be a sign of some real churn inside the system where some people don't like the fact that a 28-year-old is now running the country."" And Donald Gregg, a former adviser to then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said North Korean contacts he has met recently told him ""that they have given up on their diplomats, and the military is now in control."" ""What they want is to talk about moving from the now-disbanded armistice agreement to the creation of a peace treaty,"" Gregg told GPS. ""That's what they want to talk about, and anyone who is willing to talk about that, they will listen to. Anyone who wants to talk about what they call the old way, which was give up your nuclear weapons and then we'll talk, is going to get nowhere."" Gregg recommended engaging the North Koreans in new talks. But Cha, a former National Security Council official in the second George W. Bush administration, said that can't be done so soon after their nuclear and missile tests, and he predicted ""a very difficult period for the next couple of months or so."" ""They don't want to give up their nuclear weapons. They want to be able to have their cake and eat it, too,"" he said. ""U.S. policy for the past quarter century or so has been, 'These things are all on the table if you're willing to give up your nuclear weapons.' This is the problem. This is the dilemma right now.""","""We just don't know the stability of their leader,"" Rep. Mike Rogers says .

"(CNN) -- A U.N.-Arab League envoy working for a cease-fire in Syria arrived in Damascus on Friday as warplanes pounded rebels and fighting engulfed the nation. Lakhdar Brahimi ""eventually"" will be meeting President Bashar al-Assad during a trip expected to last several days, said Brahimi's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi. Brahimi wants to forge a cease-fire by Eid al-Adha, the Muslim holiday that arrives Thursday, and has been meeting with Middle East leaders to stoke momentum for stopping the violence. Syrian man loses 18 relatives in airstrike . ""The hurdles are huge. We are appealing to the government to see the benefit of a period of calm where people can breathe. There's not going to be any joy in Eid -- exuberance amongst the Syrian people -- but at least they might bury less than a hundred people a day,"" Fawzi said, referring to the crushing daily death tolls. Brahimi is appealing to the Syrian government to take the lead and make the first move. ""Of course, we appeal to the government to start first -- as the stronger party -- and then the opposition immediately after,"" Fawzi said. ""Let's see what happens on the ground. There are no guarantees for anything in this conflict. They think they can shoot it out. We think they can't."" The United Nations and the League of Arab States, in a joint statement, called for support of Brahimi's cease-fire plan. ""This step needs to be sustained. It could create the space to allow a peaceful political process that realizes the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for democracy, equality and justice,"" the statement said. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the 19-month conflict as scores have died daily in fighting. At least 245 people, including 20 children, were found dead across Syria on Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said. More than 80 of those killed were discovered in a mass grave ""after they were field executed"" in Deir Ezzor, the LCC said. Ous al-Arbi, an activist in Deir Ezzor who visited the site, said women and children were among the dead. Some had been ""slaughtered"" and ""burned,"" while others had their hands and other body parts ""cut off by axes,"" he said. The bodies were located near a street that is used to get out of the city, al-Arbi said. They were taken to an open space for identification. ""The doctors who were with us said the bodies appear to have been field executed first, then later some of them were burned. They also said some of the bodies are only a day old, and others a month old,"" al-Arbi said. Meanwhile, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian jets continued to shell towns and villages in Idlib province, in the north. UK man charged over photographers' kidnapping in Syria . Warplanes targeted rebel fighters on the outskirts of a military camp. They also struck the key town of Maaret al-Numan and nearby villages, the observatory said. Maaret al-Numan is strategically important because a highway from Damascus to Aleppo runs through the town. The Syrian army uses the highway to provide reinforcements in the north. The observatory also reported injuries from heavy clashes in the Idlib town of Salqeen. Fighting also flared in Aleppo. The Syrian army shelled the al-Sakhour neighborhood and fought to oust rebels there. Rebels shelled the government-controlled neighborhood of al-Midan with mortars and battled the troops. The LCC also reported ""intense"" gunfire by security forces against demonstrators in Damascus. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said government soldiers destroyed a water tank truck loaded with explosives driven by a ""suicide terrorist"" in Idlib. It also said it killed two ""terrorists,"" one of whom was Lebanese. Syrian rebels said to cut deals for arms from extremists . As Syria endures tough Western sanctions over the government's actions, reports have emerged that international broadcasts are being jammed from inside the country. ""Deliberate and intermittent interference"" to international broadcasters' signals ""is coming from within Syria,"" satellite provider Eutelsat said Friday. The BBC said that it and other broadcasters are ""experiencing deliberate, intermittent interference to its transmissions to audiences in Europe and the Middle East."" ""Deliberate interference such as the jamming of transmissions is a blatant violation of international regulations concerning the use of satellites and we strongly condemn any practice designed to disrupt audiences' free access to news and information,"" the BBC said.

"(CNN) -- Newly uncovered documents from a confidante of Hillary Clinton are making headlines about the former first lady. But they also reveal new details about legacy moments in her husband's presidency that were frustrating and distracting to the White House. It seemed as if Bill Clinton had too many choices in his first chance to name a Supreme Court justice and not enough for his second. The deliberations went down to the wire, and when Stephen Breyer's name came up each time, he was not the person the President, in his heart, preferred. ""At this point BC [Clinton] also said he did not want to name Breyer,"" wrote Diane Blair in May 1994 just two days before he was ultimately selected. ""Didn't want to give a big deal to Massachusetts."" That's where Breyer, then 55, was serving. Apparently naming someone from that reliably liberal state would not pay political dividends. Blair was a close family friend who took copious notes of conversations she had with both Clintons throughout most of their White House years that ended in 2001. Notes from that conversation with Clinton are part of papers Blair, then a University of Arkansas professor, left the school after her death in 2000. CNN has uncovered one inside look at how Breyer was ultimately chosen, and it mirrors the tricky, often delicate game of politics nearly every White House must navigate. Blair's three-page memo affirms much of what a variety of sources have told CNN about the Breyer selection process. But she adds a fresh layer of detail on the last-minute maneuvering to get Clinton to decide. Back to '93 . It all began a year earlier soon after Clinton took office in 1993. Justice Byron White was retiring and the President had his first chance to create a legacy with a high-profile pick. Sources said Clinton had lots of ideas of who should sit on the high court-- too many, in the eyes of many White House staffers. Names included New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, and Education Secretary Richard Riley. All turned him down. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's name was quietly leaked, but Senate Republicans made clear he would face a rocky confirmation. In her words: Hillary Clinton then and now . Clinton even briefly considered naming his wife to the court-- which he labeled an intriguing, ""sexy"" idea-- but was quickly talked out of it, according to former top White House aide George Stephanopoulos, in his memoir. ""We don't need another gang-that-couldn't-shoot-straight story,"" reluctantly concluded the president, according to Stephanopoulos. More traditional choices were then considered-- federal appeals court judges. Among them was Breyer, then chief judge on the Boston-based First Circuit. He was asked to come to the White House and interview personally with Clinton. But there was one problem. He had days earlier suffered a serious accident on his bicycle, and sources said he left his hospital bed to come to Washington. The interview ""went badly,"" Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, wrote in ""The Nine,"" his book on the Court. ""Normally a friendly, almost garrulous man, Breyer was short of breath and still in pain,"" wrote Toobin. ""Afterwards, Clinton told his staff Breyer seemed 'heartless'. ... I don't see enough humanity. I want a judge with soul."" Still, government sources say Breyer was on the verge of being selected until he tapped Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She served on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where her colleagues at one time included Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Both would precede her on the high court. Despite her clear liberal record on the bench, the nominee was well received and received near unanimous Senate approval. It also helped boost the morale of a White House struggling in its first year from a series of political setbacks. Clinton knew he had a winner in the second woman to sit on the high court, introducing her by saying she had a ""big heart."" Friend's papers giver insight into rise of the Clintons . The 1994 pick . Fast forward one year. Justice Harry Blackmun announced his retirement April 6, presenting another chance for Clinton to burnish his legacy. The five-week selection process was again unwieldy, as the Blair memo shows. Her notes from that May 11 conversation with Clinton show it was ostensibly about the ""Supreme Court appointment,"" but other topics kept cropping up. Clinton was worried about the midterm congressional elections, even his own political future (""BC not sure he can get reelected""). Yet, it was clear Clinton was torn between his personal and political sides -- focusing on one man -- Judge Richard Arnold, a fellow Arkansan on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The two were not close but Arnold had a national reputation, with some later calling him one the greatest judges never to have sat on the Supreme Court. But there were three problems, among them his divorce years earlier. Blair's memo notes county divorce records point to some ""messy allegations"" that might complicate Arnold's chances. ""This thing is so sick, according the BC [Clinton], in a way he wants to stand up to it, but [the issue] will come out and will be part of the pattern of sleaze,"" she writes. There were also concerns of perceived nepotism, which fellow Arkansan Blair tried to downplay to the president. ""BC is furious about what has been done to Ark., how they've taken all the joy and happiness out of BC's victory, turned the state into the killing field-- this would restore their pride and happiness,"" she paraphrases him saying. But the biggest lingering concern was Arnold's health. He had been diagnosed years previously with low-grade Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the cancer had produced tumors, spreading through his body. Although Arnold was able to function ""more or less normally,"" wrote Toobin, a doctor told Clinton on May 13 that there was no way he could say ""that Arnold's disease 'would not interfere' with his duties as a Supreme Court justice."" Hillary's big concern . Blair's memo says this was ""HRC [Hillary Clinton's] greatest concern, makes it seem he's [Clinton] is not taking this, his greatest legacy, seriously, if [he puts in] someone who may die in 5 years of less time."" Arnold stayed active on the bench until his 2004 death. But Arnold, in Blair's mind, was clearly the best choice and she strongly urged Clinton to ""go ahead and appoint RA, because that's what he really wanted to do."" The President was not even remotely close to a decision, and he urged Blair to speak with his wife after their conversation. The first lady was ""wild"" about the issue of Arnold's health. Blair paraphrases her close friend saying, ""BC wouldn't even think about naming someone from Neb. or Iowa if they had possible cancer threat-- so why do it just because he knows the guy,"" writes Blair. ""If HRC carried the day, and sounds as if she is, it will be Babbitt. She's not wild about him. Wishes there were a 3rd choice. But there isn't. Which in itself is very, very sad and strange,"" according to Blair's notes. After hearing Arnold's medical prognosis from the doctor, Clinton later that day made up his mind. It was Breyer. The final decision was sudden, and Clinton wanted it public immediately, before his pick could get down to Washington. So Breyer wasn't even present when the announcement was made. He was easily confirmed. The whole selection process lacked the excitement and momentum of the one a year earlier but both of Clinton's high court choices have turned out to be great successes. Ginsburg and Breyer have carved a consistent left-leaning record, and are well-liked and respected by their colleagues. CNN's Robert Yoon and Dan Merica contributed to this report .","Notes taken by Clinton confidante reveal new details about Stephen Breyer's selection to bench .

"Washington (CNN) -- The private law firm hired by House Speaker John Boehner to represent the government in the federal Defense of Marriage Act has suddenly pulled out of the case. The chairman of King & Spalding said Monday the firm's internal vetting for accepting representation was ""inadequate."" As a result, the high-profile lawyer who was to lead the legal fight for House Republicans has resigned immediately from the firm. Paul Clement, who was a top partner at the firm, wrote in a letter, ""I resign out of the firmly held belief that a representation should not be abandoned because the client's legal position is extremely unpopular in certain quarters. Defending unpopular clients is what lawyers do."" He will now defend the statute for another law firm. The decision by the Atlanta-based law firm to withdraw is a victory for gay-rights supporters that have tried to have the Defense of Marriage Act repealed or tossed out on constitutional grounds in court. Those groups had urged King & Spalding in recent days to drop out of the case, and were preparing a national campaign to highlight the company's efforts. The Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 by the GOP-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states. The Obama administration, which normally would defend federal laws in judicial disputes, announced earlier this year it believed the Defense of Marriage Act, often referred to as DOMA, to be unconstitutional. The law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman. Boehner said that with the Justice Department not participating, he had ""no choice"" but to act unilaterally, and moved to lead the legal defense of the law. Robert Hays Jr., chairman of King & Spalding, said the firm had filed a motion Monday to withdraw its representation of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives, ""on the constitutional issues"" regarding the law. ""In reviewing this assignment further, I determined that the process used for vetting this engagement was inadequate,"" Hays said in a statement. ""Ultimately I am responsible for any mistakes that occurred and apologize for the challenges this may have created."" Law firms typically undergo an internal review process headed by senior-level lawyers to determine which cases they will accept. Controversial issues like same-sex marriage are normally subject to intense scrutiny to balance the legal issues with financial, ethical, and other considerations. The Hays statement made no specific mention of the reasons behind the sudden change of heart. Clement said he is going to work for a Washington law firm, Bancroft PLLC. Legal sources say he will be taking a number a high-profile clients with him to his new job. Clement had filed a brief a week ago while at King & Spalding in a pending case from New York, where a lesbian received an estate tax bill of more than $360,000 after her longtime partner and legal wife had died. He is a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush, serving from 2005 to 2008. It was his job to defend federal laws and executive actions in court, similar to what he will be doing now as a private lawyer on retainer. He was mentioned at one time as a possible Supreme Court nominee. Separately, he also is representing more than two dozen states in a lawsuit against the Obama administration over the sweeping health care reform law passed by Congress last year. That case is pending in a federal appeals court in Atlanta. In his resignation letter, Clement made clear, ""I take this step not because of strongly held views about this statute. My thoughts about the merits of DOMA are as irrelevant as my views about the dozens of federal statutes I defended as Solicitor General."" ""In this instance, my loyalty to the client and respect for the profession must come first,"" he wrote. ""The Speaker is disappointed in the firm's decision and its careless disregard for its responsibilities to the House in this constitutional matter,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck told CNN. ""At the same time, Mr. Clement has demonstrated legal integrity, and we are grateful for his decision to continue representing the House. This move will ensure the constitutionality of this law is appropriately determined by the courts, rather than by the president unilaterally."" Papers have not yet been filed for Clement to continue representation of the House. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had been vocal about her opposition to the decision to take on the case. ""Leader Pelosi shares Mr. Hays' apparent concerns with the lack of transparency and accountability in the way this contract was signed,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told CNN. ""She also vigorously opposes using half a million taxpayer dollars or any taxpayer resources to defend discrimination at a time when Republicans in Congress are cutting critical initiatives like education and infrastructure.  It is now more critical than ever that Speaker Boehner fully account for his decision to sign this half million dollar contract to defend this indefensible statute."" Boehner last week indicated he would make an effort to divert money from the Justice Department to fund its high-profile fight. ""Obviously, DOJ's decision results in DOJ no longer needing the funds it would have otherwise expended defending the constitutionality of DOMA,"" he said April 18. ""It is my intent that those funds be diverted to the House for reimbursement of any costs incurred by and associated with the House, and not DOJ, defending DOMA."" Such a move would require Senate approval, an unlikely prospect since Democrats control that chamber. President Barack Obama on February 23 ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the law. ""The president has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder at the time. The key provision in the law ""fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional,"" he said. Obama had previously expressed his personal opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act but had never stated an opinion relating to its constitutionality. Gay-rights supporters applauded the law firm's decision to withdraw. ""King & Spalding has rightly chosen to put principle above politics in dropping its involvement in the defense of this discriminatory and patently unconstitutional law,"" said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""We are pleased to see the firm has decided to stand on the right side of history and remain true to its core values."" Two pending lawsuits from New York and Connecticut challenge the law. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes both states, is the only federal circuit to have never decided the basic legal question of whether a law discriminates against gay men and lesbians. The New York legal fight was prompted by Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who lived with her female partner, Thea Spyer, for more than four decades. They married out-of-state in 2007, but neither the federal government nor their home state of New York recognized the legal union. Spyer died and left her estate to Windsor, who was then forced to pay taxes on the money because she was not considered a legal spouse. In July, a federal judge in Massachusetts, in a separate case, became the first to rule part of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. District Judge Joseph Tauro said that ""irrational prejudice plainly never constitutes a legitimate government interest."" The administration's decision comes on the heels of other major developments in the struggle over gay and lesbian rights. In December, Obama signed legislation that will repeal the controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and bring an end to the ban on openly gay men and women serving in the armed forces. Courts in California are considering a legal challenge to Proposition 8, an initiative narrowly approved by that state's voters in 2008. It defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Either one of those cases could reach the Supreme Court in coming months, perhaps in time to become a major issue during the 2012 election year. Same-sex marriage is legal in five states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont -- and in the District of Columbia. Civil unions virtually equivalent to marriage are permitted in New Jersey, while several other states offer more limited civil unions or partnerships. The New York case is Windsor v. U.S. (1:10-cv-08435).","A spokesman says Boehner is ""disappointed""

"(CNN) -- Claudio Ranieri paid the price for Greece's humiliating defeat to the Faroe Islands when it was confirmed Saturday that he had been sacked as national team coach. The 63-year-old Italian's fate was sealed after the 1-0 loss in Athens, which left the former European champion bottom of its Euro 2016 qualifying group with a single point from four games. Ranieri had only been in charge since July, taking over from Portugal's Fernando Santos, who had led the Greeks to the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil. But results since have been poor and an opening defeat to Group F leaders Romania set the scene for Ranieri's eventual departure. A statement on the official website of the Greek National Football Federation said Ranieri and his coaching staff had been relieved of their duties. The writing on the wall was clear for all to see in the immediate aftermath of Friday's defeat with federation president Giorgos Sarris openly admitting that Ranieri's appointment had been a mistake. ""Following today's devastating result for the national team, I take full responsibility for the unfortunate choice of coach,"" he said in a statement on the official website. No replacement has been named, but Greece is due to meet Serbia on Tuesday, a team also without a coach after Dick Advocaat stepped down after a 3-1 home defeat to Denmark in Group I Friday. Ranieri took full responsibility after the defeat but said he would not resign. ""This defeat was a surprise for me and my players. It was very painful. A very bad result,"" he told gathered reporters. Ranieri had previously managed big-spending Monaco -- taking them to second in the French Ligue 1 in 2013. He has also been in charge of English Premier League Chelsea and a trio of Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Napoli and Roma.","Greece sacks coach Claudio Ranieri .

"Editor's note: Angelo Falcón, a political scientist, is president of the National Institute for Latino Policy, a nonprofit think tank on issues affecting the Latino community. He is co-editor of ""Boricuas in Gotham: Puerto Ricans in the Making of Modern New York,"" and author of the ""Atlas of Stateside Puerto Ricans."" Angelo Falcón says Sonia Sotomayor's identification as a Puerto Rican has caused her joy and a little grief. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States has raised the profile of Puerto Ricans in the American consciousness. Her identification as a Puerto Rican has caused Judge Sotomayor both joy and a little grief during this stormy nomination process. But, being a Puerto Rican who also grew up in New York City, well, I can say that's par for the course for most of us. Despite Puerto Rico being a possession of the United States since 1898, most Americans know very little about the island and Puerto Ricans -- except for tourism commercials. Many consider Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico (I called these ""Stateside Puerto Ricans"") another new immigrant group of Latinos. But the reality is that we can trace Puerto Rican settlements in New Orleans to the 1860s and workers from Puerto Rico migrated to Hawaii around 1900. In 1917, through an act of the United States Congress (the Jones Act), the people of Puerto Rico were made United States citizens, enabling them to come to the United States freely and legally without passport or visa. I grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, in an area known as ""Los Sures"" (The Southside). Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1951, my mother brought me to New York when I was only 6 months old. Now, to point out how different we are from most Americans, check this out: Despite living 99 percent of my life in New York and being a U.S. citizen for 100 percent of my life, under some interpretations of the law, because I was not born in a state of the United States (nor were my parents), I may not even be eligible to run for president of the United States! I am not sure how this has affected my career development, but I am sure it has resulted in some deep psychological trauma that I have yet to understand. Puerto Ricans have been migrating to the United  States since the 1800s, but it wasn't until World War II that this population movement peaked. At the time of this ""Great Migration"" over 80 percent of the Puerto Rican population in the United States lived in New York City. ""West Side Story,"" ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" Piri Thomas' book, ""Down These Mean Streets,"" all tried to capture this experience. It was a time when we became social guinea pigs, the subjects of Oscar Lewis' ""culture of poverty"" experiments and the like. Fast forward to today: The 800,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City represent about 20 percent of the more than 4 million Puerto Ricans living stateside. There are now more Puerto Ricans living stateside than in Puerto Rico. The fastest-growing Puerto Rican settlements in the States are in Florida and the South, not in the Northeast and Midwest where Puerto Ricans traditionally migrated. While once seen as basically a very poor community, the stateside Puerto Rican community has become more economically, politically and culturally complex than ever. Alongside very poor Puerto Ricans in areas such as the South Bronx, there are growing middle-class Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the New York suburbs. Settlements in states such as Florida, Texas and California are full of Puerto Rican professionals --- surgeons, engineers, lawyers. Where once this was seen as a very politically liberal community captured by the Democratic Party, in these newer settlements we are seeing a growing trend toward conservative politics. Then there is Puerto Rico. There are about 4 million residents, 95 percent of whom identify as Puerto Rican. Puerto Rico is a territorial possession of the United States, which was formally defined a commonwealth after a vote by its residents in 1952. The U.S. Congress is currently debating its future political status -- whether it should remain a commonwealth, or become a state or an independent nation. And it appears Puerto Ricans living stateside are as divided on this question as those in Puerto Rico. The U.S. Supreme Court once described Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States as ""foreign in a domestic sense."" Don't worry, I don't know what that means either. But it does point to a rather convoluted relationship embodied in a series of Supreme Court decisions called the Insular Cases. The bottom line is Puerto Rico is an integral part of the United States. They use the same currency, follow the same laws and are subject to the same federal courts system. They even have the same fast food places -- so they are killing themselves dietarily just like the rest of the United States. However, did you know that despite being U.S. citizens, the people of Puerto Rico can't vote for the U.S. president? And Puerto Rico is excluded when the U.S. Census Bureau reports its numbers on Hispanic population in the United States? So, next time you hear a report on U.S. Hispanic population, add 4 million to get it right! As Judge Sotomayor's Puerto Rican heritage is discussed in reference to her nomination, it is clear that it is an experience that is thoroughly American. Exotic as we may sound to some, we are a people just trying to get by and as bewildered by American politics and jusiprudence as the next guy. Judge Sotomayor, as a Puerto Rican, is, well, as American as mango pie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Angelo Falcón.","Angelo Falcón: Sonia Sotomayor is part of New York's large Puerto Rican community .

"(CNN) -- As the snow finally wound down, drivers and residents in and around Buffalo, New York, continued to dig out from a storm that dumped up to three feet of snow and shut down a major highway. Some motorists spent as much as 20 hours stranded on Interstate 90, as emergency personnel worked to dig their vehicles out despite continued and concentrated precipitation and up to six-foot high drifts. By around 8 p.m. Thursday, snow was falling at about a half-inch for hour, according to the National Weather Service. While still meddlesome, it paled compared to the 3-inch per hour rate late Wednesday as well as the intense, concentrated snow that continued through much of the day Thursday. ""Just too much in too short of a time,"" Bob Hill, who offered his plow to help, told CNN affiliate WVIB. Tractor-trailers and passenger cars were marooned on two nearby four-mile stretches of the interstate -- one eastbound and the other westbound. While there was some movement by Thursday evening, large parts of the road remain closed to new traffic and the highway authority said it had no estimate when the interstate would reopen. Authorities used plows and all-terrain vehicles to clear the road and provide food, water and gas to those stuck, even busing stranded motorists to a senior center-turned-shelter in suburban Cheektowaga. ""We're still using ATVs that have police officers or [firefighters] operating them, inspecting to see if anyone needs any services,"" said New York State Police Capt. Michael Nigrelli. ""We are seeing progress now, [and we're] hoping in the next few hours to see some breakthroughs."" Many area residents woke up Thursday morning to drifts as high as four to six feet that, in some cases, blocked doors and driveways. Shifting winds from an east-moving front combined with record-breaking warm water temperatures in Lake Erie to create the intense early December storm. How does lake effect snow form? D'Youville College's men's and women's basketball teams spent at least 24 hours on the road -- most all of it in a standstill on Interstate 90 -- on their trip back to Buffalo from games in Pennsylvania, reported WVIB. Sam McMahon, who had been trapped on the interstate since 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, told CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf that while he has seen snow comparable to this, there is something unique about this storm. ""In terms of snowfall, I have seen snowfall like this before, but I have never been stuck in a situation like this on the thruway this extreme,"" he said. The University of Buffalo student was heading home Wednesday evening and when he hit slow traffic. ""By 9 o'clock, we were stopped,"" he said. ""Since 9:30 last night, I haven't moved an inch."" Frank Rodriguez, 22, whose office backs to the clogged highway, said people -- including a few truck drivers, wearing only T-shirts as they waded through two-and-a-half feet of snow -- scaled fences all day to get food and warmth. Network Task Group, his telecommunications company, even brought out two ladders to help, he said, noting some motorists said by late afternoon that they'd been stuck for over 16 hours. He said the interstate, which he can see from his workplace, was ""completely dead"" most of Thursday until small movement by late afternoon. Ironically, Rodriguez said his hometown of Grand Island, 11 miles north of Buffalo, had minimal snow. ""It was kind of weird -- it was almost like a blanket"" covering some spots and not others a few miles away, Rodriguez said. That disparity is common with lake-effect snow, with official advisories warning about rapidly changing conditions and noting that ""the weather can vary from locally heavy snow in narrow bands to clear skies just a few miles away."" Several spots got hit hard by this week's storm, and consistently. National Weather Service spotters reported more than 32 inches in communities east and south by Thursday evening. Plus, temperatures just below freezing made for wet snow that forecasters cautioned ""will bring down some tree limbs and produce scattered power outages."" Still, while packing a punch, the storm was hardly a record-setter: Over 76 inches of snow fell in Buffalo in late December 2001, including 35.4 inches in a single 24-hour period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Despite the wintry conditions, the New York State Highway Authority noted that no injuries have been reported, though ""as a precaution,"" an ambulance did take away one stranded motorist who used an oxygen tank. ""There have not been any serious accidents or injuries, and no one has been in serious harm,"" Nigrelli said. The snow did die down late Thursday, and only flurries were forecast for Friday. Still, this being upstate New York, the National Weather Service is calling for a chance of snow showers every day through next Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Chances are you've either heard about or seen the photos of Kim Kardashian posing nude for Paper Magazine. The intention was to ""break the Internet"" with the provocative photos of Kardashian baring it all. While I was disappointed that Kardashian chose to use nude photos of herself for the occasion, I was even more disappointed to hear all the mean comments and disparaging articles written about her. Those who know Kardashian personally speak well of her and tell me how kind and sweet she is. So, it is painful to see how quickly we are willing to come down hard on each other as women. It's as if we give no space or room for any margin of error. It's important to not judge others and to recognize that we have all made decisions that in hindsight (no pun intended) we wish we could take back. The movie ""Groundhog Day"" comes to mind. Haven't we all wanted a second chance at getting something right? Let's encourage all women to seek powerful, sustainable and fulfilling ways to break the Internet and the bank by using our minds instead of our bodies. I remember being an executive in corporate America and being mindful to cover up my curves so the men I worked with would focus on my creative and innovative ideas instead of how I looked. I was probably overly obsessed with it, but I always wanted to be rewarded for my merits and accomplishments versus anything that had to do with my physical attributes. For women in the corporate world, how you dress and speak, how passionate you are about what you do, how you persevere, and how you operate day-to-day all help establish your brand. Think for a moment: What are people saying about you when you are not in the room? Do you know what your personal brand is? Does your brand convey that you are using your body or your mind to achieve your goals and aspirations? There are two amazing women -- Sara Blakely and Elizabeth Holmes -- who are examples of sisters who are using their minds to not only create wealth but also using their gifts and talents to make a difference in the lives of others. Blakely, founder of Spanx, has helped women feel beautiful and confident in their clothes without having to wear full feet-in pantyhose. She did three things that I believe all successful entrepreneurs must do: 1) She cared deeply about what she was trying to do -- namely, how to help women look great even if they don't have perfect bodies, 2) She was confident in her ability to provide a solution, 3) She was courageous enough to discuss her ideas with others, knowing that they could write her off. Even though she experienced rejections at first, she never gave up. Oprah named Spanx one of her favorite things in 2000 -- and the rest is history. Another woman we can all admire is self-made billionaire Elizabeth Holmes, who founded Theranos, a medical diagnostics company, which is revolutionizing the blood testing process. She leveraged her fear of needles to develop a way to use a small amount of blood for multiple tests instead of the usual two to four vials that we are accustomed to having drawn at the doctor's office. Holmes studied chemistry at Stanford University but dropped out in her sophomore year to pursue her business. She spent years working on her idea. During that time, she didn't give up; she stayed focused in the right way, in what I call the 3 Cs: care, confidence and courage. So, how will you break the bank using your mind? We want to hear from you.","Kim Kardashian, who posed nude for Paper Magazine, received many mean comments .

"(CNN) -- The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has approved a road map to destroy Syria's chemical weapons by the middle of next year. A joint OPCW-United Nations team charged with overseeing the destruction of the weapons began inspecting sites in October. The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences. The OPCW's executive council met Friday at its headquarters in The Hague to finalize a detailed plan. In a statement, the council said chemical weapons would be transported outside Syria to be destroyed ""to ensure their destruction in the safest and soonest manner and no later than June 30, 2014."" Under the plan, all declared chemical substances and precursors except for isopropanol will be removed from Syria no later than February 5. Isoproponal is a chemical used in the manufacture of the nerve gas sarin, but it is also widely used as a solvent. The OPCW said it was envisaged that ""the most critical chemicals"" would be removed from Syria by the end of 2013. It said destruction of Syria's declared chemical weapons facilities would take place between December 15 and March 15 ""according to a risk-based criterion."" OPCW Director General Ahmet Umzucu said the plan provided a ""clear road map"" and set ambitious milestones to be met by Syria's government. November 15 was the deadline for the council to approve a plan for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. ""This next phase will be the most challenging, and its timely execution will require the existence of a secure environment for the verification and transport of chemical weapons. Continuing international support and assistance for this endeavor will remain crucial,"" Umzucu said. The government of Norway on Thursday offered to provide a commercial cargo ship and a military escort to pick up the Syrian weapons stockpile and deliver it to a destination to be destroyed. However, the OPCW statement did not state which countries would host the weapons destruction, and Albania announced Friday it was rejecting a U.S.-backed plan for it to take the stockpile. Albania rejects plan . In a televised address, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama said the country had ""no capacity of any kind pertaining to the transport and technological processes involved."" Crowds of protesters erupted in cheers outside the address, where hundreds were demonstrating against the request, which they claimed would put Albania at risk of pollution or accidents. Rama had originally been in favor of the plan, which would have had the roughly 1,300 metric tons of sarin, mustard gas and other chemical weapons from Syria shipped to NATO-member Albania for destruction. ""There was an inclination to say 'yes' initially as an obligation to our big allies, but how can the U.S. take the chemical weapons from the hands of a killer only to kill other people on the planet,"" said Rama, the new prime minister of the normally stalwart U.S. ally. ""We respect the prime minister's decision,"" the U.S. Embassy in Tirana said in a statement. ""We remain confident that we will complete elimination of the program within the timeline agreed upon."" 'Reaching out' A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State told media Friday there had been ""extensive discussions"" with several countries relating to finding a location. ""Several countries have seriously -- are seriously -- considering and have seriously considered hosting the destruction efforts,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. OPCW-UN Joint Mission special coordinator Sigrid Kaag told the OPCW's executive council she was ""reaching out to others to consider joining this international effort, which is key to the successful implementation of the executive council's decision."" The statement said that Umzucu would present a specific plan for the destruction of chemicals outside Syrian territory. ""The director general is also requested to establish a special trust fund for this purpose,"" it said. Sarin allegations . The U.N. resolution on Syria's chemical weapons was based on a deal struck between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces. In Friday's update, the OPCW said its mission in Syria had verified that more than 60% of Syria's declared unfilled munitions had been destroyed. Syria had committed to destroy all unfilled warheads and bombs by January 31, it said. It follows its announcement on October 31 that Syria had destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filing and production facilities and that all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites were under seal. Read more: Syria meets first chemical weapons destruction deadline . The mission had visited 21 out of 23 sites, the OPCW statement said, and 39 of the 41 facilities at those sites. The remaining two sites were too dangerous for the inspectors to go to, it said, but Syria had declared those sites as abandoned. The chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites, which were inspected. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict.","OPCW says it has approved a detailed plan to destroy Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The photo is both touching and humorous, a loving couple dressed as many of their friends and colleagues recall them. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg beams in her judicial robes, adorned with a frilly lace collar. Her late husband, Martin, gazes adoringly, wearing shorts and a silly French cooking apron. Now Marty has received a fitting, very personal tribute in the form of ""Chef Supreme: Martin Ginsburg,"" a cookbook released this week by the Supreme Court Historical Society. In addition to being a pre-eminent tax attorney and law professor, Marty -- who died last year of cancer -- was by all accounts an extraordinary amateur chef. His easy-to-follow recipes for everything from smoked bluefish spread to vitello tonnato are available for all to try, leavened with bits of his trademark humor. And sprinkled throughout are photos (including the chef getup) and remembrances from his children, friends, and fellow spouses of the justices. It was Martha-Ann Alito, wife of Justice Samuel Alito, who helped spearhead the cookbook project. To honor his memory, she worked with other court wives to gather the best recipes and bring it to publication. ""His voice, it really comes through. He was an extremely warm and encouraging person,"" said Clare Cushman, director of publications for the society, who edited the book. ""The way he writes recipes really reflects his playful personality."" In a place brimming with tradition, one of the least known and intimate events are the monthly to quarterly lunches at the Supreme Court, organized and attended by the spouses of justices past and present. Marty was often outnumbered as the only male, but eager to build lifelong friendships in a place known for strong differences of opinion. ""Good food, conversation, wit, and warmth help bind them together,"" Cushman told CNN. ""The Supreme Court is a very collegial place, partly because of the protocols that have been in place for decades, (which) help bring the justices themselves together as a group. But the protocols of the spouse lunches probably helped foster that overall collegiality more than we know. Due in large part to Martin Ginsburg."" The justice has called her husband ""super chef,"" and ""my best friend and biggest booster."" The Ginsburgs made an ideal pair, say friends, precisely because their different personalities complemented each other perfectly. While both possessed strong legal minds, Ruth is soft-spoken, genteel, and serious of purpose. Marty was irreverent but precise, often brash but always sweetly caring. Those qualities meshed in the kitchen, where cooking was an expression of love. Marty experimented, sometimes for years, to perfect his creations. His detailed recipe for pissaladiere, an onion-based tart appetizer, runs four pages in the book, and he confidently vouches for its tastiness. ""Fear not,"" he commands. ""The above recipe may be only authentic mid-Manhattan (where the Ginsburgs once resided), but on information, belief, and ten years of testimony from innumerable diners -- including my wife, who is otherwise a confirmed anchovy hater -- it is more than edible."" All styles are represented: ""Shrimp in an Indian Manner,"" ""Squid in an Italian Manner,"" ""The Perfect Baguette,"" and ""Caesar Salad Jane,"" named after the couple's daughter, now a Columbia Law professor. And there are nine desserts, including ""Tarte Tatin"" and ""Grandchildren's Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies."" Unexpected challenges brought out the best in him. Justice Antonin Scalia is very close to Justice Ginsburg, and also an avid hunter. He once brought back meat from a wild boar he shot, prompting Marty to create a suitable marinade of carrots, shallots, dry white wine, and even crushed juniper berries among his various ingredients. After clearly explaining the 10-day marination process, Marty adds, ""Throw out the roasted meat and drink the marinade (just kidding)."" The home chef never expected his meals to reach a wider audience -- they were just passed to friends. Cushman and her friends and colleagues actually tested all 47 recipes in the book, narrowed from a repertoire of hundreds of often elaborate dishes. ""In a way he says 'trust me, it's going to work out,'"" Cushman said. ""Through his (explanatory) steps, you feel him keeping a careful eye on you while you're cooking these recipes. I cooked a lot of them myself -- some were quite complicated -- and I was very grateful having him, in a way, looking over my shoulder."" Marty's culinary skills were picked up by necessity shortly after he and Ruth married, upon discovering his wife possessed few such talents. That became a running joke in the family, and one that the justice regaled audiences with over the years, somewhat sheepishly. ""Professor Ginsburg is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the Supreme Court,"" said the justice in March 2009. ""Mainly he performs in the kitchen, for the quarterly spouses' lunches held at the Court and, occasionally in past years, at a dinner for the entire Court family -- justices, their spouses, and widows of former Court members. In the beginning, when I was the newest justice, my dear husband offered aid in lightening my load."" Marty, too, needed little prompting to playfully and publicly needle his wife. ""Ruth was a fairly terrible cook and, for lack of interest, unlikely to improve,"" he recalled in a 1996 speech. ""Out of self-preservation, I decided I had better learn to cook, because Ruth -- to quote her precisely -- was expelled from the kitchen by her food-loving children nearly a quarter-century ago."" ""Being the spouse of a Supreme Court justice is not always an easy role to play, and Marty Ginsburg made it more fun than perhaps it had been in the past,"" Cushman said. ""There's a unique dynamic to this because Justice Ginsburg -- before being named to the courts -- had battled gender stereotypes in the law and tried to eliminate them. And her marriage seemed to defy gender stereotypes of who does the cooking and who's out there in the public sphere. A true partnership.""

"(CNN) -- Tuesday was a tragic day for girls everywhere. In Pakistan, 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai was shot by the Taliban on her way home from school on a bus. Although she was targeted specifically because she spoke out against the Taliban's suppression of women's education rights, her story serves as a reminder of the obstacles that girls face in trying to obtain schooling. In all my travels, from Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to villages and towns across rural India, I have been struck by the unwavering commitment of every girl to do one simple thing: Go to school. Just like Malala, the girls I met know that education is their ticket to a better future: for themselves, their families and their entire communities. Girls would beg their parents to let them stay one more year in school, struggling to juggle their household chores with caring for their younger siblings, all so they can squeeze in one more day in the classroom. Unfortunately, girls around the world have also shared with me how pursuing an education can be dangerous, whether it's because of harassment and violence from teachers or the dangers they encounter as they walk to school. Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . Today, as we celebrate the first United Nations International Day of the Girl by marking the progress that has been made for girls, we should keep in mind that we need to redouble our effort to create a future in which all girls can safely receive an education and reach their full potential. Violence keeps girls out of school. Globally, nearly half of all sexual assaults are committed against girls who are 15 and younger. Fear of this type of violence restricts where girls are allowed to go and when they are allowed to be out of the home. Often, parents do not send their daughters to school for this reason. Violence in the home can also hold girls captive and out of school. For instance, nearly half the girls in developing countries are married during their teenage years, with many before age 15. They may experience profound violence at the hands of their often much older husbands. But sadly, school does not equal safety. Even girls who are able to go to school still face violence -- in the classroom, of all places. A girl may walk up to five kilometers between home and school in the company of friends or an older brother to avoid the inevitable harassment by groups of men or boys she passes, only to receive more harassment from a teacher once she finally reaches school. In schools around the world, teachers pressure girls for sex in exchange for grades. In Zambia, for example, more than 2,000 cases of teacher rapes were reported in 2010 alone. Of these cases, only 240 teachers were convicted. While these numbers may be shocking, Zambia is not the only country with this problem. Schools should be a safe haven for girls, but instead, they are too often a place of fear and danger. International day of the girl: World's most remarkable women share advice . However, despite the violence that can happen in schools, going to school tends to increase girls' safety outside school. A recent study in Swaziland found that the risk of childhood sexual violence was greatest among those who were not attending school, suggesting that greater educational opportunities decrease vulnerability to violence. Girls in school have an opportunity to escape early marriage and early motherhood, and to gain skills that give them enhanced economic and social opportunities. As part of the global community, we can all do our part to help girls by making school safe and making sure they can get to school. Here are a few ways: . -- Invest directly in girls. Less than 2% of every international development dollar goes directly to adolescent girls, let alone toward protecting them from violence. We have made great strides globally in increasing the numbers of girls in primary school, but until we make girls' safety a priority we will not advance our educational goals. -- Ensure schools are accountable to girls by enacting and enforcing policies that prevent sexual abuse and exploitation by teachers. When a 13-year-old girl in Zambia was repeatedly raped by her teacher, the Adolescent Girls Legal Defense Fund supported the girl's court case against the teacher who raped her and the headmaster who knowingly allowed the assaults to occur. In 2008, the High Court of Zambia ruled that the Zambian government is responsible for protecting girls from sexual assault and providing recourse to victims. Schools everywhere must enact systems that protect girls and hold teachers accountable. -- Empower schools and girls through provision of safe spaces. One important outcome of the Zambian teacher rape case has been the wide scale adoption of safe spaces for girls in Zambian schools. -- Recruit, train and retain female teachers. Female teachers can reduce some of the major risks adolescent girls face in school. They can also serve as strong role models and help girls imagine different futures for themselves. The 10x10 Campaign is uniting people and organizations around the critical goal of removing barriers to girls' education. Likewise, so is the Adolescent Girls Legal Defense Fund. You can join them. The benefits of education for girls are undeniable. But until we can ensure that schools are places of learning, rather than places of danger, girls will be held back. When girls are educatedâ€”and safeâ€”they, along with our entire societies, will flourish. On CNN iReport, tet us know why educating girls is #basicmath . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Buffett.","Jennifer Buffett: Girls everywhere want to go to school to get a better future .

"(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. Diana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the ""People's Princess."" Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. Inge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. ""There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,"" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. Life at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. When the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. Despite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an ""ordinary"" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals. ""She was quite a lovable child,"" Crane said. ""She was very, very cuddly.""  Watch Crane share her memories of the young Diana » . Inside Park House, however, the marriage of Diana's parents was falling apart. The divorce was finalized in 1969. Clarke said the failed marriage had a resounding effect on Diana. ""When Diana walked towards me at school, she had these downcast eyes,"" Clarke said of their first meeting, when Diana was just 9. Diana's broken home made her feel different from her classmates, Clarke said. Divorce was uncommon at that time in England. Even more unusual -- Diana's father got custody of their four children. Nearly 40 years later, Clarke still remembers their first conversation. ""She said, 'I will never marry unless I'm really in love because if you're not in love, you're going to get divorced -- and I never intend to be divorced,' "" Clarke said. ""This was quite a profound statement for a little girl to come out with."" ""Diana's dreams all through her childhood really were just to be happily married and to have a large family,"" Clarke said. Her dream, specifically, was to marry Prince Charles, 12 years her elder. While other 13-year-olds loved pop stars, Diana's boarding school room was decorated with pictures of Charles.  See family photos as CNN's Soledad O'Brien recounts friends' stories of Diana » . The young child's dreams seemingly came true when she married him just seven years later, but, like her parents' relationship, her marriage unraveled. From that first candid conversation about her aspirations, Clarke and the future princess of Wales connected. ""We always clicked from the word go,"" Clarke said. ""We worked together as a team."" Clarke had heard rumors about a mischievous Diana -- how a flurry of nannies had come and gone, including the one she locked in a bathroom. But, Clarke said, the Diana she knew never gave her ""any headaches whatsoever."" Clarke, who was 21 and had no previous experience, was given ""sole charge"" of Diana and her younger brother Charles. Diana often helped around the house and was especially nurturing toward Charles. Charles would describe his sister as the ""very essence of compassion"" at her funeral. Diana's motherly instincts were evident as she matured. As a teenager, she would become a nanny, then an assistant kindergarten teacher, and then a mother of two sons, William and Harry. Clarke remembers observing Diana's impartial love at a young age. She played with children from royalty as well as children from the village. ""They were all treated completely as equals, which is why I feel that in Diana's adult life, she ... found it so easy to interact and to mix with everyone, because to her, each person was an individual,"" Clarke said. Diana would become famous for that openness. She was photographed holding hands with a patient who was HIV positive in 1987 -- when many still believed the virus could be spread by touch. Diana devoted herself to her volunteer work, visiting the sick and campaigning for an international ban on landmines. Even as a teenager visiting patients at a mental hospital, she bonded with people -- ordinary people, disabled people -- in a way no other student could. In his funeral oration, Charles said his sister told him ""it was her innermost feelings of suffering that made it possible for her to connect with her constituency of the rejected."" She remained, he said, a ""very insecure person at heart."" As the Princess of Wales, Diana captivated the world with the same qualities that stood out to her nannies -- her affection, her vulnerability and her private misery. These qualities changed the face of the monarchy, and they keep the shy girl from a broken home just as much in the public eye, a decade after her death. E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal court has given the Obama administration the go-ahead to continue funding embryonic stem-cell research. The controversial 2-1 decision Friday is a victory for supporters of federally funded testing for a range of diseases and illnesses. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted an injunction imposed last year by a federal judge, who said all embryonic stem-cell research at the National Institutes of Health amounted to destruction of embryos, in violation of congressional spending laws. Legislation passed in 1996 law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in the creation or destruction of human embryos ""for research purposes."" Private money had been used to gather batches of the developing cells at U.S.-run labs. The current administration had broken with the Bush White House and issued rules in 2009 permitting those cells to be reproduced in controlled conditions and for work on them to move forward. Obama officials have been at odds with many members of Congress over whether the the NIH research actually causes an embryo's destruction, as prohibited by the Dickey-Wicker Act. Two scientists had brought a lawsuit to block further research. But the three-judge panel concluded in its 21-page ruling, ""the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail because Dickey-Wicker is ambiguous and the NIH seems reasonably to have concluded"" the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells. The ruling does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells, which remains permissible under federal law. The plaintiffs have the option of now taking their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for review. The issue at this stage deals only with the lifting of the injunction allowing funding to continue for embryonic stem-cell research. The larger constitutional issues are still being debated at the district court level. The government had argued that an extensive list of research projects outlined by the National Institutes of Health would have to be shelved if the court had not acted and granted a stay. The field of embryonic stem-cell research has been highly controversial, because in most cases the research process involves destroying the embryo, typically four or five days old, after removing stem cells. These cells are then blank and can become any cell in the body. Embryonic stem-cell research differs from other kinds of stem-cell research, which don't require embryos. Some scientists believe embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. The case began with a lawsuit against the NIH by scientists opposed to use of embryonic stem cells, a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization, the nonprofit Christian Medical Association and others. When the injunction was first issued by Judge Royce Lamberth in August, Ron Stoddart, executive director of Nightlight Christian Adoptions -- one of the groups that filed the lawsuit -- said he supported adult stem-cell research that doesn't require destroying embryos. ""Frequently people will say, 'Why are you opposed to stem-cell research?' and of course our answer is, 'We're not,' "" Stoddart said. ""We're opposed to the destruction of the embryos to get embryo stem cells."" When President George Bush first approved federal funding of human embryonic stem-cell research in 2001, 60 existing stem-cell lines -- which were created before August 9, 2001-- qualified for federal funding. Of those, only 21 actually were usable for scientists. Bush later rescinded the funding. Since the Obama administration's rules went into effect, at least total of 75 stem cell lines qualify for federal funding, according to  the NIH. NIH has invested more than $500 million in human embryonic stem-cell research. Because such embryos are destroyed when stem cells are removed for research, most opponents believe this is moral issue. Scientists conducting such research said continued federal funding is necessary, saying they would have greater flexibility to work collaboratively within labs, across labs and around the world on the latest treatments and breakthroughs. Supporters of embryonic stem-cell research say their studies have shown promise to treat a range of debilitating conditions including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, cancers, and spinal cord injuries. The case is Sherley v. Sebelius (10-5287).","NEW: The NIH has invested more than $500 million in human embryonic stem-cell research .

"(CNN) -- Gun control supporting candidates facing tight races for governor in Connecticut and Maryland are the beneficiaries of a last-minute ad buy from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg's group, Independence USA PAC, is supporting pro-gun control candidates like Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy in Connecticut and Democratic Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown in Maryland, both of whom are locked in tight races to lead their states. Gun control is a ""simmering issue"" in these states, said Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser. Historically, the PAC has donated to both Democrats and Republicans supporting ""common sense"" gun control in an attempt to stave off the gun lobby and tie pro-gun candidates to the National Rifle Association. In Connecticut, the group hopes that support for gun control will emerge as a salient theme for voters in the wake of the state's Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012, where 20 young children and 6 adults were shot and killed at an elementary school. The newest ads there target Malloy's opponent, Republican challenger Tom Foley. ""The NRA praises Tom Foley, calling him pro-gun,"" a voice in a new Connecticut ad says. ""No wonder. The NRA opposes comprehensive background checks. And Foley promised he'd sign a bill to weaken them, undermining our gun safety laws."" The Foley campaign did not immediately return CNN's request to respond to Bloomberg's efforts. This is the second ad buy in Connecticut in the past week: Television watchers also might have noticed another gun control ad which launched Friday from the group. Loeser said these ad buys represent an attempt to make sure gun control stays on the agenda in these states. ""The public safety bills that were passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre -- which have overwhelming support -- are an issue for discussion,"" Loeser said. ""One of the things that Independence USA is able to do is help highlight issues particularly in expensive media markets like New York City that might otherwise get swept under the rug."" The group has plans to spend $1.7 million in the state in its support for Malloy, who signed a gun control law in 2013 which expanded background checks and banned sales of some weapons like the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which was used in the Sandy Hook massacre. Foley took a stand against Malloy's measures in an August gubernatorial debate, calling his moves ""grandstanding"" and ""overreaching."" He has also said he would repeal Malloy's gun control legislation. Four years ago, Malloy narrowly fended off Foley by less than one percentage point in their 2010 battle for the governor's office. The candidates are tied in the most recent poll from CBS/New York Times/YouGov. In Maryland, Brown holds a substantial lead over his opponent, Republican Larry Hogan. But the race has drawn the attention of national headliners: Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has stumped in the state for Hogan, while top Democrats like President Obama and the Clintons have appeared for Brown. Bloomberg -- a noted philanthropist and media magnate boasting a net worth of $34 billion -- has pledged to spend $25 million through his political action committee to raise awareness on gun control across the country. Shortly after the Newtown shootings, he made a sizable donation to Americans for Responsible Solutions, a fundraising group run by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The former congresswoman survived gun wounds to her head after an attempted assassination attempt in January 2011. With polling places officially open in Connecticut and Maryland in just a week, Bloomberg's group is focused on Election Day. ""We take these elections one at a time,"" Loeser said.","Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is making ad buys.

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie ""absolutely"" plans to give up acting one day -- but not just yet. The actress gave her fans a scare on Wednesday when she said in an interview with DuJour magazine that she's ready to give up performing for directing. ""I've never been comfortable as an actor; I've never loved being in front of the camera,"" Jolie said. ""I didn't ever think I could direct, but I hope I'm able to have a career at it because I'm much happier."" So, she's planning to leave acting behind? ""Absolutely,"" Jolie responded. But that certainty came with a caveat. ""I see myself moving into directing more and doing much less as an actor,"" Jolie later clarified to Entertainment Weekly. ""I have a few more in me, ones I have been developing for some time, so I will do those before I step away."" Obviously, one of those movies she wants to see through is her 2015 film ""By the Sea,"" which she wrote and directed, and also stars in with husband Brad Pitt. ""It's a heavy film, and it's not easy for us,"" Jolie told DuJour of her upcoming project. ""But even as you struggle through it, you're in the trenches together and you don't expect it to be easy.

"Washington (CNN) -- In the words of Judge Roslyn Silver, the situation is ""dire."" From her chambers in Phoenix, Arizona, the chief judge of federal judicial District of Arizona warns a bulging criminal caseload is being exacerbated by three unfilled bench seats, which the Obama administration and the Senate have, until recently, shown little urgency to address. ""We have a crisis, we have vacancies, and we would like to have them filled so that justice can be served,"" she told CNN in an exclusive television interview. The crisis was thrust suddenly upon the 64-year-old Arizona native. The murder of her predecessor, Chief Judge John Roll in the January 8 Tucson shootings that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords seriously wounded suddenly put her in charge. Losing a colleague and dear friend, while ensuring her court continued to do its job remains a personal and professional challenge for Silver, but she remains quietly confident. ""We are doing our job,"" she said. ""That's what we were appointed to do and we will continue to do, and I can't imagine anything falling apart here."" A nationwide dilemma . The situation in Arizona is mirrored nationwide, caused by a combination of practical and political forces. The importance of the federal courts is not lost on the ever-rising number of civil and criminal litigants seeking justice, and on the issue advocacy groups that have made the appointment of judges a political rallying cry. That has led to delays of up to 19 months in getting some nominees confirmed. ""Government is now not doing it's job, that's what it comes down to, it's just not filling these vacancies in a timely manner and there's enough blame to go around,"" said Russell Wheeler, a policy analyst with the Brookings Institution. ""I think it's going to be harder and harder to get people, good people to be federal judges because who wants to go through this process?"" In Arizona, a state with the third highest criminal caseload in the country, the vacancies have left the remaining three Tucson-based judges handling more than 1200 criminal cases each. ""And then of course they have civil cases on top of that,"" said Judge Silver. ""And I just learned recently that Judge Roll was carrying about 150 civil cases."" Based on its caseload, the judicial district of Arizona is eligible for five additional judgeships. There are now 92 vacancies in the 857 federal district and appeals court judgeships, amounting to about 11%. Just 61 names have been currently put forth by President Obama in the new Congress, many of them renominated -- but never confirmed -- from the past two years. Seventeen candidates have received confirmation since January. The Administrative Office of the U.S. courts predicts at least 23 more vacancies this year. Since Obama took office in 2009, the number of open slots has risen steadily, as judges retire or leave for better-paying jobs. The president has been slow to replace them, compared to his two predecessors. In their first two years, Bill Clinton had a 90% confirmation rate for his nominees, while George W. Bush had a 77% rate. Obama by contrast has only had 58% of his 103 choices clearing the Senate hurdle. His supporters point to a number of factors for the slow start -- including two time-consuming Supreme Court vacancies in the past two years. Yet White House aides proudly note the diversity the president has brought to his nominees: About three-fourths are women or minorities, with a particular focus on Hispanics. By contrast, the current federal bench remains almost 60% white male. Supreme Court choices almost always receive relatively swift attention. Obama's two choices -- Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- took their judicial oaths less than three months after being chosen. Some lower court nominees by contrast nominated in 2009 by the president have yet to get a final vote. Wheeler from the Brookings Institution and other court watchers point the finger at all sides: a delinquent White House, stall tactics from conservative Republican senators, and an ever-increasing chorus from interest groups on the left and right. ""Both parties may have an institutional reason to get this back to a situation it was before,"" said Wheeler, ""where the government could fulfill a basic government function, which is filling judicial vacancies."" There is some hope of that happening. Seven judgeships have been approved in the past month by senators, including two this week. Several more nominees have been promised floor votes in coming days. Government sources say Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, reached an informal agreement earlier this year not to use the same procedural maneuvers that have delayed many judicial nominees over the past few years. Most nominees, said sources, will get up-or-down votes in ""an orderly fashion."" Most. The Senate Judiciary Committee resumes confirmation hearings Wednesday, with perhaps the most contentious nominee getting another shot. University of California law professor Goodwin Liu has been tapped to sit on the 9thCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals. His outspoken opposition to many of the legal policies and judicial nominees of the second Bush administration has earned him conservative wrath. If confirmed he would be only the second current Asian-American on the federal appeals bench, and many liberals see Liu as a potential candidate for the Supreme Court someday. Cause and effect . The sagging economy has rippled into the federal courts, with ever-increasing bankruptcy filings and civil, financial disputes. Current legal fights over national security, health care reform, and ""social"" areas like gay marriage have only added to the bulging dockets. In the District of Columbia, hundreds of appeals from terror suspects detained at the Guantanamo military prison have overwhelmed that federal court. As a result, ""We plan to try very few civil cases this spring and summer,"" said Chief Judge Royce Lamberth. Washington's federal district court has three current judicial vacancies. Lamberth is unusually blunt about the situation, saying, ""This is as bad as I've seen it."" ""There's a war between the legislative branches of government and the judiciary is caught in the middle and we are suffering,"" the 1987 Reagan appointee told CNN. ""The Republicans are doing exactly what they accused the Democrats of before. They're stalling and there's no good basis to stall if you have no basis against the nominee."" Some courts in some areas of the country report little or no backlog. Other areas like the Southwest see no relief. Operation Streamline has been anything but for those on the judicial front lines. The federal program launched in 2005 requires low-level criminal prosecution and imprisonment of nearly every illegal immigrant caught crossing parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. Judges in the region report being swamped. ""The border courts are absolutely overloaded,"" said Judge W. Royal Furgeson, based in West Texas. ""You've got judges handling eight times the number of criminal cases than are normally registered in other courts across the nation. That's a staggering docket. It's amazing."" The 1993 Clinton appointee said some decisions by his border state colleagues are made ""assembly line fashion, which I think we all find unacceptable."" Arizona justice . Silver said criminal prosecutions in her home state have risen by about 70% in the past two years. So in January she declared a judicial ""emergency"" in Arizona, giving her and her colleagues more time before defendants must face trial. Essentially those criminal trials do not have to take place for 180 days as opposed to the Speedy Trial Act requirement of 70 days. It is a rarely used tactic, but Silver said she and her predecessor, John Roll, had no choice. ""He initiated the request for a declaration of the judicial emergency,"" she said. After his sudden death, ""I picked up the reins immediately and accomplished it. He put together all the statistics so all I did was update those statistics and now it has been accomplished."" Roll in fact had gone to speak informally with Rep. Giffords at a Tucson-area constituent gathering about the judicial emergency, when the shootings occurred. The 63-year-old judge was caught in the crossfire. ""Well we were absolutely shocked and stunned and we're still saddened,"" said Silver, a 1994 Clinton appointee. ""The crisis occurred on January 8, we went back to work on January 10. We did not lose any stride whatsoever. We are dealing with a crisis. We do our best not to think about it and let the sad news overcome us."" CNN's Dan Lothian and Shawna Shepherd contributed to this report.","There are now 99 vacancies in the 857 federal district and appeals court judgeships .

"(CNN) -- When you're talking about Chris Hemsworth being named People magazine's new Sexiest Man Alive, don't make the mistake of calling him ""that guy from 'The Hunger Games.'"" No, Chris Hemsworth is the ripped Australian actor who's made a name for himself as the hammer-wielding Thor in Marvel's blockbuster movies. The Hemsworth who does star in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise is actually Hemsworth's younger brother, Liam. While the two siblings have competed for a role once before -- they actually both auditioned to play Marvel's Norse god, with Liam being a serious contender -- there's no beef between them about Chris landing at the top of People magazine's ""sexy"" list. ""Liam's been good; we've been throwing sexy looks back and forth all week,"" Hemsworth, 31, said on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" Tuesday, where his People magazine cover was revealed. ""He's been a real team player."" And what does Hemsworth himself think of his sexy status? ""I'm most excited about the 'alive' portion of that statement,"" Hemsworth joked. ""The sexy is a bonus, and I'm flattered."" Aside from his hotness, here are a few other things you should know about the star: . Before he was Thor, he was a TV star Down Under . Chris Hemsworth earned his first acting credit in 2002, and in 2004 he landed the role of Kim Hyde on the Australian soap opera ""Home and Away."" After starring on the series for three years, Hemsworth moved on to the big screen, landing a part in J.J. Abrams' 2009 ""Star Trek"" as George Kirk. He's actually the middle Hemsworth brother . There are two Hemsworth siblings that are currently dominating our movie screens, but there's actually a third Hemsworth brother, Luke. He's the eldest, and is three years older than Chris. ""We grew up surfing and stuff,"" Liam, 24, told Details magazine of their upbringing in Melbourne, Australia. ""That's why we can laugh (at the movie industry). This business is ridiculous."" He's married to Spanish actress Elsa Pataky . Just as Chris Hemsworth's reputation as Hollywood's newest heartthrob was taking off, he settled down and tied the knot with Spanish actress Elsa Pataky in 2010. When his wife learned that she's married to the ""Sexiest Man Alive,"" she thought ""it was pretty funny,"" Hemsworth told People. ""We had a good laugh about it."" Perhaps that's because, in the Hemsworth household, Pataky still reigns as ""the sexiest thing in the world,"" Hemsworth said. He's a major family man . Chris and Elsa have been steadily building a family since they wed in 2010. In 2012, the couple welcomed their first child, daughter India Rose, and in March 2014 they added twin boys to their brood. With his movie commitments, Hemsworth has admitted that it isn't easy balancing fatherhood with his superhero duties. ""It makes it harder and harder to leave and go to work,"" he told People of being a dad last year. ""I enjoy being at home a lot more than I ever have."" He's not only about Marvel movies . So far, Hemsworth has starred in two ""Thor"" movies -- 2011's ""Thor"" and 2013's ""Thor: The Dark World"" -- and he has a third sequel on the way. That's not even counting the times he suits up to star in Marvel's ""Avengers"" movies. Between that demanding schedule, Hemsworth is squeezing in other dramatic work. In 2013, he starred as British race car driver James Hunt in ""Rush,"" and in 2015 he'll appear in Ron Howard's action adventure, ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" and a comedy called ""Vacation.""","Chris Hemsworth is People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive for 2014 .

"Jabal Akhdar, Oman (CNN) -- For centuries, European travelers would tell tales of Oman's Jabal Akhdar mountain -- of its lush gardens filled with grapes and pomegranate surrounded by otherwise parched desert terrain. Alas, access to the site was shut off in the 1950s amidst internal strife and tribal rebellion. The area remained a tightly controlled military zone for decades after the conflict ended. Recently, however, all that has started to change. The Omani government is hoping to make Jabal Akhdar (Arabic for Green Mountain) a focal point for showcasing tourism in the interior of the country. A number of resort brands are already building on this opportunity. The 86-room Alila Jabal Akhdar luxury hotel -- part of the wider Alila Group which operates throughout India and the Asia-Pacific region -- is one such company. Opened in May 2014, the project is striving to meet the government's vision of preserving the heritage of the region. ""The design and the architecture of this particular property was very much to make a very traditional Omani house concept using local materials,"" says Jork Bosselaar, general manager of the Alila Jabal Akhdar. ""Elements of traditional welcomes will stay. We are collaborating with the local farmers to procure the produce and we are getting them involved in the economy. The heart and the soul and the character of the hotel are local people from the mountain who guide the guests into their communities, introducing them to the local customs,"" Bosselaar adds. Tour guide Ali Al Abri is one of the natives keen to do just that. He says part of the appeal of Jabal Akhdar is the cooler climate it offers visitors compared to other parts of Oman. ""While we have high temperatures in cities around the country, we have really moderate temperature here,"" Al Abri says. ""So the closest place in the region here to escape in 1 or 2 days would be the mountain."" The tourism ministry of Oman says that the number of tourists to the region has grown by 12% in the past year alone. A similar rise is expected next year. And with a burgeoning new industry comes greater opportunity for the 10,000 people who call Jabal Akhdar home. Nasser Al Fahdi works at the front desk of The Sahab, the only other established hotel on the mountain right now. ""It is very important for me because if tourism opens for this mountain, it means more jobs will come for the people here."" Since the hotel opened in 2011, Al Fahdi says room occupancy has risen by as much as 20%. Next to The Sahab, construction work is underway for two more hotels, including one mammoth project that comes with a $50 million price tag. Such impressive developments are a far cry from the turmoil of yesteryear. But a priority for the future of this fertile desert oasis.","Oman is looking to open up its interior to tourists .

"(CNN) -- That North Korean leader Kim Jong Un won his first parliamentary election with a clear 100% of the vote might not be remarkable, but who he chose to cast his vote with certainly has sparked interest amongst Korea-watchers. Kim was accompanied to a polling station at Kim Il Sung University of Politics by his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, in what was her first official appearance. The state-managed parliamentary election was the first ""election"" for Kim, who is the third leader in a dynastic lineage that has ruled the Stalinist state since 1948. Critics have discounted North Korea's electoral process as a political show to legitimize the country's rubber stamp parliament, given that there is only one named candidate for each electoral district. Unanimous vote, 100% turnout . The country's Central Election Committee released a report that Kim was unanimously elected as Deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) of the DPRK, with 100% turnout. On March 13, state media quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: ""All its citizens of the DPRK took part in the election to consolidate as firm as a rock the people's power chosen by themselves, fully enjoying their rights as the genuine masters of the state and society, and voted for the candidates with loyalty and patriotism."" The spokesman criticized a U.S. State Department spokesman's ""impudent"" comment that North Korea's election process was undemocratic. ""This is nothing but a ridiculous jargon of those who cannot understand the advantageous election system of the DPRK as they are engrained with repugnance toward the Korean-style socialist system,"" he said. ""The U.S. had better feel ashamed of the American-style election which decides everything with fraud and swindle and its dollar-almighty election system in which a duck on a pond can be a president if it has money, and mind its own affairs before impudently finding fault with others."" Daniel Pinkston, Deputy Project Director, North East Asia for the International Crisis Group, told CNN that Kim Yo Jong's presence by Kim's side was politically significant. ""Recently over the past year there have been these glimpses of her in public and rumors about her position in the party,"" he said. ""It's an event to introduce her."" Kim Yo Jong's presence as a ""senior official of the Party Central Committee"" may point to a generational power shift, with some speculating that she may be ready to take over her aunt's role in the upper echelons of North Korea's political elite. There has been some confusion surrounding the current status of Kim's aunt, who is also late ruler Kim Jong Il's sister. South Korean intelligence agencies believe that it may refer to another individual. Waning influence . While Kim's aunt's name -- Kim Kyong Hui --appeared on a list of SPA members, a South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson told CNN there is a possibility she has not been re-elected to the Assembly. ""We cannot be 100% certain if that is her or someone else. We have not been able to confirm and need further verification,"" the spokesperson said. Pinkston does not believe that Kim Kyong Hui is likely to suffer the same fate as her husband, Kim Jong Un's former protector Jang Song Thaek, who was executed as an enemy of the state. ""I think her time is over and that her generation ... her time has passed ... she's untouchable as part of the family whereas Jang Song Thaek was an outsider. (However) as far as political influence it's basically over."" Read more: Kim Jong Un lauds purge of executed uncle . Read more: Why North Korea probably won't change despite damning U.N. report .

"(CNN) -- As he watched wounded troops being brought inside the hospital on stretchers, Michael Conklin couldn't believe what he was seeing. ""You see this stuff in movies, but I was watching it happen,"" said Conklin, recalling a 2003 visit to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. ""There were so many casualties coming in -- busloads of them."" Conklin made the visit to learn more about the needs of wounded servicemen and women. The needs were overwhelming. ""When these guys come back from war, they are broken,"" he said, reflecting on the missing limbs, traumatic brain injuries and other devastating wounds he observed. Conklin's eldest son, Kris, was treated at Walter Reed in 2003, after his Humvee was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq. He recovered from his injuries, but his dad was heartbroken when he realized that other wounded troops didn't have the support his son did. ""We have a tight, cohesive family. Not all of them do,"" said Michael Conklin, 59. ""Some of them don't have anybody to come home to. ... ""When I first went to Walter Reed to visit, I wanted to take them all home with me. But you can't. It's impossible."" Instead, he started a scholarship program -- the Sentinels of Freedom -- to support disabled veterans and help them become self-sufficient. Since 2003, Conklin and his foundation have assisted more than 100 veterans with housing, education, jobs -- whatever they need to adapt to their new lives. ""Every one of them is different,"" Conklin said. ""Some will need service dogs, guide dogs, housing assistance, special equipment put through the house, drivers."" Hien Tran, 33, was injured by an improvised explosive device five years ago in Iraq, and he spent 15 months at Walter Reed. He lost his right eye and had a titanium rod placed in his leg, and he said he didn't have much hope for the future. But through Conklin's program, Tran received more than $60,000 for a vehicle, housing assistance, furniture and household goods. He also received valuable mentorship and advice that has helped him make his engineering and building firm successful. Tran is now paying it forward by hiring other veterans. ""I think (for) every wounded veteran, every disabled veteran out there, the drive is now double of what it was before,"" Tran said. ""Because you want to be seen as normal. You want to be successful."" Tran has been thankful for Conklin's personal guidance along the way. ""Mr. Conklin's helped me build my business,"" he said. ""I go back to Mr. Conklin and say, 'Hey, this is what I want to do' ... and he gives me his input."" Conklin, a former real estate agent from San Ramon, California, is a father figure for many of the ""Sentinels"" in his program. He said he usually hears from four or five of them a day. ""I have an intimate knowledge of what's going on with them,"" he said. ""Most, if not all, have my cell phone number."" Conklin also has teams based in 28 states across the country, ready to help veterans in need. These teams partner with local businesses and individuals who are willing to donate their services, time and money. It's this community support that is crucial to the program's success, Conklin said. ""These kids grew up in our neighborhoods, went to our schools and churches, played on our ball fields,"" he said. ""We need to welcome them back into their communities with open arms."" Conklin never served in the military, but his three sons are Army Rangers -- one is in Afghanistan -- and his brothers served in Vietnam. He said he has always taken note of the treatment of men and women in the military. ""One of the things that bothered me as a kid when my brothers were in Vietnam was that nobody from our community knew their names or faces,"" Conklin said. ""And I could see that happening again."" The Sentinels of Freedom program rigorously screens each candidate, and scholarship recipients must continually provide status updates to keep getting assistance. But it's not just about the money, Conklin said. It's about building relationships and reintegrating people into society. ""We don't just write a check,"" he said. ""We walk with them until they are successful."" Recently, Conklin picked up his phone and heard Johnny Jones' shaky voice on the other end. Jones, 27, is a retired Marine who lost his legs when he stepped on an IED in Iraq. ""I want to tell you something before you hear it from someone else,"" Jones said. Conklin's heart stopped. A medical scare? A death? His mind was racing. ""I got a C in one my classes,"" Jones replied. ""And I want to explain why."" Jones is pursuing a bachelor's degree at Georgetown University, and Conklin's group has assisted him with tuition, rent and expenses like his computer. When Conklin heard that Jones' news was just a bad grade, he felt more than relief. He felt pride. ""I was proud that he trusts me enough to give me a call,"" Conklin said. ""It showed tremendous character."" For Conklin, that's what his program is all about. ""What we try to do is focus on the future, the potential,"" he said. ""We can't focus on the injury, even though it's hard not to because you're looking at a young man with no legs or arms, or burns. ""You really have to listen hard, look into their eyes, look for that spark that says: 'This guy has potential. Let's see what we can do to help him get there.' "" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- A copyright dispute over royalties from an acclaimed film, ""Raging Bull,"" can go the distance after the Supreme Court on Monday allowed a lawsuit to move ahead. The appeal deals with a 1963 book and screenplay on the life of former middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who wrote it with his childhood friend and business partner, Frank ""Peter"" Petrella. LaMotta's story was made into the 1980 movie, starring Robert De Niro. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, concluded Petrella's daughter did not wait too long to make her claims against Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, which made and distributed the Academy Award-winning drama. The case on the merits will now be heard in lower federal courts. Entertainment companies will likely be affected financially by the ruling. Earlier courts had limited similar lawsuits, often filed many years after movies, plays, and television shows first premiered, by the estates of actors, writers, and producers. With new electronic outlets emerging for a range of entertainment and literary properties, those companies may have to rethink their strategy when negotiating not only rights to the original creative property, but such retooled content as merchandising, spinoffs, and video games. The underlying issue was a lot more dry and technical than the film itself: equitable defense and tolling for remedies in civil copyright claims. That was apparently enough to temper the court's creative streak in Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's majority opinion -- no pop culture references to showbiz or sports; no clever rhetoric about this being a ""knockout"" legal fight; and no justice who would admit ever seeing the acclaimed film. At issue is whether rolling time limits in filing copyright infringement lawsuits applied in this case. She claimed ownership over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story. Her father died a year after the movie's release. Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991. But her lawsuit was not filed until 2009. MGM Studios and 20th Century Fox -- the movie's distributor -- say that violates the established legal principle of ""laches,"" which bars most claims that are unreasonably delayed, on the theory it would unfairly burden the adverse party. Both sides also dispute what ownership rights the studio retained after the elder Petrella's death, and which were subsequently returned to his daughter. Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights. She seeks damages dating back three years from the filing of the lawsuit, and an injunction on further distribution of the work without compensation. Her lawyers claim the delay over years was caused by fear of retaliation, lack of money to file the suit, and being told by the studio that ""Raging Bull"" was no longer making money. The federal government backed her, at least in part. MGM and Fox say they have invested heavily to convert the film to formats such as DVD for home viewing, and for overseas distribution. The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions. But Ginsburg, writing for the court, concluded the studio had the weaker argument. ""If the rule were, as MGM urges, 'sue soon, or forever hold your peace,' copyright owners would have to mount a federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude,"" she said. The three-year limitations period ""allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle. She will miss out on damages for periods prior to the three-year look-back, but her right to prospective injunctive relief should, in most cases, remain unaltered."" Ginsburg added, ""Allowing Petrella's suit to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has earned during that period and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties, such as consumers who have purchased copies of 'Raging Bull.'"" Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy, along with Chief Justice John Roberts dissented. Copyright experts say the high court's ruling will make it easier to press decades-old copyright claims. ""Hollywood has an insatiable appetite for recycling old film content,"" said William Kane, an attorney with BakerHostetler. ""Increasingly copyright ownership for much of this older content has now been passed down to the families and heirs of the original creators. And if the current owners did not sign over all their copyrights to the industry, you end up with potentially multi-billion dollar clashes of interest."" ""Raging Bull"" won two Oscars, including best actor for De Niro, who portrayed the boxer. LaMotta is 92 and not a party in the appeal. The fighter also known as the ""Bronx Bull"" held the middleweight title from 1949-51. The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).","The Supreme Court permits lawsuit to move ahead years after being filed .

"(CNN) -- Mike Nichols, the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award, died Wednesday evening, according to a note from ABC News' president to its staff. Nichols, 83, who directed ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and ""The Graduate,"" was the husband of former ""ABC World News"" anchor Diane Sawyer. Nichols' influence looms large in entertainment. He was among the founders of the Compass Players, the predecessor to the Chicago-based comedy troupe Second City, which has been a proving ground for comic talent for more than four decades. Share your memories of Mike Nichols . As a performer with Elaine May in the late '50s and early '60s, he took comedy into places it had seldom gone before, bringing an improvisational swagger and intellectual edge to a field that had been dominated by joke-telling standups. ""Nichols and May combined the political and social satire of (Mort) Sahl and (Lenny) Bruce with the inspired comic skits of (Sid) Caesar and (Imogene) Coca,"" wrote Sam Kashner in a 2013 Vanity Fair profile. Nichols was also an outstanding theater director. At one point in 1967, he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon, ""Barefoot in the Park"" and ""The Odd Couple"" -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life, helming Tom Stoppard's ""The Real Thing"" (1984), ""Monty Python's Spamalot"" (2005) and a 2012 revival of ""Death of a Salesman"" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. But he's probably best known for his movies, including the groundbreaking ""The Graduate"" (1967), the Oscar-nominated ""Silkwood"" (1983) and box-office smash ""The Birdcage"" (1996). He was known as an ""actor's director,"" one able to pull strong performances from his ensemble and capable of seeing things others didn't. Dustin Hoffman remembered Nichols' ability at an American Film Institute tribute. Hoffman observed that Benjamin Braddock, the character he played in ""The Graduate,"" was a tall, blond, WASP-y type in the novel. (Indeed, among the actors considered for the role was Robert Redford.) But Nichols saw the character as uncertain and neurotic, qualities Hoffman brought to life on screen. ""And so I thank you for casting this short, 29-year-old, unknown actor with a prominent nose to play Benjamin Braddock,"" Hoffman said. ""God bless you, sir. You're more than a great director. You're a real artist down to your toes, because you're insanely courageous."" Starting with two phrases . Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931. With war clouds looming and Nazi persecution of Jews rising, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. As recounted in the book ""Faces of America,"" a young Nichols arrived in the United States knowing only two phrases: ""I don't speak English"" and ""Please, don't kiss me."" The family changed its last name to Nichols after settling in New York City, where the family patriarch established a medical practice. Nichols attended college in Chicago and later headed back to New York, where he studied acting under famed teacher Lee Strasberg. He returned to Chicago, where he started up a comedy troupe and met Elaine May. The pair would go on to form a partnership that would later take Broadway by storm. Nichols said he took to the stage. ""I liked doing the stand-up,"" Nichols told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012. ""I only stopped because Elaine wanted to stop. I've never understood it. I thought: 'Why? It's not a very long show. It doesn't cost us anything emotionally.' "" He moved behind the scenes and directed Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley in ""Barefoot in the Park,"" which won him his first Tony in 1964. For a time he was Broadway's golden boy, with success following success: ""Luv"" (1964), ""The Odd Couple"" (1965), ""The Apple Tree"" (1966, featuring a young Alan Alda), ""Plaza Suite"" (1968) and ""The Prisoner of Second Avenue"" (1971). ""Barefoot,"" ""Odd Couple,"" ""Plaza Suite"" and ""Second Avenue"" were all written by Neil Simon. He was also the director of the musical ""Annie"" (1977), which was one of Broadway's longest-running musicals when it closed almost six years later. Notable movies . More acclaim would follow for his work on the big screen. His first film was a biggie: ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (1966), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and won five, including a best actress trophy for Taylor. His next film, however, was in many ways even more impressive: ""The Graduate,"" which made innovative use of pop music (thanks to Simon and Garfunkel's songs), featured a terrific script by Buck Henry and Calder Willlingham and became a blockbuster sign of the New Hollywood -- one led by youthful moviegoers and antihero protagonists. ""Nichols and veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees threw out the (Directors Guild) playbook for 'The Graduate,' experimenting wildly with lighting and lenses, lending the film a sense of freewheeling freshness, a sheen of visual inventiveness that hasn't dimmed over the years,"" wrote Slant magazine's Budd Wilkins in a 2012 look back. Nichols won best director for his work. His movies never quite caught lightning in a bottle again -- few movies do -- but still contained stirring scenes and fine performances: the launch of the planes in ""Catch-22"" (1970), the sour Jack Nicholson in ""Carnal Knowledge"" (1971), the lives of blue-collar nuclear plant workers in ""Silkwood"" (1983), the unrestrained glee of the plotting Melanie Griffith in ""Working Girl"" (1988). He also directed the TV production of ""Angels in America"" (2003), which won a then record-setting 11 Emmys. His last film as director was 2007's ""Charlie Wilson's War."" ""No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike,"" James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff. ""He had recently been immersed in a new project for HBO to adapt 'Master Class,' Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning play about opera legend Maria Callas. The project reunited him with Meryl Streep, one of his most frequent collaborators."" Nichols occupied that rare air in the industry of those who have won the EGOT -- an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. In 2012 he earned his record sixth Tony for best direction of a play for ""Death of a Salesmen."" He met Sawyer later in life (he was 54 at the time) and she became his fourth wife. He told The Hollywood Reporter that he first spotted the then-""60 Minutes"" correspondent on a flight and later struck up a conversation with her. ""I found her and said, 'You're my hero.' And she said: 'No, you're my hero. Do you ever have lunch?' She wanted to interview me for '60 Minutes.' I pretended that I was up for it, and we had about 14 lunches."" The couple was married for 26 years. In addition to Sawyer, Nichols is survived by his three children -- Daisy, Max and Jenny -- and four grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- What a week it's been for Formula One ace Nico Rosberg. A new wife, a World Cup win for his beloved German football team and now a new contract with the Mercedes team. Rosberg heads to his home grand prix in Germany this weekend on cloud nine -- and still leading the 2014 world championship by four points from Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. First came the wedding, as the 29-year-old married childhood sweetheart Vivian Sibold in Monaco last week. The celebrations carried on as Rosberg enjoyed a rare race free Sunday by watching Germany defeat Argentina to lift the World Cup for a fourth time. The Mercedes driver -- who had sportingly invited French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean to watch Germany defeat France in the quarterfinals after qualifying for the British Grand Prix -- plans to mark Germany's triumph with a special helmet for his homecoming race. He will race around Hockenheim with football's World Cup trophy at the centerpiece of a black, yellow and red design. Rosberg, the son of 1982 F1 world champion Keke, also goes to Germany with a multi-year contract extension in his back pocket. The former Williams racer, who joined Mercedes when the Silver Arrows returned to the sport in 2010, has signed on for an unspecified number of seasons. ""I'm looking forward to the next years together,"" said Rosberg, who has raced to six victories with the German team. ""We will keep pushing to win even more races -- and hopefully championships."" Mercedes motorsport chief Toto Wolff said: ""Nico's speed, commitment and focus have all helped to give clear direction and to drive the team forward since 2010. ""With his performances in 2014, Nico has demonstrated to the outside world what we already knew in the team; that he is one of the very top drivers in Formula One."" Rosberg made his F1 debut with Williams in 2006 but his reputation has grown at Mercedes, particularly as he proved equal to the sport's seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher during their three years as teammates. Since replacing Schumacher in 2013, Lewis Hamilton has provided another benchmark for Rosberg to measure himself against. The English 2008 world champion is generally perceived to be the quicker driver but Rosberg has shown in 2014 that he is developing into a more rounded racer. Hamilton signed a three-year contract when he joined Mercedes with the deal due to expire at the end of 2015. From junior teammates and friends, Rosberg and Hamilton are now locked in an intriguing battle for the 2014 world title. Rosberg has won three races with Hamilton, who has lost valuable points with two retirements, taking five grand prix victories as the season reaches its halfway point. After Hamilton's victory at the British Grand Prix put him back in the title hunt, Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda predicted of his Mercedes charges: ""They will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion."" Rosberg may already be enjoying an annus mirabilis but he still has his eye on the prize he really wants -- his first F1 world title.","Nico Rosberg signs a new multi-year contract with the Mercedes F1 team .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court struggled Tuesday, speaking in somber tones, when confronting one of its toughest criminal sentencing questions: whether two men convicted of killings committed when they were 14 deserve life in prison without the possibility of parole. The justices seemed to find little agreement on how young is too young in these rare instances, and whether it would be cruel and unusual punishment to forgo the chance that these now-adult inmates may someday be rehabilitated. ""What's the definition of a child?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito, trying to draw a constitutionally acceptable line on mandatory sentences for underage murderers. ""It seems to me some of the issues that we have suggested justify a different treatment of juveniles have to do with mental development,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""And those same issues would be taken into account by a jury in considering which of a list of offenses the juvenile should be convicted of."" The high court in 2005 banned the death penalty for those under 18 who commit aggravated murder. Then, five years later, the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole. Now the spotlight turns on the youngest of killers and the question of whether a national consensus has developed to treat them differently regarding a lifetime of incarceration. The separate appeals involve an Alabama boy who, with an accomplice, robbed a neighbor and then beat the man to death and set his house on fire; and an Arkansas youth who was part of a group of teens who robbed a video store where the clerk was blasted to death with a shotgun. Both were tried and convicted as adults and received the minimum sentences allowed under state law for felony capital murder. There are about 2,500 prisoners serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles, at least 79 of whom are 14 years or younger, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, which is representing the two men before the high court. Attorney Bryan Stevenson urged the justices not to ""give up"" on child offenders, who he said are fundamentally different from adults. He said while they must be held accountable for their actions, youths are also works in progress, emotionally and developmentally. ""These deficits in maturity and judgment and decision-making are not crime-specific. All children are encumbered with the same barriers that this court has found to be constitutionally relevant before imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty,"" said Stevenson, who is based in Montgomery, Alabama. ""These differences are even more pronounced in young children."" Justice Antonin Scalia jumped in. ""Once you depart from the principle that we've enunciated that (the) death (penalty) is different, why is life without parole categorically different from 60 years or 70 years? You'd be back here next term (challenging) a 60-year sentence."" He wondered aloud whether it would be fair to argue 14-year-olds deserve less time behind bars than a 15-year-old. Stevenson said firmly all those under 18 at the time of their crimes deserve the chance for parole someday. He said the often-terrible facts of a murder can overwhelm any mitigating factors like a defendant's age, especially for jurors who may be unaware that a young person's brain development, living environment and self-control are often not complete. ""You would say that a person of 17 years and 11 months, who commits the worst possible string of offenses -- and demonstrates great maturity -- still cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole?"" asked Alito, sounding skeptical. ""What justifies an absolute ban at a certain age and a modified ban above an age?"" added Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Scalia said 39 states allow juveniles to receive life without parole for certain murder offenses. ""The American people have decided that that's the rule. They allow it. And the federal government allows it. So I'm supposed to impose my judgment on what seems to be a consensus of the American people?"" Later, the Alabama solicitor general said states deserve discretion to set punishments for the worst of offenders, even teenagers. ""The government's primary goal here is expressing the retributive judgment about the wrongfulness of murder and why it's different,"" said John Neiman Jr. ""They don't want to roll the dice on convicted murderers. Society acts with particular revulsion when a convicted murderer commits a crime again"" after being released from custody, he said. ""How do you go back to justifying,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, ""the mandatory nature of life imprisonment without parole, given that not every juvenile is equal and not every murder is equal with respect to them?"" Justice Stephen Breyer pressed the question further, asking, ""What's the minimum age, in your opinion, or is there any constitutional minimum at all in respect to which you could give"" life without parole to a young killer. ""I mean, you could have an instance of a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old. I mean, is it totally up to the states, or is there a minimum?"" Breyer said. Neiman ran into trouble when backed into this legal corner, suggesting, ""If I were the state up here trying to defend a 12-year-old (getting life without parole), I would argue that that was the line. So a 12-year-old-- well, no -- well, yes,"" he finally decided. ""Do you see the difficulty? All right. So now put yourself in my position,"" responded Breyer. ""Do you want to say 12? Do you want to say 10? Do you want to say 9? Because as soon as whatever you say, I'm going to say: and why not 14?"" he added. Justice Anthony Kennedy -- as he has in many divided cases -- may prove to be the deciding vote. But he seemed troubled about articulating an appropriate age limit. ""Now, we have some quite compelling stories of rehabilitation in this case. I don't know if they're isolated; I don't know where they are in the statistical universe of how often rehabilitation is demonstrated and is real. What do I look at? What's a judge supposed to do?"" he asked Stevenson. ""You're just forcing us into a bipolar position. We're either going to say that you can't prevail at all or that everyone under 18 cannot get life without parole. I don't see this middle course."" Complicating matters, several justices noted differences between the two cases before them. Neiman noted the murder committed by Evan Miller in Alabama was especially ""gruesome."" The boy and his accomplice had smoked marijuana with the victim in his trailer. The 52-year-old man burned to death after the mobile home was set ablaze. In Kuntrell Jackson's case, he was originally outside as a lookout when the Chickasaw County, Arkansas, robbery took place. It was a 15-year-old boy who shot the female clerk when she refused to turn over money. The actual shooter later pleaded guilty and received life with the possibility of parole. Stevenson said there was a real question whether Jackson had an ""intent to kill"" during the botched robbery, perhaps allowing for a lesser sentence. But the Arkansas assistant attorney general said the sentence of life without parole was still appropriate, arguing the defendant could have received the death penalty if he had been an adult at the time of the crime. ""A legislative judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline for all murderers, whether they are juvenile murderers, whether they are getaway drivers,"" said Kent Holt. ""And when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets you liability for being a capital murderer, then that is the minimum sentence"" -- life without parole, with no exceptions.

"London (CNN) -- Michael Phelps added to his Olympic legend Friday night, winning the 100-meter butterfly to capture his third gold medal of the London Games and the 17th of his career. Already the most decorated Olympian in history, Phelps started off Friday's race -- which he has said will be his final individual Olympic race, having promised to retire after this competition -- trailing several swimmers. But with basketball great Lebron James and Prince William among those looking on, the Baltimore native charged ahead late to win by 0.23 seconds over South Africa's Chad le Clos and Russia's Evgeny Korotyshkin, who finished with an identical time. That margin, while slim, was still exponentially larger than when Phelps captured gold in the same event at the 2008 Beijing Games. Phelps won that race by .01 seconds by taking a quick, final stroke to catch a Serbian swimmer gliding to the wall. ""This one was I guess a bigger margin than the last two, so a step in the right direction,"" Phelps told NBC after his latest win. ""It's a pretty cool feeling. I have had a great week so far, and we have one more race tomorrow,"" he added, referring to his final Olympic race Saturday as part of the U.S. men's 4X100-meter medley relay team. Phelps wasn't the only American to make history in the pool Friday. Missy Franklin, 17, from Pasadena, California, earned her third gold medal, and fourth medal overall, in the women's 200-meter backstroke, smashing the world record in the process. ""It doesn't get any better than this,"" Franklin said to NBC about her victories in London. ""This has been the most incredible week, and I've never been happier."" Another American teenager, 15-year-old Katie Ledecky, also earned gold in impressive fashion, besting her nearest competitor by more than four seconds in the women's 800-meter freestyle. France's Florent Manaudou, 21, won the swimming competition's fastest and, arguably, most glamorous event with a time of 21.34 (just a shade off the Olympic record) in the men's 50-meter freestyle, his first ever Olympic final. The United States' excellence at the Aquatics Centre helped them pass China for the most gold medals, with 21, on the seventh full day of the Games. The Americans have 43 medals total, compared with 42 for the Chinese. Great Britain also rocketed up the medal count chart Friday, thanks to one of its athletes' best days yet. The host nation captured three gold medals, bringing its total for the Games to eight, just behind South Korea for the fourth most of any country. The women's double sculls team of Anna Watkins and Katherine Grainger placed first in their competition, while the Brits excelled at the Velodrome for indoor cycling events. The men's team pursuit title went to Great Britain, and in world record time. Then, a short time later, Victoria Pendleton eked out a win by fractions of a second over a fast-charging competitor from China in the women's keirin competition. London 2012 live: Day six . In tennis, Roger Federer of Switzerland advanced to the gold-medal match in men's singles, after beating Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina in a marathon four-hour, 26-minute match. The legendary player's final match doesn't promise to be much easier, considering that the London crowd most likely will be rooting against him. That's because Great Britain's own Andy Murray secured a spot in the championship, after beating hard-hitting Serbian Novak Djokovic by a 7-5, 7-5 score. Federer and Murray last matched up on the same court in July, when the 30-year-old Swiss won the Wimbledon final in straight sets despite the exhortations of the home crowd, which included several members of the royal family. The women's final, meanwhile, will pit American Serena Williams and Russia's Maria Sharapova after the two won semifinal matches Friday in straight sets. Both women are no strangers to the All-England Club court: Sharapova has won the iconic Wimbledon tennis major once, while Williams has captured that championship five times, most recently just a few months ago. The U.S. women's football (soccer) team also moved to the semifinal round with a 2-0 win over New Zealand. Still, the biggest match of the day showcased two of the sport's top teams in Brazil and Japan. Reigning World Cup champion Japan won 2-0 to advance to the next round. In judo, 16-year-old Wojdan Shaherkani of Saudi Arabia was allowed to compete wearing a headscarf but lost in her elimination match Friday to Melissa Mojica of Puerto Rico in 82 seconds. Officials initially said they would not allow her to compete in the headscarf, but Shaherkani's father and Saudi officials insisted that she would not compete without it. Shaherkani, who was competing in her first major international event, received a special invitation to compete from the International Olympic Committee. One of the most exciting contests Friday may have mattered little in the medal count, though it provided a historic amount of drama. The women's basketball teams from Great Britain and France finished their preliminary round game's regulation tied at 67, and the game looked set to go into a second overtime. But France's Celine Dumerc hit a three-point shot with a fraction of a second left to propel her team to victory. And for the first time since the opening ceremony, Olympic Stadium was buzzing Friday with the start of track and field competition. Athletes in action included American sprinter Allyson Felix, who won her first-round heat to move on to the semifinals of the 100-meter sprint. She raced a few weeks after she sprinted to a tie with Jeneba Tarmoh in the Olympic Trials. On the day of a scheduled runoff, Tarmoh -- who is part of the U.S. team as a member of the relay pool -- backed out. Fellow American Carmelita Jeter posted the day's best time in that race at 10.83 seconds, a full tenth of a second better than her next fastest foe. Most of the track and field events Friday were qualifiers, like the women's sprint, but a few medals were handed out. Poland's Tomasz Majewski won gold in the shot put, just ahead of Germany's David Storl. America's Reese Hoffa was third. And the women's 10,000-meter race ended with a climactic finish, as Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba pulled away from a pair of Kenyan runners for the win.","Michael Phelps wins the 100-meter butterfly by 0.23 seconds for his third gold of Games .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden has been the topic of much discussion this past week as to whether he was playing racial politics in what has become the ""chains speech"" in Danville, Virginia. Commentators, political pundits, politicians and academics have weighed in. But through all of the hoopla, it is important to probe the statement that preceded Biden saying to the audience at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research: ""They're going to put y'all back in chains."" Here is Biden's full statement from the speech: ""(Mitt) Romney wants to let -- he said in the first hundred days, he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules. 'Unchain Wall Street.' They're going to put y'all back in chains."" Knock yourself out focusing on the racial implications of what Biden had to say. Because when I look at the number of Americans still underwater because of the dastardly things that took place in the housing market; when I look at the number of banks that took billions in federal funds supposedly to provide credit to Americans, only to use it to shore up their balance sheets; and when I look at the banking industry fighting tooth and nail to prevent future regulations, that to me is far more vital to determining who we should cast our vote for in November. Neil Barofsky, The independent watchdog appointed to investigate the TARP program, wrote in his book, ""Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street,"" that the federal government committed $23.7 trillion in various initiatives to save the financial industry. Yes, $23.7 trillion. Not all was spent, but that figure begins to get at the depth at which Wall Street had devastated this country with its reckless behavior. Mitt Romney, who made his millions in private equity, is most certainly the guy Wall Street is betting big on. Millions are flowing into his coffers from Wall Street because he has made it clear that he is going to pretty much say, ""Gents, it's business as usual!"" We could have some faith in his vice presidential pick, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who has talked openly about reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, which was enacted in 1933 to protect Americans by preventing commercial banks from also being investment banks. Yet it was the repeal in 1999 of that important law's restrictions, a repeal led by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, of Texas. and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, that is largely to blame for the current crisis. Far too few banks are in control of far too much of the nation's money, and when the shameful and evil ways they make money end up almost collapsing the economy, taxpayers are left to bail them out. Ryan voted for repeal on Glass-Steagall in 1999, but is on the record recently as saying Glass-Steagall should return. But the man at the top of the ticket isn't so sure, which means that Ryan will have to keep his thoughts to himself. Romney and Ryan are in lockstep in disagreeing with the passage of the Dodd-Frank law, which was supposed to reform the banking industry, and that should cause many of us to be cautious as to why. Let's be clear: Dodd-Frank is not a perfect bill. The financial lobby was successful at stripping away some of the toughest provisions of the law, and former Connecticut Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd was too willing to do their bidding. Democrats and Republicans are to blame for that, but at least the law is an effort to get Wall Street to clean up its act. Romney seems to want Wall Street to keep doing what it's been doing, offering no specifics on what kinds of regulations should be imposed to put it in check. He definitely wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, but won't say what he'll replace it with. When J.P. Morgan announced it lost $3 billion a few months ago, Romney essentially shrugged his shoulders and said that's the free market enterprise for you. But when that free market enterprise results in our economy almost collapsing, resulting in Wall Street needing more than a trillion dollars of infusion from the American taxpayer and the Federal Reserve, it sure isn't free to us. Far too many banks have been horrible at working with the millions of homeowners who face foreclosure, as evidence by stories done by many reporters, including CNN's Jessica Yellin Romney? Nothing. Go to www.mittromney.com and see if you find anything confronting the housing crisis. Nada. Nothing. Zip. Judging by the voting record of Ryan in the House, we surely can't expect him to work to change Romney's mind. Ryan was one of only 64 House members to vote against a law requiring credit card companies to notify cardholders they were going to raise their interest rates (it passed). He voted no on a bill to allow the Treasury Department to offer $300 billion in loans to community banks to assist small businesses (it passed). He voted yes to strip the Consumer Financial Protect Agency of some of its toughest rules, instead wanting to soften it up (it failed). And he voted yes on a bill that delayed for a year new regulations on the kind of derivatives that created the financial mess we're in right now (it passed). It is clear that Wall Street doesn't care about American consumers, except to keep them shackled in debt through sky high credit card balances, thus allowing the financial industry to make billions off the high interest rates. Bankers fought hard to keep hitting account holders with hidden fees, again lining their pockets. And they sure as heck aren't doing enough to stabilize the housing market by drawing down principals and placing a moratorium on foreclosures. So we should recognize Romney's recipe of ideas as a disaster for consumers and a boon for Wall Street. You can be angry all you want about Biden's chains comments, but you better be just as upset if we have to go through another financial calamity like we did in 2008 when Wall Street ran amok and took us for suckers in an effort to tap into our pocketbooks again, courtesy of the U.S. Treasury.

"(CNN) -- Russia lashed out Friday against the latest round of sanctions over its involvement in Ukraine, accusing the United States of once again escalating the crisis -- undermining the chances for peace there as well as the greater quest for ""global stability."" This followed U.S. President Barack Obama's announcement Thursday that, in coordination with the European Union, ""we will intensify our coordinated sanctions on Russia in response to its illegal actions in Ukraine."" The United States and its allies, chief among them Ukraine's Kiev-based government, accuse Russia of implicitly and explicitly supporting separatists claiming territory and battling the Ukrainian military in the European nation's east and south. Moscow has voiced moral support for the rebels but denied any direct involvement, including countering NATO and others' claims that its forces have entered Ukraine and fired on Ukraine's military. Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement Friday responding to the latest sanctions, which it called ""the latest hostile step on the confrontational course of the American administration."" The ministry claimed Washington ""is focusing on an escalation of the Ukrainian conflict"" rather than a peaceful resolution. Levying sanctions against Moscow is counterproductive, the Russian government added, claiming they hurt American businesses and compromise international goodwill to address common issues like terrorism and drug trafficking. And sanctions won't spur Russia to change its policy, according to the foreign ministry. ""We are not going to act in order to please the United States' geopolitical ambitions and the calculations of those overseas politicians who are trying to use a 'manageable Ukraine' to restrain Russia,"" the ministry said. The foreign ministry didn't respond back with counter-sanctions against Washington, which it characterized as ""a last-ditch measure."" Instead, it said it is ""leaving the door open to constructive and honest bilateral cooperation, including working together to tackle the Ukrainian crisis if the U.S. administration is willing."" ""Washington needs to recognize: only respect for each other's interest can help us find a solution to the Ukrainian crisis that suits everyone,"" the Russian ministry said. New sanctions despite ceasefire . For months, Russia and the West have been at odds over Ukraine -- which continues to simmer with tension, despite a fragile, recently agreed-upon ceasefire. U.S. officials and their allies have not dispatched troops into Ukraine to help their allies there; in fact, Obama has ruled out such direct intervention. Instead, they have tried to press the issue diplomatically and through sanctions targeting Russian citizens, officials and industries. Their rationale is to compel the Kremlin to stop fueling, in their view, the crisis in Ukraine. That's even after Russian President Vladimir Putin played a role in brokering a ceasefire signed Friday after talks in Minsk, Belarus, between representatives of Ukraine, the rebels and Russia. Speaking about the new sanctions, Obama said Thursday, ""We are implementing these new measures in light of Russia's actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month, including through the presence of heavily armed Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. ""We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine."" A NATO military officer said Thursday that Russia has about 1,000 troops inside eastern Ukraine, down from a significantly higher number in recent weeks. NATO also sees 20,000 more Russian troops aligned along the border, according to the NATO office, who was not named according to standard practice in the organization. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Carol Jordan and Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","Russia's foreign ministry accuses the U.S. of again escalating the crisis in Ukraine .

"London (CNN) -- Three co-authors of the U.N. report into the 2008-09 Gaza war parted ways with a dramatic reconsideration of key conclusions by Richard Goldstone, the team's chairman and fourth author. Pakistani human rights lawyer Hina Jilani; Christine Chinkin, professor of international law at the London School of Economics; and Desmond Travers, a retired Irish soldier and peacekeeper, said in a Guardian newspaper column in Britain on Thursday that they want ""to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission's report unsubstantiated, erroneous or inaccurate."" ""There is no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict,"" they said in the British daily. ""The report of the fact-finding mission contains the conclusions made after diligent, independent and objective consideration of the information related to the events within our mandate, and careful assessment of its reliability and credibility. We firmly stand by these conclusions."" The report, issued in September 2009, is officially called the ""United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict,"" but it is popularly named the ""Goldstone Report"" after the former South African jurist. The report found both Israel and Hamas likely committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the conflict between December 27, 2008, and January 18, 2009. Israel launched the offensive against Gaza militants in response to ongoing firing of rockets against southern Israeli towns. However, in a Washington Post op-ed column posted on the newspaper's website, Goldstone said he would have reached different conclusions if the Israeli military had been more forthcoming and if he had known the results of subsequent investigations. ""If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document,"" wrote Goldstone. Goldstone wrote that Israeli investigations found cases involving individual soldiers, but the intentional targeting of civilians was not a ""matter of policy."" The U.N. Human Rights Council, which assigned Goldstone and others to the fact-finding mission, approved the controversial report, which focused more on alleged war crimes by Israel. Israel later provided the United Nations with a report justifying its actions. Israel said it faced ""asymmetric conflicts"" and blamed ""militants operating from within and behind civilian areas"" for placing civilians at risk. In his column, Goldstone cites a subsequent report by a U.N. committee of independent experts, which found Israel investigated more than 400 allegations of misconduct while Hamas has ""not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against Israel."" ""That the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying -- its rockets were purposefully and indiscriminately aimed at civilian targets,"" Goldstone wrote. Goldstone said Israel should have conducted proceedings in a public forum and been more cooperative during his panel's investigation. ""Israel's lack of cooperation with our investigation meant that we were not able to corroborate how many Gazans killed were civilians and how many were combatants,"" Goldstone wrote in the Washington Post article. But the three co-authors in the Guardian assert Israel and Hamas ""have yet to establish a convincing basis for any claims that contradict the findings of the mission's report."" They argue that the follow-up U.N. report, written by a committee led by Judge Mary McGowan Davies criticized Israel, expressing ""serious concerns about the late start and slow pace of the proceedings, their insufficient transparency and the participation of victims and witnesses."" ""In addition, with regard to the issue of the policies guiding Operation Cast Lead, the committee states that there is 'no indication that Israel has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw Operation Cast Lead.' In other words, one of the most serious allegations about the conduct of Israel's military operations remains completely unaddressed,"" the three wrote, referring to the name of the Israeli offensive. Echoing a report by the follow-up committee, the three say they regret that ""no domestic investigations at all have been started into any of the allegations of international crimes committed by members of Palestinian armed groups in Gaza which have fired thousands of rockets into southern Israel."" The Israeli government and others have called for the United Nations to retract the Goldstone report, but the three reject those stances as well as what they say have been ""personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure"" on the members of the fact-finding mission. ""Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitize our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade,"" the three said. Yigal Palmor, Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman, on Thursday reiterated Israel's negative position on the Goldstone report, citing flaws and biases in the document. He defended Israeli investigations into the report and endorsements by international authorities that the country sincerely worked to seek justice. A Palestinian Authority government spokesman welcomed the column and said it is ""very disturbing that members of the committee say they have been put under pressure to sanitize their conclusions."" ""Israel must not be allowed to influence the outcome of what needs to be an objective process. Nor must Israel be allowed to investigate its own actions and find itself not guilty,"" Ghassan Khatib said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Angela Merkel might be the most powerful female politician in the world these days. She certainly is in Europe. We now know that her cell phone was monitored by U.S. intelligence, not just since she became the German Chancellor in 2005, but also for an additional three years before that. Many U.S. analysts are now arguing that Merkel's anger at the revelations is manufactured for public consumption. They could not be more wrong. A lot of Germans were flustered when they learned this summer that the NSA had been collecting millions of bits of so-called meta-data on them. According to opinion polls, 60% of Germans supported Edward Snowden's release of classified information. Just 17% found what he did was wrong. For Germans, the discussion about U.S. surveillance is not a joke. In fact, it couldn't be more serious. We value our privacy highly. It is seen as an individual liberty that often could not be taken for granted in German history. Both the Nazi secret police -- the Gestapo -- and the East German intelligence agency -- the Stasi -- spied extensively on citizens. Even in more recent decades Germans have repeatedly fought battles about privacy and against a perceived ""Ãœberwachungsstaat"" -- or ""surveillance state."" Compared to the U.S., Germany already has many laws concerning data privacy, but two-thirds of Germans would even like stricter regulations. Back in the summer, Merkel tried to downplay the U.S. surveillance herself and stood strong on the side of the U.S. ally. In mid-July, Merkel gave an interview on the topic, which in light of the recent revelations, seems almost satirical. OPINION: Stasi past looms over spy scandal . The host of the show introduced her as ""the lady who hopes that at least her cell phone is bug-proof, even from U.S. intelligence services."" Merkel said later in the interview: ""I know that I am not being monitored."" A month later -- and in the midst of an election campaign dominated by this issue -- the German government announced that the ""NSA scandal,"" as the German media called it, was over because the U.S. had ensured more transparency. The German public's anger calmed and Merkel cruised to re-election. Last week Merkel learned in a particularly personal way that the issue is far from over. She became Germany's first NSA victim known by name and gave the extent of U.S. spying a face. Politically Merkel didn't have a lot to gain by bringing this issue to the table again. Her anger is not simulated for domestic consumption. In fact, the opposite is true, since she is now criticized for not taking the extent of the surveillance more serious in the beginning. Merkel is usually measured. For her to pick up the phone and call President Barack Obama to publicly criticise the extent of U.S. surveillance shows how disgruntled she really is. Her anger seems real and rightfully so. Eavesdropping on Merkel's conversations and reading her text messages is completely unacceptable. Not because she is the most powerful female politician, but because she is one of the closest allies the U.S. has in Europe and, overall, a trusted friend. The latest polls show that a majority of Germans supports her sharp reaction; a quarter even thinks that she has reacted too gently. Back in the summer, Obama said that if he wanted to know what Merkel is thinking, he could pick up the phone and just ask her. In retrospect, this comment verges on the offensive. So what benefit does it really bring to spy on Germany? Are these benefits really worth the costs? Even if Obama has begun a foreign policy shift towards Asia in his presidency, he still needs strong transatlantic partners. Of course, the ""HandyÃ¼berwachung"" -- the German word for spying on cell phones -- hits close to home for Merkel. She grew up in Eastern Germany where every conversation, every step, was monitored by the Stasi. It's in part because of her past that Merkel always had a lot of respect for the United States. She values freedom and liberties and with that the country, which seemed to value these attributes the most: The United States. Merkel wouldn't challenge relationships with the U.S. if she didn't think it was necessary. She wouldn't endanger the Swift data exchange agreement and negotiations on a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States, just to demonstrate that she is a strong leader or to strengthen her position at home, which is stable regardless at the moment. Ever since World War II, German-U.S. relations have flourished through trust in each other. That trust is broken now. For the first time it seems, the U.S. has crossed an actual threshold. Tapping the phones of ally leaders shouldn't be a question of ""can we"", but rather ""should we?"" Now it is time for the U.S. to try to understand those cultural concerns, to show Europeans that security doesn't trump liberty; that the intelligence services haven't gone wild and, especially, to rebuild the trust of a valued ally. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charlotte Potts .","German Chancellor Angela Merkel is indignant over having her phone monitored .
Merkel grew up in East Germany where domestic spying was rampant .
She respected the U.S. as reflecting her values of freedom and liberty .

"Washington (CNN) -- Microsoft and Google are getting help from other tech companies in their fight to release more information about government surveillance orders, which companies say is their First Amendment right to provide. On Monday, Microsoft and Google were joined by Yahoo and Facebook in asking the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to allow them to make public aggregate data listing the number of court-ordered records requests, including those made for criminal and national security investigations. The companies, in court filings made with the surveillance court, portrayed the government's attempt to block them from publishing more detailed data as a version of prior restraint, infringing their right to exercise their First Amendment rights. The move seeks to set a high bar for the government to stop publication, akin to the Nixon administration's failed attempt to stop newspapers from publishing the Pentagon Papers. According to the companies' court filings, the data isn't classified, but the government seeks to prevent publication on national security grounds. They argue there are ways for them to tell their customers more about the government's requests, with broad statistics every six months, without compromising individual security investigations. The companies argue that they are acting to correct the public record on national security requests they are compelled to obey. They cite disclosures by Edward Snowden, a fugitive former National Security Agency contractor who says he leaked thousands of documents on government surveillance, which has led to erroneous news stories, the companies say. All say they do not allow the government direct access to their computer servers. Google in its filing says, ""Notwithstanding Google's complete denial, the revelations about the scope of the NSA activities, and false or misleading stories about Google's alleged involvement in such activities, have continued unabated and continue to cause substantial harm to Google's reputation and business."" The other companies also said their businesses were being harmed by not being allowed to provide more information. In the court filings, the companies are asking to publish how many government data requests are for content and how many are for so-called metadata, which includes information such as the sender and receiver of e-mails and phone calls, and the time and date when they are sent or made. Google and Microsoft also asked to make oral arguments on the legal fights; Google asked that the court, which normally conducts its proceedings in secret, allow arguments open to the public. James Clapper, director of national intelligence, has said the agency plans to publish broad data on criminal and national security surveillance requests. But that data wouldn't show requests made to each company. The legal tussle came as the technology company officials went to the White House as part of a new ""working group"" focusing on transparency. The Obama administration has defended the NSA's surveillance activities, saying they are necessary to prevent terrorism and protect national security. But President Barack Obama has acknowledged the need for greater transparency and invited companies to help come up with new ways to disclose more. Microsoft and Google first made their request to publish surveillance data in June and then spent the last few months negotiating with the government. After failing to reach an agreement, the companies got permission from the surveillance court to make new legal filings. The deadline for those filings was Monday. The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.","Microsoft, Google seek OK to tell customers what information NSA has gotten .

"(CNN) -- Their livelihood was being threatened, and they were tired of waiting for government help, so business owners and residents on Hawaii's Kauai island pulled together and completed a $4 million repair job to a state park -- for free. Volunteers bring in a heavy crane for work on a bridge to Polihale State Park on Kauai last month. Polihale State Park has been closed since severe flooding destroyed an access road to the park and damaged facilities in December. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources had estimated that the damage would cost $4 million to fix, money the agency doesn't have, according to a news release from department Chairwoman Laura Thielen. ""It would not have been open this summer, and it probably wouldn't be open next summer,"" said Bruce Pleas, a local surfer who helped organize the volunteers. ""They said it would probably take two years. And with the way they are cutting funds, we felt like they'd never get the money to fix it."" And if the repairs weren't made, some business owners faced the possibility of having to shut down. Ivan Slack, co-owner of Napali Kayak, said his company relies solely on revenue from kayak tours and needs the state park to be open to operate. The company jumped in and donated resources because it knew that without the repairs, Napali Kayak would be in financial trouble. ""If the park is not open, it would be extreme for us, to say the least,"" he said. ""Bankruptcy would be imminent. How many years can you be expected to continue operating, owning 15-passenger vans, $2 million in insurance and a staff? For us, it was crucial, and our survival was dependent on it. That park is the key to the sheer survival of the business."" So Slack, other business owners and residents made the decision not to sit on their hands and wait for state money that many expected would never come. Instead, they pulled together machinery and manpower and hit the ground running March 23.  Watch the volunteers repairing the road » . And after only eight days, all of the repairs were done, Pleas said. It was a shockingly quick fix to a problem that may have taken much longer if they waited for state money to funnel in. ""We can wait around for the state or federal government to make this move, or we can go out and do our part,"" Slack said. ""Just like everyone's sitting around waiting for a stimulus check, we were waiting for this but decided we couldn't wait anymore."" Thielen has been waiting, too. She wants the legislature to approve her Recreation Renaissance project, a $240 million booster shot to help fix parks across the state. Without it, at least five state parks may be forced to close, and there would be no emergency repair money to fix Polihale State Park. ""We shouldn't have to do this, but when it gets to a state level, it just gets so bureaucratic, something that took us eight days would have taken them years,"" said Troy Martin of Martin Steel, who donated machinery and steel for the repairs. ""So we got together -- the community -- and we got it done.""  See photos of the volunteers working to repair the road » . The park is a fixture on the west side of the island and a favorite spot for many in the area, but it's also a hub for tourists. ""Tourism is our lifeblood. It's what pays all of our bills,"" Slack said. ""The money that pours in comes from tourism is really an important factor for everyone here in Hawaii, and it's such an important time to encourage tourism."" And it's an important time to keep jobs, which were threatened if the park had to remain closed. In February, Kauai's unemployment rate was at 9.1 percent, up from 2.8 percent during the same time in 2008, according to Hawaii's Department of Labor. ""I think it's crucial to say the doors are open, everyone is ready,"" Slack said. ""So when one of the most important parks in Hawaii is closed, it really changes things."" Now, because of their hard work, volunteers hope they'll be ready to send that positive message -- right in time for the tourist season. Slack said he likes to have business up and running by April 15, and the season gets busy around May 1. The business owners and residents are hopeful that their generous contributions in time and resources mean the park should officially open soon. Pleas says they have only to get the new bridge certified and do minor cleanup. ""A lot of people are quietly sitting by, waiting for it to open,"" Slack said. ""This really this is one of the nicest parks in the state and in all of Hawaii, in the entire state parks department. Now, hopefully, those people get their wish.""","Some business owners will be in trouble if park doesn't reopen .

"(CNN) -- Airline uniforms may not be the fashionista's definition of sartorial elegance but the flight attendant's garb represents the epitome of jet-set style and glamour for one aviation enthusiast. Cliff Muskiet has been collecting female flight attendant ensembles since the early 1980s and has accumulated over 1,000 outfits and accessories, which he proudly displays on his website uniformfreak.com. ""I love airplanes and everything that comes with it,"" says Muskiet, who also works as a flight attendant for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. ""When I think of an airplane, I automatically think of a stewardess. When I think of a stewardess, I automatically think of a uniform. When I think of a uniform, I want to have it,"" he adds. See also: High-end designers create uniforms for the masses . Muskiet often receives requests to display his collection at industry shows and exhibitions. He says the uniforms offer a window into different eras of style and commercial aviation history. ""You can see the fashion change through the years when you look at the stewardess uniforms,"" explains Muskiet. ""I love the 1970s psychedelic patterns and color combinations: yellow, red, orange, purple, green, white, blue. Every color was used and everything was possible,"" he adds. Over the years, some of the world's most prominent fashion designers have created outfits for airline companies, including Giorgio Armani (Al Italia), Nina Ricci (Cathay Pacific) and Christian Lacroix (Air France), says Muskiet. See also: 'Safe-list' flyers get security fast track . But just because big-name designers put their names to particular items it doesn't mean that the uniforms they produce are always a work of beauty, he explains. ""Yves Saint Laurent, for example, has made beautiful clothes for women, but the uniform he designed for Qantas in the 1980s was so horrible,"" says Muskiet. Muskiet highlights 1970s uniforms from Japan Airlines, El Al and Iberia as some his all-time favorite items. He says the combination of aesthetic style and neat accessories, as well as the embodiment of the carrier's national identity -- although this is not absolutely necessary -- can all be important factors in creating a uniform that will resonate.

The veil is that national identity as well as the color of the uniform: beige is the color of sand."" Muskiet says his collection will continue to grow for as long as airlines are willing to let him get his hands on their attire. In doing so, he hopes to preserve and further chronicle the historic link between airlines and the styles they continue to spawn.

"(CNN) -- With sparkling new air hubs and new tourism opportunities, some of the world's biggest hotel brands have spied the perfect opportunity to pitch up in the Middle East in recent years. Hilton, Waldorf Astoria and Shangri-La are all making major investments in previously sleepy outposts such as Ras al Khamiah as well as hot new locations like Saadiyat Island, both in the UAE. But one local company has a head start on the big global players coming late to the game. Rotana Hotels is an Abu Dhabi-based chain that has been growing at an aggressive rate since it was founded by business partners Nasser Al Nowais and Selim El Zyr in 1993. From just two hotels back then, Rotana is now responsible for 85 sites across the Middle East and northern Africa. According to new CEO Omer Kaddouri, beating the international competition to the likes of Syria, Iraq and Sudan is just the start of the company's plans. The ambition is to more than double the number of cities where Rotana has a presence to 40 and increase the number of hotel rooms -- or keys -- to 28,000 by 2018. The majority of this early expansion will take place in the Middle East but Kaddouri is also casting his eyes further afield. ""We are talking to people in Southeast Asia, India (and) Australia,"" he told CNN's Marketplace Middle East of where he hopes Rotana will develop next. Having been in the hotel industry for almost 30 years, Kaddouri believes that Rotana should be competing with some of the larger hotel chains in big important regional locations. ""I visited several major cities in need of hotels. (They'll say) 'Who are Rotana?' That's when we need to sell ourselves."" ""When they (potential investors) come and see us, the quality, the portfolio... the five stars and (the) apartments, they believe us. There will be an investor that will give the new kid on the block a chance."" A home-grown brand . Rotana's home grown brand status in the Middle East gives it the ability to break ground where others may hesitate. It was the first to open a five-star-hotel in fast-growing Erbil, northern Iraq. Next on the list according to Kaddouri is Iran. With roughly 80 million consumers, the Islamic Republic is a big prize. ""Iran is a big market ... we want to be the first (there) and I think we will be. Some elements need to be stabilized but we are hoping by end of next year, early 2016, we'll see our first hotel."" To expand as planned, Kaddouri says it is important to always maintain a clear identity and remember where the brand was born. The Beach Rotana in Abu Dhabi, for example, was the chain's first property and it remains a reference point for the company and the UAE. ""We're not going to change how we've been doing business just because I'm the new CEO,"" Kaddouri said. ""Our model works and we want to keep it that way. In the next six months, one year, we will start enhancing, tweaking."" With the Middle East, and in particular the likes of Dubai and Abu Dhabi fast becoming aviation hubs, opportunities to grow and further develop the regions burgeoning hotel sector will be plentiful. ""I always talk about the airlines,"" Kaddouri said. ""It's happening, making our area explode (with) incomings and outgoings."" ""It's getting better moving forward...bringing in commerce. That didn't happen 20 years ago and is great for us here and when we move out (around the world),"" he added.

"(CNN) -- It's the latest landmark on Singapore's already busy skyline. It features a 55,000 seater stadium, swimming pool complex and water sports facilities. It's also the winner of a World Architecture award and is described by the projects chief operating officer as less of a venue and more of ""a brand new city."" Welcome to Singapore's Sports Hub, which opened in June at a cost of more than $1 billion. This 350,000 square meter site, in one of the most land scarce countries in the world, is the result of a government driven initiative to firmly place Singapore on the global events calendar. It also hopes to get citizens moving and involved in all manner of sporting activities. According to Jonathan Rose, principal of design firm Aecom, the project has raised the bar in terms of its look, feel and goals. ""Sports Hub really is setting a completely new standard for how major sports infrastructure is being integrated to the community and ... the life of the city,"" Rose said. Inside, the main venue is decorated in a patriotic red and white, the national colors of Singapore. For COO, Oon Jin Teik, the building was designed to be versatile as well as symbol of national pride. ""Singapore is not a one sport nation,"" Oon said. As such, the sports hub will cater for football, athletics, rugby, cricket and even concerts under one giant roof. At 310 meters across the distinctive roof is the largest free spanning dome in the world. ""It takes away the heat, the direct sunlight, it takes away the heavy rain,"" Oon said. But it also does more than that. A 200 meter by 100 meter section of super lightweight steel can be moved on demand, taking 22 minutes to open and close. The traditional air conditioning system featured at similar retractable roof venues, meanwhile, has been replaced by an innovative bowl cooling system. These nifty features bring a host of benefits unseen elsewhere. ""You can sell tickets for banks of seats and then you can switch on the cooling for different banks of seats,"" said lead architect, Clive Lewis. ""In that way you reduce the energy by a sixth ... of the energy you would use to cool a conventional closed stadium."" But while the design may lead towards the environmentally friendly it also creates some unique challenges -- including grass that isn't quite the normal shade of green yet. As described by Oon, ""at different parts of the pitch the humidity is different, the wind is different, and therefore soil conditions are different."" The Sports Hub has suffered its share of embarrassment because of its sandy pitch in recent months. But there are signs a solution may be in sight. ""We found that we needed a more even blend of regular sunlight all the time,"" Oon said. ""We want to get it right more badly than our harshest critic."" That's required the stadium operators to adapt their plans for the facility. Luckily for them, the engineering flexibility afforded by the stadiums high tech design allows fine tuning for long term success.","The Singapore Sports Hub is a new stadium and events complex in the Southeast Asian country .
The project comes in at a cost of more than $1 billion dollars .

"(CNN) -- During his travels around the nation, meeting countless working men and women, Mike Rowe has certainly seen many different ways to make a living -- some more dangerous than others. Before becoming the host of CNN's new series ""Somebody's Gotta Do It,"" Rowe hosted a Discovery Channel series called ""Dirty Jobs."" After an episode that took place on an oil rig, Rowe received a job-safety question from a fan. ""My husband works on the oil rigs as a well tester,"" wrote ""suzemommy."" ""We watched you folks do so without any eye protection! Are you crazy? Drilling a hole with no protective eyewear? Between him, a well tester, and me, a workers' compensation lawyer, we're cringing! Somebody could LOSE AN EYE! Seriously -- Safety First, fellas! I would expect better from the Discovery Channel!!"" Rowe responded, ""I sincerely appreciate your concern for me, and agree that stupidity plays an ongoing role in my professional and personal life. But believe me, I have no wish to be injured on the job. However, it is not the objective of Dirty Jobs to conform to any particular set of safety standards, other than those dictated by the people for whom I happen to be working at the time. I take my cues from them, and I assume whatever risk they assume, for the most part. In the end, we hope to capture an honest look at what life is like for the workers in a particular venue. We do not aspire to set an example, or be a poster child for OSHA or any particular industry. I realize that may sound controversial, but it's the truth, and not nearly as inflammatory as what I'm going to say next. Ready? Of all the platitudes automatically embraced in the workplace -- and there are many -- there is none more pervasive, erroneous, overused, and dangerous, than ""Safety First!"" in my opinion. I have heard this slogan countless times. I have seen it emblazoned on banners, T-shirts and hats. I have sat through mandatory briefings and slideshows and presentations designed to ""protect me from the hazards at hand."" And I have listened as safety officers and foreman have run down list after list of OSHA requirements, all apparently construed to remind me that nothing is more important to the employer than my own well-being. What a load of unmitigated nonsense. In the jobs I have seen thus far, I can tell you with certainty, that safety, while always a major consideration, is never the priority. Never. Never, ever. Not even once. Is it important? Of course. But is it more important than getting the job done? No. Not even close. Making money is more important than safety -- always -- and it's very dangerous in my opinion to ignore that. When we start to believe that someone else is more concerned about our own safety than we are, we become complacent, and then, we get careless. When a business tells you that they are more concerned with your safety than anything else, beware. They are not being honest. They are hedging their own bets, and following the advice of lawyers hired to protect them from lawsuits arising from accidents. You are correct to suggest that wearing safety glasses would have made the task at hand safer. But why stop there? Wearing a helmet would have made it safer still. And wearing a steel mesh shark suit would have made it really, super safe. I know that sounds glib, and I know that many will wish to scold me for appearing cavalier. But really, I'm not. In a car, I wear a safety belt. On a motorcycle, I wear a helmet. Not because it's the law, but because it seems a reasonable precaution. And ultimately, the only one responsible for my own safety is me. (Besides, if the government were really concerned with my safety above all else, wouldn't they drop the legal speed limit to 30 miles an hour and make cars out of rubber?) Again, you're right -- I probably should have been wearing safety glasses, not because safety is first, but because I like to hedge my bets. We can always be safer. We can always assume less risk. But if safety were really first, I wouldn't travel at all, or engage in any activity that required me to assume any risk. And I certainly wouldn't be hosting Dirty Jobs.""","Author: It's dangerous to ignore this idea: Making money is more important than safety .

"(CNN) -- Next-generation video game consoles are nearly upon us, and with them will come increased power and cutting-edge developer tech. Analysts expect early games on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will look more realistic thanks to enhanced graphics capabilities. But some current-generation games are already bridging between real-life actors and near-real-life game simulations. The result is a film-like quality to the action in the games, creating a deeper feeling of immersion in the narrative. French developer Quantic Dream started down this path in 2010 with ""Heavy Rain,"" a noir-thriller game featuring characters that nearly resembled human actors. The facial expressions were highly detailed and small, human movements -- like shifting from foot to foot while standing still -- portrayed the virtual figures as more than mere avatars on a screen. Quantic Dream used a process called motion capture. Mo-cap, as it is less formally called, is a video process of tracking movements by placing markers on real actors to record their motions. It has been used in video game making since 1995, but the quality has improved dramatically in the past few years. In many video game mo-cap productions, body movements and facial features are recorded separately, then merged together during final production. But Quantic Dream founder David Cage wanted something more for his new title, ""Beyond: Two Souls."" Cage used a technique called ""performance capture,"" which is similar to mo-cap except all an actor's movements, along with dialogue and other sounds, are recorded at the same time. The entire performance is captured in one take and allows actors to interact with each other during a scene instead of being brought together by a computer later. ""With 'Beyond,' we have added complexity. We wanted to capture the movement of the eyes of the actors, which is always a major challenge,"" Cage said. ""We found a way ... to give them real life and really capture the subtlety of the performance."" The result is a smoother, more realistic portrayal of the interaction between characters. While, in a way, it's like shooting a movie, the interactive nature of video games means developers have to plan for many different player actions. So, the same scene will be shot in several different ways to anticipate what could happen. Cage said making a game look more realistic creates stronger emotional ties for the player. ""If we can create this link, the player will start to care for the character and identify himself through the character and then start to feel what the character on the screen feels,"" he said. This new realism push isn't limited to characters. Driving games have also been creating more realistic cars and applying more accurate physics to movements. Sports games are nearly television-broadcast quality in their depiction of the play on the field. However, there's one gaming genre that isn't trying to go full on real life -- for perhaps obvious reasons. Military shooter game developers say they're striving to bring the feel of war to the player without going too far. ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" and ""Battlefield 4"" are two recent examples. Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg said people want to be able to do things in video games they can't do in real life, but for first-person shooter games, there should be a limit. ""The genre does give an incredibly visceral opportunity for us to put people in fairly extraordinary situations with a very high realism, but with also a very good deal of poetic license,"" Hirshberg said. ""We want to get the details right to suspend your disbelief, but our developers take you on a fictitious thrill ride."" Infinity Ward executive director Mark Rubin said as a developer of ""Call of Duty: Ghosts,"" his group talks to former and current military personnel to learn what the troops experience, to help get the equipment right. ""It is amazing how that (military) community has been,"" Rubin said. ""They tell us stuff that they've been a part of that there's just no way we would put in the game because no one would believe it. It is so outrageous."" Gun violence in PG-13 movies has tripled . Executive producer Patrick Bach, of ""Battlefield 4"" developer DICE, said the game's depiction of war isn't intended to be realistic, but aims to be accurate and authentic. He said advancements in game engines have helped create a heightened sense of realism. ""We can do more with dynamic environments,"" Bach said. ""Now, everything is alive. We have 'Levolution,' a play on words for evolution of levels. You have weather changes, calm seas turning into stormy ocean in real-time and at the same time you are playing."" The move toward more realistic or film-like games has also created a cross-over effect between the video game industry and Hollywood. Bach said DICE, like other developers, have people on their development team who have also worked on movies. ""We use talent, not only from the visual effects areas, but from other places like set design to help us create realistic environments,"" he said. Gamers' expectations of dynamic environments and realistic characters are only expected to grow with the new PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. During the PlayStation 4 event in February, Quantic Dream used the new console for a tech demo so detailed that it initially confused some people as to whether it was live or computer-generated. ""The Dark Sorcerer"" was, at the time, a glimpse into how powerful the consoles were and what could be done with them. Cage, of Quantic Dream, said of the demo: ""It really sets the bar for next-gen acting and what acting can be in a game.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The woman who stabbed pregnant actress Sharon Tate to death will be considered for parole from prison a month after the 40th anniversary of the killings that cast a shadow of fear over southern California. Susan Atkins, shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders, has been denied parole 17 times. Susan Atkins, 61, has been denied parole in 12 previous hearings, but the former ""Manson Family"" member now is terminally ill with brain cancer and is paralyzed. Charles Manson used his hypnotic powers to direct Atkins and other ""family"" members to kill seven people, including the pregnant Tate, in a two-night rampage that terrorized the city of Los Angeles, California, in August 1969. Atkins -- who was initially sentenced to death along with Manson and three others -- will have her 13th parole hearing on September 2, according to a spokesman with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In July of last year, Atkins -- California's longest-serving female inmate -- was denied a compassionate release in a unanimous decision by the California Board of Parole Hearings. She has repeatedly been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings, and she now shuns Manson. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy and stabbed the pregnant woman 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate ""asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" After stabbing Tate to death, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's house guests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage. A Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, says Atkins is now paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and cannot sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair. However, despite her declining condition and her impressive prison record, the site says, ""there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society."" Atkins' compassionate release was opposed by Tate's sister, Debra, Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. However, the former prosecutor who won her conviction, Vincent Bugliosi, said he supports Atkins' request for release. ""She has paid substantially, though not completely, for her horrendous crimes,"" Bugliosi told the Los Angeles Times last year. ""Paying completely would mean imposing the death penalty."" Bugliosi is the author of several books on the Manson case, including ""Helter Skelter."" Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were ""so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back."" ""The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,"" Debra Tate said. ""They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."" In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins, who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz, wrote that ""this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day."" ""Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'"" Atkins was housed in the California Institution for Women at Frontera until May 2008, when her declining health caused her to be moved to Central California Women's Facility at Chowchilla. Manson and those convicted along with him in the murders -- Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten and Charles ""Tex"" Watson -- have been in California prisons for more than three decades. All were initially sentenced to death, only to have their sentences commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down death penalty laws in 1972, establishing a four-year moratorium on executions. Van Houten was released for six months after her conviction was overturned, but was reconvicted.

"(CNN) -- Sam Alito doesn't have ""any complaints"" about the press corps who cover the Supreme Court -- but the Associate Justice could do without ""incredibly snarky"" columnists. ""Some of the columns that are written, you know, are another story,"" Alito said, in a rare public lecture on Constitutional history and law presented by the New York Historical Society on Saturday. ""Some of them are written by people who are not very knowledgeable."" Alito took particular issue with a New Republic column critical of the cloistered culture of the Court. ""I was reading one, actually, reading one this morning that was complaining about the current membership of the Court, because unlike in past days, according to this columnist, we don't have a representation of drunks, philanderers, and a few, you know, a few other n'er do wells."" The column - entitled ""Yale, Harvard, Yale, Harvard, Yale, Harvard, Harvard, Harvard, Columbia"" - argues ""while we have gained diversity of background, we haven't gained diversity of experience"" and was penned November 13 by Dahlia Lithwick, a senior editor at Slate and regular Court watcher for the past 15 years. ""The current justices are intellectually qualified in ways we have never seen,"" Lithwick wrote. ""Compared with the political operators, philanderers, and alcoholics of bygone eras, they are almost completely devoid of bad habits or scandalous secrets. This is, of course, not a bad thing."" American legal scholar and Yale University professor Akhil Reed Amar, who moderated the discussion and referred to Alito by his first name throughout the event, politely described the column as ""interesting"", and quickly moved on to other topics. Alito was more forgiving of the regular Supreme Court press corps. ""We have a corps of journalists who are perm -- that, their full time job is to cover the Supreme Court. They're very knowledgeable, there are probably ten or so of them. The New York Times, Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg, I'm missing some but there are, there are -- they cover us full time. They are very knowledgeable and I think that their news stories about oral arguments and decisions when they come out are pretty good."" But he couldn't resist at least one jab. ""One of the interesting aspects of my job is that every once in a while we have a chance to compare notes with judges from other supreme courts or constitutional courts in other countries. And we had a visit a few years ago by justices from the Canadian Supreme Court. They, they told us that they do not have journalists like that,"" Alito said. WATCH: Supreme Court justices imagined as dogs . ""Because there journalists were, the people who wrote opinions about their decisions cover lots of other things, they, they didn't think that they were that knowledgable. So they devised this procedure that's called either a lock up or a lock down, I've forgotten which one. They will invite the journalists who may be interested in the, in a decision that's coming down to go into a little room just before the opinion is announced. And before they go in they take away all their electronic communications devices and then they lock the door and someone on the staff of the Court explains the decision to these, these journalists. And when they told me this story, they told us this story, I thought it was a really good idea. Until I heard that at the end of this process, they open the door and they actually let them out."" The New York City crowd laughed heartily. ""That's a joke, that's a joke,"" Alito interjected. ""That will make the papers tomorrow,"" said the moderator. Alito, at ease and clearly comfortable in the free flowing discussion, made few controversial remarks - unless you're Canadian. ""It has occurred to me that we American judges have the most boring robes of any judiciary anywhere in the world. Believe it or not - there's a website for everything - there's a website, you can check this,"" Alito said. ""If you have nothing else to do, you can compare and we are, we are the plainest, just the plain black robes,"" Alito continued. ""Everywhere else they have colors, they have fur, they have medals. The Supreme Court of Canada...to me, their robes look like they're dressed up like Santa Claus. Have you seen them? They have red robes and they have white fur around."" Indeed, a cursory but by no means exhaustive investigation by CNN returned a website - www.jjmccullough.com -- on which judicial robes of the world, including those seemingly inspired by Kris Kringle, were featured. Alito - who perhaps is best known to the public as the justice who mouthed the words ""not true"" as President Obama criticized the Citizens United decision during the 2010 State of the Union - need not worry about any blowback from his public comments. Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. ""I think life tenure is a great idea,"" Alito joked at the opening of the law lecture. ""I think the reason is that we have the oldest Constitution in the world and in the late 18th century they counted on biology taking care of the problem.""","Alito spoke at the New York Historical Society .

"(CNN) -- Out with seekers and brooms. In with stirrups and hooves. This is horseball, where rugby meets basketball on horseback -- but players have more fun comparing it to quidditch, the sport of Harry Potter's wizarding world. ""I usually ask people if they've seen the Harry Potter movies,"" says British horseball player Jamie Gibson. ""Quidditch is the nearest comparison I can think of. That usually gets people going."" While Potter and teammates pick up gruesome injuries with disturbing ease playing quidditch, full-contact horseball does at least feature helmets. ""It looks a little bit violent, but it isn't,"" says Frederico Cannas, the sport's president, who began playing as a teenager in his native Portugal. ""The horses are very well-prepared and there are rules to protect both the horse and the rider. It's intensive, but it's safe."" As UK horseball pioneer Jim Copeland puts it: ""People have a go at you, that you 'shouldn't be doing that with an animal,' but we only have one horse -- so we want to end up with it at the end of the game, in the condition it started in."" Horseball games last 20 minutes, in which teams of six -- four horses per side at any one time -- try to shoot a junior football with leather handles into an oversized basketball net. At the highest level, you can expect up to 20 goals per game. Players can tackle each other, so horses and riders do come into contact, and one of the game's signature moves involves riders swooping low to pluck the ball off the ground, without dismounting. That requires the game's only specialist riding equipment, a ""pickup strap"" which ties the stirrups together, allowing competitors to lean far below their horse, collecting the ball without falling off. ""That's our little secret,"" laughs Cannas. ""For spectators, it looks fantastic when players do that, but for people picking up the ball, it's not that difficult."" The sport's passing, movement and some strategies share similarities with rugby and basketball, but horseball first appeared in 1970s France as a descendant of pato, Argentina's national game. Pato is centuries old and looks more like polo -- early players once used a duck in a basket as the ""ball"" -- whereas horseballers say their sport offers a more modern, spectator-friendly experience. ""I believe this is one of the most exciting equestrian sports,"" says Cannas. ""It's a team sport, when equestrian sports tend to be individual sports, and the gear is not expensive. ""To start horseball, you don't have to have a lot of riding skills. You just have to be comfortable on a horse."" Copeland, who founded the North London club in the 1990s, adds: ""It's the team aspect. In the other equestrian sports, like dressage and jumping, the team event just means you're relying on each other for points. ""In horseball, you rely on each other the same way you would in a football match. ""Horseball encourages men and boys to stay riding longer. The participation is about 50-50, men and women."" Gibson, who works at a nuclear power station when not playing, is testament to that. He says horseball kept him riding as a teenager. ""I was about 14, and I was leaning more towards football and rugby,"" he recalls. ""But my uncle had a space on his horseball team and I didn't really look back. It kept me involved in horses. ""On the team this year there's me, two of my sisters, another lad that's played for about 15 years, and two girls who used to play for Nottingham -- one is a doctor and the other is an accountant."" The French, inventors of the game, still dominate the sport. Gibson believes France's senior men's team has never been beaten at international level. (He also complains that his British team, like England's footballers, are ""not as good as we should be."") Cannas says more than 80% of the world's players hail from France, while Copeland was inspired to start horseball in the UK when he saw a French demonstration at the 1991 Horse of the Year Show. But Cannas believes his sport can expand quickly in years to come, beginning with a chance to showcase horseball as a demonstration sport at this August's World Equestrian Games in Normandy. ""We now have 18 countries playing horseball,"" says Cannas. ""We have already had two World Cups, there is a Champions League, and there are some national championships. ""I believe, in five to 10 years, this will be one of the biggest equestrian sports. People love it. Last month I was at an equine fair in Ohio and they were crazy for horseball, it was basketball on horseback. ""We even have horseball in Australia at the moment,"" he adds, ""but they are on the other side of the world, and sometimes they try to do their own thing."" That makes Copeland chuckle. ""The Australians can be quite ... physical. When they go to international competitions, they find they haven't really read the rules properly."" Horseball's next move is expansion into the United States. The players, however, have bigger dreams. ""They say that if Paris had got the 2012 Olympics, instead of London, horseball would have been looked at as an Olympic event,"" says Gibson. ""I was one of the few who was slightly disappointed when London got the Olympics."" Copeland adds: ""Personally, I think this would make an excellent Olympic sport. ""Whereas the horse world is always very good at attracting its own, horseball attracts people who aren't even interested in horses.""","Horseball mixes rugby and basketball on horseback in teams of six .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Ted Cruz has traded ""Green Eggs and Ham"" for Cicero. The loquacious Texas Republican, with a penchant for memorable speeches, criticized President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration Thursday by adapting an address from the orator Cicero, warning of the demise of the Roman Republic. ""The words of Cicero, powerfully relevant 2077 years later,"" the conservative said on the Senate floor. ""When President Obama do you mean to cease abusing our patience. How long is that madness of yours still to mock us. When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now,"" Cruz intoned. ""What shall we who are the Senate tolerate, President Obama openly desirous to destroy the Constitution and this republic?"" he added. A Cruz spokeswoman explained the events Cicero warned of two millennia ago -- when the aristocrat Cataline, a champion of the poor, was attempting a coup -- apply to the current dispute over whether the President has the right to change immigration laws without the consent of Congress. She said the speech, which ran about four minutes, is ""almost verbatim"" to how Cicero delivered it. ""It is incredible how accurately this narrative applies to today,"" Catherin Frazier said. ""The President once said he could not take such action on immigration because he was not an emperor, yet today he is acting just as such."" ""For we have a resolution of the Senate, a formidable and authoritative decree against you, Mr. President. The wisdom of the republic is not at fault, nor the dignity of this senatorial body,"" Cruz said. ""We alone, I say it openly, we the Senate are waiting in our duty to stop this lawless administration and its unconstitutional amnesty."" The historically themed speech clearly won points for creativity. But it might not have been surprising coming from the Princeton and Harvard trained lawyer. His most memorable words from the floor prior to this were when, during a lengthy filibuster-type speech related to President's health care reform law, he read Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" as bedtime story for his children watching on C-SPAN.","Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, quoted Cicero in the Senate on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Early on Tuesday morning, two Palestinian men from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber entered a synagogue in the sleepy West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof and went on a killing spree. Armed with guns and knives, the two men killed four rabbis -- three Israeli-American and one Israeli-British -- before they were struck down by Israeli police. The attack, which also claimed the life of a police officer, was the deadliest in a series of recent ""lone wolf"" attacks against Israelis across Jerusalem. The Israeli response was swift. The Israeli military ordered the demolition of the perpetrators' homes. Israeli border police blocked access to several East Jerusalem neighborhoods that have been recent flash points for conflict. And Israeli security services conducted raids in several towns in the West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attacks and hammered Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas for inciting the ongoing violence in Jerusalem. Similarly, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the ""senseless brutality,"" and called on Abbas to do the same. Abbas soon stepped up. It was his first condemnation of any attack in Jerusalem since the unrest began last month. Indeed, the aging Palestinian leader is walking a tightrope. On the one hand, lone wolves are by definition not under the control of Abbas nor other Palestinian political organizations. And it is also true that Abbas has not been the driving force of the Jerusalem unrest. But at the same time, he does appear to be making an effort to benefit from the tensions, seemingly seeking to ride this current wave of nationalist fervor. Yet Abbas is also operating from a political place of strength. The West trusts him because he brought an end to the violence of the second intifada, or uprising (2000-2005). The Israelis need him because his forces in the West Bank cooperate with the Israelis on a range of security issues. In many ways, Abbas is responsible for preventing a third intifada in the West Bank -- the territory he controls. However, both Israel and the United States have badly mismanaged the relationship with the Palestinian Authority, doubling down on a system that has failed to invest in Palestinian good governance, let alone new leadership. As a result, neither have much leverage to tone down his rhetoric, short of threatening to oust him from power. Ultimately, though, there is also the question of whether the Palestinian leader actually has the ability to bring stability back to Jerusalem. Even though Palestinians claim the city as their capital, Jerusalem is outside of Abbas' jurisdiction. Moreover, Abbas is now nine years into a four-year term, and his popularity is flagging. The 79-year-old Abbas may be thinking about his legacy after nearly a decade of failed peace talks and internecine squabbles that have divided the Palestinian people, both politically and geographically. The key question is whether Abbas believes he can resuscitate his political fortunes on the Palestinian street by supporting the Jerusalem unrest. If he does, the path to de-escalation is clouded. If Abbas is not the answer, the trick for U.S. and Israeli policymakers is identifying who else to engage. And it is far from clear who that person might be.","Jonathan Schanzer and Grant Rumley: Tuesday latest lone wolf attack .

"(CNN) -- With astronomical Chinese art prices making recent headlines ($36 million for a decorated porcelain cup, anyone?) it's hard not to wonder how one can elbow into the art market for a piece of the pie. For those outside of the Chinese art scene, entering the market can be intimidating. With reports surfacing in recent years on forgery, fraud, and money laundering, the art game seems even harder to play. ""The art market is not very transparent,"" admits Alexandre Errera, founder of online art gallery Artshare.com. But he, and several other experts we spoke to, offer some insight on how to see clearly inside the Chinese art market, with tips on the hottest works to buy right now. Dig deep . ""Chinese art is a jungle,"" says Errera. Navigating the wild terrain requires patience and passion, especially if the buyer is unfamiliar with Chinese history and culture. Start at regional art fairs, such as Art Basel Hong Kong, or SH Contemporary, where a lot of artists can be seen all at once. If you find yourself thinking about a work long after you've seen it, approach the gallery and go deeper. Look at many works from the artist's entire career. ""Some collectors never buy without meeting with the artist,"" says Errera. When it comes to valuating the works, there are plenty of online resources. Websites like artnet.com, artprice.net, and artvalue.com offer information about an artist's auction records and previous owners. It also pays to see who is your competitor. If institutional investors, museums, art funds, or other private collectors are also buying this artist, that's a plus. Calligraphy, photography, but not Mao . When looking for undervalued Chinese art as an investment, start with ink and brush paintings made by artists born after the 1970s. ""Contemporary ink paintings are a good buy. Some are very, very affordable,"" says Sotheby's Asian art expert Mee-seen Loong. ""Also Asians have always valued traditional calligraphy. You can find good works from $10,000 to $1 million."" Errera on the other hand suggests Chinese video art and photography, both offering a small number of good contemporary artists, but with a great potential to grow in value and interest. He also points out that the days of kitsch art with Maoist imagery are over. Contemporary artists, such as Chen Fei, Zhao Zhao, and Li Shurui were born after the Cultural Revolution and do not focus overtly on politics as their predecessors did. ""They are not what you would typically think of as 'Chinese,'"" says Errera. It's a gamble . If you can afford it, entering the market at the higher end will likely bring a larger return on your investment. Errera says it is quite rare not to make a profit on blue chips works that go for more than $1 million, like Zhang Daqian or Qi Baishi. Buying more affordable pieces, around the $10,000 mark, has the potential for the largest return, but it's risky. ""Unless you have inside information, it's like buying a lottery ticket,"" says Errera. At the end of the day, don't be too speculative. ""I would not recommend a client to buy a young artist who suddenly became super famous. It's too high risk. Prices can fall quickly again. Start with a mid-range artist. It's more value proof,"" says art world lawyer Laurens W. Kasteleijn. Auction dos and don'ts . ""The art market is not very transparent. The secondary art market (auctions) is even less so,"" says Errera. Auction first-timers must set a budget and a theme for themselves. After the bidding starts, best sit on your hands when the budgeted price is surpassed. Sotheby's Loong warns against impulse buying, which she calls ""a serious mistake."" For more experienced buyers though, she recommends being ruthless: ""Spend beyond your means, reach as far as you can get, and always go for the better piece. Otherwise you'll regret it."" Protect your interests . ""The art world has by tradition been based on gentlemen's agreements,"" says Kasteleijn, he founded the company Art Law Services. ""But the market has become more international and includes more money today than before, so it's important to protect your interests."" At the very least, request a certificate of authenticity when purchasing a work, and have it signed by the artist. If you are buying from a third party or reseller, it is also a good idea to ask for a proof of purchase from the artist, or gallery representing the artist. Keep all e-mail, receipts and details that can prove a legitimate transaction for when you want to resell the art in the future. Sometimes your gut feeling will also tell you when you're being lured into an unreliable sale. ""For me it's very important that the gallery manager likes art,"" says Kasteleijn. ""If they immediately start talking about art as an investment, it's a big turn-off."" Golden rule . Although everybody interviewed for this article offered different advice, all agreed on this: to make a good art investment you have to enjoy art. ""Do you want the piece of art on your wall? If not, don't buy it,"" says Kasteleijn. ""It doesn't matter if you know much about art or not, you must enjoy it. Otherwise it's like collecting wine without drinking it.""","New to Chinese art? Remember the mantra: Research, research, research .
Blue-chip always pays, so buy high, sell high -- if you can afford it .
Maoist kitsch is so over, be adventurous and look for new media, video, and photography ."
"(CNN) -- When a sinkhole gobbled up a large rental condo at a resort complex in Clermont, Florida, this week, I wasn't particularly surprised. Hundreds of sinkholes form every year in Florida. They really are not that unusual. But it is surprising how little we know about them and how much bad sinkhole policy there is in the state. Sinkholes are natural phenomena that form when limestone dissolves bedrock and the overlying land surface collapses. This is a problem in a state whose population has doubled every 20 years or so in recent decades. For a time, all homes in Florida were required to have sinkhole coverage. But the state legislature passed insurance reforms in 2011. Now, insurance companies must offer sinkhole insurance, but if you are in a high-risk zone, you can easily be turned down for coverage after a rudimentary inspection. When I tried to get sinkhole insurance for my 1961 concrete block ranch home near Tampa, I was told I needed to get an inspection. I paid $50, and someone came and walked around the house and briefly came inside. I was then told by my insurance company that my home was ineligible for sinkhole coverage. The explanation: There were cracks in the 50-year-old plaster. Who doesn't have cracks like that in an old home? In February, a sinkhole opened under a home in Seffner, causing the death of a resident, the only known fatality from a sinkhole collapse in Florida in modern history. This home had passed the same inspection that my home failed. It's not clear why. Sinkholes have affected property values in neighborhoods across Florida: Few want to buy into a neighborhood where there have been sinkholes. Some have lost more than 70% of their investment, and many have walked away from mortgages. Florida has lax building standards when it comes to sinkholes. Home builders are not required to do detailed assessments of property to assess sinkhole risk, and because telltale signs are out of sight, under the earth, unsuspecting homeowners can buy into an area without knowing that they may be heading for trouble. There are also few planning rules for building in sinkhole-prone areas. Local governments are happy to gain the taxes from expansive building booms but are unwilling to limit development in high-risk areas or even require investigations where there is risk. In the face of all this, lawyers have happily stepped into the breach. If you travel across Florida, you will see many billboards advertising legal services to those who are impacted by sinkholes and want what they feel is just compensation. In fact, due to vagaries of law and science, a sinkhole industrial complex has evolved that includes those lawyers, plus geologists and engineers. While the state's Division of Financial Services does provide helpful advice about what to do if you have a sinkhole, homeowners often have to dive into this expensive world to try to understand what to do if they have a sinkhole on their property. Surprisingly, the state has not seriously invested in sinkhole science. Although the Florida Geological Survey does provide some key information, there is no clear coordinated research effort on Florida karst landscapes, the landscapes that foster sinkholes. A well-funded sinkhole research institute at the University of Central Florida was founded after a huge sinkhole opened in Winter Park in 1981, but it was defunded a decade later. The state has not reinvested in comprehensive sinkhole or karst research in any thoughtful or meaningful way since then. Most of the key publications published by the state on sinkholes and other types of karst features in the state date back at least a generation. The state did recently receive a federal grant to study Florida's vulnerability to sinkholes, but there does not seem to be any clear long-term research plan to address the broad problems associated with the region's unique geology. Florida is failing its citizens in sinkhole science and policy. It is time for the state to get serious about trying to understand this vexing problem. It is also time for policy makers to take another look at insurance, building codes and land use rules, and it's time to rebuild a Florida sinkhole research institute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Brinkmann.","Robert Brinkmann: Florida sinkholes all too common, but state's policy on them terrible .
He says recent law makes it easier for insurers to deny homeowners sinkhole coverage .
He says builders aren't required to check for sinkholes, and there are few planning rules .
Brinkmann: State should rethink regulations and land use, revive sinkhole research institute ."
"(CNN) -- Ted Cruz is in for the fight of his political career. I'm not talking his possible run for president in 2016. I mean his fight with two far more formidable opponents: comedy and porn stars. This battle started last week after President Obama called for the FCC to back ""net neutrality"" for the Internet. As Obama said, at its core net neutrality means that Internet providers cannot act as ""a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online."" Cruz responded, via Twitter, that ""net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet."" This is nonsense, of course, but you have to give Cruz points for trying to conflate the unpopular Obamacare -- which, by the way is so loathed that it has exceeded its goal and has signed up 7.3 million people for health insurance -- with net neutrality. Although on the other hand, I'm surprised Cruz didn't claim that net neutrality is something supported by ISIS. You would think that Cruz, as a member of the Senate's Communications, Technology and Internet subcommittee, would offer up a more reasoned objection to net neutrality. Traditionally, the debate over an issue like this would've been conducted in the wonky realm of policy makers and politicians. Unfortunately for Cruz, however, it has entered the world of naughty pop culture. On Friday, ""Funny or Die,"" the comedy website co-created by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, released a video titled ""Porn stars explain net neutrality."" It features adult film stars Alex Chance, Mercedes Carrera and Nadia Styles discussing the issue in a funny, accessible and provocative way. Did I mention that they're naked? They explain that ending net neutrality would mean not only slowed down social media, it also would result in, ""slower porn."" Says Styles: ""Ted Cruz doesn't want me to get naked for you."" Mercedes Carrera then adds a kernel of info that is both poignant on a personal level, and significant politically: ""Unfortunately, Sen. Cruz -- who is not sexy! -- has taken countless donations from telecom giant Comcast and wants to end net neutrality."" That video, my friends, is political satire at its best. It uses humor to entertain as well as explain the issue. Now some might dismiss the FOD video as ""just comedy."" Really? This video, per the execs at FOD, was viewed by over 1.4 million people as of Monday. This video has clearly reached audience far beyond those who tune in to watch Sunday morning political talk shows or who religiously read political websites. And for that reason, I'd say Cruz is going to lose this battle. There's a lesson here, not just for Cruz, but for all candidates thinking of running for president in 2016 (and there are a lot of you.) You should use nontraditional methods, like comedy, to reach voters. This is more important than ever. Why? Well, have you ever seen more people turned off to politics than there are today? Just look at the lousy turnout for midterm elections two weeks ago: just 36%. That was the lowest number since 1942, and back then the country was in the middle of a World War! And if you doubt that comedic videos can have an effect on your chances, then look no further than the President's March appearance on the FOD online show, ""Between Two Ferns"" hosted by Zach Galifianakis, where Obama urged people to sign up for Obamacare. That six-minute video, which has been viewed over 27 million times, caused traffic to increase to healthcare.gov by 40% within 24 hours of its release, and caused a spike in people signing up for Obamacare. Yes, I know some political pundits will tell you that these types of comedy videos only reach young people and younger people tend not to vote. These people are wrong for two reasons. First, younger voters in the 2008 and 2012 elections comprised close to 19% of the electorate; that's a sizeable voting bloc. In fact, if Mitt Romney had just split the 18- to 29-year-old voters in 2012, as opposed to losing them by 37% to Obama, he would've won the presidency. Second, political comedy -- even FOD videos -- aren't just consumed by people under 30. Want to guess the median age of ""The Daily Show"" audience? 21? 30? Nope, it's 41 years old. And the median age of Stephen Colbert's audience is 42. But here's a little tip to political people thinking of using online videos: Have professionals help you. For example, Cruz released a video Monday night to counter Sen. Al Franken's recent charge on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Cruz doesn't understand net neutrality. The problem with this video, however, is that it's nothing more than a badly lit Cruz speaking directly to the camera. Cruz, to his credit, did use props (an old telephone), but besides that the most interesting aspect of the video was the bizarre robot image on the wall behind him and the person standing off to Cruz's left unintentionally photobombing him. The best chance Cruz has of this video reaching beyond his base is if it inspires comedic memes mocking it. Obviously, most of those running for president in 2016 will avoid comedy for fear it will backfire. But any candidate who employs comedy effectively stands to reach millions of people who would never tune in to hear a politician's speech. And those people could very well be the difference in a close election.","Dean Obeidallah: Video with porn stars mocks Ted Cruz's position on net neutrality .
It makes point that Cruz got donations from Comcast. It opposes Obama regulation plan .
He says pols should use comedy to reach voters. Obama did with ""Between Two Ferns""

"(CNN) -- When freelance journalist Steven Sotloff disappeared during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2013, his family kept the news a secret. Families of hostages are frequently advised to do this by security firms. The abduction of Sotloff, who was beheaded Tuesday -- according to a video released by the terror group, ISIS -- has been international news since Sotloff was seen at the end of another video published last month by the Islamic extremist group. After journalist James Foley was shown with his head cut off, the video's narrator indicated that Sotloff would be killed if President Barack Obama did not cease U.S. airstrikes against ISIS. ""I've known Steve was missing for the past year -- the problem is, he was a low-profile freelance journalist -- his family didn't want anyone in the media talking about Steve because they were afraid of retaliation,"" said Emerson Lotzia, who lived with Sotloff in college. ""If any old friends asked me about Steve over the past year, I'd just say I hadn't seen him in a long time."" Sotloff's mother last week issued an emotional plea for her son's release. She directed her message to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Lotzia said he has been in touch with Sotloff's father, Art, and before Tuesday's news of Sotloff's killing, last month's video ""was the first time his dad and family have heard anything about Steve since last December."" Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies tried to gain Sotloff's release for the past year. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, who represents the district where the family lives, said that she had met with the family in Miami and spoken with them by phone. ""My office has contacted the relevant agencies, departments and even organizations with connections on the ground in Syria to try to get answers for the Sotloff family,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. ""This is a tragic situation and we have seen that [ISIS] has no respect for human life."" Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He attended high school at a New England boarding school, Kimball Union in New Hampshire. The school described him in a statement as ""an active and involved student whose interest in journalism was evident early on."" Not only was Sotloff credited with revitalizing the student newspaper, he participated in myriad extracurricular activities, including student council, varsity football and rugby. He also appeared in the musical, ""Cabaret,"" the school said. After graduation, he kept in touch with school faculty and sent e-mails detailing the events to which he bore witness. ""It was important to him that Kimball Union students were exposed to world issues like the Arab Spring. Steven wrote that Kimball Union had prepared him to see the world through different lenses and to commit to using what he learned to help others,"" the school statement said. After high school, he majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians such as the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami."" Lotzia met Sotloff when they were both starting college in 2002. He described Sotloff as ""someone you want in your circle of friends -- just a good, good guy."" He reminisced about ""epic video game battles at our apartment"" -- usually NCAA football or other sports games. In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area. ""I think he was at a crossroads of life,"" Lotzia said. ""He talked about wanting to go over to the Middle East."" He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Syria, among other countries. ""He's an incredible writer,"" said Tim Smith, another college friend who kept in touch with him via Facebook over the years. ""I know reporting on an international level is what he always wanted to do."" Ashley Burns, who edited some of Sotloff's work for their college newspaper, said that out of all the people he met through the newspaper, he wished he had followed Sotloff's work more in recent years. ""He writes with incredible passion, about Benghazi and his experiences in Syria and Turkey, while showing an incredible relationship with -- and understanding of -- the people that he met in the countries that he has worked in,"" Burns said. ""He has seen things I'll never see, and his courage is incredible."" Karisa Workman, who taught Sotloff in a UCF oral communication class a decade ago, said she remembered him well. ""He was genuinely interested in his classmates' speeches,"" she said. ""In fact, he often asked follow-up questions to the student speeches. In retrospect, he was a journalist even in the classroom."" Another college friend, Danielle Montoya, said she remembered him as a quiet guy who was loyal to his friends. ""I remember Emerson had a show on the UCF radio station focused on sports talk, and not a lot of people would call in when they were getting the show started up,"" she said. ""Steve would call in to support him and ask questions so the show was at least a little entertaining to listen to."" Montoya said she thought Sotloff's effort ""says something about his character to support his buddy's ambition."" Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors .

"(CNN) -- We've just landed a washing machine-sized robot on a comet and NASA's chief scientist has no idea. Dr Ellen Stofan is deep in conversation with a journalist when, unable to contain himself any longer, an adviser with phone triumphantly held aloft blurts out: ""Rosetta -- It's landed!"" ""Wonderful"" Stofan beams, and the handful of reporters gathered in a lecture theater at University College London excitedly fidget in their seats. Barely has the probe touched down on a comet 310 million miles from Earth, then one of science's great minds is discussing humanity's next cosmic milestone. Stofan wants to land a man on Mars by the mid-2030s. Or rather, ""land a human on Mars,"" the mother-of-three corrects me with a wry smile. ""In a sense it's our destiny to move beyond this planet and Mars is the logical choice,"" said the 53-year-old geologist. ""It's a place where humans could live and work -- not out in the open -- but with not too-radical modifications."" Indeed, life on the 'Red Planet' may not just be the stuff of science fiction. ""Mars is the other body in the solar system that we're very likely to find that life evolved,"" said Stofan. ""So being able to have a laboratory on Mars, being able to have some sort of sustained human presence on Mars in the future, I think is critically important for science."" Next stop: Mars . Surviving an eight-month journey to Mars is one thing -- staying alive once there is another. Astronauts would face high levels of radiation -- ""we still have to figure out how to adequately protect them,"" said Stofan. The thin atmosphere would also make landing difficult, particularly for a heavy spaceship loaded with equipment and people. ""If you think of the Apollo capsule coming into Earth with a parachute, the Mars atmosphere is just so thin you've got to find some way of slowing yourself down really rapidly,"" explained Stofan, the daughter of a NASA engineer who watched her first rocket launch as a four-year-old. At the time, the un-manned launch spectacularly exploded, leaving a huge impression on the little girl who decades later has set her sights on a mission to Mars. The interplanetary endeavor has more to do with unlocking Earth's secrets than you might think. ""Being able to compare the Earth to Venus, to Mars, and studying these same processes all around the solar system -- all of a sudden you get smarter about your own planet,"" explained Stofan. ""If you're a doctor and you only have one patient, then you'd never really understand the progression of disease. You need lots of patients, and scientists learn more about the Earth by studying lots of planets."" Star Wars reality . But with so many earthly problems, does it pay to point billion dollar budgets at the skies? ""You know, we're really spending that money here on Earth,"" said Stofan. ""We get amazing technology spinoffs from the work NASA has done,"" she adds, listing everything from fuel efficient winglets on airplanes, to air traffic control systems, and equipment for measuring climate change. Science fiction becomes reality in NASA's lab, with the hovering orb seen in Star Wars -- fans will remember Luke Skywalker using it during light-saber training -- inspiring real-life gadgets on board the International Space Station. ""Think about these things you used to see on TV from science fiction, like communicators on Star Trek, well now we actually have them,"" said Stofan. ""Space exploration pushes us to say 'here's things we've just dreamed about, but we can turn that into reality.'"" Marvin the Martian . Does that mean she also believes in intelligent life? ""I think there has to be in the universe -- how easy it's going to be to find, is another question,"" said Stofan. ""Statistically every time you're looking at a star you're likely to be looking at a planetary system. Play the math game, there's billions of stars, so eventually you'll come out saying there has to be another body where life could have evolved to a fairly sophisticated level. ""Now, do I think they're visiting here and altering people's crop patterns? No. If they were smart enough to get here, we would know about it."" Women's business? As a women working at NASA, sometimes it's Stofan who feels like the alien in the room, admitting: ""I had to work four times as hard to be taken half as seriously."" ""I still go into most meetings and I will look around the room and I just suddenly register the male to female ratio -- women usually make up 10% to 20% in any room I'm in, at best."" It's a ratio fairly consistent with women working across STEM sectors (science, technology, engineering, math) in the U.S., and Stofan speaks passionately about the need for ""all hands on deck."" ""When you have problems like trying to get humans down onto the surface of Mars, if you don't have all the best minds in the world -- not just white men -- then you're not utilizing humanity the way you should."" Landing a human on Mars would inspire a new generation of scientists -- the likes of which we haven't seen since the Apollo mission 45 years ago, says Stofan. ""It's a great international human endeavor, with all the nations of the world moving out beyond Earth to explore a new planet, a new world. ""And doing it together.""

"New York (CNN) -- On a beautiful fall day in Yonkers, New York, just north of New York City, Mary J. Blige stepped onto the sidewalk on South Broadway. ""I love you!"" yelled one of the women in the crowd. Blige waved. ""Hi. How are you doing?"" For the people in the neighborhood, one of their own had come back. And she wasn't just anyone, she was MJB -- a real celebrity standing right there on South Broadway. Cellular phones and digital cameras were raised in the air to capture images of Blige in all of her blonde pixie-haired grace. The appearance wasn't for a singing engagement or a CD signing. This was a dream being fulfilled, a symbol of her own struggles as a child and a young woman. It was the official ribbon-cutting for the Mary J. Blige Center for Women. The building has no sign yet, but its pastel-painted rooms will soon become a haven for women and young girls, offering them different programs for education, life skills, self-empowerment and much more if Blige has her way. FFAWN (Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now), which was founded by Blige and Steve Stoute, partnered with design house Gucci and Westchester Jewish Community Services to bring Blige's center to fruition. After local officials spoke, Blige stepped up. ""When I was 5 years old there was a lot that happened to me ... that I carry ... all my life."" Her voice filled with emotion. People in the crowd started to yell in support. ""Don't cry!"" ""It's OK, Mary!"" ""We love you!"" Blige removed her sunglasses to wipe away her tears. ""And when ... I was growing up after that, I saw so many women beaten to death, almost to their death, by men."" CNN spoke with Blige at the center. She talked about her personal struggles as a young woman, how her spirit helped her rise above thoughts of suicide and her plans to help women now. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: I feel like you can really help young women. Do you feel that way? Mary J. Blige: I always felt that I wanted to help women, period. As a child I [saw] women really, really suffer terrible, terrible situations, and I vowed as a child to want to do something -- anything -- that can help them have better self-esteem so that they don't have to be subjected to men that wanted to kill them. In my music, that's what I've been doing in my career, and now through FFAWN I'm doing that. CNN: Today was touching, especially seeing you break down and talk about your life. Was it difficult to go to that place? Blige: Well, today was very, very heavy. It was happy and sad because you know the very place where I've seen so many women suffer is the sad part, and the very place that I suffered is the sad part. But the happy part is I'm back to help. I'm back doing what I dreamed to do. My dream is coming true. CNN: Will all age ranges be able to come here and seek guidance? Blige: All age ranges will be able to come to this center. Women from all walks of life, not just women from poverty-stricken areas. ... Whatever it is, they'll be able to come here. There are gonna be psychologists here, doctors here, day care centers here. Anything that you need or they need to be able to better themselves is here for them. CNN: What got you through when you were young? Blige: I guess what got me through when I was young was something I guess a lot of people don't have and that was just the will. ... I don't know what was driving me. I guess it was something in me did want to die -- you know, I guess my spirit didn't want to die, but my physical body definitely was at some point was like I gotta get out of here. ... My physical body was contemplating suicide and all this other crazy stuff, and my spirit is what saved me, I believe. CNN: Do you think there are enough resources out there for women? Blige: I think there's definitely enough resources, but ... a lot of women are ashamed to come forth. What I believe I've done for women is show them, look, I'm Mary J. Blige and I'm telling you you don't have to be ashamed. ... That's why I think as celebrities we're given this job. We're not given this job to just hold onto this stuff and die with it. We're given this job to be able to touch someone and say, ""me, too,"" because they look up to us and look to us for help and guidance and want to be able to relate to us. CNN: When you reached adulthood what set you free? Blige: The truth was ... I had to admit that I needed help and I needed help in self-love and finding myself. And I had to admit that although I was ashamed that I didn't know who I was. ... CNN: Will you be up here and have time in your schedule to come to the center? Blige: I will definitely be up here. I mean before this building had this much in it I was here with the girls. ... I would come and talk to them, I'd give them things, I sent them clothes. I'd get their letters, I'd send them letters back. I'm definitely gonna be here. CNN: Have you had a sigh of relief that it has all come to fruition? Blige: I am so happy today is the day, ya know?

"(CNN) -- The lawyer for comedian Bill Cosby, in response to over a dozen allegations of sexual assault by different women over many years, made this statement on November 16: . ""Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced. The fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment. He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work. There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives."" This terse press release tries to convince us that an accusation of rape cannot be true if it is 1) old news 2) already disbelieved by at least one person and 3) made against a man almost 80 years old. We don't know what Bill Cosby did or did not do, but these allegations should not be easily dismissed. Over a dozen women have come forward alleging remarkably similar patterns of abuse. While alone with Cosby, they say they were drugged and assaulted, then silenced afterward by Cosby handlers. One of the victims is Barbara Bowman, a 46-year-old married mother of two, who said Cosby repeatedly raped her when she was a teenager and aspiring actress under his tutelage. Bowman has no financial incentive to speak out; she never asked for or received money from Cosby, and the statue of limitations in her case has long passed. It takes a surprisingly long time for victims' denial to crack. I know this firsthand. Five years passed before I spoke about my own abuse, and another 10 before I wrote about it. Some victims can't admit for years -- even to ourselves -- that we were raped. Denial, shame and self-doubt are all typical psychological byproducts of being abused by someone you trust. No one wants to be a victim of sexual abuse. It's hard to admit it and it's natural to think that denying a traumatic, demeaning, embarrassing assault gives you control over the damage. Victims sometimes need decades to come forward about what is perhaps the most traumatic physical and psychological betrayal that one can experience. It is harrowing to speak out about rape and other acts of abuse perpetuated by someone you know. You feel complicit; someone you trusted caused you terrific physical pain and humiliation. This is not like describing how you lost your wallet or broke your leg skiing. Immense courage is required to report the crime, and to allow others to intentionally or unintentionally make you relive painful experiences you'd give anything to forget. The trauma compounds when your rapist is famous. Everybody grills you about meaningless, salacious, intrusive details. Many people do not want to believe you. It is excruciating to hear about rape and assault. Most listeners therefore want to disbelieve victims. So it's not surprising that these allegations about Cosby have been discredited before. Lawyers, police officers and prosecutors had powerful psychological and financial motives not to believe victims who reported Cosby's attacks. For these reasons, acquaintance rape and all other forms of intimate violence are vastly under-reported, under-prosecuted crimes. Victims need and deserve extra time, and extra respect, when they summon the courage to expose their assaults. The stigma of being a rape victim is starting to erode little by little. People who were never raped are beginning to internalize that it's normal to delay reporting rape, it's normal to have great difficulty confronting an abuser, particularly a powerful celebrity, and it's normal for a victim to feel shame, reticence and confusion. Rape and relationship violence experts know that one of the most important factors in recovering from assault is that the first person you tell believes you. Even if decades-old allegations are surfacing, we need to take them as seriously as if the assaults occurred yesterday. Let's hope that the media, corporate leaders and our criminal justice system begin to offer compassion and dignity to women (and men) coming forward with allegations of violence and sexual assault. Let's try to find ways to end rape on college campuses, in the military, in the NFL, in our religious institutions, in our homes and elsewhere.","Leslie Steiner: Bill Cosby's lawyer tries to dismiss allegations against Cosby .

"(CNN) -- While following their favorite soccer teams in preparation for the 2014 World Cup, fans in Brazil may have glimpsed one of the largest public health campaigns ever organized by the country's Ministry of Health. ""Dengue Mata"" or ""Dengue Kills"" is the key message being pushed in print materials and TV commercials. Brazilian health officials hope the campaign will encourage local citizens to clean up areas around their homes to reduce mosquito breeding grounds, and that doing so will reduce the risk of the mosquito-transmitted virus that causes dengue fever. The 2014 World Cup host country has reported the most cases of dengue in South America over the past 30 years, including four deaths attributable to the disease in January and February. Because there is no vaccine or specific treatment, prevention is paramount. 'Indescribable, crazy pain': Surviving dengue fever . Risks for U.S. travelers . ""It's difficult for anyone to put any number on the level of risk,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Tyler Sharp, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's dengue branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico. ""The important thing to remember is that all regions of Brazil every day, every week and every year have transmission (of dengue)."" Most dengue virus infections occur in and around homes, Sharp said, so tourists in air-conditioned hotels have a relatively low risk of infection. Travelers staying with friends and relatives in their homes are at a higher risk. Could the virus make it back to U.S. soil? Sharp said it would be a rare event, but the virus could be spread from an infected traveler to any state with a mosquito presence. Dengue fever is not unheard of in the United States. In 2013, 137 cases were reported in Florida. Of those cases, 114 involved a person who had traveled to a dengue endemic country (including Brazil) in the two weeks before onset, according to the Florida Department of Health. U.S. hospitalizations for dengue fever tripled in seven years . Dengue symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting and swollen glands. It is potentially fatal because of fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding or organ impairment. Individuals with diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease or asthma have a higher risk of developing a more severe illness if infected. People who are older or have had previous exposure to one of the four dengue viruses are also more at risk. For protection, the CDC recommends using a bug repellent at dawn and dusk that includes either DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 as the active ingredient. Sunscreen should be applied first and insect-repellent second. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants and sleeping in screened or air-conditioned rooms are other strategies for avoiding infection. Dengue at the World Cup . An analysis published in Lancet Infectious Diseases in May looked at the climate forecast for dengue fever during the 2014 World Cup. Researchers analyzed past behavior of the virus to determine high-risk areas, which include the cities of Recife, Fortaleza and Natal, where many countries, including the United States, have matches. Even though three of the tournament cities pose a higher risk, according to the Brazilian Federal Government, the World Cup falls during a time of year that typically sees a 74% reduction in dengue fever cases across the country. ""The one thing in our favor is that it is winter in Brazil,"" Sharp said. The risk of infection and outbreak are based on several factors, including the number of mosquitoes (based on climate and presence of standing water needed for breeding) and a susceptible population. The Pan American Health Organization says inadequate sewage disposal and water supply issues in residential areas are part of the reason Brazil has a heightened dengue risk. Unplanned city growth in the country is also increasing the spread of the disease. Thousands hit by Brazil outbreak of dengue . Brazil travelers should also protect themselves against hepatitis A and B, yellow fever, typhoid, meningitis, malaria, rabies and diarrhea, the CDC says. 5 ways to stay healthy while traveling abroad .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin says he still doesn't see eye to eye with the United States on Syria. But ""all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria ... and to solve this situation peacefully,"" Putin said Monday after a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the Group of Eight Summit in Northern Ireland. Putin said he and Obama ""agreed to push the parties to the negotiating table."" But the Russian president didn't specify who could be involved in Syria talks, when they would take place or what their end goal would be. The G8 summit comes days after the United States pledged to play a greater role in assisting Syrian rebels, citing evidence that President Bashar al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons against the rebels and his own people. The move was backed by seven of the eight nations represented at this week's conference in Loch Erne, while Russia remains the sole G8 nation supporting al-Assad. And global leaders at the conference are poised to pressure Putin over his support for Syria's government. On Monday, Obama stressed the importance of making sure chemical weapons ""are neither used nor subject to proliferation"" in Syria -- a topic that Putin didn't mention in his public remarks after meeting with the U.S. president. Russia has downplayed the claims of chemical weapons use, and Putin has opposed outside intervention into the county's 2-year-old internal conflict. On Sunday, Putin sharply criticized the decision to provide arms to Syrian rebels, referencing a widely circulated video of an opposition fighter appearing to eat the heart of a dead solider. Speaking to reporters in London after meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Putin warned against arming Syrian rebels ""who kill their enemies and eat their organs."" ""Do you want to support these people? Do you want to supply arms to these people?"" Putin asked. Putin warns against arming organ-eating Syrian rebels . Opinion: A new breed of terror in Northern Ireland . The White House announcement last week that it was increasing the ""size and scope"" of its material support to Syrian rebels came after months of political debate over the U.S. role in the conflict. Great Britain and France, two other G8 members, were strong backers of the May decision to end the European Union arms embargo on Syria, and both countries asserted that al-Assad's regime had used chemical weapons before the United States did. The meeting between Obama and Putin Monday was the first time the two leaders have spoken face to face since last year's G-20 summit in Mexico. ""It's in Russia's interest to join us in applying pressure on Bashar al-Assad to come to the table in a way that relinquishes his power and his standing in Syria, because we don't see any scenario where he restores his legitimacy to lead the country,"" Obama's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes noted before Monday's meeting. Other G8 nations have expressed similar viewpoints, calling on Russia to back United Nations intervention in Syria. Russia's permanent position on the United Nations Security Council has made action through that body difficult for countries intent on removing al-Assad from power. After meeting with Putin on Monday, Obama said the possibility of negotiations remains on the table. ""We want to try to resolve the issue through political means, if possible,"" Obama said. Before this week's meetings, the U.S. president spoke by videoconference with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany to discuss ""ways to support a political transition to end the conflict"" in Syria, the White House said. The White House has not yet publicly specified what exact steps it would take to support members of Syria's opposition, though sources have told CNN small arms, ammunition and possibly anti-tank weapons would be part of the assistance package. On Friday, Rhodes said further discussions with other nations were necessary to determine next steps. Though Syria will likely dominate discussions behind the scenes at this week's summit, leaders began the conference Monday by heralding a possible trade deal they said could create millions of jobs. The first round of negotiations for a trans-Atlantic trade agreement between the United States and the European Union will take place next month in Washington, Obama said. ""I believe that we can form an economic alliance as strong as our diplomatic and security alliances,"" he told reporters after the leaders of eight of the world's most powerful nations kicked off their meeting. ""The whole point of this meeting ... is to fire up our economies and drive growth and prosperity around the world. ... There's no better way than by launching these negotiations on a landmark deal between the European Union and the United states of America,"" Cameron said. Cameron, the host of this week's conference, named the problem of tax avoidance by large corporations as a central issue for G8 leaders to resolve at this year's summit. The British prime minister hopes to secure agreements among nations on sharing tax information, with the goal of ensuring global companies aren't able to dodge tax bills. The measure met resistance from firms' chief executives, though Cameron said he's willing to withstand corporate ire for a fairer global tax system. ""You don't get anywhere unless you are prepared to give the lead and perhaps make a few enemies along the way,"" Cameron said. ""In setting the G8 agenda around trade, tax and transparency, yes, you are taking on some vested interests, you are taking on some difficult decisions. But actually will it help both the developing world and us in the West? I believe it can."" While in Europe, Obama will also likely be forced to defend U.S. Internet surveillance techniques that were disclosed in a series of newspaper articles in early June. The intelligence programs, which were previously considered top secret, involved large tech companies who operate globally, including Facebook, Google and Yahoo.

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Mike McQueary, who testified that he saw Jerry Sandusky in a shower with an underage boy, filed a whistleblower lawsuit Tuesday against the university, according to a court document from Centre County, Pennsylvania. McQueary was a key prosecution witness and was the only individual -- excluding the victims themselves -- who said he witnessed an apparent sexual encounter between Sandusky and a boy. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, was convicted in June for abusing young boys over a 15-year-period. In support of McQueary's whistleblower claim, the lawsuit states he was the only assistant football coach who was not invited to interview for employment with the incoming new head football coach after longtime coach Joe Paterno was fired amid the Sandusky scandal. Victim 1 sues Penn State over Sandusky abuse . McQueary also claims he was the only former employee who was not reimbursed for legal fees, and that he did not receive his severance payments on time. The lawsuit states McQueary believes those situations and his employment termination were the result of his cooperation with authorities in the Sandusky case. Read details of the lawsuit (PDF) According to the lawsuit, after testifying in court, McQueary was placed on administrative leave with pay in November 2011, only to later be terminated in July 2012.

"Culpeper, Virginia (CNN) -- When the Library of Congress comes to mind, most of us don't think of movies, TV shows or old-school vinyl. But the federal library has been collecting analog recordings of sound and moving images since the late 1800s: Early film reels from inventor Thomas Edison's lab of the 1890s. Audio recordings of Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The original 35mm film stock of ""Star Wars."" These national treasures are among the millions of cultural artifacts being stored in secure vaults in the Library of Congress' National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, some 90 minutes southwest of Washington. The center occupies the Packard Campus, a former bunker for storing federal currency, and measures an amazing 415,000 square feet. Its artifacts are housed in dozens of temperature-controlled vaults and on 90 miles of storage shelves. With more than 5 million items, it's an impressive collection. There's just one problem: Despite the best efforts of preservationists, some of them are physically decaying and in danger of being lost forever. ""Any physical artifact is just that, a physical artifact,"" said Mike Mashon, head of the Library of Congress' moving image section. ""These things can shrink, they can fade, they can crumble to dust in less than a lifetime."" Going digital . The solution, said Mashon, is to convert these artifacts to digital files. It's an exhaustive job. Between 1.5 million film, television and video items, and another 3.5 million sound recordings, the 114 staff members here have their work cut out for them. Collecting and cataloging over 120 years of recorded American history may seem to be a daunting task. But the preservation of these deteriorating items is currently one of the most pressing missions for the library. Years ago, when analog began to degrade, staffers would make a new copy. But that process has its limitations. ""Think about back when you were making your mix tapes,"" said Gene Deanna, head of the library's recorded sound section. ""Every time you made a copy of that tape, it didn't sound as good."" Digital technology, he said, is now the best way to preserve the past. ""The great thing about digital is that it can be migrated (to copies) without loss."" Going digital doesn't solve the problem entirely if the data isn't stored properly. When the compact disc was released to consumers in the early 1980's, many people felt the new format could last forever. Leave a CD on a car's dashboard on a hot summer day, however, and its weakness is revealed. But digital files have the advantage of flexibility, because they can be converted easily into pretty much any other available digital format. Because of advancements in technology, these artifacts in the library's massive vaults will now have a chance to live forever. ""Our work in the future is going to be migrating the files and transcoding them to make sure that they're always going to be available to be played back on whatever the next generation software is,"" Deanna said. Preserving history . Every year, music and movies from all genres in the Library of Congress collection make their way into the digital archives of the National Recording Registry and the National Film Registry to be preserved as national treasures. ""We have this entire campus ... for the preservation of the audio-visual heritage of the United States,"" said Gregory Lukow, chief of the library's Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound division. ""We're still acquiring very large-scale collections,"" he added. ""It forces us to think very deeply about how we prioritize what we choose to put through this incredible technological machinery. That's a big challenge, and it means that we'll be at it for decades because we have more than we're capable of putting through the production pipelines at this time."" Film stock, especially cellulose nitrate film from the early 20th century, sometimes decays faster than the library's staff can preserve it. ""There are inevitably going to be films that we just can't get to,"" Mashon said. ""We try to inspect the film as regularly as we can. If it's seen to be deteriorating rapidly, we want to get it up into the laboratory, but sometimes it's just going to be too late. It's a cultural loss."" But thanks to new international standards for audio formats -- a 97-kilohertz, 24-bit, broadcast wave file -- audio snippets catalogued here will be playable around the world. Mashon said the next step in the process is to make many of these audio items available to the public via the Internet. More than 10,000 historical recordings are already available to listeners on the Library of Congress' National Jukebox page. Librarians feel a duty to preserve as many audio and visual artifacts -- more than a century of American life -- as possible. ""There is so much to learn from the past from a historical sense,"" said Deanna. ""What people sounded like, what our leaders actually said in their speeches, what the radio broadcast of the day actually consisted of. And without that actual recording, you only have someone else's interpretation of it. ""It's absolutely critical that we don't let this legacy fall from the soundscape, fall from our memories.""","The Library of Congress stores historic audio and video recordings in secure vaults .

"(CNN) -- The first official trailer for 2015's ""Peanuts"" movie has been released, and good grief -- it's actually pretty cute. Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox rolled out the two-minute clip on Tuesday, giving another look at what Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and the rest look like in CGI. The companies released a teaser trailer in March. The new trailer was supposed to be unveiled on Thanksgiving Day but leaked online early -- and it seems Snoopy is to blame. While the characters are rendered in a new way, some things never change: The familiar theme song is still intact, Snoopy still has a highflying imagination, and poor Charlie Brown is still the butt of everyone's jokes. The ""Peanuts"" comic was introduced by artist Charles Schulz in 1950, and keeping the spirit of his work intact is paramount for the crew behind the ""Peanuts"" movie. ""Our No. 1 goal was always to be authentic to (Schulz's) work and legacy,"" Schulz's son Craig told USA Today in March. ""I'm way more protective than my father would have been. The fans have been asking for a long time, but we held off until the time was right.""

"(CNN) -- The trailer for 2015's ""Cinderella"" doesn't feature any singing mice, but it's magical all the same. Disney has released its first look at next year's live-action re-telling of ""Cinderella,"" which stars Lily James, of ""Downton Abbey,"" as the unfairly treated princess-to-be. This version keeps all the memorable moments of Cinderella's story intact -- she's still left at the mercy of a vindictive stepmother, and still has to bail from that royal ball by the stroke of midnight -- but it also fills in some of the gaps in our understanding of how Cinderella came to be. Instead of picking up with Cinderella already slaving away, we get to meet her parents, as played by Hayley Atwell and Ben Chaplin, and we learn that the moniker ""Cinderella"" is a cruel twist on her name, Ella. This time around, Cinderella meets her Prince Charming (Richard Madden) in the woods before encountering him again at his royal soiree. And while her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham-Carter) still drums up a pair of glass slippers faster than you can say ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" we're now assured that the shoes are far more comfortable than they look. The new ""Cinderella"" arrives close to the 65th anniversary of Walt Disney's classic animated version. That ""Cinderella"" first opened in the United States on February 15, 1950, after spending six years in development. The result proved so popular that Disney offered occasional re-releases of the film, not to mention that the fairy tale has spawned a near sub-genre of Cinderella-inspired movies. (Hilary Duff's ""A Cinderella Story,"" anyone?) The latest ""Cinderella"" will arrive in theaters on March 13, 2015.","Disney's new live-action ""Cinderella"" has been unveiled .

"(CNN) -- Back when Facebook only had millions of users instead of a billion, before Timeline and the bungled IPO and outrage over privacy issues, people ""poked"" each other on the social network. The poke, which is still around but rarely used, is a minimalistic form of communication -- the digital equivalent of a head nod or wink. Now the social network has expanded the poke into a standalone iOS app, which was released on Friday. The simple free app, called Facebook Poke, allows you to send fleeting messages, pokes, photos and 10-second videos to Facebook friends. The messages expire after a set period of time, from 1 to 10 seconds, and cannot be retrieved by either party again. This makes the app perfect for sending salacious images without leaving a trail. ""With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you're up to in a lightweight way,"" says Facebook in a blog post announcing the new app. When you open the app, you can choose from a set of icons at the bottom of the screen to send a poke, type a 120-character message, open the camera to snap a picture (you cannot choose an existing photo from your camera roll, but you can add fun doodles or text on top of the picture you do take), or shoot a 10-second video. Decide how long you want the other person to see your message or photo (1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds), add a location if you like, then choose one or more of your Facebook friends from the list and hit send. To view a message, tap and hold until the little countdown clock in the corner runs down, and the message is gone forever. You can see a list of who send you messages, but not view them again. The app Poke shamelessly imitates is Snapchat, a photo and video-sharing service that has surged in popularity over the past year year. It's no mystery why Facebook is jumping on the temporary message bandwagon. Snapchat says it has millions of users who send around 50 million messages a day. It is also popular with the highly valuable younger age group, though it doesn't currently have ads or any other way of making money off of its service. The Facebook Poke app is also ad-free for the time being. The allure of self-destructing messages is that they are unlikely to be seen by anyone other than the recipient, or to resurface during a campaign for public office. Snapchat has earned a reputation as a tool for sending risquÃ© photos, though its also handy for funny or silly images for friends. Because of the private nature of these messages, the apps have built-in safeguards. The only way to keep a copy of a photo on these apps is to take a screenshot with your phone. Both Poke and Snapchat warn the sender when the recipient has grabbed a screenshot of their message. Facebook seems keenly aware of how the Poke app will be used by most people. ""If you ever see something you're uncomfortable with, you can click the gear menu and report it,"" says the company in the post. In the app's help center there are instructions for what to do when someone takes a screenshot against your will. That section helpfully links to a post on what to do when an adult is making you uncomfortable, and another on what to do when someone requests nude photos. The app is Facebook's fifth iOS app, joining the main Facebook app, Facebook Messenger and Facebook Camera.","Facebook has released a new, free app for iOS called Facebook Poke .

"(CNN) -- ""Gigantic, alien-looking buildings"" that bring to mind melted guitars, mushroom-like parasols and UFOs.

As well as standing out from other buildings in their vicinity, blob buildings often conjure imaginative responses from the public, not always complimentary. While the Selfridges Building, a shopping center in Birmingham, England, is known as the Beehive due to its honeycomb-like façade, the London City Hall was once described as a ""glass testicle.""

"(CNN) -- Former presidential candidate Ralph Nader had some biting words about Rand Paul, saying the self-described ""libertarian-ish"" lawmaker is retreating from his roots as he broadens his appeal for a potential presidential bid. ""What he ought to do is go back to his father, sit on his knee and become more like Ron Paul,"" Nader said in a new video published Monday. Nader, a liberal consumer advocate who espouses left-libertarian views, ran for president as the Green Party nominee in 2000 and as an independent candidate in 2004 and 2008 and as a write-in candidate in 1992 and 1996. Nader's comments came in an interview Saturday in New York with Luke Rudkowski, an activist who's known for confronting high-profile political figures and whose goal is to ""expose corruption worldwide,"" according to his website. The senator's office had no comment on Nader's remarks. Nader told Rudkowski he shares Paul's views ""against militarism"" and ""against a bloated military budget"" but argued the Kentucky Republican is ""changing by the month."" ""He's beginning to change,"" he continued. ""You can see him in just one year. He's not going to go on the floor and filibustering again, the way he did courageously. That's what blind ambition does."" Nader argued that Paul wants to give more aid to Israel, a reference to the first-term senator's policy on foreign aid that came under question this year. Paul, however, maintains that he hasn't changed his position on aid to Israel and would still like to see an eventual end of U.S. assistance to the country. Rand Paul: U.S. aid to Israel OK -- for now . Nader has been pushing the idea of a left-right alliance and earlier this year said he could envision Paul as a possible leader of the movement, but still expressed skepticism of what he called his ""evolving"" views. As Paul broadens his appeal among Republicans and even Democrats, he has attracted closer scrutiny of his views and issues on which he agrees or disagrees with his father, a former congressman and presidential candidate who ran as a Libertarian in 1988 and as a Republican in 2008 and 2012. While Rand Paul has long sought to distinguish himself from his father's political brand, his own star has in part benefited from his father's fame as well as the grassroots support he generated in key early presidential primary states. If Paul wins the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, the Libertarian Party could also nominate him in an effort to avoid a spoiler situation in a close general election race. A new report Tuesday by U.S. News shows that leaders and constituencies in the Libertarian Party are already gearing up for an internal debate over the scenario.","Former presidential candidate Ralph Nader says Rand Paul is ""changing by the month""

"(CNN) -- For Airbnb hosts who want to keep tabs on their homes, a full home security system might be overkill. They're expensive, and live cameras and motion detectors invade guests' privacy. So how do they make sure guests keep the volume down, aren't smoking inside and don't ransack their home? A new device called Point combines microphones with environmental sensors to detect anything out of the ordinary in your home while you are away. A broken window while you're at work, the sound of your teenagers throwing a raging party, Grandad sneaking an unauthorized after-dinner cigar. ""They want to have peace of mind and know that everything is fine, but they don't want or need full security systems,"" said Nils Mattisson, co-founder of Form Devices, the start-up that makes Point. Small, round and plastic, Point looks like a traditional smoke alarm crossed with a speaker. Sounds are matched with data from the other sensors to figure out what might have happened -- a loud crash followed by a drop in temperature might mean a window was broken. It hears when an existing smoke detector goes off and sends an alert, though it's not certified as an official smoke detector on its own. It has a microphone that can detect sounds outside that the human ear could pick up. Environmental sensors pick up temperature; the particle sensor can tell what's in the air. When Point detects any notable changes, it sends an alert to the owner's smartphone. The mobile app also shows a timeline of all events, so someone can quickly scroll through the day to see when people were in the home. All the computation takes place on the device; there is no live-streaming audio, no way to eavesdrop on your home and no overwhelming amount of data to sort through. Mattisson worked in the Exploratory Design Group at Apple for seven years, where he helped build prototypes for early, experimental product ideas. He left the company last year to start Form with co-founders Marcus Ljungblad, Fredrik Ahlberg and Martin LÃ¶Ã¶f. Together, they wanted to create a new genre of smart-home device. The original idea started with Airbnb hosts, but it's for anyone who wants a lightweight security option for their home or office. It's meant for anyone who doesn't need a complex security system, or who isn't comfortable with images from inside their home being stored on the cloud. Internet-connected cameras like Dropcam are a popular alternative to full security systems, but images and videos stored in the cloud can be vulnerable to hackers. For example, a Russian website is hosting hacked streams of strangers' video cameras. Point doesn't store audio information, processing it all directly on the device. Form has raised $150,000 on Kickstarter and is working with a manufacturer in China on the first production run, though it has tested early prototype devices. Early next year, the Finland-based company will ship the device to its first pilot customer, a management company that rents offices for short periods. Form hopes to test it with a hotel soon after that, and make it available to consumers by next summer for around $100 each. Tech companies including Apple and Google, and traditional home stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, are all pushing smart-home products as the next big thing. Mattisson saw that big companies were taking existing products like thermostats and refrigerators and adding Internet. ""We felt there was a need for something that was simple,"" said Mattisson. ""And we don't have to make products that are in the same mold.""","Point is a new kind of home security gadget that listens constantly for unusual sounds .

"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- Minot and other North Dakota cities dealing with record flooding will continue to be threatened by the Souris River for days to come, even though the water is no longer rising along parts of the river, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers commander said Monday. Although the river crested in Minot early Sunday morning, it has only dropped a fraction of an inch since -- leaving crews with the tense, around-the-clock job of constantly inspecting and shoring up emergency levees built to protect critical structures, said Lt. Col. Kendall Bergmann, deputy district engineer for the Corps' St. Paul District. ""We're 99% complete, but it's an ongoing fight,"" Bergmann said Monday. The river had crested in Minot and appeared to be cresting in the downstream community of Velva, Bergmann said. The remaining communities along the U.S. portion of the river -- which begins in Canada and loops back into that country downstream of Minot -- do not appear threatened, he said. Overnight, crews had to deal with floodwaters seeping through storm sewer drains and levees, but none of those issues posed major threats, he said. Workers had to build another ring levee near the Broadway Bridge to protect that critical north-south route through Minot from being cut off, Bergmann said. National Guard helicopters also had to drop one-ton sandbags around a school to keep it from flooding. The Souris River crested Sunday at Minot at nearly 13 feet over flood stage -- below earlier predictions, but still almost 4 feet above an 1881 record, according to the National Weather Service. The river had fallen about 6 inches as of Monday morning, according to the weather service, and is predicted to remain above the 1881 record into next week. The state was scheduled to open three recovery centers in North Dakota on Monday -- two in Minot and one in Bismarck -- for residents in the throes of the record-setting floods. Residents can visit the locations to find out about assistance programs and have their questions answered, Gov. Jack Dalrymple told reporters. But, he said, it is not necessary for residents to visit the centers to register for disaster assistance, which can be done by telephone or online. Dalrymple said a tour of the area Sunday was ""sobering, to say the least."" A boil-water order, issued as a precaution Saturday, remained in effect. Minot officials told residents that tap water should be boiled for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms. Republican Rep. Rick Berg said he had been in touch with officials in Washington -- which has authorized FEMA to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges. ""You're seeing people at the highest levels working together, putting politics behind them,"" said North Dakota's lone congressman. Many residents of Minot who evacuated ahead of the rising water returned to the area Sunday against the recommendations of the city officials, hoping to catch a glimpse of their homes, said CNN's Jim Spellman. Spellman said when he toured the hardest-hit area by boat, several residents gave him their addresses and asked him to check on their homes. Everyone was hoping his or her home might be the one that was spared, he said, but he had to bring back bad news. ""It's a somber feeling, sitting here,"" said resident Steve Knab. He recalled ""listening to the sirens go off, and they evacuated us, and coming back the next day and seeing this ... it's disheartening."" But, he said, ""We'll get there. We're healthy."" Evacuee Robin Taylor said residents have been helping one another. When her family had to evacuate in a hurry, neighbors on both sides pitched in, she said. Jim Sarroll has lived in Minot his entire life. He has sandbagged his home, located just outside the evacuation zone, with the help of neighbors, and said Sunday it was dry so far. He was, however, very concerned about the water. ""I flushed my toilet this morning, and the water was red,"" he said. Still, he said he was able to see the positives, when neighbors, relatives and friends bond to get through a disaster the best they can.

"(CNN) -- Two grieving fathers, who each lost a son in the recent killing spree in Santa Barbara, California, met for the first time Sunday.

""I have met with Peter Rodger and we plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have,"" Martinez told CNN affiliate KEYT. ""This was a private conversation between grieving fathers who've reached common ground."" An emotional Martinez has been an outspoken critic of the nation's gun laws in the days since his 20-year-old son, a junior at the University of California at Santa Barbara, was gunned down by Rodger inside a deli on campus the night of the rampage. Police say Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 the night of May 23 after years of rejection and jealousy. He was later found dead in his car from a gunshot wound to the head. His family had tried to get help for him in the weeks leading up to the massacre, even calling police to conduct a welfare check, but all attempts at helping the troubled 22-year-old college student failed. Richard Martinez has been so grief-stricken by his son's death that he reached out to the father of his son's killer. Peter Rodger agreed to a private meeting Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, new attention has been paid to longstanding allegations that Bill Cosby sexually assaulted multiple women over the course of his career. As new information and accusers are brought to light, we are reminded of an unshakable feature of American life: rape culture. By ""rape culture,"" I refer to the ways that our society and its institutions normalize, promote, excuse, and enable sexual violence against men and women. While I cannot definitively say that Cosby is guilty of the crimes of which he is accused, the conversation about him epitomizes some of the most pernicious aspects of rape culture. Patriarchy . For decades, reports of Cosby's alleged sexual misconduct have circulated in private circles and, more recently, mainstream media outlets. Despite report after report, often from credible sources, the general public has failed to take the stories seriously. That was, of course, until male comedian Hannibal Buress raised the rape allegations during a two-minute comedy skit last month. This is not a coincidence, but rather a key feature of rape culture, which diminishes the legitimacy of women's voices and truth claims. By privileging the perspectives of men, who have a material investment in the maintenance of gender injustice, we allow rape culture to survive and thrive. In this case, it is entirely reasonable to assume that if Buress (or another man) hadn't made the claims publicly, we would still be talking about Cosby as America's favorite father rather than a possible sociopath. Denial . In the face of horrific evidence against Bill Cosby, most Americans simply elected to look the other way. From fans to industry executives to his latest biographer, we all committed to denying the existence of consistent rape allegations throughout Cosby's career. Of course, part of this is about the unique position that Cosby holds in the public imagination. After all, who wants to believe that America's most beloved father and black America's socio-moral steward could be a depraved serial rapist? But it's deeper than that. We live in a society where even the most ordinary and anonymous of accused rapists is offered the benefit of social and legal doubt. This is why we're quick to chalk up rapes, particularly acquaintance rapes, as ""misunderstandings"" or ""miscommunications"" rather than the crimes that they are. Blaming the victim . Rather than offering criticism of Cosby's alleged actions, many have chosen to focus on the behavior of the accusers. Why were they alone with him in the first place? What were they wearing? How can they cry rape if they had consensual sex with him in the past? Why didn't they do more to physically fight him off? This sensibility can be seen in my colleague Don Lemon's interview with Joan Tarshis, when he asked her why she didn't use her teeth to defend herself from Cosby's alleged sexual assault. Lemon responded to discussion of the interview Wednesday with an apology, saying ""As I am a victim myself I would never want to suggest that any victim could have prevented a rape."" Still, when such questions are raised, even by victims of sexual assault, we reinforce one of the dominant narratives of rape culture: ""If you get raped, it's at least partially your own fault."" Perpetuating myths . Some people have pointed to Cosby's public persona, philanthropy, and other positive attributes to refute the rape allegations. Others have pointed to the personal nature of his relationships with his accusers as proof that he is not a rapist. Such gestures are commonly used to reinforce the myth that rapists are strangers, social outcasts or part of a seedy criminal class. The normalization of rape in our society hinges on these deeply ingrained lies about the nature of sexual violence. In truth, most rapes don't happen in dark alleys, nor are they usually perpetrated by unknown actors. Rape occurs among co-workers, classmates, family members and even spouses. And rapists can be doctors, lawyers, judges, priests and, yes, professional comedians. This doesn't mean that Bill Cosby is guilty -- that is for courts to decide -- but it does mean that his personal biography and achievements do not make him innocent. Trivializing sexual violence . In the past few days, footage of Bill Cosby's old comedy routines has begun to circulate around the Internet. One clip worthy of extreme concern was his 1969 ""Spanish fly"" routine, where he jokes about the erotic effects of slipping a substance into women's drinks. Of course, this is far from a smoking gun. In all likelihood Cosby saw no connection between this standup routine, which was wildly popular among fans and critics, and rape culture. Unfortunately, that is precisely the point. Jokes about Spanish fly, pro-rape college chants and nearly universal axioms about ""not dropping the soap"" in prison are all part of a perverted cultural logic that minimizes the immorality, illegality, and trauma of rape. Turning rapists Into victims . Over the past week, Cosby has received support from a unlikely coalition of people. Black radicals have argued that Cosby is being attacked because of white supremacist antipathy toward successful black men. Many of the same liberals who ran to Ferguson, Missouri, hours after Michael Brown's death, criticizing our dysfunctional justice system and demanding immediate justice, are now preaching the virtues of patience and due process. Conservatives like Rush Limbaugh have claimed that Cosby is being punished by the liberal media for his righteous moral crusades against the black community. Few things can unite America's warring political factions like a commitment to shielding men from accountability for sexual violence.","Marc Lamont Hill: The way people talk about Cosby allegations is revealing .

""They talk about their pets like members of the family, 'my son' or 'my brother'.""

"(CNN) -- All Blacks captain Richie McCaw is warning his side against complacency as they go into Sunday's Rugby World Cup final against France as odds-on favorites to lift the William Webb Ellis trophy. While hosts New Zealand have enjoyed a relatively smooth and unbeaten passage to the finale of the global showpiece at Eden Park, France have been beaten twice and failed to hit their top form. But McCaw, who was left in tears as the All Blacks stumbled to a 20-18 quarterfinal defeat to the French in the 2007 World Cup, said Saturday that negative media coverage had given Les Bleus extra motivation to spring another upset. ""I've got no doubt the French are going to play their best game and you blokes have loaded the gun for them,"" he told gathered reporters at the official press conference. ""They've got players who've been around for a long time and they understand what it takes to win Test matches."" And as to France's indifferent form, including a 37-17 loss to his team and a dismal defeat against Tonga in the pool stages, McCaw believes it counts for nothing. ""In a final it's not about who 'deserves' what,"" said McCaw. ""It's about who goes and plays the best rugby on that stage, in this game, that's what we've got to do."" The All Blacks, the traditional powerhouses of international rugby, are searching for only a second World Cup triumph, their only title coming in the inaugural tournament in 1987 when they beat France in the final in Auckland. New Zealand to end 24 years of hurt? McCaw's French counterpart and rival flanker Thierry Dusautoir said his team were determined to defy the odds after scraping into the final with a 9-8 victory over 14-man Wales last weekend. ""No matter whatever the sport, all kids dream of being world champions. It can't get better than being the world champions and to achieve those dream,"" he said. ""We showed great strength to get here. There's one match left and we need to prove ourselves."" France's defense coach, Englishman David Ellis, is confident they can repeat their previous successes against the All Blacks and claims to have found chinks in their armor. ""We feel there are certain areas of their defense we can exploit,"" he told the official Rugby World Cup website. ""There are things that we found out and we are quite capable of exploiting those weaknesses."" But despite Ellis' bold talk, it would be almost unthinkable for the All Blacks to fail to deliver with a whole nation holding its collective breath. Rugby is the national sport in New Zealand and after the tragic events of earlier this year when Christchurch was hit by an earthquake and the recent oil spill in the Bay of Plenty, many have looked upon the World Cup to lift collective spirits. New Zealand prime minister John Key had no doubt when asked about the result on the eve of the final. ""I'm thinking they're going to beat them and beat them quite comfortably,"" he said. With elections looming, Key will be hoping his bold prediction holds come Sunday night.","All Blacks captain McCaw says France will be dangerous World Cup final opponents .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea says it plans to prosecute two American tourists that it detained earlier this year, accusing them of ""perpetrating hostile acts."" The North Korean government had previously said it was holding the two U.S. citizens, Jeffrey Fowle and Matthew Miller, but hadn't said what it planned to do with them. ""According to the results of the investigation, suspicions about their hostile acts have been confirmed by evidence and their testimonies,"" the North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Monday. ""The relevant organ of the DPRK is carrying on the investigation into them and making preparations for bringing them before court on the basis of the already confirmed charges,"" the report said, using using an abbreviation of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The U.S. State Department called on North Korea to release the two men on humanitarian grounds. Asylum bid? North Korea said in late April that it had taken Miller into custody, claiming he had come to the country seeking asylum and had torn up his tourist visa. It announced the detention of Fowle in early June, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" It didn't provide details at the time on what exactly he was accused of doing. But the Japanese news agency Kyodo cited unidentified diplomatic sources as saying that Fowle was part of a tour group and that he was detained in mid-May after allegedly leaving a Bible in a hotel where he had been staying. Although North Korea regularly denounces the United States as a sworn enemy in its state-run media, Americans are able to visit the country as tourists. But the U.S. State Department says it ""strongly recommends against all travel by U.S. citizens to North Korea."" Swedish Embassy involved .

In practice, that means that North Korean authorities have been in touch with the Swedish Embassy, which represents American interests in the country. ""Out of humanitarian concern for Mr. Fowle and Mr. Miller and their families, we request North Korea release them so they may return home,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

"(CNN) -- South Sudan is in the news but not for the reasons that moved me to fly halfway around the world to the country were I was born. South Sudan, my country, has been criticized for not having done enough since its independence. The naysayers seem to have forgotten that this is a country that was mired in civil war for decades and that only a little over a year ago broke free from the chains of the North. Still it is fighting to negotiate a fair agreement for the oil on the dangerous and contentious border while generously hosting over 170,000 Sudanese refugees. Its population has bulged with hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese returning home. Imagine the U.S. in the first year of its independence. Read more: End the suffering in the Sudans . In July, I traveled home with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to commemorate the one-year anniversary of independence. I hadn't been to South Sudan since the peace agreement in 2005. I never thought I would see a free South Sudan. It was overwhelming. The story that is not being told is that in spite of all the challenges -- the country is teeming with hope. Opinion: President al-Bashir feels heat from 'Sudanese Spring' For instance, my nephew, who was born in England, moved to South Sudan to start a telecommunications firm. He gave up the comforts of London because he believes in South Sudan's future. He is just one of thousands with a vision for their country that only an appetite inspired by decades of bloodshed can foster. During my trip I met dozens of people from the First Lady of the country to refugees who had returned from Khartoum, most were brimming with ideas about how to restart their lives and contribute to their new home. South Sudanese people are rich like the soul of their nation. What they lack in training they make up in sheer willpower. Read related: Which countries take in most refugees? Not the West . I visited a woman UNHCR helped settle in a village near Juba. Naomi, 83, is taking care of her grandchildren. All three of her sons were killed during the civil war. Her story moved me to tears. She should be relaxing and enjoying the fruits of her labor but instead is still taking care of babies. Naomi reminded me of my own grandmother who endured the civil wars and those who lost someone to violence. Yet in spite of all this pain, Naomi exuded hope.

At the Independence Day ceremony President Kir rallied the people reminding them that they had won their freedom but the battle was not over. Now they must build their nation. What South Sudan needs to do is invest in education. Over 50% of the country is young people. I read in a report that a South Sudanese girl is three times more likely to die in childbirth than reach eighth grade. Read related: Sudan, South Sudan settle oil dispute . My father instilled in me a fierce commitment to education and that is why at the TEDx Juba conference I shared my vision for the future of South Sudan -- infrastructure development and education. As a member of the South Sudanese diaspora I hope to help continue his legacy. UNHCR, which has been helping thousands of South Sudanese who have returned rebuild their lives, is compromised by the crisis on the border. This month's rains have worsened an already dire situation for the refugees. Unfortunately, aid organizations can only do so much. They need help to work with both the returning population and the refugees at the same time. Blog: Four ways social media could transform conflict in Africa .

"Dr. Jane Miller remembers the first -- and the last -- time she implanted four embryos into a patient getting in-vitro fertilization. Nadya Suleman gave birth to octuplets on January 26. Fanfare -- and controversy -- were not far behind. ""It was 1999, and we got triplets, and I said, 'My God, never again,' "" remembers the fertility expert in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. ""The human uterus is meant to carry only one at a time."" Since then, Miller says, she implants only one or two embryos; on ""very, very rare"" occasions she'll implant three. When she heard Nadya Suleman, the mother of octuplets in California, say her doctor had implanted six embryos, she was outraged. Miller is not alone. Fertility experts around the country say there's never a reason to implant six embryos. It's risky, and it's way outside the scope of normal practice: Data from the Centers for Disease Control show that on average, fertility doctors implant 2.3 embryos into women under age 35. Why, then, did Suleman's doctor implant so many embryos? Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . That's the question fertility experts, bloggers and now the Medical Board of California have been asking since Suleman, age 33, gave birth to octuplets in January. In media interviews, she identified her reproductive endocrinologist as Dr. Michael Kamrava of West Coast IVF Clinic in Beverly Hills, California. The state board is now investigating the ""Suleman matter,"" according to Candis Cohen, a spokeswoman for the board. Kamrava did not return phone calls to his office from CNN.  Watch more on fertility do's and don'ts » . ""It's crazy,"" said Dr. Walid Saleh, medical director of the Sher Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Dallas, Texas, noting that implanting six embryos clearly violates guidelines set by the American Society for Assisted Reproductive Medicine, which recommends implanting no more than two embryos in a woman under 35. ""I don't know of anyone else who does this."" Saleh and other fertility experts say they think they know why Kamrava chose to implant so many embryos. The CDC keeps statistics on fertility doctors and their success rates, and Kamrava's is significantly below the national average. Nationally, when doctors implant embryos, they manage to achieve a live birth 38.7 percent of the time, according to the CDC data. But Kamrava achieved a live birth 10 percent of the time, according to CDC data for his clinic. ""He has terrible statistics,"" says Miller. Other doctors say he had to put in a large number of embryos to get any success at all. Miller and other experts in the fertility field say it's not talked about a lot, but Kamrava is not the only one implanting such a large number of embryos. ""This is not an isolated case,"" says Pamela Madsen, a fertility blogger and founder of the American Fertility Association. ""It's more common than you might think for a patient to stumble upon a doctor who's willing to deviate from the norm."" Consumer Tips Blog: What not to say to infertile friends, family . So, before you select a fertility doctor, do your homework. Start by clicking on the CDC's Fertility Clinic Reports page to find information for a fertility clinic you're interested in. Look for the line ""percentage of cycles resulting in live births."" This tells you how often a clinic was able to achieve a live birth, or in layman's terms, the clinic's ""success rate."" Farther down, the line ""percentage of pregnancies with triplets or more"" lets you know how often a clinic had a pregnancy with high-order multiples. ""Anything more than a singleton or twins is risky,"" Miller says. ""Even twins have higher risks of having health and developmental problems. People go to the shopping mall and see double strollers and say, 'Oh, how cute.' They don't see the ones who aren't able to leave the house."" You can compare an individual clinic's rates with the national average on the CDC's page with national fertility statistics.. Madsen also recommends talking to other patients about their experience with fertility doctors. The groups Resolve and Fertile Thoughts both have popular online forums and discussion boards. ""If you post a doctor's name and nobody's heard of him, that's a red flag,"" Madsen says. To learn more about the terms you'll hear about on these Web sites and in doctor's offices, take a look at this glossary of fertility terms. Madsen says another sign of a good fertility doctor is one who won't yield to patients' pressure to implant a large number of embryos. ""Patients really need to be aware that a doctor simply pleasing them may not actually be good medical practice,"" she says. CNN's Marcy Heard and Jennifer Pifer-Bixler contributed to this report.","Birth of octuplets in late January turned unflattering spotlight on fertility clinics .

"(CNN) -- Samoa's Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu has been suspended indefinitely from rugby union after failing to attend a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday. The center was summoned after criticizing referee Nigel Owen on social networking site Twitter following Samoa's 13-5 defeat to South Africa on Friday which ended the Pacific Islanders' participation at the 2011 Rugby World Cup. ""The judicial officer determined that due to the player's failure to attend the hearing he would adjourn the case to an appropriate time when he would face the charges against him,"" tournament organizers Rugby World Cup Limited (RWCL) said in a statement. ""Pending the holding of such a hearing, he ordered that Mr. Fuimaono Sapolu be provisionally suspended from all participation in the game of rugby union."" Fuimaono-Sapolu had received a warning for a similar outburst earlier in the World Cup. The 30-year-old criticized RWCL for Samoa's fixture schedule and compared it to a holocaust, but escaped with a warning. Meanwhile, Italy forward Leonardo Ghiraldini has been banned for 15 weeks for foul play during the Azzurri's 36-6 reverse against Pool C winners Ireland. The hooker was handed the sanction after admitting that he gouged the eye of Ireland prop Cian Healy during Sunday's match in Dunedin. ""Ghiraldini was accordingly suspended from all rugby up to and including January 17, 2012,"" read a statement on the tournament's website. ""The player has 48 hours in which to appeal from the time he was informed of the decision."" Ireland face Wales on Saturday for a place in the semifinals, with 2003 winners England taking on France on the same day. On Sunday, hosts New Zealand face Argentina in the other half of the draw, while defending champions South Africa play Australia.","Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu receives an indefinite suspension from rugby .

"(CNN) -- New Zealand captain and key forward Richie McCaw has been passed fit for Sunday's Rugby World Cup semifinal clash with neighbors Australia in Auckland. Reports had suggested the flanker could miss the host nation's eagerly-awaited showdown with the two-time world champion Wallabies due to a foot injury, after the 30-year-old played a limited role in this week's training sessions. But McCaw has been named in Graham Henry's starting XV as the All Blacks aim to reach their first final at the four-yearly tournament since winning the inaugural event on home soil 24 years ago. Aaron Cruden comes in at flyhalf for only his eighth Test appearance after Dan Carter's deputy Colin Slade aggravated a groin injury during the quarterfinal win over Argentina last weekend. Piri Weepu retains his place at scrumhalf after kicking 21 points in New Zealand's 33-10 victory over the Pumas. But despite his match-winning display in Auckland, Weepu's joy at reaching the semifinals was countered by learning his paternal grandfather had passed away. ""It was pretty tough at the beginning,"" the 28-year-old told reporters. ""Especially coming off the field on Sunday, seeing my father trying to get a hold of me. He pretty much broke the news. ""It was pretty tough but I'm back in camp now and I've got the support I need from the boys to help me get through this week and hopefully put in a good effort."" Australia beat New Zealand 25-20 when the two sides met in the Tri-Nations in August, and the Wallabies have won their last two World Cup contests -- in the semifinals in 1991 and 2003. Kurtley Beale has been selected at fullback for the Wallabies in the hope the 22-year-old will recover from a hamstring injury. If Beale fails to make Sunday's encounter, Adam Ashley-Cooper will fill in and be replaced at outside center by 24-year-old Anthony Faingaa. Australia, coached by former All Blacks fullback Robbie Deans, will have to become the first team to beat New Zealand at Eden Park in 17 years to reach a fourth World Cup final. Wales have reached the last four for the first time since 1987, and coach Warren Gatland has made one change to the team which recorded a 22-10 win over Ireland in the quarterfinals ahead of Saturday's semi with France. James Hook replaces the injured Rhys Priestland at flyhalf for what will be his 58th international cap as Wales look to reach their first World Cup final. France, beaten by New Zealand in the 1987 final, will be unchanged following the 19-12 win over England. Coach Marc Lievremont's Les Blues will attempt to repeat their 28-9 defeat of Wales in this year's Six Nations.","Richie McCaw is declared fit for New Zealand's Rugby World Cup semifinal .

"Washington (CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 8:41 a.m. ET] . Al Qaeda is linked to a terror threat that has prompted the State Department to direct its embassies in key Middle East nations, including Egypt and Israel, to close Sunday, U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, told CNN's ""New Day"" Friday. ""It's my understanding that it is al Qaeda linked, alright, and the threat emanates in the Middle East and in Central Asia."" [Previously published story, 8:56 p.m. ET] . A terror threat prompted the State Department on Thursday to direct its embassies in key Middle East nations, including Egypt and Israel, to close on Sunday with the possibility they could remain idle longer. A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly on the matter called the threat ""credible and serious."" It was ""directed at American targets overseas,"" but may not be confined to main diplomatic facilities, the official said. In addition to Egypt and Israel, the State Department action includes diplomatic facilities in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iraq and Kuwait, according to the agency and Twitter postings. A senior State Department official said the agency has told those embassies that normally would be beginning the work week on Sunday to close, but additional days could be added. Diplomatic facilities in the region are for the most part closed or operate with minimal staff on Fridays and Saturdays. Separately, another U.S. official told CNN that the Obama administration is monitoring threats against the embassy in Sanaa, Yemen. The official did not say whether the embassy would close. President Barack Obama met with Yemen President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi at the White House on Thursday. Yemen has been cracking down on al Qaeda. A U.S. official earlier told CNN the embassy closures were because of ""more than the usual chatter"" about a potential terrorist threat, which was not specific about time and location. Officials said the time frame comes with the approaching end of Ramadan and the one-year anniversary of the terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps at diplomatic sites out of an abundance of caution. Read more: CNN found embassy attack suspect before FBI .

"(CNN) -- In writing the book ""Love 2.0: How Our Supreme Emotion Affects Everything We Feel, Think, Do, and Become,"" here are 10 lessons I have learned: . 1. It can be hard to talk about love in scientific terms because people have strong pre-existing ideas about it. The vision of love that emerges from the latest science requires a radical shift. I learned that I need to ask people to step back from their current views of love long enough to consider it from a different perspective: their body's perspective. Love is not romance. It's not sexual desire. It's not even that special bond you feel with family or significant others. And perhaps most challenging of all, love is neither lasting nor unconditional. The radical shift we need to make is this: Love, as your body experiences it, is a micro-moment of connection shared with another. 2. Love is not exclusive. We tend to think of love in the same breath as loved ones. When you take these to be only your innermost circle of family and friends, you inadvertently and severely constrain your opportunities for health, growth and well-being. In reality, you can experience micro-moments of connection with anyone -- whether your soul mate or a stranger. So long as you feel safe and can forge the right kind of connection, the conditions for experiencing the emotion of love are in place. 3. Love doesn't belong to one person. We tend to think of emotions as private events, confined to one person's mind and skin. Upgrading our view of love defies this logic. Evidence suggests that when you really ""click"" with someone else, a discernible yet momentary synchrony emerges between the two of you, as your gestures and biochemistries, even your respective neural firings, come to mirror one another in a pattern I call positivity resonance. Love is a biological wave of good feeling and mutual care that rolls through two or more brains and bodies at once. 4. Making eye contact is a key gateway for love. Your body has the built-in ability to ""catch"" the emotions of those around you, making your prospects for love -- defined as micro-moments of positivity resonance -- nearly limitless. As hopeful as this sounds, I also learned that you can thwart this natural ability if you don't make eye contact with the other person. Meeting eyes is a key gatekeeper to neural synchrony. 5. Love fortifies the connection between your brain and your heart, making you healthier. Decades of research show that people who are more socially connected live longer and healthier lives. Yet precisely how social ties affect health has remained one of the great mysteries of science. My research team and I recently learned that when we randomly assign one group of people to learn ways to create more micro-moments of love in daily live, we lastingly improve the function of the vagus nerve, a key conduit that connects your brain to your heart. This discovery provides a new window into how micro-moments of love serve as nutrients for your health. 6. Your immune cells reflect your past experiences of love. Too often, you get the message that your future prospects hinge on your DNA. Yet the ways that your genes get expressed at the cellular level depends mightily on many factors, including whether you consider yourself to be socially connected or chronically lonely. My team is now investigating the cellular effects of love, testing whether people who build more micro-moments of love in daily life also build healthier immune cells. 7. Small emotional moments can have disproportionately large biological effects. It can seem surprising that an experience that lasts just a micro-moment can have any lasting effect on your health and longevity. Yet I learned that there's an important feedback loop at work here, an upward spiral between your social and your physical well-being. That is, your micro-moments of love not only make you healthier, but being healthier builds your capacity for love. Little by little, love begets love by improving your health. And health begets health by improving your capacity for love. 8. Don't take a loving marriage for granted. Writing this book has profoundly changed my personal view of love. I used to uphold love as that constant, steady force that all but defines my marriage. While that constant, steady force still exists, I now see our bond as a product of the many micro-moments of positivity resonance that my husband and I have shared over the years. This shakes me out of any complacency that tempts me to take our love for granted. Love is something we should re-cultivate every single day. 9. Love and compassion can be one and the same. If we reimagine love as micro-moments of shared positivity, it can seem like love requires that you always feel happy. I learned that this isn't true. You can experience a micro-moment of love even as you or the person with whom you connect suffers. Love doesn't require that you ignore or suppress negativity. It simply requires that some element of kindness, empathy or appreciation be added to the mix. Compassion is the form love takes when suffering occurs. 10. Simply upgrading your view of love changes your capacity for it. The latest science offers new lenses through which to see your every interaction. The people I interviewed for the book shared incredibly moving stories about how they used micro-moments of connection to make dramatic turnarounds in their personal and work lives. One of the most hopeful things I learned is that when people take just a minute or so each day to think about whether they felt connected and attuned to others, they initiate a cascade of benefits. And this is something you could start doing today, having learned even just this much more about how love works. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barbara Fredrickson.","Love and compassion can be the same, says psychologist Barbara Fredrickson .

"(CNN) -- ""There is a market for selling humans."" That unsettling fact was pushed into the front of the news cycle on Monday when a man who claims to have kidnapped 276 teen girls announced in a video message that he would sell the young women into marriage or slavery. ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" the man, who claimed to be Abubakar Shekau, the leader of a Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, said in the video. He smiles while he says that, by the way, which sent chills down my spine. ""There is a market for selling humans,"" he adds, according to a CNN translation. ""Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women ..."" This is no doubt an extreme case, and it's one that has led to international outrage and demands for the United States and other world leaders to help find the young women that reportedly were kidnapped a month ago from school in Nigeria. Everything possible should be done to find these girls, who may be as young as 12. But the story is also a harrowing reminder that slavery, in various forms, remains a pervasive reality worldwide, particularly in poor and violent places such as parts of Nigeria. International efforts to combat the practice have failed to stamp it out. Perhaps the only sane thing this crazed leader said is that there is a ""market for selling humans."" It's 2014, and that most certainly is true. That fact alone is worthy of sustained, global attention. In Nigeria, signs suggest the market is alive and well. Between 670,000 and 740,000 people are estimated to be in slavery in Nigeria, according to the Walk Free Foundation's 2013 Global Slavery Index. That puts Nigeria at No. 4 worldwide in terms of the total number of people enslaved. Mauritania, a West African country I visited in 2011 for a CNN story, ranks as having the highest percentage of enslaved people, according to that report. Advocacy groups say 20 million to 30 million people are enslaved worldwide, and more than 15% of those people are in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to Walk Free. It's unclear what exactly would happen to the girls if Boko Haram does follow through on its threats to sell them into marriage or slavery. Young women sold into slavery or marriage sometimes end up as domestic servants; some are sexually abused by the ""husbands"" who purchase or obtain them; some work under threat of violence; and other women are sold internationally to work in the sex trade. ""It appears from the media statements that the intention is to sell the girls into so-called 'marriages,' which are likely to be nothing more than sexual and domestic enslavement, presumably either in neighboring countries or within Nigeria itself,"" Fiona David, executive director of global research at the Walk Free Foundation, wrote to me in an e-mail from Ghana, where she is attending a conference. Nigeria acts as a sort of hub for human trafficking, with victims sometimes being sent to Europe, especially Italy, according to experts and published reports. During a September 2013 visit to Rome, the United Nations' special rapporteur on trafficking in persons, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, told the story of a 21-year-old woman who was trafficked from Nigeria through Turkey, Serbia, Hungary and Slovenia and eventually to Italy. The story highlights not only the international nature of the network but also the importance of global vigilance to spot trafficking victims. Families sleep in the bushes, fearing more attacks . ""Not only was she trafficked but was held in debt bondage as her father back in Edo state (of Nigeria) had put up his land as collateral for the payment of the 60,000 euros ($84,000) fee illegal contract to bring her to Europe,"" Ezeilo said of the woman, who was not identified in an online summary and transcript of the speech. ""The young woman was moved from Turin to Milan and Paris to sell her body in order to repay her debt. She was rescued following a random identification check in Italy, where she now benefits from assistance."" As we keep the young women in Nigeria on our minds and pressure governments to rescue them before they can be sold into marriage or slavery, we also should think about the conditions that foster slavery internationally. Poverty, instability and a lack of education tend to make the practice of slavery more likely and help it persist. This is particularly troubling given reports that the Nigerian girls were kidnapped because they were at school. Boko Haram, the group taking credit, has a name that roughly translates to ""Western education is a sin."" Education and stability also could help end slavery. ""Any time there's conflict -- particularly when that's accompanied by historic discrimination against women and sex violence and abuse -- it's actually not uncommon that there would be this type of kidnapping,"" Karen Stauss, director of programs at Free the Slaves, a Washington-based advocacy group, told me. It's crucial not to downplay the importance of finding the young women in Nigeria, but I agree with Stauss when she says that every potential victim of trafficking and sex slavery has an important story to tell. All of them matter. Bergen: What's at stake in war against girls' kidnappers? It's impossible for each to become the center of global media coverage. But each deserves our advocacy. If you live in the United States, asking your legislators to pass the International Violence Against Women Act is one way to show your support for all of the women around the world who are hurt because of their gender. The act would make combating gender-based violence a central goal of U.S. foreign policy. Change.org has an online petition you can sign. I'm sure there are some people who will read this and think that Nigeria and the issues of slavery and the sex trade are far too distant to matter to them. For one, that's patently untrue. Trafficking occurs in the United States and Europe, as well. But, if that is your view, I'd ask you to consider what Emeka Daniel told CNN after the kidnapping in Nigeria. Daniel, whose father was kidnapped in Nigeria in a separate incident, according to the CNN report, said some people in Nigeria reacted to the news by saying ""Why do I care?"" and ""Nigeria is done."" They'd resigned to the control this extremist group exerts. And they'd lost hope that the country can be made safe. Not Daniel. ""I refused to believe that,"" he said, according to the report. ""We can't let this be the new normal."" I'd second that. This sort of violence against women could start to seem normal if it's ignored. So don't ignore it. Demand, as so many are, that the United States and others do more to help rescue the girls. And refuse to ignore the fact that, every day, unseen and unheard women face sex slavery and discrimination on an unthinkable magnitude.","Nigeria is home to 670,000 to 740,000 slaves, according to 2013 report .

"(CNN) -- An employee of a subcontractor laying fiber optic cable hit a 2-inch gas line with an underground boring machine about an hour before an explosion killed one person at a popular restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri. Fire Chief Paul Berardi told reporters the subcontractor, Heartland Midwest, called 911 at 4:55 p.m. CT to report the accident. Authorities do not know what caused the leaking gas to ignite, according to Rob Hack, chief operating officer of Missouri Gas Energy. ""But all the damaged points to ignition inside the restaurant,"" he said. One body was pulled Wednesday from the debris at JJ's restaurant, a popular place near Country Club Plaza, a locale with upscale shops and restaurants. Officials said Wednesday afternoon they believed there were no more missing people or undiscovered bodies. ""The people stage has basically concluded,"" Mayor Sly James told reporters. Authorities were moving into the investigation phase, he said. The explosion occurred just after 6 p.m. Tuesday. One female employee was reported missing after the blast, but Fire Chief Paul Berardi said it was too early to confirm the identity of the victim, whose body was found near the restaurant's bar area. At least 15 people were injured in the blast. Six people remained hospitalized Wednesday, three in critical condition, Berardi said. Berardi released a timeline of events that began with the subcontractor calling 911 shortly before 5 p.m. local time to report the accident. A Missouri Gas Energy employee showed up about 20 minutes later and, after some initial readings on gas-measuring devices, called for backup, Hack said. MGE employees on the scene went into businesses and asked people to leave because levels were above the state's threshold for gas concentrations in the air. The gas company also brought in excavating equipment to try to vent the pipe, but the explosion occurred before they could alleviate the problem. Three of the company's workers were hospitalized, Hack said. 'I thought I was going to die' The odor of natural gas led to the early closure of JJ's restaurant, but hostess Deidre Estes and other employees weren't in a rush to leave, unaware of the danger they were in. Then, ""Boom! And everything was black,"" Estes told CNN affiliate KCTV. The blast ripped the roof off of the restaurant. ""I thought I was going to die. Honestly, I thought I was trapped in there,"" Estes told KCTV. ""I saw the flames, and I was scared I was going to burn up. And then with all my might, I got this strength and lifted the rubble off."" A utility crew investigating the odor had suggested that the restaurant close, but gave no sense of urgency or the potential for an explosion. The mayor confirmed that the fire department responded to a call about the gas odor, about 50 minutes before the blast, but left the scene after being told by the utility company that everything was under control. ""When these situations exist, the fire department defers to the expertise of any utility who is there,"" James said. Debris was stacked 3- to 4-feet high where the restaurant once stood. Among the rubble was the gas company's destroyed backhoe. Watch video of the explosion's aftermath . Jennifer Carter, who was in the restaurant, told CNN affiliate KSHB that a man who had a hand-held device came in before the blast and told her and 10 others to leave. Employees had already turned off appliances after smelling gas, she said. Carter complied. She was just a few blocks away when she heard the explosion. The gas sent flames a few stories high into the night sky. More than 100 firefighters responded, Berardi said. Dr. Leonardo Lozada heard the explosion a block and a half away at St. Luke's Health Systems, where he is chief physician. ""It was pretty loud. I just heard it; it wasn't that traumatic,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Hosts New Zealand reached the final of the Rugby World Cup with a 20-6 win over Australia Sunday at Eden Park in Auckland. They will play France next Sunday on the same ground in a repeat of the 1987 final, which they won 29-9 and remains their only World Cup triumph. The All Blacks dominated from the start against their Tasman rivals and scored the only try of the match through centre Ma'a Nonu in the sixth minute. It followed a brilliant run and pass by full-back Israel Dagg and they were 14-6 in front at the interval. Two second half penalties from scrum-half Piri Weepu, taking over the kicking role from the injured Dan Carter, sealed victory for a relieved home team who carried huge weight of expectation. Australia will play Wales in the third place playoff next Friday but could have few complaints about the result of the match. France edge 14-man Wales in semifinal . ""It was an outstanding performance. I'm very proud of them. We just need to regroup next week and do the same thing,"" said New Zealand coach Graham Henry. ""The guys' character was superb and you can't ask for more than that. Everyone on the field gave 100 per cent, so it's a good feeling to have the job done,"" he told AFP. It went wrong from the start for Australia as their playmaker Quade Cooper sent his kick straight into touch to put his team under immediate pressure. From that passage of play, Dagg beat Anthony Fainga'a and Rocky Elsom to send Nonu over. Scrum half Weepu missed the conversion in a nervy start but was on target with a penalty after Australia flanker David Pocock was pulled up for a ruck infringement. James O'Connor had the Wallabies on the board with a penalty but New Zealand fly-half Aaron Cruden, playing after groin injuries ruled both Carter and Colin Slade out of the World Cup, put his team further ahead with a 22nd minute drop-goal. Cooper pulled it back to 11-6 for Australia with a neatly-taken drop-goal but Weepu added a penalty before the half to open up an eight-point lead again. Weepu's two kicks in the second half wrapped up his side's final appearance as they look to repeat the emphatic victory they enjoyed over France in the pool stage.","New Zealand to play France in the Rugby World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal came into the French Open with his air of invincibility punctured by recent defeats but his beaten opponent Thursday -- Austrian hopeful Dominic Thiem -- believes the eight-time champion is still the man to beat at this year's French Open. The 20-year-old Thiem admits Nadal was ""one of his idols"" growing up but showed little sign of being overawed as he detained the top seed for over two hours on Philippe Chatrier before succumbing to a 6-2 6-2 6-3 defeat in their second round match. But Thiem, the youngest man in the top 100 of the world rankings, currently occupying 57th spot, saw enough in Nadal's game to predict he will be holding the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy aloft on Sunday week. ""I think here in Roland Garros there are only a few man who can beat him, but yes he is the biggest favorite,"" Thiem told CNN. Nadal suffered shock quarterfinal defeats in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and in last week's Rome final to Novak Djokovic, but Thiem believes he is an altogether different proposition at the clay court grand slam. ""He's in his element at his favorite venue and he's really pumped up,"" he said. ""His top spin is really tough to counter and he didn't make a lot of mistakes."" After his victory, Nadal was also full of praise for his young opponent and applauded him off the court. ""He has completely everything to become a champion,"" he predicted. ""He as able to hit the ball very strong from the backhand and the forehand."" Thiem, who beat Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka in the second round of the Madrid Masters earlier this year, admitted to ""feeling a little bit nervous"" as he walked out on to the center court at a grand slam for the first time, . ""But fortunately I made a good start which helped a bit,"" he added. He will now head to Queens Club in London to get grass court preparation ahead of Wimbledon, while Nadal will next play Leonardo Mayer of Argentina in the third round, seeking the 61st victory of his record breaking career at the French Open. Even though he was expected to overcome Thiem, Nadal must have been slightly relieved as several big names have exited the tournament already. They include women's number one and defending champion, Serena Williams, second-seed Li Na and Wawrinka -- the man Nadal lost to in the Australian Open final. Elsewhere, Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, and 2013 finalist David Ferrer, advanced with straight sets wins in the men's draw. Murray led Nadal by a break in the third set at the Rome Masters earlier this month, only for the 13-time grand slam winner to rally. They could meet again in the semifinals in Paris, although Murray must first get past Philipp Kohlschreiber in the next round. Kohlschreiber won a clay-court title last weekend in his native Germany and crushed the Scot on clay in Monte Carlo in 2010 in their lone head-to-head. In the women's tournament, fourth seed Simona Halep of Romania, tipped by many for grand slam glory soon, beat Heather Watson of Britain 6-2 6-4. Serbian sixth seed Jelena Jankovic, who could directly benefit from the loss of Li Na in her section of the draw, continued her fine form in Paris with a 7-5 6-0 dismissal of Japan's Kurumi Nara. Former world number one and French Open champion Ana Ivanovic also went though while Sloane Stephens kept American hopes high in the absence of the defeated Williams with a 6-1 6-3 victory over Polona Hercog of Slovenia.","Defending champion Rafael Nadal beats Dominic Thiem at the French Open .

"(CNN) -- On a January night in 1961, a U.S. Air Force bomber broke in half while flying over eastern North Carolina. From the belly of the B-52 fell two bombs -- two nuclear bombs that hit the ground near the city of Goldsboro. A disaster worse than the devastation wrought in Hiroshima and Nagasaki could have befallen the United States that night. But it didn't, thanks to a series of fortunate missteps. Declassified documents that the National Security Archive released this week offered new details about the incident. The blaring headline read: ""Multi-Megaton Bomb Was Virtually 'Armed' When It Crashed to Earth."" Or, as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara put it back then, ""By the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted."" It's difficult to calculate the destruction those bombs might have caused had they detonated in North Carolina. What might've been . The website, nuclearsecrecy.com, allows users to simulate nuclear explosions. It says that one bomb the size of the two that fell in 1961 would emit thermal radiation over a 15-mile radius. Wind conditions, of course, could change that. The blast today, with populations in the area at their current level, would kill more than 60,000 people and injure more 54,000, though the website warns that calculating casualties is problematic, and the numbers do not include those killed and injured by fallout. It's also worth noting that North Carolina's 1961 total population was 47% of what it is today, so if you apply that percentage to the numbers, the death toll is 28,000 with 26,000 people injured -- a far cry from those killed by smaller bombs on the more densely populated cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. University of California-Los Angeles researchers estimate that, respectively, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had populations of about 330,000 and 250,000 when they were bombed in August 1945. By that December, the cities' death tolls included, by conservative estimates, at least 90,000 and 60,000 people. Wayne County, North Carolina, which includes Goldsboro, had a population of about 84,000 in 1961. The state capital, Raleigh, is 50 miles northwest of Goldsboro, and Fayetteville -- home of the Army's massive Fort Bragg -- is 60 miles southwest. The Goldsboro incident . The B-52 was flying over North Carolina on January 24, 1961, when it suffered a ""failure of the right wing,"" the report said. As the plane broke apart, the two bombs plummeted toward the ground. The parachute opened on one; it didn't on the other. ""The impact of the aircraft breakup initiated the fuzing sequence for both bombs,"" the summary of the documents said. In other words, both weapons came alarmingly close to detonating. Weapon 1, the bomb whose parachute opened, landed intact. Fortunately, the safing pins that provided power from a generator to the weapon had been yanked -- preventing it from going off. Weapon 2, the second bomb with the unopened parachute, landed in a free fall. The impact of the crash put it in the ""armed"" setting. Fortunately -- once again -- it damaged another part of the bomb needed to initiate an explosion. While it's unclear how frequently these types of accidents have occurred, the Defense Department has disclosed 32 accidents involving nuclear weapons between 1950 and 1980. There are at least 21 declassified accounts between 1950 and 1968 of aircraft-related incidents in which nuclear weapons were lost, accidentally dropped, jettisoned for safety reasons or on board planes that crashed. The accidents occurred in various U.S. states, Greenland, Spain, Morocco and England, and over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Another five accidents occurred when planes were taxiing or parked. Two months after the close call in Goldsboro, another B-52 was flying in the western United States when the cabin depressurized and the crew ejected, leaving the pilot to steer the bomber away from populated areas, according to a DOD document. The plane crashed in Yuba City, California, but safety devices prevented the two onboard nuclear weapons from detonating. Catastrophe averted . The Goldsboro incident was first detailed last year in the book ""Command and Control"" by Eric Schlosser. The documents released this week provided additional chilling details. Eight crew members were aboard the plane that night. Five survived the crash. ""I could see three or four other chutes against the glow of the wreckage,"" recounted the co-pilot, Maj. Richard Rardin, according to an account published by the University of North Carolina. ""I hit some trees. I had a fix on some lights and started walking."" The MK39 bombs weighed 10,000 pounds and their explosive yield was 3.8 megatons. Compare that to the bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki: They were 0.01 and 0.02 megatons. But Rardin didn't know then what a catastrophe had been avoided. ""My biggest difficulty getting back was the various and sundry dogs I encountered on the road.""

"(CNN) -- So much for a ""clean"" bill. The measure passed by Congress to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling also contains some goodies and gifts tucked into the 35-page bill. There's more money -- a lot more -- for a dam project on the Ohio River and millions of cash for Colorado flooding repair projects. And the wealthy widow of a late U.S. senator will receive a year's pay as a death benefit. You have to hand it to a Congress that finds no bill is off limits for pork. It's over for now . ""These people are like alcoholics. They can't resist taking a drink. It's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous,"" said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona to the Daily Beast, referring to the dam project. ""It shows that there are people in this body who are willing to use any occasion to get an outrageous pork-barrel project done at the cost of millions and millions of dollars. It's disgusting."" Here are five most surprising provisions to the bill: . 1. RIVER PROJECT . Kentucky kickback?: $2.2 billion. That's the amount in additional cash authorized for a project that involved a dam and decades-old locks on a river that flows through Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky. Sounds kinda fishy, but a Democratic senate aid and a Republican senator say it's on the level. The aide tells CNN that McConnell didn't push for the project to be included. And Sen. Lamar Alexander, who's a key figure on the committee that oversees what water projects get what money, says he and another senator asked for the cash. He tells CNN's Chris Frates the new money -- which more than triples the original $775 million -- will save the federal government many millions because contracts won't be canceled due to work stoppages. Still, the Senate Conservatives Fund calls the money a ""Kentucky Kickback."" What's open for business again . 2. FLOOD RECOVERY FUNDS . Bridge to somewhere: This one's a lot less controversial than the river project money. Congress OK'd $450 million for rebuilding projects in flood-struck areas of Colorado. That's well over the limit of $100 million for the Department of Transportation as allowed in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. Wednesday's authorization used similar language to a bill that died last month after the House declined to vote on it, according to Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado. He said Coloradans had been resilient, but they needed the money because ""it's time to let us get to work"" rebuilding roads and bridges wiped out by overflowing rivers. Nine things we missed during the shutdown . 3. LATE SENATOR'S WIDOW . For decades of service: Frank Lautenberg served in the Senate for almost 30 years. He died in June of viral pneumonia. This nation owed him a great deal. Congress has almost always approved a death benefit gift to the family equal to one year's salary, which they provided for Lautenberg's widow, Bonnie, in the bill. The thing is ... Lautenberg was one of the richest members of Congress and was worth more than $59 million as of 2011, according to The Hill. You can see why some people think it might not be a terrible thing to forgo $174,000 to the family. 4. OTHER WINNERS . Ssssh, we're getting a big check: There were more agencies that got big money in the bill. Agencies that fight wildfires could get as much as $636 million, depending on how bad it gets in the next year. The mine safety department is getting a bump in the fees it can keep, a $1 million increase to $2.49 million. A watchdog group meant to guard Americans' right to privacy against overreach by government cyberintelligence will get $3.1 million, which they could use considering the year they've had dealing with revelations about the super-secret National Security Agency's programs. The Hill, a political newspaper, reports that's double the top amount the five-member panel has been given before. 5. SAME PAY FOR CONGRESS . No raise this year: Down on page 20 of the bill, it says there will be no cost of living adjustment for members of Congress for the next year. Actually, it's not that surprising. Congressional pay has held steady for years. They last received a raise four years ago. And you thought you had it rough. Wait, you don't make $174,000 a year? Key points of the new debt deal .","Act includes billions for a project in the home state of one of the bill's negotiators .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has denied Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer's request for an expedited hearing on the state's controversial immigration law. Instead, the case has been scheduled for a hearing during the first week in November. Brewer had wanted public oral arguments in the case for mid-September. The Justice Department had urged a slower schedule, and the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals agreed in a brief order issued Friday evening. Arizona filed its appeal Thursday, asking the court to lift U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton's preliminary injunction on the immigration law. Bolton's ruling Wednesday temporarily blocked some of the most controversial provisions of the law, known as SB 1070, including the requirement that police officers check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Bolton also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime for people to fail to apply for or carry ""alien registration papers"" or ""for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for, or perform work,"" as well as a provision ""authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person"" if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation. The parts of the law that took effect Thursday include a ban on so-called ""sanctuary cities"" -- municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. The judge also allowed a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic. The parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also withstood the first legal test. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the ruling reflects the government's argument that immigration enforcement should be dealt with at the federal level. ""Arizona may have good intentions, they may be trying to make up for where the U.S. government has failed, but what the judge is saying is, this is not the way to do it,"" he said . As other states pass similar laws, Toobin said, the issue is ""very much destined for the Supreme Court."" State Sen. Russell Pearce, author of the law, said he foresaw a protracted legal fight from the beginning. ""I wrote it to go to the Supreme Court,"" he said before the ruling came down. ""I'm begging for that fistfight at the Supreme Court. We will win in a 5-4 decision and finally settle this problem."" He added, ""My message to the judge, is uphold the Constitution. Uphold states' rights. This is a battle of epic proportions. This is the states versus the central government.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The former secretary of state's most ardent supporters and organizers will meet Friday in New York City to discuss what now looks like an all-but-certain Hillary Clinton campaign for president. Ready for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super PAC that has been organizing around a Clinton run for almost two years, is hosting an all-day strategy session that will bring together the different groups that have been working around a Clinton run since shortly after she left the State Department in early 2013. The Ready for Hillary National Finance Council meeting -- which is being held at the Sheraton Times Square in New York City -- is part rally, part history lesson for the Clinton supporters and will bring together top flight Democratic strategists, longtime Clinton supporters and at least three people rumored to be the former secretary of state's next campaign manager. Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY's List; and Ace Smith, a political operative who worked for Clinton in 2008, have all been rumored as likely picks for Clinton's top campaign job. All three will sit on panels and discuss Clinton's future Friday. Ready for Hillary has been the most high profile pro-Clinton super PAC that sprung up to boost Clinton between her years at the State Department and her eventual presidential run. Founded in 2013, the group has been focused on garnering grassroots support, building a sizable list of supporters and raising money. The organization has worked somewhat like a ground and grassroots operations for Clinton, dispatching volunteers to different events and sending a campaign bus to drive across the country and rally support. Ready for Hillary has also started to grease the wheels of state and local politics. The group has sold or traded its email list with over 30 state parties and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to state parties and local campaigns. But Friday's meeting -- and an eventual Clinton announcement - are somewhat of a going away party for Ready for Hillary and its young, excited staffers. Multiple sources from the group told CNN that while Ready for Hillary will keep working until Clinton announces her candidacy, the group will wind down operations that day the former first lady announces. ""That is the point at which we would wind down because we are not going to have a separate and competing field and grass roots infrastructure across the country,"" said one source with knowledge of Ready for Hillary's plans. ""Rather than continuing our efforts across the country, we would tell our supporters, 'Hillary has a campaign, go join it.'"" The day Clinton announces, the group will also make their supporter list available to the Clinton campaign, allowing their operation to reach out and activate the supporters Ready for Hillary have cultivated across the country. As Ready for Hillary prepares to fade away, two other super PACs boosting Clinton are starting to ramp up. Priorities USA, the super PAC tasked with big money fundraising and ad buying, is in a place to step up the moment that Clinton declares her run. Although the group promised not to raise money for Clinton while other groups competed for donations around the 2014 midterms, organizers from Priorities have been meeting with big Democratic donors across the country and plan to contact those donors the instant Clinton announces. The group is currently ""sitting down and talking with donors"" but not ""making direct asks until there is a candidate in place,"" said a Priorities organizer. ""I think, once the sort of wheels are in motion, we will go back to the folks that we are meeting with and then there will be solid fundraising off that,"" the source said. ""Once things really start to ramp up, that is when we get the checks in the door."" Representatives from Priorities USA, including strategist Paul Begala, executive director Buffy Wicks and the group's financial adviser Jonathan Mantz, will speak at Friday's event. Correct the Record, a communications and research outfit that has been operating for over a year, is another pro-Clinton super PAC gearing up to run side-by-side with a Clinton campaign. According to a source with knowledge of the group's planning, Correct the Record plans on ramping up in the coming months and tapping into the research they have invested in for months. While the group will have a presence at the Ready for Hillary event -- founder David Brock will moderate a panel -- over three dozen Correct the Record donors will meet Friday in New York to discuss Clinton and the future. Brock, according to the source, will tell attendees that he has decided his group will continue through the 2016 election and will use their rapid response and research to push the message of the eventual Clinton campaign.","Leaders of pro-Hillary Clinton groups are meeting in New York City on Friday .

"London (CNN) -- Whatever U.S. and European leaders may say, it seems clear a majority of the residents of Crimea were only too happy to abandon Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. The referendum held there on Sunday was illegal according to Ukrainian constitutional law and took place under duress, following the large-scale incursion of ""pro-Russian forces"" -- and voters did not have the choice to say ""no"" to severing ties with Kiev. But these failings aside, it appears plain that most of Crimea's population, with the exception of the Tatar minority and some ethnic Ukrainians, was content to return to what it regards as its ancestral home. The crucial turnout figures of up to 83% are suspect and may well be inflated. But independent reporting of enthusiastic celebrations suggested the overall outcome genuinely reflected popular wishes -- and was crudely democratic. For this reason, it is unwise of U.S. President Barack Obama and his European counterparts to declare they will ""never"" recognize the Crimean result. This crisis erupted when anti-Russian opposition forces in Kiev overthrew the country's democratically-elected president, Viktor Yanukovych. This action, too, was illegal under Ukraine's constitutional law and had little support in Crimea. But it was swiftly endorsed by Washington and in European capitals. Now, faced by the pro-Russian opposition's rebound success in Crimea and a political result he does not like, Obama cries foul and refuses to accept the outcome. He cannot have it both ways. In his telephone conversation with Obama on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin quoted the ""Kosovo precedent,"" a reference to the recognition by the U.S. and several European states (but not Russia) of a 2008 declaration of independence by the provincial assembly in Pristina, even though Kosovo was then still a part of Serbia. The unrepentant Russian president's slightly disingenuous question to Obama was: So what's the difference? The right of self-determination of peoples is guaranteed under Chapter One of the U.N. Charter. In South Sudan (which became independent in 2011), in East Timor, in Croatia and Montenegro and various other Balkan states, the U.S. and its allies have upheld and encouraged this principle. A similar process is currently underway in Scotland. If Catalonia enjoyed a similar freedom, it would quite possibly part company with Spain. The answer given by Western governments when confronted with the ""Kosovo precedent"" is that each case is different and indeed, unique, and must therefore be treated on its separate merits. But this, too, is a slightly spurious argument, akin to the hypothesis which states that my invasion of a country (Iraq or Afghanistan, for example) is legally and morally justified, whereas your invasion is not. In pragmatic as well as theoretical terms, it is a mistake to make of the assisted, hurried but essentially voluntary secession of Crimea a major issue of principle on which there can ""never"" be compromise. It will obscure the bigger picture. The key challenge for Obama and the EU is not the fate of Crimea per se, but what its destabilising departure implies for the future of Ukraine as a whole and for the wider region. The sanctions and other punishments now being prepared for Russia in Washington and Brussels should pivot on what Moscow does or does not do next, most especially in the cities of eastern Ukraine where additional, large ethnic Russian populations live but so too do many non-Russian Ukrainians. This pre-emptive policy should also apply to Moldova (which has a breakaway, pro-Russian region known as Transnistria), to the Baltic states, and to Georgia, where Putin might be tempted to intrude again. Putin was left in a minority of one at the U.N. Security Council at the weekend because Chapter One of the U.N. Charter also states the following: ""All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."" Whether Putin has absolutely contravened this principle in Crimea may be open to debate. But eastern Ukraine, with its mixed populations, heritage and loyalties, is a different matter altogether -- which even China, which did not support Moscow at the U.N., understands. If an emboldened Putin now makes the mistake of thinking he can extend his modern-day form of rolling Anschluss into these areas, he must be knocked back very hard indeed. That means going much further, and acting much tougher, than the rather feeble travel and visa bans now being discussed will allow. An Iran-style sanctions regime blocking energy exports, investment, banking and other mainstream business and commercial activities such as arms sales would be more appropriate. So, too, would be direct U.S. and European military assistance to Kiev, as proposed by Senator John McCain. Judging by his behaviour in Chechnya and elsewhere since he first became Russia's prime minister in 1999, Putin is a bully with a massive inferiority complex who responds to strength, not weakness. When Obama stresses that diplomatic solutions can still be found, as he did on Sunday, Putin reads that as fear. You can almost hear the snigger. The only way to stop this strutting menace, if he continues to over-reach, is to frighten him right back -- and if necessary, help create the conditions inside Russia in which he and his ugly, reactionary regime are brought down.

"(CNN) -- The cassette tape is back! Or at least this is what the organizers of Cassette Store Day, held in September, would have us believe. Cassettes? Really? Let's play along, if only for nostalgia's sake. Fifty years after the prototype cassette was introduced at the 1963 Berlin Radio Show, a group of independent labels that release new cassettes have pulled together the global event celebrating and, they hope, stimulating the resurgence of prerecorded tapes. The day was observed, according to the group's website, at roughly 100 retail stores and music venues in the U.S., Europe, Canada and South America, with tie-ins, new cassette releases and live performers pushing new tapes. Cassette releases from established bands like At the Drive-In and Flaming Lips were vended, as well as tapes from underground artists like Grape Soda and Gold Bears on the Hope for the Tape Deck label. Anyone who remembers fumbling with a cassette deck while driving or listening as a tape unspooled and self-destructed in the tape deck or having to insert index finger or pen into the cassette in a usually vain attempt to rewind the hopelessly twisted tape must be asking a simple question: Why? In the seamless age of digital music, when seemingly every song ever recorded is available at the stroke of a few computer keys, why would anyone revive such a clunky and outmoded physical format? But consider: Even with the convenience and sheer abundance of music stored on MP3 files, cassettes (and vinyl) offer tangible and tactile pleasures that aren't readily available in the digital world. There's a sizable, and growing, subset of consumers who lust for musical objects that they can hold in their hands (and their hearts) as well as their ears. ""Metal and punk and noise people never stopped releasing cassettes,"" says Scott Seward. He is a music critic and owner of John Doe Jr. Used Records and Books in Greenfield, Massachusetts. ""Fans of that music have always collected tapes. Same with jam band and Grateful Dead fans until recent years. It's still a common format for a lot of Middle Eastern, Indian and Asian street or folk music too, because cassettes are so cheap to reproduce."" It's true. Cassettes have always been an alternative and were for many years something of an underdog in the musical format wars. Not long after prerecorded cassettes emerged in the vinyl-dominated marketplace, the 8-track tape format eclipsed them in popularity. That was largely because the Ford Motor Co. started offering 8-track players as an option on some of its cars beginning in 1966. The automobile would power sales of the 8-track format past the cassette in the music-mad '60s and '70s. Drivers could insert and remove the bulky 8-tracks with one hand. By 1975, incredibly, 8-track tapes were second only to vinyl records in terms of sales figures. Cassettes had already been a tough sell to audiophiles because until the advent of Dolby noise reduction in the '70s, their sound quality was muffled compared with vinyl records. Gradually that improved, just as new tape playback options emerged. Even before the Walkman, the portable stereos known as boom boxes boosted the popularity of cassettes in the urban areas where these hulking radio/tape players (aka ghetto blasters) were most often used. Boom boxes made music consumption a public event (often whether the public wanted it or not) while advancing the notion of portability. But consumers began to demand portable music players. In late 1979, Sony introduced the proto-Walkman. Retailing for $199, the Soundabout was a 14-ounce playback-only device that came with headphones and used standard-size cassettes. By 1981, the smaller and cheaper Walkman II was available. Hello, 80s? We miss you! When it comes to recorded music formats, portable equals personal. So it's no accident that the Walkman and similar devices became known as personal stereos in the early '80s. Soon, Walkman headphones were as ubiquitous as boom boxes on city streets. Thanks to the Walkman, the boom box and the cassette (and later the CD), sales of vinyl records plummeted during the '80s. In 1981, more than twice as many vinyl records as prerecorded cassettes were sold. By 1984, the numbers had flipped, and cassette sales outpaced vinyl for the first time. Despite the unsuccessful ""Home Taping Is Killing Music"" campaign of the early '80s, the ability to record one's own tapes was always a huge part of the cassette's appeal. Homemade mix tapes became a cultural touchstone for a generation (or two), functioning as diaries or journals and figuring in courtship rituals (see Rob Sheffield's affecting memoir ""Love Is A Mix Tape""). When cassettes faded from the scene in the early '90s in the conquering wake of the CD, something unique -- personal -- got left behind. Gone, perhaps, but not forgotten. The pull of nostalgia is not the only motivation behind the recent cassette cult resurgence, but memories and recorded music are deeply -- some say neurologically -- intertwined. ""There is that True Cult aspect,"" Seward says. ""It's an exclusivity thing. Cassettes just seem like a cooler thing to have for sale at your punk or noise show than a CDR. Black metal and power electronics sound fab on tape, though. Same with Miami bass music. I still listen to a lot of metal and rap on tape, and I make mix tapes from vinyl that sound amazing."" Even if Cassette Store Day fails to bring prerecorded cassettes back to commercial prominence, the event made a telling point about our music consumption. Despite the digital revolution, if you dust off those outmoded physical formats like cassette tapes and vinyl records down in the basement, they produce more than memories: They play music. They still work. Their appeal, however sentimental, is stronger than mere nostalgia. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Coleman.","Mark Coleman: September brought Cassette Store Day. Why celebrate this? Let's play along .

"(CNN) -- The score was tied at 53. The game was in overtime. The mood, electric. Number 35 came charging up to the net and hit a last moment winning layup for his undefeated Fennville High School Blackhawks to end the season Thursday night with a perfect 20 games. The other players hoisted their star, 16-year-old Wes Leonard, on their shoulders. The screaming crowd charged the court to hug him. It was the biggest moment in memory for the tiny Michigan town of Fennville. And then it all turned to black. Silence fell under the harsh glare of the florescent lights. Leonard lay still on the court, pale in his school colors. His family and coaches surrounded him. He wasn't breathing, his friend Arista Sauceda recalled. His heart had stopped cold. After attempts to revive the varsity player in the gym, an ambulance transported him to nearby Holland Hospital. Doctors worked on him for an hour and 20 minutes. They could not save him. By 10:40 at night, when Leonard should have been out celebrating with his classmates, he was dead. It's hoped an autopsy will determine the cause of death, said Tim Breed, hospital spokesman and a 1977 graduate of Fennville High School. As news of Leonard's death spread, a small community on the banks of Lake Michigan convulsed in shock. A moment of enormous school pride was reduced to irrelevance, a moment of joy turned into the opposite. A Facebook memorial page -- R.I.P. Wes Leonard -- created Friday, quickly filled with thoughts and prayers. ""Blackhawk Down,"" the page said. Sauceda described Leonard as an affable guy, popular for his smile and jokes. He excelled in athletics scoring 1,000 career basketball points and playing quarterback for the school's football team. She said Leonard's family moved to Fennville when he was in middle school. His mother, Jocelyn Leonard, teaches music and is the drama director at Fennville and Sauceda said the family had helped bring the school community together. Jocelyn Leonard canceled Thursday night's performance of ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying,"" because she wanted to watch her son play in the game, reported CNN affiliate WOOD. It was make-up game to compensate for blizzard-canceled events last month. Everyone had so looked forward to Saturday's game -- not only was it the last of an undefeated season, but it pitted Fennville against Bridgman, a school that beat them by just one point last year. It was a revenge game, as Sauceda put it. Sauceda had screamed her lungs out during the game. She was running towards Leonard to hug him when he went down. Breed, the hospital spokesman, was also at the game. He doesn't normally attend games, but thought he could not miss his alma mater's perfect season closer. When Leonard collapsed, the crowds were asked to leave the gym. Breed was on his way home when he was paged by a local newspaper reporter. He rushed to the hospital to find medical teams trying to resuscitate Leonard. Shortly after that, a text message appeared on Sauceda's phone from a friend at the hospital. Sauceda was about to go to sleep. Instead, she was jolted awake, the shock so severe she wasn't even able to immediately cry. In the morning, she stayed home from school. And wrote on Facebook: . ""Wes, you were taken from our lives too soon ... you were the most amazing friend, I will never forget you, and how you have changed us all, I am so thankful to have been apart of your life. Please watch over us, and cheer us on as our boys win state! RIP # 35 WES LEONARD.""","Wes Leonard was a star athlete and a popular student .

"New York (CNN) -- On the second page of the executive summary of the 9/11 commission report is a line we should all remember: ""[T]he 9/11 attacks were a shock but they should not have been a surprise. Islamist extremists had given plenty of warning that they meant to kill Americans indiscriminately and in large numbers."" Christmas Day could easily have gone into history as another day nearly as infamous as Pearl Harbor day or 9/11. The United States was attacked, allegedly by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who got past whatever security precautions might have stopped him from boarding Northwest Flight 253 for Detroit, Michigan. If the attack had been successful, 279 passengers and 11 crew members would probably be dead, and we wouldn't be discussing Democrats hiding behind closed doors to wrap up a health care bill. Thankfully no one was killed, and the threat was stopped by the incompetence of the would-be bomber, not the competence of our security apparatus. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said immediately after the incident that ""the system worked,"" intending to refer to what happened after the failed bombing. But people took it as a defense of the overall system, and she had to spend time clarifying her comment afterward. Clearly the system didn't work. Her boss, the president, made that plain in his comments Tuesday: ""The bottom line is this: The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack, but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots which would have placed the suspect on the no-fly list,"" Obama said. And now we find out our most important ally, Britain, also had sufficient intelligence and had warned us in advance about AbdulMutallab. Pre-9/11, our guard was down. Airport security was a joke, and our national intelligence apparatus was a bunch of fiefdoms that didn't want to cooperate and wouldn't share information with each other. In the aftermath of that great American tragedy, 9/11, the system was supposed to be fixed. The Department of Homeland Security was created and all intelligence was put under one entity, headed by the director of national intelligence. But the failures outlined Tuesday are the same failures that caused 9/11. Why have we as Americans spent billions of dollars, inconvenienced our lives, and lost many of our own freedoms? And in spite of the fortunate outcome in Detroit, is this next decade going to be one in which Americans lose more freedoms? Or is it going to be one in which we say, ""Stop! I am not going to be intimidated."" I know we live in a dangerous time, but are we letting the other side win by letting our way of life be taken away from us by being overly cautious and maybe even overprotected? How come every time a system breaks down, we citizens are made to endure more? Even before  the president and his homeland security secretary issue their new travel guidelines, I know more of my personal freedoms are going to be eroded. As someone who has traveled extensively, I now look at going to an airport with the same dread I felt as a kid going to the dentist. I know it is going to be a painful experience. If I thought for one moment the TSA teams (50,000 plus strong) at the airport, who treat me as a potential terrorist, could actually catch a real terrorist, I might be a more willing victim of their harassment. I now have to be searched, my computer and Kindle stacked separately, shoes off (thanks to Richard Reid, another incompetent bomber), belt, wallet, watch and whatever else taken out, and have my ticket and ID checked every 10 feet even though I am in their secure space. Now my underwear is to be viewed as a secret weapon. How does a man on a watch list, whose very own father turns him in as a potential  terrorist, plunk down $3,000 in cash and get on a plane anywhere? We as taxpayers are now spending billions on airport security and other intelligence to keep us safe. My challenge is: Get what you need, but get it right!  No more excuses. When I worked in the White House, I was told it was the big leagues. Zero defects was the rule. It was like the National Football League and you had to perform at the very top level or you were gone. We have just finished the regular season of the National Football League and there are some lessons to be learned from that sport. Perform and you survive. Don't perform and you are fired. Eight years after 9/11, the system failed. Mr. President, follow the example of your neighbor, the unpopular Redskins owner Dan Snyder, and hold someone accountable. Snyder fired his general manager and his football coach for a failed season. You need to fire someone for the security failures. This is the second big-time security failure this year -- the White House gate crashers and now the Detroit bomber. The two agencies that have failed security big-time are the Secret Service and TSA. The person in charge of both agencies is Janet Napolitano.  Fire her and convince us that standing in long lines at airports is worth the price. Getting mad is not enough, Mr. President. We're mad too. But you can do something about it! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Before 9/11, airport security was a joke and agencies feuded, Ed Rollins says .

"(CNN) -- Country star Ty Herndon has something to share: He's an ""out, proud and happy gay man."" Herndon, 52, came out publicly as gay in an interview with People magazine. He says he's known he was gay since he was a child and started coming out to family members in his 20s. But the ""What Mattered Most"" singer, who had a number of hits in the 1990s, kept the news close to the vest. It wasn't until he attended a Tony Robbins seminar in 2009 that he decided to become more public, he told the magazine. ""I realized I had an incredible story that could possibly help someone's son or daughter or grandchild's life not be as difficult as mine has been,"" he said. ""Maybe they wouldn't have to go through as much pain and suffering. It's time to tell my truth."" The country music world hasn't always been the friendliest to LGBTQ people, but Herndon sees signs that's changing. Singer Chely Wright came out in 2010 and the open-minded Kacey Musgraves has a song titled ""Follow Your Arrow"" that was just named CMA song of the year. ""I felt so proud of my city,"" he said. ""I hope that trend continues; I pray it does."" Herndon has been in a relationship with his partner for six years. He doesn't expect his life to change radically now that he's made his announcement.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi police and soldiers on Saturday launched major raids in a once-notorious insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad. Saturday's raids in Falluja by Iraqi forces were similar to U.S.-led sweeps in the city in 2004, shown here. A police official in the Anbar province city of Falluja told CNN that a large number of security forces were scouring its Sinaie district for an array of weapons -- machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. The Sinaie area, in Falluja's southeastern section, is an industrial district with factories, scrap yards and large, abandoned yards. The area used to be a stronghold of the insurgency in Falluja until the militants were driven out in major military operations five years ago. At that time, the U.S.-led offensive was largely in response to the brutal ambush, killing and mutilation of four U.S. security contractors. Their charred bodies were left dangling from a bridge over the Euphrates River in spring 2004. In November of that year, U.S. and Iraqi forces attacked insurgents in Falluja, killing about 1,200 militants. Eight Iraqi soldiers and 51 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, died in urban combat, according to the Pentagon. About 95 percent of Falluja's population was displaced. Falluja is about 37 miles, or 60 kilometers, west of Baghdad . After the city was pacified, the United States committed more than $200 million to reconstruction projects there, and changes became evident. Small cafes and grocery stores lined the streets once dusty and abandoned. Iraqis in Falluja got back to the rhythms of everyday life: They worked, shopped -- and rebuilt. As fragile security gains took root, American military officials marveled at the resurgent city of several hundred thousand. On Saturday, a police official denied reports that armed groups were trying to re-establish a foothold in the area. The U.S. military said Marines and police in the nearby town of Karma were also participating in a combined cache sweep. Violence has dropped in Iraq, and President Obama's administration has been gearing up to withdraw U.S. troops. The U.S. military continues to be on guard for flare-ups in violence and insurgent activity. The vast and predominantly Sunni Arab Anbar province was a battleground between the U.S. military and al Qaeda in Iraq during the earlier years of the Iraq war. But the insurgents eventually lost ground when a grass-roots movement called ""the awakening"" emerged. The tribe-based awakening forces rejected al Qaeda in Iraq and turned their allegiances toward the U.S. and Iraqi government. While the awakening doesn't have clout in Falluja, there are pockets of support just outside the city, as well as in the rest of the province. Al Qaeda in Iraq's strongest presence in the country is now in the Mosul area, in Nineveh province, north of Baghdad.","Iraqi police official says security forces were scouring Sinaie district of Falluja .

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- When I was in law school, my criminal law professor introduced us to the crime of rape by reading us a quote from Lord Chief Justice Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century English jurist: ""In a rape case it is the victim, not the defendant, who is on trial."" It was not merely a history lesson. I had lived it. While a student in my final year of college, at age 21, I was raped. I have dissected that moment -- the horrifying moment that I became a ""victim"" -- from every possible angle. I have poked and prodded, examined and re-examined. Regrettably, I have even suspected myself in a desperate, ultimately futile attempt to understand how I became a victim. But blaming myself was neither my idea nor my first inclination. I thought such 17th-century notions were long dead. I was wrong. People who did not even know me were quick to comment or speculate on my rape. What were you wearing? Did you scream loudly? Did this occur in public? 'Legitimate rape' reaction, from the Congo to black crickets . As my history lesson said, I found myself on trial, facing the most fierce judge and jury: ignorance. Eight years after my rape, I find myself on trial against ignorance again. Rep. Todd Akin's recent comments that ""legitimate rape"" rarely results in pregnancy not only flout scientific fact but, for me, cut deeper. Akin has de-legitimized my rape. You see, nine months after my rape, I gave birth to a beautiful little girl. You could say she was conceived in rape; she was. But she is also so much more than her beginnings. I blissfully believed that after I finally had decided to give birth to and to raise my daughter, life would be all roses and endless days at the playground. I was wrong again. It would not be long before I would learn firsthand that in the vast majority of states -- 31 -- men who father through rape are able to assert the same custody and visitation rights to their children that other fathers enjoy. When no law prohibits a rapist from exercising these rights, a woman may feel forced to bargain away her legal rights to a criminal trial in exchange for the rapist dropping the bid to have access to her child. Opinion: Wake up, it's not just Akin . When faced with the choice between a lifetime tethered to her rapist or meaningful legal redress, the answer may be easy, but it is not painless. For the sake of her child, the woman will sacrifice her need to see her once immensely powerful perpetrator humbled by the court. I know it because I lived it. I went to law school to learn how to stop it. Having fought this injustice for the past several years, I have come to believe that ignorance is to blame for this legal absence. Opponents argue no woman would ever choose to raise the child she conceived through rape. The only two studies to analyze the choices made by pregnant raped women indicate otherwise -- at least 30% of women who conceive by rape make this choice. Others argue that no rapist would ever seek parental rights. Not only does my experience and that of others I know prove otherwise, but it is not surprising that a man who cruelly degrades a woman would also seek to torture her in an even more agonizing way, by seeking access to her child. Today, it seems we may face a new and unbelievable challenge: convincing legislators that women can conceive when they are raped. iReport: 'Rape is rape' Make no mistake, my efforts and the efforts of others to persuade legislators to pass laws restricting the parental rights of men who father through rape will be directly impacted by Akin's recent comments. Whether these efforts will be helped or hurt, however, depends upon us as a society. Either we will fight ignorance and take steps to legislate for raped women based upon reason and facts, or we will be led by ignorance and continue to make bad laws. Or fail to make good ones. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shauna Prewitt.","Shauna Prewitt had a baby conceived in a rape and faced another unexpected ordeal .

"(CNN) -- Approximately 44 million people live with dementia worldwide, according to the Alzheimer's Association. By 2050, that number is expected to more than triple to 115 million. In the fight against these fast-growing numbers, experts from all over the world discussed the latest research at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, this week. Here are five things we learned about Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia: . Hypertension in old age may save your brain . High blood pressure is usually called the ""silent killer."" However, a new study from the University of California now suggests that if you're over 90, hypertension can save the life of your brain cells. Hypertension may protect against dementia in people over age 90, the study authors say. The researchers followed 625 participants who developed high blood pressure in their 90s for up to 10 years and found that their risk for dementia was 55% lower than people without a history of hypertension. Nevertheless, the study doesn't promote hypertension in the elderly, given that high blood pressure is related to other bad outcomes. ""I don't think it says if I find somebody who's doing well at age 90, whose blood pressure is 120/80, we should feed them salt to bump their blood pressure up,"" says William Klunk, vice chair of the Alzheimer's Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council. The study simply shows that when it comes to normal levels of blood pressure, it might not be a one-size-fits-all with respect to age, he says. Better late than never . Seniors can lower their risk for late-life cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease with a number of lifestyle changes, new research suggests. A two-year clinical trial from Karolinska Institutet and the Finnish Institute for Health included 1,260 participants aged 60 to 77. One part of the group received a ""lifestyle-package,"" including nutritional guidance, physical exercise, management of heart health risk factors, cognitive training and social activities. The control group received standard health advice. After two years, the lifestyle-intervention group did much better in tests of memory and thinking. We know from past studies that implementing those lifestyle factors in midlife can hedge against Alzheimer's disease later on, says Ralph Nixon, chairman of the Alzheimer's Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council. ""The good news from this particular study is that these kind of changes can be implemented in your 60s and 70s."" Playing games makes your brain bigger . Middle-aged people who were avid game-players (think crosswords, checkers, cards) tended to have bigger brains than people who did not play games, according to a recent study that looked at brain scans. ""It's like looking at someone's muscle mass,"" said Dr. Laurel Coleman of the Maine Medical Center Geriatric Assessment Center. ""It's bad when it's smaller, good when it's bigger."" Researchers looked specifically at certain parts of participants' brains. The volume among game-players was greater in areas that tend to be damaged by Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the potential for delaying -- maybe even avoiding -- the disease. People who kept their brains pumped scored higher on tests of their thinking ability. Coleman suggests mixing it up: Try potentially stimulating activities like learning a new language or switching from reading nonfiction to fiction -- anything that poses a cognitive challenge. Exercise benefits the mind too . Exercise seems to slow the descent toward dementia as well. Two sets of data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging suggest that exercise may positively influence how mild cognitive impairment (a precursor to dementia) and dementia develop. In one group of patients with mild cognitive impairment, exercising seemed to protect against developing dementia. Data on a different group of healthy patients who exercised -- either lightly or vigorously -- showed they were less likely to be diagnosed with cognitive impairment. ""We would never say that these things totally prevent Alzheimer's, that they will cure you,"" said Coleman, a geriatrician. ""But they're going to help your brain."" A smell test may detect Alzheimer's . In the future, a test of your sense of smell may help doctors predict your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In two separate studies, scientists found that people who were unable to identify certain odors were more likely to experience cognitive impairment. The researchers believe that brain cells crucial to a person's sense of smell are killed in the early stages of dementia. Researchers say this information could help doctors create a smell test to detect Alzheimer's earlier. Early detection means early intervention and treatment to slow the progression of the disease. Doctors today can only diagnose Alzheimer's disease once it has caused significant brain damage. ""In the face of the growing worldwide Alzheimer's disease epidemic, there is a pressing need for simple, less invasive diagnostic tests that will identify the risk of Alzheimer's much earlier in the disease process,"" Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer's Association, said in a statement. Blood test predicts Alzheimer's disease . 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . CNN's Jacque Wilson and Stephanie Smith contributed to this story.","NEW: High blood pressure that starts after age 90 linked to lower risk of dementia .
NEW: Lifestyle changes, even if started in 60s or 70s, can lower Alzheimer's risk .

"(CNN) -- Before dropping off his son at Colgate University a few days ago to begin his freshman year, New York advertising photographer Robert Tardio went on one last summer vacation with his family. While his wife and youngest son were out exploring the quaint streets of Montreal, Robert took his eldest, college-bound teen out for a beer. ""My son is an incredible, conscientious young man. But at 14, 15, 16 -- alcohol was out of the question. We made it very clear what our expectations were and that he would not be drinking."" The rules shifted for Tardio's son Ames when he turned 18. Now, a beer here or there was no longer out of the question. Labor Day by the numbers . ""In our minds, he became somewhat of an adult, and we were willing to set new limits. He understood that if he was going to have a drink he had to be responsible and in control at all times. We also had many discussions with him about the consequences of his actions if he wasn't under control."" So the Tardios did what many parents across the country do: They made up their own rules, inside their own home, when it came to alcohol consumption and their underage children. As a mother of a 10-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son, I've often wondered if it's OK to give my children a sip of wine at dinner. Would I be sending an irresponsible message, or demystifying alcohol and thereby weakening its allure later on? U.S. government agencies insist no amount of underage drinking is acceptable. ""If parents have a liberal idea about alcohol, kids may get the wrong message,"" says Dr. Vivian Faden, director of the Office of Science Policy and Communications at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health. ""Underage drinking can lead to injuries, fatal car accidents, risky sexual behavior, and there's also potential risk to the developing brain."" What are your Labor Day plans? According to the NIAAA, every year nearly 2,000 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related injuries. The question parents often wrestle with is whether they can help their children make better decisions about drinking on campus if they allow experimentation at home before they leave for college. Tamar Abrams, a senior communications manager at a global development firm in Virginia, says she never allowed her daughter to drink when she was in high school. ""The line for me was what was legal versus what was illegal. It seemed like a slippery slope to bend the rules, and I was not going to break the law."" Her daughter is currently a rising sophomore at Drexel University and hasn't had any alcohol-related problems. Dr. Westley Clark, director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, would agree with Abrams' approach. ""Statistics show children who start drinking at a younger age have more problems later on. We also know that, particularly for males under 21, they are still developing what we call executive function -- meaning, how they make decisions and how they deal with risk. At 21, the brain is simply more mature and the ability to control impulses is much stronger. The legal age is 21. The message to parents is to buy time and delay the onset of any consumption."" At Yale University's School of Medicine, Meghan Morean, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry, has been studying substance abuse in adolescence and early adulthood for nearly a decade. While she agrees with Clark that early drinking is associated with ""heavier drinking as children age,"" Morean says what could be a key in helping children avoid alcohol-related trouble is often the willingness of their parents to talk. ""The piece of the puzzle that's likely missing is arming underage drinkers with real, concrete information. It's too easy to say 'Don't drink and drive,' and that's generally where parents stop talking. Instead, they should be quizzing their kids to see if they really understand how many drinks it takes to get drunk. Do they know what binge drinking really is and what it looks like? These are the type of questions that need to be talked about openly and honestly."" Underage drinking: Talking to your teen about alcohol . Having those kinds of candid conversations is something the Tardios made sure to do with Ames before -- and after -- they offered him his first beer at home. And it's the reason that, when they said goodbye to him at Colgate -- the same campus where the couple met 34 years earlier -- they drove off with perhaps less anxiety about alcohol than many parents of college freshmen are feeling right now. ""We've built a trusting relationship with our son and we know he'll make the right decisions without us watching over him,"" reflects Tardio. ""We've allowed him to play a little with alcohol at home and we're not worried that suddenly, without our supervision, he'll make the wrong decisions. We've always had high expectations about his behavior and that hasn't stopped now that he's in college."" Do you let your kids have a drink on special occasions? Were you raised in a household where a sip of wine with dinner was normal?

"Denver (CNN) -- Iraq war veteran Sean Azzariti described his purchase of recreational marijuana -- legally -- as a historic moment Wednesday. ""It's huge,"" he said at a marijuana store along a light industrial corridor outside downtown Denver. ""It hasn't even sunk in how big this is yet."" Indeed, before the 3D Cannabis Center opened at 8 a.m. MT, more than 100 people were waiting in snowfall and cold under gray skies to be the next buyers of recreational pot under a landmark law voters approved in 2012. The dispensary was one of a handful that opened to lines of waiting people on New Year's Day, with scores more expected statewide in coming months. Do you smoke pot? Tell us about it . Azzariti was selected to be the first buyer at the 3D Cannabis Center because he was a Marine from 2000 to 2006 who now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder after two tours in Iraq. He can't obtain medical marijuana in Colorado because PTSD isn't a qualifying condition for that treatment, he said. ""This is what we worked so hard for the last few years,"" he said of the voter-approved constitutional amendment that led Colorado to become the first state in the nation to open recreational pot stores to anyone age 21 and older. ""It's mind-blowing."" Azzariti, 32, bought an eighth of an ounce of pot, plus chocolate truffles laced with marijuana. Those treats are called ""edibles"" at the store. The price: $59.50. The marijuana alleviates the anxiety and stress that come from PTSD, he said, adding that he'll smoke the pot Wednesday evening. At several recreational weed stores, buyers waited in line for three or four hours to be a part of opening-day history. Despite the hundreds of people queuing on public sidewalks, no significant problems emerged Wednesday, Denver officials said. ""I want to thank the businesses and consumers alike for acting responsibly and with great accountability today,"" Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock said in a statement. ""Denver is a progressive city, a vibrant city, and it's incumbent on all of us to continue getting this right."" Long lines . Even three hours after the stores opened, one downtown Denver dispensary had a line of about 100 people outside the front door to the corner. The snow had stopped falling by then, and the gray skies were clearing to blue. While patrons -- young and the old, men and women -- waited patiently in line, the demographic at the downtown dispensary tilted more toward 20- and 30-somethings. When many buyers emerged from the store and nudged through the line, they raised their bags of newly purchased pot above their heads. People waiting on the sidewalk cheered them. Even though recreational weed is now legal, some purchasers declined to disclose their last names. One woman, Dee, who didn't want to use her surname, said she waited in line for almost three hours to buy her cannabis. She and a male companion bought a small amount, she said, just to commemorate the occasion. ""We voted for it, and now it's here,"" Dee said of the recreational marijuana law. ""We just went in and celebrated the new law. It's a new day."" She didn't mind the long wait at the LoDo's Dispensary. ""Everybody is cool and mellow and nice. So it's all good,"" she said. Some motorists passing the pot shop honked and cheered the queue of buyers, who whooped in return. One motorist, however, shouted a disparaging remark about the ""potheads,"" and the crowd muttered raspberries in response. Buyers whiled away the hours in line by talking aloud about the benefits of marijuana as a remedy for hangovers, headaches, sleeplessness and low appetite. Then a young woman in a passing SUV slowed and interrupted them by asking, ""What's going on, guys?"" ""Legal pot sale!"" a man in line shouted. ""Oh, I need an eighth!"" the young woman shouted back excitedly. The car drove on. In fact, around 11:30 a.m. MT, Don Andrews, whose family owns and runs the dispensary, announced to the waiting people on the sidewalk that he was being forced to limit sales to an eighth of an ounce to each person, though under the new state law, a resident can buy up to an ounce. The dispensary will close at 7 p.m. MT, but Andrews said he may have to start turning people away at 4 p.m. The line had gone out the front door, down the street and around the corner by 2 p.m. MT, when more than 400 people had made purchases. In all, Andrews counted buyers from several states and countries. Buyers showed IDs from Vermont, Arizona, Georgia, Oregon, Wyoming, Louisiana -- and even Alaska and Hawaii. Other prospective weed buyers came from Canada, Australia and Italy, though the Italian man, 21, walked away because he had to catch a bus for his tour of America. South of downtown, the Evergreen Apothecary was encountering the same phenomenon: 700 people in line took numbers, but employees said they might not be able to serve all of them by the close of business. The atmosphere at the dispensaries was clearly celebratory and cheerful. For example, about 10 miles outside of downtown, one man said he had waited in the snow since 2:30 a.m. for the Medicine Man dispensary to open at 8 a.m. When asked how he felt after making the first sale there, he responded: ""I'll feel better in an hour."" Applauding, criticizing the new law . Even before the weed went on sale, enthusiasts were anticipating the end of an era. ""Prohibition is over,"" blared a flier for New Year's Eve festivities at Casselman's Bar in Denver. ""Celebrate Cannabis freedom in style."" As many as 30 stores throughout Colorado will sell recreational weed. Of the estimated 30 stores, 18 are in Denver. ""With Washington state next to implement marijuana legalization and other states strongly considering enacting similar laws, we believe this marks the beginning of the end of the nation's decades-long war on marijuana and its harmful human and fiscal toll,"" Ezekiel Edwards, a director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a prepared statement. But not everyone was applauding. ""Legalization -- with all of the American-style promotion that will accompany it -- is the last thing people in recovery, parents, communities -- and even our nation -- need right now,"" Smart Approaches to Marijuana said on its website. A total of 136 stores received state licenses last week, but most apparently had not obtained approval yet from their local governments to open on January 1. In 2012, Colorado voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana, as did voters in Washington state. But Colorado is the first to have the pot shops up and running under regulations recently established by state and local governments. Colorado voters' approval in effect amended the state's constitution to allow for the retail sale of recreational pot. The state already allows medical marijuana. Limits to marijuana consumption . Not all of the state is participating in the new law. A community can decide not to allow the shops, and in fact, most of the state geographically hasn't, including communities such as Greeley and Colorado Springs. Proponents of the new law were dealt a setback last week when Denver and state officials threatened to shut down a private party at a dance club scheduled for January 1 celebrating the end of the prohibition against cannabis -- an event billed as ""Cannabition."" The organizers canceled the party because officials said it would violate a Denver ordinance prohibiting the public consumption of marijuana. Cannabis can only be smoked on private property with the owner's permission. Under the new state law, residents are now able to buy marijuana like alcohol. The cannabis purchase is limited to an ounce, which is substantial enough to cost about $200 or more. People from out of state can buy up to a quarter-ounce. In a vivid example of how recreational pot is a new reality for the state, Denver officials posted public signs in the tourist-populated corridor known as the 16th Street Mall. The street signs read, ""Know the Law about Marijuana Use in Denver."" ""You must be 21 or older to have or use retail marijuana,"" says one bulletin on the sign. But further below it, the sign warns readers that ""it is illegal to use, display or transfer marijuana on the 16th Street Mall."" One of Colorado's main media outlets, The Denver Post, has even devoted a website to the history-making moment and its ongoing impact. ""The culture of cannabis, that's what we're here to talk about,"" says the newspaper's ""The Cannabist"" page. ""As marijuana's coming-out continues, we'll report journalistically from our homebase in Denver, Colo. -- the site of recreational marijuana's first legal sale in the modern world on Jan. 1, 2014."" This week, Denver International Airport authorities banned all marijuana on the airport grounds. Medical marijuana had been legal to bring to the airport as long as it didn't go through security checkpoints, said airport spokeswoman Stacey Stegman. But a total ban was implemented to avoid confusion as the recreational pot law rolls out, she said. Officials are concerned that a large influx of people may take marijuana to the airport and transport it across state lines. So if a visitor brings marijuana to the airport and leaves it in the car to pick up a relative at the terminal, that visitor will be breaking the law and could face a fine of up to $999, Stegman said. Colorado becomes the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale. Pot is the third most popular recreational drug in America, after alcohol and tobacco, according to the marijuana reform group NORML.

"(CNN) -- Several diplomatic facilities were shuttered Friday as many braced for intensified protests over the anti-Islam movie ""Innocence of Muslims,"" as well as recently published cartoons in a French publication of a figure resembling the Prophet Mohammed. Demonstrations have raged for days as many in the Muslim world are angry about the U.S.-made film that mocks Mohammed and about the French cartoon. And some believe that Friday prayers, a time of protest recently in the Middle East and North Africa, could add fuel to the fire. Demonstrations started early Friday in Pakistan. Developments include: . U.S. officials appear less certain of events ahead of Libya attack . Protesters set blaze in Pakistan . Protesters against the film and the cartoon in Peshawar, Pakistan, set fire to two movie theaters Friday morning, killing one person and injuring dozens, officials said. Firefighters extinguished one blaze in about 90 minutes but were not able to get to the other fire, said Nadir Shah, a fire brigade official. ""We were informed by the police that the two cinemas had been set ablaze by rioters, and so we responded immediately,"" Shah said. At least 25 people were injured, three of them critically, said Majid Qureshi, a doctor at a local hospital. A member of the media was also shot in killed in the protest, Qureshi said. Peshawar police said four policemen were also injured. Crowds of protesters were reported in Islamabad, and CNN affiliate Geo TV reported protests in Rawalpindi and Karachi. Slain ambassador Stevens worried about security threats in Libya . Children chant 'Death to America' The protests come a day after about 100 small children in Karachi repeated anti-American slogans during a protest in the coastal Pakistani city, a police official said. Video showed children repeating an adult voice that said ""Death to America"" and ""Any friend of America is a traitor."" ""Punish the blasphemer,"" children chanted Thursday. One placard read, ""Shut down website of blasphemous film."" The film reference is to ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which mocks Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. A 14-minute trailer for the movie was first posted online in July, though it wasn't until this month that it was recognized globally. Since September 11, Muslims have staged a wave of protests in more than 20 countries, decrying the film and the nation in which it was privately produced, the United States. The children in Karachi -- seemingly between the ages of 6 and 8 -- demonstrated across from the Karachi Press Club, said Ghulam Qadir, a city police official charged with keeping track of all demonstrations at the club. The event was not formal or planned, so authorities didn't know ahead of time it would happen, he said. In general, Pakistani parents are not informed about every event organized by a school. At least four teachers accompanied the children to the demonstration, Qadir said. There did not appear to be any parents there. Facilities close in Indonesia . The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, U.S. Consulate General in Surabaya, U.S. Consular Agency in Bali and two other facilities will be closed Friday because of the ""potential for significant demonstrations that might be held in front of these facilities."" officials said in a news statement. There were protests in Indonesia last week. About 100 demonstrators gathered last Tuesday near a U.S. diplomatic facility in Medan, Indonesia, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta said. Opinion: Protests are as mindless as anti-Islam film . German Embassy to close in Sudan . The German Embassy in Sudan's capital city of Khartoum will be closed Friday as authorities anticipate protests over the cartoon published in French magazine Charlie Hebdo, state-run Ashorooq TV reported. ""Security measures have been tightened at other diplomatic missions abroad,"" Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said. Tunisian authorities ban all demonstrations Friday . Seeking to avoid a repeat of what happened one week earlier, Tunisia's Interior Ministry banned all demonstrations Friday, the state-run Tunisian News Agency (TAP) reported, citing a statement from the ministry. The report said the protest ban is ""in accordance with the provisions of the state of emergency"" that has been in place since the ouster January of its longtime president, Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. The statement refers to ""calls launched via social networks"" to demonstrate over the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. And it comes a week after four protesters died and 49 were wounded during an assault on the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Tunis, TAP previously reported, citing Souad Sadraoui, interim general director of Charles Nicolle Hospital. Presidential spokesman Adnene Mansar denounced Charlie Hebdo's publication of the cartoons as a ""deliberate insult,"" adding that ""some circles are deliberately seeking to stir up tension in relations binding the Muslim and Western worlds."" ""We should not fall in the trap of provocation, we should rather denounce these acts by peaceful means,"" Mansar said, according to a TAP report. In another TAP report, National Constituent Assembly Speaker Mustapha Ben Jaafar said that the bloody September 14 protests ""do not reflect the mood of the moderate and tolerant Tunisian people."" ""Political, ideological and religious violence is (no) longer tolerated in present-day Tunisia,"" Jaafar said in Strasbourg in eastern France, calling abiding by the ""rule of law ... an absolute priority.""

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Army soldier who lost both legs serving in Iraq fell to his death from a roller coaster in upstate New York, police said. James Hackemer, 29, was riding the Ride of Steel roller coaster at Darien Lake Theme Park Resort on Friday when he plummeted some 200 feet to the ground, according to Sgt. Greg Walker of the Genesee County Sheriff's Office. ""They were descending from one of the hills when he became dislodged from the roller coaster and fell to the ground,"" Walker said. Hackemer, who had been fitted with prosthetic legs, was not wearing them on the ride, according to senior dispatcher James Tripp of the Sheriff's Office. Hackemer, a sergeant, had spent three years in rehabilitation after he lost both legs in an improvised explosive device blast in Iraq in 2008, according to CNN affiliate WVIB. This was his first trip to the park since returning to his home in Gowanda, New York, in March, WVIB reported. ""However long he was on that ride, (it) had to have been the best time in the last 3 1/2 years,"" his sister Jody Hackemer told WVIB. ""It was the only time (that he) felt completely normal again,"" she said. The park is working closely with local and state authorities to investigate the death.

"(CNN) -- It may not be keeping track of your phone calls, but one government agency may be keeping your garage door shut. A recent radio communications update at the U.S. Army's Fort Gordon near Augusta, Georgia, reportedly is causing hundreds of nearby residents to have difficulty accessing their garages. The new radio system operates at the same radio frequency needed to operate automatic garage door remotes, the military said. The frequency update caused garage doors to be unresponsive to owner remote controls. Residents report trying several methods, including replacing the remote's battery, to get the controls to work. The Augusta Chronicle reports that up to 500 residents have put in complaints with the Overhead Door Co. of Augusta because of the sudden malfunction. ""On Sunday, I came home, sat in front of the garage in my car and pressed the remote seven or eight times before the door finally opened,"" Jason Milford told the Chronicle. ""I was not even 10 feet away."" The newspaper also noted the new system was installed for updating emergency communications, and that the complaints of nonresponsive garage doors come from up to 15 miles away from Fort Gordon. Fort Gordon is the home of the U.S. Army Signal Regiment and is a site of leading communication development for the Army. It employs 15,717 military and 7,112 civilians and boasts of several partnerships with the Augusta community. However, this incident has frustrated some residents, who complained about the lack of advance notice about the installation. A spokesman from the base said warnings were planned, but the system was up and running quicker than anticipated. ""Fort Gordon intended to conduct widespread public notifications on this transition; however, testing began earlier than expected,"" spokesman Buz Yarnell said in a statement. Yarnell's statement notes that frequencies between 380 megahertz and 399.9 megahertz have been reserved for government and military uses since World War II, though manufacturers of garage door remotes may choose to use these frequencies if they think there is low risk of interference. As a result, those near military bases may experience interference on occasion. The Federal Communications Commission categorize garage door openers as operating on an ""unlicensed basis"" of radio frequencies, the statement said, and must ""accept any interference that may occur from the authorized users of radio frequencies."" The interference is not a cause for safety or privacy concerns; it will not open garage doors but temporarily keeps the remotes from working. The Augusta paper reported that interference has been reported in other places since 2004, including California, Connecticut and Texas. For now, residents experiencing interference can wait for Fort Gordon to fix the issue, or shell out $150 to $500 for new systems that can withstand the interference, according to the paper.","New communication system installed at Fort Gordon near Augusta, Georgia .

"(CNN) -- North Korea on Wednesday blamed South Korea for driving them ""to the brink of war,"" a day after the North shelled a South Korean island and killed four people. South Korea provoked the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the Yellow Sea, North Korea said. Pyongyang made the accusation through its state media, referring to a military drill that Seoul holds every year. ""The puppet group dared make an uproar over 'a provocation' from someone and cry out for 'punishment' like a thief crying 'Stop the thief!'"" the North's KCNA news agency said. ""The Lee Myung-bak group's treacherous and anti-reunification acts are intolerable as it vitiated the atmosphere for improving the inter-Korean relations overnight and drove the situation to the brink of war, challenging the desire of all the Koreans,"" KCNA said. The administration of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said it was consulting the United States and other allies Wednesday, following the North's shelling. ""We have come to the judgment that what happened on Yeonpyeong Island was a definite military provocation against the Republic of Korea,"" the Lee administration said. ""The fact that they have indiscriminately fired upon a defenseless civilian zone was a brutally inhumane action, an illegal and intentional action against the U.N. constitution and the armistice between the North and South Korea."" The South said it was on high alert, but was calmly considering its actions. ""We have ordered to bring calm to the lives of people. For the deceased marines, we will give them honorable treatment and the funeral functions will be held on the coming Saturday,"" the Lee administration said. ""The close cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea will be maintained and there will be special measures for the damage done to the village."" Seoul on Wednesday announced 1 billion won ($875,583) in emergency money to repair damage wrought by Tuesday's shelling, which killed two South Korean marines and two civilians. The attack also injured 15 South Korean soldiers and three civilians, South Korea said. The two civilians' bodies were found Wednesday on the coast of Yeonpyeong Island, South Korean coast guard said. The bodies of two men in their 60s were not recognized by residents of the sparsely populated island, leading officials to believe that they were construction workers from off the island, said Song Young-gil, mayor of Incheon. Hundreds of South Koreans continued to evacuate from the island on Wednesday. Some residents said they were too afraid to ever return. They described being terrified as North Korean shells landed in and around their homes Tuesday. On Wednesday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that five buildings were directly hit and 22 were damaged during the attack. Photos provided by South Korean coast guard on Wednesday showed demolished and damaged homes. The Yellow Sea is a longstanding flash point between the two Koreas. In March, 46 South Korean sailors died there when their warship was torpedoed. Seoul says Pyongyang sank the Cheonan, which the North has denied. The United States said Wednesday that it would hold military drills with South Korea in the Yellow Sea starting on Sunday. ""This exercise is defensive in nature. While planned well before yesterday's unprovoked artillery attack, it demonstrates the strength of the ROK-U.S. alliance and our commitment to regional stability through deterrence,"" U.S. Forces Korea said. ""The USS George Washington carrier strike group will join Republic of Korea naval forces in the waters west of the Korean peninsula from Nov. 28 to Dec. 1 to conduct the next exercise in the series announced at the 2+2 meetings in July."" The United States has about 28,500 troops deployed in South Korea. A U.S. defense official said more than 50 U.S. Navy vessels are in the area, including a carrier strike group led by the USS George Washington. The North Korean shelling has put the entire region on edge. On Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, ""North Korea's artillery attack on South Korea was an attack on an area where ordinary citizens live. This is an unforgivable act of barbarism. We have been strongly condemning North Korea for this action and will continue to do so."" ""This attack created extreme anxiety not only in South Korea, but also in the East Asia region, including Japan. We must tackle this issue with close coordination with South Korea, as well as the United States. At the same time, we urge China, which holds a strong influence over North Korea, to make an effort to suppress such action by North Korea."" China, which is North Korea's key ally, has responded obliquely to Tuesday's shelling. ""We have taken note of relevant reports and express our concern. Relevant facts need to be verified and we hope both parties make more contributions to the stability of the peninsula,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. Beijing sustains North Korea with food, arms and fuel. International sanctions over the North's nuclear program have isolated the country. Its people have gone hungry as Pyongyang has poured money into its military and nuclear programs.","The South provoked shelling by holding a military drill, the North says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bob Andrews lost his sight in the Vietnam War but the patriotic American is keen to serve his country again by helping to revive a Ryder Cup competition for blind golfers. Blind golfer Tony Shearman with guide Martin Poole. Former U.S. Marine Andrews was 22 when he was robbed of his vision in 1967 after a grenade explosion left him unable to see. Andrews only occasionally played golf when he was younger. But when he lost his sight his interest in the sport really developed and he became involved in the development of the U.S. Blind Golf Association. Andrews is excited by the possibility of a return of blind golf's version of the Ryder Cup, which was last contested in 1995. And as a former president of the USBGA who now sits on the board of the International Blind Golf Association, Andrews is hopeful the tournament can be revived. ""I would love to see a Ryder Cup for blind golfers make a return. We had some great days back in the 1990s and played some great courses such as Wentworth,"" he said. ""The Ryder Cup itself is really popular and I think that matchplay in a team scenario is ideal for blind golf so bringing it back is something we should all work towards. ""Of course, there are different levels of blindness and provided that the criteria can be laid down -- which has caused some problems in the past -- then I think we could have a brilliant event on our hands."" Tony Shearman, of the English Blind Golf Association, agreed that there is interest in a Ryder Cup competition for blind golfers on his side of the Atlantic. He added: ""Blind golf is really growing and expanding as a sport in Europe and further afield. I think there is a real appetite among the top players here to get some sort of match up between the U.S. and Europe if at all possible. ""We also have some of the best players, including current world champion Mike Loten, so it would be a really good contest. If something can be sorted out that would be brilliant,"" he finished. Blind or partially sighted golfers have a sighted coach who assists the golfer in describing distance, direction and characteristics of the hole, and helps with club head alignment behind the ball, prior to the stroke. From this point, the golfer is on their own, and it is their skill that determines the resulting stroke. Other than the coach, there is only one relaxation to the Royal & Ancient Rules of Golf: Blind or partially sighted golfers are allowed to ground their club in a hazard. Andrews, who lives in Florida, revealed that blind golfers use several techniques to aid them just before they make the shot. ""Some golfers like to visualize what the whole looks like and get as much information as possible from the sighted coach to try and paint a picture in their mind of what the layout of the hole might be,"" he told CNN. ""But I prefer to play the numbers game. What is the par for hole? What is the length of the hole? Once I know these things I can calculate the power needed for my shots and pretty much know how far I need to hit the ball and which club I need. ""Without doubt, putting is the most difficult -- I try to read the contour of the greens through my shoes to get a feel for how hard I have to hit the ball, whether there is a gradient et cetera,"" Andrews explained. ""A lot of the time, with advice from the coach, blind golfers can make it to the greens in more or less the same number of shots as sighted players,"" he said. ""Most of the golf I play is against players who have full vision. And let me tell you they don't cut me any slack whatsoever -- not a single stroke -- especially if the loser buys the beer!"" he joked. While the sighted coach is essential to the blind golfer, having an extra person can also bring a fresh set of problems. ""Sometimes having a coach can overcomplicate things for you with the amount of information and often when they leave stuff out it can actually help you,"" Andrews explained. ""For example, I would hit over a lake easier if I didn't know I was doing so -- but if I know it is there then all of a sudden it puts more pressure on you,"" he said. ""The other thing is that you are playing as part of a team,"" he continued. ""You might be on fire and playing the best golf of your life but if the other part of that team is having a bad day it can mean you don't shoot the score you want.""","Vietnam veteran Bob Andrews is keen to revive a Ryder Cup for blind golfers .

"(CNN)  -- A former Wal-Mart employee who suffered severe brain damage in a traffic accident won't have to pay back the company for the cost of her medical care, Wal-Mart told the family Tuesday. Debbie Shank, 52, has severe brain damage after a traffic accident in May 2000. ""Occasionally, others help us step back and look at a situation in a different way. This is one of those times,"" Wal-Mart Executive Vice President Pat Curran said in a letter. ""We have all been moved by Ms. Shank's extraordinary situation."" Eight years ago, Debbie Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal-Mart's health and benefits plan. After a tractor-trailer slammed into her minivan, the 52-year-old mother of three lost much of her short-term memory and was confined to a wheelchair. She now lives in a nursing home. She also lost her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, who was killed shortly after arriving in Iraq. When Debbie Shank asks family members how her son is doing and they remind her that he's dead, she weeps as if hearing the news for the first time. Wal-Mart's health care plan lets the retail giant recoup the cost of its expenses if an employee collects damages in a lawsuit. And Wal-Mart set out to do just that after Shank and her husband, Jim, won $1 million after suing the trucking company involved in the wreck. After legal fees, the couple received $417,000. Wal-Mart sued the Shanks to recoup $470,000 it paid for her medical care. However, a court ruled that the company could only recoup about $275,000 -- the amount that was left in a trust fund for her care. The Shanks appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the court declined in March to hear the case. CNN told the couple's story last week, prompting thousands of angry blog responses and at least two online petitions to boycott the company. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart said in a letter to Jim Shank that it is modifying its health care plan to allow ""more discretion"" in individual cases. Watch Wal-Mart reverse its decision » . ""We wanted you to know that Wal-Mart will not seek any reimbursement for the money already spent on Ms. Shank's care, and we will work with you to ensure the remaining amounts in the trust can be used for her ongoing care,"" Curran said. ""We are sorry for any additional stress this uncertainty has placed on you and your family."" Wal-Mart's reversal came as shock to Shank. ""I thought it was an April Fool's joke,"" he told CNN. ""I (would) just like to let them know that they did the right thing. I just wish it hadn't taken so long,"" Shank said. ""But I thank them and I hope they come through with all that they said they're going to do.  E-mail to a friend .","Wal-Mart sued Debbie Shank to recoup $470,000 it paid for her medical care .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Three Palestinians were wounded Monday in two separate incidents, including one that Israeli officials described as a ""price tag"" attack against Palestinians. ""Price tag"" attacks are actions taken by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and Palestinian properties as retaliatory measures. In the first incident, according to Yousef Abu Maria, head of the Popular Committee of Beit Ummar who said he was an eyewitness, a settler opened fire on a Palestinian funeral procession that was taking place in the village, wounding two Palestinians. The two were identified as a man, 32, who was shot in the right leg, and a 59-year-old man shot in the chest. According to Abu Maria, ""An Israeli settler got out of his car, approached the cemetery gates, pulled his pistol and fired towards the funeral procession, injuring two Palestinian people."" Abu Maria said the settler then ran for cover to a nearby Israeli military watch tower but was not arrested by the military. ""The Israeli soldiers did not arrest the Israeli settler and gave him a safe haven. Later the soldiers started firing tens of tear gas canisters towards the people who were taking part in the funeral procession without any reason, just to protect the settler,"" he said. The Israeli military denied that its soldiers were standing idly by and said they only began employing tear gas after Palestinians started throwing rocks at their positions. Dr. Mohamad Hashlamon of Al-Ahli Hospital in Hebron said the staff there treated the two Palestinian with gunshot wounds. Israeli Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told CNN that police received reports of the shootings and were investigating the incident, adding that they had also received complaints about Palestinians throwing rocks in the area. In the second incident, a 32-year-old Palestinian farmer was stabbed in the upper body by masked Israeli settlers in the southern Hebron hills, according to Palestinian medical officials. They said the man, Mahmoud Awad from the village of At-Tuwaini near the settlement Havat Mo'an, was stabbed in the shoulder and chest and remains in moderate condition. According to eyewitness, Awad was travelling on a donkey in the Hebron Hills area when three masked Israeli settlers approached him. One of the masked men stabbed the man in the shoulder and chest, then fled the area, the witnesses said. Rosenfeld said ""the police believe this is a 'price tag' incident"" and that officers were on the scene searching for the suspect. In a statement, the Palestinian Authority held the Israeli government responsible for both attacks for what it described as ""tolerating settlers' violence against Palestinians."" ""The Palestinian government media center holds the Israeli government responsible for tolerating settler violence against Palestinians,"" the statement read. ""Only last week, six Palestinian workers were attacked brutally by settlers near Shilo settlement. This action was part of the 'price tag' policy of settlers that has been escalating, while the Israeli government remains tolerant and provides immunity for settlers committing crimes against Palestinians. Palestinians' safety and security is an immediate demand and need."" Hebron Governor Kamel Al-Hameed told CNN the incidents were not isolated, represent escalating attacks by Israeli settlers and said the Israeli government is not doing enough to put an end to them. ""It is clear that there is a continuous escalation in the daily attacks by the settlers on the Palestinians and is supported by the Israeli army because they do not interfere to stop these attacks and does not arrest any of the attackers and do not bring them to justice,"" Al-Hameed said. ""The Israeli government looks like it is interested in escalating the situation and not interested in calming the situation. It is not interested in putting an end to these settlers' violations and acts of terror."" Monday's attacks come a week after five members of an Israeli family living in the northern West Bank settlement of Itimar were killed by an unknown assailant in what the Israeli military called a terror attack. Commenting on that attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that the Palestinian Authority assist in finding those responsible but he did not explicitly blame Palestinians for the deaths. An investigation is still ongoing. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack. In an address to the Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization last week, Abbas said, ""We have condemned this crime ... it is not humanitarian and (an) unethical act ... but there was an insistence in directing the blame to the Palestinian people, before the investigation details and final report of who committed the crime were released.""

"(CNN) -- London has always been a world-class destination, but its hotels have often fallen behind, especially in the 1990s and 2000s, as new American hotel chains rapidly expanded and design-minded resorts in Asia perennially raised the bar on service. South America, Africa and Oceania also saw unprecedented growth. London was a place to escape from, not to escape to; rooms with views were reserved for Paris and Tuscany. But how the times changed. As London prepared for two back-to-back mega events last year, the Queen's Jubilee and the Summer Olympics, its hotel sector began to make some notable strides, the likes of which are still dazzling visitors. The new generation of hotels, all of which opened between 2011 and 2013, includes the work of starchitect David Chipperfield (Café Royal) and big-name designers like Kit Kemp, Tara Bernerd, Anouska Hempel and David Collins also got in on the action. Departures: Best restaurants in London . Here are our favorites. The Ampersand Hotel . London's French-expat scene congregates in Frog Alley, otherwise known as South Kensington, which is home to the Ampersand, a hotel opened in August 2012. All 110 of its rooms feature one of five central Victorian themes: botany, music, geometry, ornithology and astronomy. (Each takes inspiration from the nearby Natural History and Victoria & Albert museums.) Its new patisserie area, an underground cocktail bar, a library, a game room (featuring table tennis) and a high-tech, 24-hour gym bring things up to date. Rooms, from $225; 10 Harrington Rd.; 44-20/7589-5895. Departures: Festive London teas . Belgraves . Thompson Hotels transplanted New York cool to London when it launched the modern, 85-room Belgraves in February 2012 in London's ritzy Belgravia neighborhood near Sloane Square. Though the hotel's designer, Tara Bernerd, is British -- and contemporary pieces from local artists Miranda Donovan and Mat Collishaw hang in the halls -- a combination of new leather, a spacious fitness center and a retro restaurant serving upgraded burgers, shrimp cocktails and pumpkin pie are pure Americana. Rooms, from $350; 20 Chesham Pl.; 44-20/7858-0100. 9 glamorous movie-star hotels . Bulgari Hotel . The pre-Olympics boom of luxury hotels includes this Knightsbridge property, which opened in May 2012 and eschews British florals and Empire-era chintz for a modernized 1920s look. Highlights include a handmade steel balustrade backed by a metallic wall adorned with sketches of Bulgari's early-20th-century jewelry collections, glossy sapele-mahogany woodwork, silver chandeliers and an overall subdued design paying homage to the label's early Italian silvercraft. Surrounded by columns and small cabanas, the 75-foot pool anchors the spa, which is composed of onyx, oak, Vicenza stone and Italian glass mosaics that lead to a vertical fireplace. Rooms, from $770; 171 Knightsbridge; 44-20/7151-1010. Departures: Opulent hotel lobbies . Café Royal . The opulent Louis XVI decor and detailing of Café Royal, which opened in December 2012 and is nestled between Soho and Mayfair, is the work of British architect David Chipperfield. The grandiose property features a Champagne and caviar lounge with live entertainment, a spa and marble hammam and restored ballrooms once frequented by Elizabeth Taylor, the Beatles and Oscar Wilde. Rooms, from $530; 68 Regent St.; 44-20/7406-3333. Lights, camera, vacation! Corinthia Hotel London . This opulent 294-room hotel -- once home to the Ministry of Defense -- reopened in the spring of 2011. Baccarat crystal, colorful flower arrangements and swirls of Calacatta Oro marble punctuate this Beaux-Arts gem, the product of a $488 million renovation. But the spa -- London's largest -- is the real game changer. The four-story, 35,000-square-foot Espa Life at Corinthia spa and wellness center offers 15 treatment rooms, a monochromatic white spa lounge, a sauna encased in glass and a pool lined with steel. Guests can hit the on-site Harrods for a shopping spree and sip cocktails in the David Collins-designed Bassoon Bar before retiring to one of the seven plush suites with literary, drama or world-exploration themes. Rooms, from $500; Whitehall Pl.; 44-20/7930-8181. Departures: Tucked-away city hotels . Dorset Square Hotel . Kit Kemp, founder and chief designer of Firmdale Hotels, brought her signature British style to New York in 2009 with her Crosby Street property. But she got her start here at this tidy 38-room Regency townhouse overlooking a former cricket grounds in Marylebone. Though it was Firmdale's first property in 1985, the dwelling was eventually de-flagged. It returned to the Firmdale family (and to the Design Hotels portfolio) in May 2012 after being gutted and ""Kitted"" out with chic, slightly eccentric touches like handwoven Argentinean rugs, bespoke wallpaper mocking vintage botanical prints and cricket-ball doorknobs. Two additional Firmdale properties are expected to open in the coming year, another in London and one in New York. Rooms, from $200; 39-40 Dorset Sq.; 44-20/7723-7874. La Suite West . Another Design Hotels member opened in August 2012 in the understated La Suite West in the underrated Bayswater neighborhood, a quiet, leafy residential area adjacent to Hyde Park that is home to some of London's best Asian food. The discreet 19th-century Victorian townhouse lurks behind hedges that make it easy to miss. But once inside guests enjoy an elegant lobby with a minimalist fireplace, relaxing rooms with handsome gray marble tubs, black lacquer shutters and fabrics in deep violet and brown hues, all thanks to British designer Anouska Hempel.

"(CNN) -- Durham has settled a lawsuit filed by members of the Duke University men's 2006 lacrosse team who were exonerated of sexually assaulting an exotic dancer in 2006, the North Carolina city said in a statement Friday. The city has settled with former players David Evans, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann, who were wrongly accused of a sexual assault at a party. As part of the settlement, Durham will make a one-time grant of $50,000 to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission. ""As the City has maintained throughout, it believes that its police officers had an obligation to investigate the allegations made by Crystal Mangum in 2006 and that no police officer nor any other City employee engaged in improper conduct,"" the statement said. ""The former District Attorney, Mike Nifong, was not a City employee, and Mr. Nifong was subsequently convicted of criminal contempt and disbarred for his actions."" Nifong also spent a day in jail for his handling of the case. The charges against the three men forced the cancellation of the team's highly anticipated 2006 season and cost coach Mike Pressler his job. In April 2007, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper reviewed the case and exonerated the three men, declaring that the charges never should have been brought against them. ""When Attorney General Roy Cooper announced his decision ... the City expressed its concurrence in Attorney General Cooper's decision,"" the statement said. ""Today, the City reaffirms that it fully concurs with the Attorney General's decision to dismiss the charges, and with his conclusion that Mr. Evans, Mr. Seligmann, and Mr. Finnerty were innocent of the charges for which they were indicted."" Duke University and the three players reached an undisclosed settlement shortly after the charges were dropped in 2007.","Duke settles lawsuit filed by three wrongly accused former lacrosse players .

"(CNN) -- The founder of an animal rescue organization in Ohio committed suicide, taking dozens of pets with her, the Moreland Hills Police Department told CNN. Sandy Lertzman, 62, founder of the Animal Rights Foundation, was found dead November 4 inside her garage in a running car alongside 31 small rescue dogs, police said. Investigators found prescription vials in the vehicle and a suicide note inside the house. According to Sgt. Janet Boehler, a friend discovered Lertzman's body. It is unclear how long Lertzman and the pets had been dead before they were found. Lertzman was last seen alive November 3. An organization that rescues and rehabilitates all types of animals, Animal Rights Foundation considered Lertzman a pioneer in animal rescue. ""She woke every day to help all of God's beautiful creatures. She fed the deer, squirrels, birds, raccoons, geese and what she called 'Sandy's Safe Haven For All Animals' at her home,'"" a statement on the Animal Rights Foundation website said. According to Boehler, one dog survived. Police say it jumped out of the car, and they found it in garage when they entered the home. The surviving dog is recovering at home with Lertzman's husband, Rick, and son, Matthew. ""Animal Rights Foundation will continue, as strong as ever, in Sandy's memory,"" the organization said on the website. ""We will go on caring, supporting, and helping all animals in distress and supporting laws to protect our animals in her honor.""

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour began its final aerial show on Wednesday, thrilling spectators across the southern United States before completing the first stage of its transcontinental voyage in Houston. After a two-day delay due to unfavorable weather, Endeavour began its flight from Kennedy Space Center in Florida to Los Angeles, where the now-retired spacecraft will be displayed. Endeavour, along with Discovery, Enterprise and Atlantis, became a museum piece after NASA ended its 30-year shuttle program in July 2011. Two other shuttles -- Challenger and Columbia -- were destroyed in accidents that killed all aboard. Challenger exploded shortly after launch in 1986, and Columbia broke apart upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 2003. Watch: Trees removed to make way for Endeavour . Endeavour's three-day piggyback flight atop a modified jumbo jet is divided into three legs that could be described as scenic routes to showcase the shuttle to the public. NASA expects Endeavour to draw crowds of onlookers as the Boeing 747 plots a course over space centers in at least five states and makes stops along the way. The flying duo will dip to about 1,500 feet at many points, to afford a better view to spectators on the ground. ""Social media users are encouraged to share their Endeavour sightings using the hashtags #spottheshuttle and #OV105, Endeavour's orbiter vehicle designation,"" NASA said. Wednesday's leg took Endeavour to Houston, with flyovers along Florida's Space Coast, Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. As Endeavour bid farewell to Kennedy Space Center, it elicited strong emotions from people, such as CNN iReporter Randy Lathrop of Cocoa, Florida, who have lived with the shuttle program nearby for decades. ""It's the last time that she'll ever be at her home base again. It strikes a chord of nostalgia in you because she's done so many flights from the space center. This is her home,"" he said. A short history of Endeavour . NASA says that on Thursday, Endeavour is scheduled to depart Houston at dawn and then make a make a fueling stop at Biggs Army Air Field in El Paso before proceeding to Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California. On Friday, Endeavour will embark on a tour of Northern California, dipping over NASA's Ames Research Center, Sacramento and San Francisco before heading back to Los Angeles, where it will become an exhibit at the California Science Center. Named for the first ship commanded by British explorer James Cook, Endeavour rolled off the assembly plant in Palmdale, California, in 1991 at a cost of $1.7 billion. It was the baby of the shuttle fleet, built as a replacement for Challenger. Over the next 20 years, Endeavour flew some of the most high-profile shuttle missions, covering 25 flights and nearly 123 million miles. It flew a Spacelab mission and numerous International Space Station assembly missions and rendezvoused with Russia's Mir Space Station. Read more space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog .

"(CNN) -- Move over hotels; vacation rentals are the place to be for summer value. A two-bedroom rental property often costs less than a hotel room, while allowing guests some familiar comforts of home, such as a living room and full-size kitchen. TripAdvisor's vacation rental TripIndex rates the value of renting a home during the summer at 15 popular U.S. vacation destinations. The best value on the list is a scorcher: Palm Springs, California. If you can endure the desert heat -- 105 degrees is average for summer -- you'll find cool prices. For $1,250 on average, a family of four can stay for a week in a vacation rental, pay for basic groceries, one dinner at a restaurant and a one-day bike rental. Be sure to book a place with a pool. The index looks at the average cost of this package at 15 destinations using more than 4,000 rental listings on TripAdvisor. Of the 15 locations, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, comes in last at $3,600. However, the second most expensive spot of La Jolla, California, prices out at $1,000 less.

"(CNN) -- When basketball legend Michael Jordan talked to the press after a Chicago Bulls or Washington Wizards game, fans never got to see the superstar with sweat dripping from his brow or a towel wrapped around his waist after emerging from the shower. Consciously aware of his image, Jordan would dress in a side room and not in the main locker room with the other players. So when he emerged, he was suited and booted. Some players would walk around naked, oblivious to the strangers standing there; others had towel wraps on, even dressing with members of the media standing not 10 feet away. Maybe Jordan should put in a call to Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge and the wife of Prince William, and give her a lesson or two on what you need to do in this media-obsessed world -- now that photos of her breasts have been published by a French newspaper. Brits are aghast at the breach of protocol, and Buckingham Palace is threatening legal action. Good luck with that. They are better off sitting Kate down with the same person who had to counsel Prince Harry after his butt-naked romp in a Las Vegas suite. Royals to sue over nude photos . Look, I'm not the least bit insensitive to the shock and horror of the young married couple seeing magazine photos of themselves sunbathing on private property in France. Yet my mama and daddy always taught me that if you don't want someone to see your private parts, then don't show them in public for someone to see. Over decades now, we have become accustomed to the crazed antics of the paparazzi invading the personal space of celebrities. Pantyless shots of Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton getting out of cars? Check. No-talent celebrities like Kim Kardashian starring in sex tapes to pave the way to the land of riches? Check. Cell phone videos of celebs doing whatever to whomever they want in nightclubs? Check. Our culture not only has accepted it, we revel in it. Seriously, do you think all of those celebrity magazines and websites with photos of stars walking to the store to get coffee lose money? No. We live in the age of voyeurism, and the long lenses of the paparazzi satisfy our insatiable desire for the garbage. ""Mindless entertainment"" is what I've heard folks call it. Just mindless is how I'll classify it. Irish tabloid publishes topless royal photos . It would be great if celebs could be themselves. And it's terrible that folks can't drop the pretenses and have dinner with friends without thinking someone has a phone video camera on them and is capturing private remarks. But that world left us long ago, and it's not coming back. As long as photographers can reap six-figure pay days, and websites can rack up millions of page views and charge advertisers more money, every boob shot of a celeb will be shown. Call it despicable and degrading, but it also creates a situation that requires common sense. Kate, unless you know for sure that no one else's prying eyes -- or camera -- will see you, don't sunbathe naked. All of the screaming and righteous indignation won't do a darn thing to stop the next celeb or royal family member who chooses to show up in his or her birthday suit. Blame the photographer all day (and it's a job I would never want). But if she never takes the top off outside, we're not having this discussion. Right, Michael Jordan? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Michael Jordan, aware of his image, kept covered up, even in locker room .

"(CNN) -- A hundred years ago on this day, on August 8th, 1914, the British HMS Asteria and Pegasus protected cruisers bombed Dar-es-Salaam, then the capital of German East Africa, bringing the European so-called ""war to end all wars"" to the eastern African shores. The day before, Anglo-French forces constituted of Ghanaian, Nigerian, Sierra Leonean, Gambian and Beninese troops had invaded German Togoland in West Africa. Among World War I campaigns, the East African one was the longest of all: as the armistice was being signed in Europe on November, 11th 1918, the last of the German forces were still fighting their British counterparts. Indeed the general who led them only surrendered two weeks later, on November, 25th 1918. But who knows any of this, whether in America, in Europe or indeed in Africa? As the world commemorates the Centenary of the Great War, the African side of this story remains a footnote, despite huge losses of human lives and major consequences for the future of the African continent. The East Africa campaign was the opposite of the European war of trenches: it was about mobility, short raids and long treks on foot. The German Schutztruppe, white German commanders and black African soldiers called askaris, never exceeded 25,000 men. The British however assembled 150,000 troops: South Africans and Indians at first, joined by Kenyans and Nigerians later on. But none of these soldiers would ever have survived, let alone be able to fight, without the unmentioned exploitation of porters. For every one soldier, German and British troops used four ""native carriers,"" including women and children, who howled food supplies, arms and even artillery; cooked, scrubbed and tended to their needs; and died of exhaustion, malnutrition and disease. Of the 105,000 deaths among British forces during the East Africa campaign, 90% were porters. 45,000 among the dead were from British East Africa (Kenya) alone. Read this: African writers you should be reading . General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the German commander, is often lauded for his military genius, outwitting the British during four years with barely a fifth of their numbers. Some of the tales written are nothing short of David vs. Goliath. But von Lettow-Vorbeck had been ordered not to engage by Berlin. As far as I am concerned, his actions would be better described as a war-mongering megalomaniac effort by a military commander responsible for the callous deaths of 300,000 porters, the looting of hundreds of villages and the devastation of years of crops. If the death toll had been of German lives, would he have been as celebrated in the scrolls of History? It is unclear that askaris actually volunteered to be part of the Schutztruppe, considering just a decade earlier, in 1905, the Germans had violently suppressed one of the largest uprisings against colonial rule on the African continent, the Maji Maji rebellion. That same year, Germans carried out the first genocide of the century against the Herero in German South West Africa (Namibia). Terror, subjugation and inhumane practice ruled in the German colonies, and this is how it should be remembered. All told, two million African soldiers, workers and porters were directly involved in World War I. Though never fully acknowledged, Europe's Great war was a war of colonials and a colonial theater of war. As I reflect on this day, a public holiday (Nane Nane) for farmers in Tanzania, I remember a hundred years ago 750,000 square miles of land was inundated and destroyed, I remember the farmers who were forcefully dragged into this as porters. I remember Africans who fought other Africans for reasons unknown to them. The erasure of Africa's involvement in World War I, including the ongoing centenary commemorations, painstakingly reminds us that, once again, it is for us to make sure history is told in full. My commitment to The World War I in Africa Project finds its roots in this necessity: history should be unearthed and a critical lens applied, especially by us Africans. What happened in Africa should not stay in Africa. Read this: African writers you should be reading . More from African Voices .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House is planning a ""very aggressive sales job"" that will involve the Vice President, cabinet members and travel across the nation for President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration, a top White House aide said Friday. Speaking at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told reporters that after Friday's address on the topic in Las Vegas, Obama will head to Chicago next Tuesday to speak with activists. The sales pitch, which Pfeiffer called a ""very important priority,"" will continue beyond December, with travel across the nation. ""[The President will] first make the case to the country about what we did, why we did it, explain to the country why it's consistent with past presidents of both parties,"" Pfeiffer said, adding a key component will also be educating the nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants the move could help on how to apply to the program. Obama announced a widely controversial plan to delay deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally during a primetime address Thursday night, and was immediately met with fierce Republican opposition. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) pledged during a Friday morning press conference that the House will ""rise to this challenge"" and respond to the order, which he said ""damaged"" the presidency. Some Republicans have floated attaching a policy rider to the upcoming must-pass government spending bill that would defund implementation of the executive order, which President Obama would then veto, effectively leading to another shutdown. Pfeiffer invoked incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) warning against shutting down the government in arguing the GOP shouldn't choose that route of response. ""Certainly, our hope is that Republicans will listen to Senator McConnell, who has said two things: one is that Republicans have to demonstrate to the American people that they can govern, and two, there'll be no shutdowns or threats or things [like impeachment],"" Pfeiffer said. Republicans have warned for weeks that the move would ""poison the well"" with the GOP and kill any possibility for compromise with the White House. Pfeiffer said the President hopes Republicans won't use the executive action as an excuse not to work with them on other issues. ""It's sort of the 3rd grade equivalent of taking your ball and going home,"" he said. Pfeiffer defended the choice to move on key issues unilaterally, arguing that, for the President, even ""getting out of bed in the morning comes with Republican opposition."" ""[If] you can only do things that are not going to make some Republicans very mad, then we would do nothing,"" he said. And he hinted that more may be to come. Pfeiffer said the President gathered his aides the day after the party suffered deeply damaging losses during the midterm elections, losing control of the Senate and a handful of moderates in the House, to remind them that time is running out in his presidency and they'll never have a better opportunity to ""do good"" in the world. ""He does feel the pressure of time, we all do. We have a little bit over two years left here,"" said, and the president wants to ""maximize"" his efforts to get things done in the remaining time. ""We're gonna be looking for opportunities to work with Republicans, but we've also made it clear that where we have authority to act, and where we can do what we can to move the ball forward, we're going to do that,"" Pfeiffer said.","White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer spoke at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Friday .

"(CNN) -- I don't think anyone is ready for grief. But when it hits you, it knocks you out cold. I was told that tears and the sorrow would come in waves. For me, it's been more like a riptide or a tornado, constantly circling around me, whipping me in the face. Sometimes it stabs; sometimes it punches; sometimes it drowns me. My grieving process began in March, when I got a phone call from my mom while at work. She told me that my dad had suddenly stopped breathing and that I needed to get home to Louisiana as soon as possible. The seven-hour car ride felt like an eternity. As the optimist I am, I kept telling myself that my dad would pull out of it. But when I got to the hospital and saw the looks on my relatives' faces, I knew the situation was much worse than I thought. My father had a major brain hemorrhage, the kind that you don't recover from. I sat by his side for roughly 48 hours, with my siblings and my mom, holding his hand until he took his last breath. The loss didn't hit me until a few days after the funeral, when all the out-of-town relatives were gone and friends and neighbors made fewer ""check-ins."" My parents' home didn't feel like home anymore, just an empty space. Friends were just people who didn't understand what I was going through. First Person: My life as a little person . I had always been an incredibly social person and loved being surrounded by people. I always found a reason to smile; I always cracked jokes. But after my father's death, the world became a dark and scary place. I wanted to crawl into a dark corner and avoid everyone. This grief felt insurmountable and incredibly alienating. I went from planning a family vacation to planning a eulogy in a matter of days. It's the kind of whiplash that is emotionally and mentally paralyzing. I attempted to manage my own grief while trying to be strong for my mom and my family. And to top it all off, I had to deal with some of the more practical matters. My mother and I had to close down his real estate appraisal business, and I had to explain to client after client that my dad had passed away, previously healthy, at the age of 64. Do you have a first-person essay? Share it with CNN iReport . The resounding response was always: ""What? But we just talked to him a few days ago, and he sounded fine!"" I would quickly hang up the phone before they could witness my imminent breakdown. Then there was the task of planning his memorial service. My mom, my siblings and I were all in a daze as we ironed out the details. When I gave the tribute at his memorial service, I described him as the kind of guy who was ""a mountain among pebbles."" I needed everyone to know just how amazing he was. It's part of the reason why I am sharing this with you. My dad, Michael P. Dunne, was a real estate appraiser with a penchant for perfectionism. He was a senior Olympic volleyball player, a former coach and an avid member of an Irish marching club in New Orleans. Friends would tell you he was the life of any party. His six siblings -- older and younger -- always called him for advice on everything from real estate to relationships. He and my mom were inseparable. For me, he embodied everything good in the world. I remember when my first love dumped me in high school, he spent hours sitting with me in the middle of the night as I cried, constantly reminding me of the amazing woman I was. He baked a cake for his grandson -- my nephew Nikolas -- every year for his birthday. He wasn't even very good at baking, but he'd spend hours meticulously frosting his creation. First Person: A fat girl gets naked . Now, more than six months later, those fond memories come often. I remember sitting on the porch in the days after he died, steeped in sorrow and angry at the world. Out of nowhere, I heard my neighbors play one of my dad's favorite songs, ""Unchained Melody"" by the Righteous Brothers. I went from crying to laughing as I recalled a fond memory. One day, he and I were in the car and it came on the radio. We both belted the ballad out at the top of our lungs. Moments like that serve as reminders for me to live my life fully and with joy. My father lived a life full of love. And the best thing I can do to honor him is to try to do the same. Those little moments make me look at the world differently. Life is suddenly more precious, more beautiful. So many things remind me of my dad. I see the love he had for me and my family in everything. Every time I eat an apple, I'm reminded of the time we went apple-picking in North Georgia. It was late in the season, and he was the only one of us tall enough to actually grab the fruit. When the New Orleans Saints play a game, I think about how he'd yell at the TV, a trait he definitely passed down to me. I try to remind myself of how fortunate I am, to have had 27 years with this incredible man. I still have the support of my mom, and that's what keeps me going most days. She lost her husband of more than 30 years, her best friend, and yet somehow she finds the strength to be there for me daily. She and my father taught me everything I know about love and family, and she and I often lean on each other for support. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a struggle every single day. The biggest relief from the pain has been surrounding myself with photos and mementos of joyful moments. I constantly try to remind myself of a phrase I uttered in the hospital as I saw our whole family surround him to say their last goodbyes: ""so much love."" My father had so much love for others, and everyone I know loved him back. Some days, I still feel the blow, fresh as new. I still have my riptide moments, and some days there are tornadoes. But mostly, there's just love. And that has to be good enough for now.","In March, CNN's Jessica Dunne lost her father very suddenly .

"Richmond, California (CNN) -- Investigators say as many as 20 people were involved in or stood and watched the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl outside a California high school homecoming dance Saturday night. Police posted a $20,000 reward Tuesday for anyone who comes to them with information that helps arrest and convict those involved in what authorities describe as a 2½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus in suburban San Francisco. Two teenage suspects have been jailed, but more arrests, as many as 20 total, are expected, according to a police detective. ""We will be making arrests continually as we develop probable cause,"" said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. ""With this number of people implicated in the incident we're going to be making arrests on an ongoing basis."" As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lighted back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911 to report it, police said. A 1999 California law makes it illegal not to report a witnessed crime against a child, but the law applies only to children 14 and under. ""We do not have the ability to arrest people who witnessed the crime and did nothing,"" Gagan said. ""The law can be very rigid. We don't have the authority to make an arrest."" Charles Ramsey, a member of the Richmond school board, said the school district bears some responsibility for the attack. School administrators and police apparently weren't watching the area as they should have, Ramsey said. The school said it would hold a safety meeting for parents and students Wednesday evening to address the assault. The victim was found unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday, after police received a call from someone in the area who had overheard people at the assault scene ""reminiscing about the incident,"" Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan said. The girl was flown by helicopter to a hospital where she was admitted in critical condition. She was in stable condition Tuesday, police said. Investigators canvassed the community with fliers, which included the reward offer, hoping to identify more suspects Tuesday. ""There is one individual in custody who has made some spontaneous statements that have led me to believe that he is culpable for what happened,"" Richmond police Lt. Johan Simon said. Nineteen-year-old Manuel Ortega, described as a former student at the school, was arrested soon after he fled the scene and will face charges of rape, robbery and kidnapping, police said. A 15-year-old was later arrested and charged with one count of felony sexual assault. A third teenager was being interviewed, Gagan said. ""Based on witness statements and suspect statements, and also physical evidence, we know that she was raped by at least four suspects committing multiple sex acts,"" Gagan said. ""As people announced over time that this was going on, more people came to see, and some actually participated,"" Gagan said. The attack occurred on school grounds as the annual homecoming dance was under way inside the school Saturday night, authorities said.","10 people involved in assault, 10 others watched and offered no help, police say .

"(CNN) -- When a couple left scathing comments on a travel review website that a hotel in northern England they had stayed at was a ""filthy, dirty rotten stinking hovel,"" they thought no more about it. But Tony and Jan Jenkinson were shocked later to see an extra Â£100 ($156) added to their credit card bill. On investigating the couple found they had been fined by Broadway Hotel in the seaside resort of Blackpool, which reportedly told them its policy was to charge guests who had left bad reviews. The pair, from Whitehaven in Cumbria, wrote on TripAdvisor they chose the hotel because it had ""ample parking,"" but the car park was so full they had to park at a nearby hotel. Jenkinson, 63, said he ""couldn't believe the state of the room,"" which cost Â£36 ($56) a night. ""The hot tap didn't work, when we reported it we were told they knew about it and it would be fixed in the morning (we were only there for one night.) ""The drawer fronts fell off when we opened the chest of drawers. Again, they knew about this and it was supposed to be dealt with in the morning."" ""The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the carpet was thin, dirty and stained. The bed was something else, it must have come out of the ark, the base was all scuffed and dirty and the springs in the mattress attacked you in the night."" Jenkinson complained about the fine to local trading standards officers, who passed the complaint on to Blackpool Council. Gillian Campbell, cabinet member responsible for public protection, said: ""Our trading standards team became aware of this issue last week. As a result, we have spoken to the hotel owner and asked for the policy to be removed, which has now happened."" ""This is a unique case and not one that we have come across before."" Jenkinson told the BBC he would fight to get his money refunded, adding: ""Annoyed isn't strong enough for how I feel about this, what happened to freedom of speech? ""Everybody we have spoken to says they (the hotel) are not allowed to do this."" CNN was unable to contact the manager of the hotel for comment. In a statement, TripAdvisor said it deplored the practice of fining its users. ""While thankfully such instances are very rare, it is completely against the spirit and policies of our site for any business owner to attempt to bully or intimidate reviewers who have had a negative experience. ""Where we find evidence of a business doing so, we will take action to protect the integrity of our site.""","Hotel in northern England fines guest who left bad review on website .

"(CNN) -- CNN on Thursday continues its series ""The Sixties,"" which explores the decade of historically significant social movements, people and events. The new episode -- ""A Long March to Freedom"" -- focuses on the Freedom Summer of 1964 for a very notable reason. This week marks the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer -- the tumultuous period in our history when three young workers were kidnapped and murdered in Mississippi while attempting to register people to vote. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner shall never be forgotten. The three youths were civil rights workers in Mississippi who had taken their summer to help eligible citizens to register to vote, a right that state and so many others down South had denied for more than one hundred years. As the men drove through Philadelphia, Mississippi, they got a flat tire. The town's deputy sheriff put on his patrol car's red light and pulled them over. He called for two highway patrolmen. Forty-four days later, the FBI found their bodies in an earthen dam. Goodman and Schwerner, white students from the North, were shot through the chest. Chaney, an African-American student from Mississippi, was beaten to death. Though 18 men were indicted on federal conspiracy charges and were likely present at the killings, seven were convicted. The longest sentence served was just six years. Those three men knew the risks they were taking, one reason why they were making haste through Mississippi's countryside and small towns. They had no desire to be martyrs. Yet, they were killed by racists who sought to stop their campaign to secure each Mississippian the right to vote. It was their deaths, along with hundreds of actions by courageous civil rights workers during the Freedom Summer of 1964, that mobilized the Congress to end the filibuster and approve the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and gave much needed momentum to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Many of those Freedom Fighters are gone, and others are too old to still organize and mobilize citizens to vote. However, they all serve as reminders that in our long march for freedom, justice and equality for all, we will never end our pursuit to secure a more perfect union. One of the people the youth recruited into local leadership in 1964 was Fannie Lou Hamer, then 44. ""They treated us like we were special and we loved 'em,"" she said. ""We trusted 'em."" She became a lifelong civil rights worker. Hamer understood that we must make government our business, and our business justice. The right to vote, the right to an education, the right to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"" the right to opportunity, go hand-in-hand, one to the other. Economic liberty and social justice and civil rights -- we cannot have one without the others. If it weren't for Freedom Summer, I wouldn't be here. If it weren't for events like Freedom Summer and for the thousands of people who participated in that and so many other events, I wouldn't be here. Throughout my years in politics and public service, I have carried with me one of the sayings of Fannie Lou Hamer. She said, ""Nobody's free until everybody's free."" That's true, no matter what kind of freedom we're talking about. We have a long way to go. The reactionary forces never give up, never cease, and neither can we. President Barack Obama campaigned with a message of hope to all: ""Yes, we can!"" He didn't say, ""It will be a walk in the park."" Mississippi today has come a long way. But, it still ranks near the bottom of the 50 states in poverty, unemployment, median household income and health care. There's work to do. We have to win back legislation to enforce not just civil rights, but also strengthen and protect the rights of all Americans to vote. Sadly, that right is under constant attack or simply being undermined by some lawmakers who insist there is widespread evidence of voter fraud when the evidence clearly shows that it's not true. Truly, we have come far in 50 years. No one disputes this fact. But now is the time to create a new Freedom Summer, but a very different one than what we experienced 50 years ago. This summer, we have an opportunity, if we have the courage, to struggle together â€” together, regardless of differences, to create a summer of economic freedom, and a new birth of secured voting rights. But it's time we try to simply power forward together. What is ""power forward?"" It's the term for a basketball position I played during high school. Power Forward means welcoming obstacles as opportunities. Power Forward means taking risks, accepting responsibility and sharing the profits and prestige. Power Forward means being conscientious, courageous and confident. Power Forward means being independent and interdependent. It means networking, sharing -- you can't do it on your own. It means following your own path but not ignoring the advice of those that have 'been there, done that.' It means being true to your vision and enabling the vision of others. Power Forward means staying ethical, doing it right and legally and honestly, especially when it's easy not to, when it seems no one else is. Power Forward means being humble and ambitious. Power forward means moving the ball farther down the court in our pursuit of equal justice under the law. Together we can commemorate a great milestone and power forward to a better and brighter future for all Americans.

"(CNN) -- As so often happens, news of North Korea's latest leadership move trickled out from the regime's official KCNA news agency and hinted at a power shift in Pyongyang. In a report published on the country's May Day celebrations, the government mouthpiece named Hwang Pyong-so, a senior official of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea and one of Kim Jong Un's closest confidantes, as director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army. The position is seen as the military's top political office. Beyond a cursory mention of Hwang's new title, the news agency did not elaborate on changes behind the political curtain. Promotion . The role is the top military position after Kim, who is supreme commander of the armed forces. Hwang was promoted to Vice Marshal just ahead of the KCNA report that named him as the new military political chief. Previously, Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae held the position. While in the job, Choe was widely regarded by North Korea watchers as second only to Kim in terms of political clout. However, speculation about his position has been rife following reports that he may have been arrested, some months ago. This conjecture appeared to have been unfounded as he maintained his position and had been a visible member of the regime until very recently, although his absence may have been due to poor health. The KCNA's May Day report, however, seems to have definitively denuded him of his power. In the same piece that effectively coronated Hwang, Choe was referred to as a party secretary in charge of labor groups -- a relatively minor position. Political consolidation . It's not the first time that Kim, who took power in 2011, has made personnel changes at the top. Moves -- some more high profile than others -- seem to be efforts by Kim to consolidate his position by elevating his own confidantes over those who served his father, the late Kim Jong Il. In December 2013, he removed his uncle by marriage, Jang Song Thaek, from his position as top adviser and one of the most influential persons in the political hierarchy of North Korea in a very public purge. Kim had the man who was considered to be a close adviser of the scion of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the North since the Korean War, executed and all but wiped from the record. Despite the eggshells that seem to surround the country's most influential political positions, it is not thought that Choe has suffered the same fate as Jang. Purge unlikely . A Unification Ministry source told the New York Times that it is unlikely that Choe has been purged. Seasoned North Korea watchers echo the line. An editorial on the independent specialist site NK News said that ""it appears ... Choe is not being purged so much as being gradually phased out of power,"" while 38 North said that the news showed ""so far no indication that it represents another broad purge such as occurred with Jang Song Thaek last December."" The move comes as the international community suspects the secretive state to be gearing up for another nuclear test, as well as rattling its neighbors with further live fire drills.

"(CNN) -- Take away the 100-foot screens, the blasting lasers, and the holographic projections, and what do you have left? Tens of thousands of screaming electronic music fans with nothing much to cheer except a solitary figure, twiddling some knobs and occasionally raising his hand. For EDM fans across the world, the festival and concert visual performances can be almost as crucial as the music -- transforming a DJ-set into an unforgettable, transcendent, multi-sensory experience. In the hands of specialist artists, the lights, images and physical environment around the DJ are becoming an art form in their own right. Buoyed by the explosion of popularity of live electronic music -- plus technological advances like projection mapping, innovative VJ (video jockey) software, mushrooming visual computing power, and those famous holograms -- these artists are now getting the chance to display their creations on a spectacular scale. Here, we look at six of the names working behind the stage to turn festivals and concerts into unforgettable immersive experiences. Comix -- Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Alesso . Avicii's 2014 arena tour was a jaw-dropping spectacle -- glittering with laser-fire, pyrotechnics, and epic on-screen visuals -- that promised that the young artist could pack out arenas across the world just as well as more established names. The company behind everything on screen are London designers Comix, and for sheer mesmerizing hypnotism, give Avicii a miss and look at their work on Swedish House Mafia's ultimate ""One Last Tour."" Strangeloop -- Flying Lotus, Skrillex, Erykah Badu . If anyone was born to take music visuals to cinematic new heights, it was David Wexler, AKA Strangeloop. The grandson of Academy Award-winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler and the son of Oscar-nominated production sound mixer Jeff Wexler, the L.A.-born artist has worked with dubstep star Skrillex (whose spasmodic performance visuals have also seen him recreated movement-for-movement as a giant robot), and ""soul goddess"" Erykah Badu. But it all started with his art school classmate Flying Lotus -- Wexler and the experimental music idol have worked together since 2008. Eyesupply -- Armin van Buuren, Afrojack . Armin van Buuren's six-hour long all-night ""Armin Only"" marathons this year called for a different kind of visual display. Eyesupply's Carlo Ruijgers said it took his team a year working with Armin to pull together the creative ideas. In the end the key was contrast: ""Sometimes we go very theatrical, do a fairytale environment... or 3D-oriented,"" says Ruijgers. United Visual Artists -- Massive Attack, Hans Zimmer . Bafta-winning documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis called it a ""gilm."" (It's cross between a gig and a film.) His collaboration with British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack was intended to be a lot more than a DJ set. Tracks ranging from Russian punk to English pop trio The Sugababes synced to a video performance billed as an immersive revelation of the ""illusion of democracy."" The performance drew on the expertise of United Visual Artists, who have been making incredible visual displays for the band for more years. The Light Surgeons -- Chase and Status, Cinematic Orchestra . The Light Surgeons have invented something they're calling ""Live Cinema."" It's an on-screen viusal performance, improvised live like a jazz band. It's similar to how VJs are working behind the scenes at a festival, anyway -- splicing clips together on-the-fly to match the ebb-and-flow of a DJ set. Here, they're in control of everything -- creating cinematic narratives (like this ""kaleidoscopic view of the cultural landscape of Malaysia"") to tell grand stories. And they make killer videos for top DJs, too. Universal Everything -- Coldplay, George Michael . Electronic music's influence has seen visuals develop across genres. Kate Bush's comeback shows and Radiohead's most recent tour stunned fans with on stage performances and visual madness. And ""dad rock"" has realized it doesn't have to be boring, either. Even dishwater ballad monsters Coldplay have signed up a company who make screen-drippingly beautiful 3D animations. Just watch this. Who have we missed?

"(CNN) -- I have a distinguished astrophysicist friend who sets an alarm to ring every 15 minutes when he's at work. As soon as it does, he closes his eyes for nine seconds, takes a deep breath and collects himself. The break represents only 1% of his working day â€” nine seconds every 900 â€” and yet it's a regular reminder to him to look up as well as down, to ensure he's not overheating and to put his work within a larger frame. The man is not a New Age flake or idler; he has been a fellow for 33 years at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, Einstein's old home, and I first met him at the World Economic Forum in Davos. But he's a seasoned scientist who's aware, from empirical research, that the best way of completing a task, often, is to look away from it; it's the pause in a piece of music that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. As J.P. Morgan used to say, I'm told, of his habit of taking two months off every year, ""I can get done in 10 months what I could never do in 12."" It's an old principle, as old as the Buddha or Marcus Aurelius: We need at times to step away from our lives in order to put them in perspective. Especially if we wish to be productive. It's no coincidence that the word ""holiday"" suggests a holy day, or that the longest book in the Torah concerns the Sabbath. If you wish to advance in any sphere, the best way is to take a retreat. Has the need for taking a break -- a breath -- ever been so urgent as right now? Sociologists studying time diaries have found that Americans are working fewer hours, at home and in the office, than they were in the 1960s, but they feel they're working more. The more time-saving devices we own, the less time we seem to have. It takes 25 minutes to recover from a phone call or an e-mail, researchers have found, and yet the average person receives such an interruption every 11 minutes. Which means that we're never caught up; we're always out of breath, running behind. Many of us know that Google has regularly given its workers 20% of their paid time off, to let their minds go foraging, setting up meditation programs and trampolines to offer them a more imaginative space. Intel experimented with giving 300 of its executives and engineers a four-hour ""quiet period"" every Tuesday morning, when they were asked not to take calls, handle e-mails or engage in idle chat, and the fortunate specimen cases found the results to be so invigorating that they suggested the program be expanded. Fully a third of American companies now have stress-reduction programs, if only because stress is costing them $300 billion a year, and the World Health Organization is quoted as calling stress ""the health epidemic of the 21st century."" But what of those of us who don't work for enlightened companies willing to allow us to go to the mental health club as readily as to the fitness center? Well, relief is always close at hand. Most people I know nowadays go for a run every day, or practice yoga, or cook after work, taking conscious measures to step out of the pace that technology has imposed on us and return to something human. A friend at Google reminds me that it's always easy just to step into a conference room, close the door and close one's eyes. When I was working in a very high-pressure job in a 25th floor office in Midtown Manhattan, I would take myself to a long, multi-course tea mid-afternoon, and be amazed at how much better and more directed my work was when I returned. All of us are feeling scattered and distracted as we try to keep up with an accelerating world. But nearly all of us have an answer in our hands, in simply choosing to do nothing and go nowhere for a while. I once got onto a plane in Frankfurt for a 12-hour flight to Los Angeles, and a young, attractive German woman came down and set next to me. She engaged in friendly and highly animated conversation for thirty minutes or so, and then politely turned away and sat where she was. She never played with her video monitor or took out a book. She didn't even sleep. She simply sat, for the next eleven hours, visibly still. As we prepared to land, I asked her about this, and she explained that she had a very draining job, as a social worker. She was now on her way to a five week holiday in Hawaii, and she wished to use the flight just to get all the stress out of her system and to detoxify. The next flight I took, I tried the same: No movie, no work-related reading. Just a chance to take my mind for a walk, or let it do nothing at all. When I awoke next morning, I felt as if I was ready to remake the world. Read more: . Could being quiet help you get ahead .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When people think of coffee, words such as caffeine, aroma and energy may spring to mind. 'Good breath,' however, certainly isn't one of them. Mel Rosenberg at work in his 'smell laboratory' found that coffee can lead to good breath. So researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel, were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath, showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath. Breath specialist Mel Rosenberg of the university's Faculty of Medicine found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt, or smelt. ""Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath,"" Rosenberg told CNN ""and as a latte drinker, I believe that too."" But the malodor doesn't necessarily come from the coffee itself, said Rosenberg: ""We think that coffee, which has a dehydrating effect on the mouth, can ferment into bad breath when mixed with substances such as milk."" This meant that until recently, coffee was up there with not eating a healthy breakfast, not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol as causes for unpleasant mouth odors. But until Rosenberg's study, no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath. Rosenberg's team wanted to prove just that. They did the research by taking saliva and incubating it with different brands of coffee including the Israeli brand Elite coffee, Landwer Turkish coffee, and Taster's Choice. ""We thought this coffee and saliva mixture would have a terrible odor, but incredibly it had the opposite effect."" Rosenberg -- who also created popular mouthwash Dentyl pH -- is now thinking about creating a mouthwash, toothpaste, or chewing gum based on coffee. The effects could be similar to plant extracts such as clove oil, which have also been shown to have anti-bacterial properties that prevent bad breath. But first Rosenberg would have to find which of the hundreds of components in coffee are the ones that have these beneficial properties. ""That will take a long time"" said Rosenberg. ""But this research has already been a lesson in humility, showing that assumptions are not always correct."" Rosenberg -- who also writes children's books such as 'Mel the Smell Dragon' -- told CNN. ""And sometimes, getting it wrong can create even more interesting outcomes.""","A new study surprised researchers when it found coffee can lead to good breath .

"Washington (CNN) -- FBI Director James Comey says new encryption standards by Apple and Google will create ""a black hole for law enforcement"" that will help sophisticated criminals avoid detection. Comey is taking up the FBI's years-long push to expand federal surveillance law to require tech companies to include a way for law enforcement to get court ordered access to data on new devices. ""The law hasn't kept pace with technology,"" Comey said in remarks at the Brookings Institution. ""This disconnect has created a significant public safety problem. We call it 'going dark,' and what it means is this: those charged with protecting our people aren't always able to access the evidence we need to prosecute crime and prevent terrorism."" Related - FBI Director: iPhones shield pedophiles from cops . Comey says he understands privacy concerns in the wake of the disclosures of NSA surveillance by former contractor Edward Snowden. He says the government's ability to do surveillance and what it does access is overstated. Apple and Google have started selling new operating systems for cellphones that they explicitly market as encrypted beyond the reach of law enforcement. Even with a court order the company cannot let law enforcement get into the devices, unless the data is uploaded to cloud computers. ""But uploading to the cloud doesn't include all of the stored data on a bad guy's phone, which has the potential to create a black hole for law enforcement. And if the bad guys don't back up their phones routinely or of they opt out of uploading to the cloud, the data will only be found on the encrypted devices."" People trying to evade law enforcement are most likely to ensure their data can't be accessed, Comey said. ""Sophisticated criminals will come to count on these means of evading detection. It's the equivalent of a closet that can't be opened. A safe that can't be cracked.""","FBI Director James Comey is worried that encryption technology by Apple and Google could help criminals .

"(CNN) -- What if, instead of picking up a smartphone or touching a mouse, you could just say, ""Remind me to buy shampoo,"" ""Play some bluegrass music,"" or ""How many moons does Saturn have?"" in the middle of your living room? Last week, Amazon unveiled an unusual product, Echo. It's a $199 stand-alone smart speaker with a splash of Siri and no screen. It has a far-field microphone that can hear a voice clearly from across a room. Utter the keyword ""Alexa,"" and the speaker's virtual assistant springs to life, ready to answer questions, provide news updates and set personal reminders. It takes the intelligence and voice-recognition of Siri and puts it someplace unexpected, inside a smart home device. Even when it's alseep, Echo is still listening for the trigger phrase that will turn it on and start streaming your voice to the cloud. If a music speaker can listen and reply to your voice, why not a connected thermostat like Nest? In a few years, we will fill our homes with ""smart"" clocks, refrigerators, TVs and security systems. Together, they'll help voice assistants break out of single devices to be available anywhere in your house, car or workplace. The biggest tech companies are betting that these voice-activated interfaces will be the next major way we interact with our computers. Amazon's Alexa joins Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Google's, well, Google in a race to be the dominant speech assistant. Apple's Siri has an optional always-listening mode called ""Hey Siri"" but it only works when the device is plugged in. The Moto X and Kinect for Xbox 360 also offer perpetual listening for their voice controls. ""Over the past decades, there has been a series of 'battles' to gain market share at the point where users interface with computers,"" said Adam Cheyer, the co-founder of Siri. It started with operating systems, then search engines and most recently app stores. Now those same companies, and some new players like Amazon, are looking ahead to voice interfaces that can communicate in natural sounding language. ""I think the major companies have to get into this game or risk not having direct interaction with a user,"" said Cheyer. Amazon's attempt at building a phone failed, but the company is determined to be an entry point for the Internet. The Echo isn't available yet, but Cheyer thinks the company has the resources and experience to create a solid voice-activated assistant. It has also been quietly buying relevant companies like Evi, Yap and Ivona. ""Building a high-quality voice assistant with broad capabilities is not trivial and typically requires the expertise and resources of big companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, with many Ph.D.s and machines and technologies,"" said Cheyer. Most small smart-device manufacturers wouldn't be able to make their own interface, but down the line they might be able to license existing assistants. Cheyer's new company, Viv Labs, is working on an intelligent assistant that will be open to third-party developers. Computers that understand regular spoken language and can follow instructions, even chat back, are big in science fiction, most famously Star Trek's ""Computer,"" Hal 9000 and the recent film ""Her."" The computers of the future aren't just highly intelligent, they all seem to have fantastic, ubiquitous, invisible microphones. We are still a long way from artificially intelligent assistants. But as voice-activated interfaces show up in more products like Echo, every corner of every room has the potential to be quietly listening for our next command.","Amazon's new speaker Echo has a Siri-like smart assistant that is always listening .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's economic powerhouse was once thought of as the ugly sister to Rio de Janeiro's beach-fronted glamour. São Paulo, the world's fifth-largest city, is the fashion capital of Brazil. But, over the past few years, São Paulo's fashion, music and design scenes have gained such momentum that it's tipped by some as a cooler destination than more touristy Rio. True, São Paulo doesn't have a beach, nor does it go out of its way to cater to foreign visitors, but hidden in the sprawl is a trove of hip hotels and restaurants, modernist architecture and some of the best shopping south of the Equator. It would take a lot longer than a day to discover everything São Paulo has to offer, but our guide should help visitors short on time to navigate the city's immense grid of skyscrapers and traffic jams to find an entirely different Brazilian experience. Watch the sun come up over the world's fifth-largest urban area like many of its mega-wealthy inhabitants -- with a helicopter ride over the city. Tourist rides normally leave from Campo de Marte Airport and take in aerial views of city landmarks such as Ibirapuera Park and Avenida Paulista. You may have worked up an appetite by now, so head back into town for breakfast on Rua Oscar Freire, São Paulo's answer to Rodeo Drive. Eat delicious cheese bread known as pão de queijo, fruit, yoghurt and granola, and wash it down with a freshly squeezed juice or coffee at Oscar Cafe. The prosperous, tree-lined avenues of the surrounding area, known as Jardims, are perfect for a bit of shopping. Look out for Clube Chocolate, where you can buy upscale designerwear in divine surroundings (Rua Oscar Freire 913) and Endossa, a collaborative shop filled with cubes of shelving where entrepreneurs can rent a cubby-hole to sell their wares. From here it's possible to walk to Avenida Paulista, São Paulo's financial district, and there you can mill past some of the most expensive real estate in South America with the Paulistano businessfolk on your way to take in some culture at MASP, also known as São Paulo Museum of Art. Once you've had your fill of high culture, take in some of São Paulo's famous street art on Beco de Batman, which translates as ""Batman Alley."" Every inch of this street in the super hip Vila Madalena area is covered in graffiti, much of it by well-known local artists. Recharge your batteries with a beer and snack on empadas, delicious miniature pies with a variety of fillings like palm hearts, Portuguese salted fish and cheese at Empanadas (Rua Wisard 489, Vila Madalena). Otherwise, why not hop in a cab and head over to Liberdade to check out the home of the biggest Japanese community anywhere in the world outside Japan? Check out the Buddhist temple (Rua São Joaquim), karaoke bars and sushi restaurants -- one of the best of which is Takô (Rua da Glória 746, Liberdade). With its green-copper facade, the Hotel Unique is just one example of São Paulo's stunning modern architecture. The highlight of this area, if you happen to be lucky enough to be there at the right time, is the anything-goes weekend market Feira da Liberdade (Praça da Liberdade), and if you're even luckier you might catch one of the sumo competitions held there from time to time. After all these hours in the concrete jungle you may be longing for a bit of green, which you can find in ample supply in the enormous Ibirapuera Park. As you wander the tree-lined walkways, dodging throngs of body-conscious Paulistanos exercising along the way, you will encounter one masterpiece of modernist architecture after another -- mostly designed by the father of Brazilian modernism Oscar Niemeyer. Look out for the beautiful sci-fi dome, Oca, and the Grande Marquise, an extraordinary white pavilion that houses MAM (Museu de Arte Moderna) and features expanses of covered concrete which attract many of the city's skateboarders. No visit to São Paulo, or indeed any part of Brazil, is complete without trying a caipirinha -- a winning combination of the local firewater, cachaça, smashed limes, sugar and ice. If spirits are a bit much for you, try a divine -- and very Paulistano -- twist on the original with squished kiwi fruit and sake. You could combine a few cocktails with catching the final rays of the day on the rooftop of another of São Paulo's modernist masterpieces, Edifício Itália (Terraza Italia Restaurant, Avenida Ipiranga 344). Here you can enjoy a breathtaking panorama, with another Niemeyer masterpiece -- the wavy-façaded Edifício Copan -- in full view. It's got to be dinner time by now. In São Paulo your options are almost unlimited. With huge populations of Japanese, Italians and even Lebanese, the problem is not where to eat but how to choose. A highlight of São Paulo's dining scene has to be Restaurante Figueira Rubaiyat, where you can eat awesome steaks and very good seafood in a dining room that has been built around an enormous fig tree. If you're still rearing to go after that little lot, São Paulo's nightlife options are almost endless. You can shake your moneymaker with the best of them at one of the city's clubland stalwarts Love Story, or if you are looking for something a little more low-key, then why not round off the day on the rooftop terrace of the Skye Bar at Hotel Unique. The hotel's space-age green copper façade is indeed unique, and it is also a good bet for a bed for the night in really special surroundings.","São Paulo's art, fashion and music scene means it's no longer second to Rio .
Among the grid of skyscrapers is iconic modernist architecture by Oscar Niemeyer .
Uniquely Brazilian, the city also has a twist of other cultures .
Do what the Paulistanos do and sample street-side delicacies and top cocktails ."
"(CNN) -- Its record on dealing with racist abuse has been mixed and now Russia has been urged by a leading anti-apartheid activist to show a tougher approach to the issue ahead of hosting the 2018 World Cup. The man who led South Africa's successful World Cup bid in 2010, Danny Jordaan wants Russia to start implementing life bans for any players or individuals found guilty of racism within football. ""Given our own history as South Africa as a country and given our struggle against apartheid and racism...this is an issue that Russia must give serious attention to,"" Jordaan told CNN's Amanda Davies. In the past, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko has insisted there is no major racism problem in the country, though earlier this month FC Rostov coach Igor Gamula said he did want to sign a Cameroonian because the club has ""enough dark-skinned players, we've got six of the things."" Gamula, who apologized for his comments, was given a five-game ban. During this season's Champions League leading Russian club CSKA Moscow has had to play its games behind closed doors because of fan abuse toward black players. That punishment was handed out by European governing body UEFA. And in an interview with the Associated Press, FIFA anti-racism adviser Tokyo Sexwale suggested black players might even boycott the 2018 World Cup, saying ""there are certain parts [of Moscow where] if you are my color it's unsafe."" Jordaan, who began to campaign against apartheid in the 1970s, argued there should be ""no compromise"" on the issue of racism in football. ""You've already seen the response from some of the leading players on the African continent,"" said Jordaan. ""We will certainly, at the level of the Confederation of African Football and FIFA, raise these issues because we cannot see the same teams there that will be subjected to racial abuse and threats."" Jordaan pointed to the NBA's leadership in dealing with Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Donald Sterling, banning him for life after privately taped racist remarks were leaked to celebrity website TMZ.com. ""In our own country we opposed both legislation and the conduct of racists in our country -- they must be confronted,"" added Jordaan, referring to his own country's history in dealing with apartheid. ""It must be dealt with severely. There must be decisive and very strong action. ""Such individuals certainly have no right to take charge of human-beings if the understanding is not that every human-being has equal worth. There are no players and things in the same team -- it's just unacceptable."" Earlier in November, the head of FIFA's disciplinary committee Claudio Sulser insisted the world governing body would deal with any racism at the World Cup. Russia's 2018 Local Organizing Committee was not immediately available for comment.","Russia should impose life bans on anyone found guilty of racist abuse in football .

"(CNN) -- You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, but Iowa Republicans are willing to put a few into a neighborhood dispute involving chickens and Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley's yard. It should be something that went no further than a community newsletter, but one of the neighbors is Braley, a U.S. congressman who grew up and owns a home in the Holiday Lake neighborhood. The others are Pauline Hampton and her four chickens, which run freely into both backyards, sometimes leaving evidence of their cross-property line roaming. With primary over, Iowa Senate race gets ugly . It's that evidence -- chicken stuff -- that made Braley and his wife cry fowl. Hampton said she was surprised to learn in May about a complaint the Braleys lodged with the Holiday Lake Neighborhood Association. ""Mrs. Braley was out with her lawnmower, and I thought, because I do this with all my neighbors, I'd give them fresh, organic eggs,"" Hampton told CNN. ""I had offered them to her and she says, 'I can't accept them because I've filed a formal complaint against you.' And that was the first I ever heard of it, so I just went ahead and said, 'OK,' you know, I took my eggs back."" Hampton says the chickens were approved by the homeowners association because she uses them for therapeutic purposes as a court-appointed child advocate. An attorney for the housing association wrote an email to the board in May, which a Republican media outlet obtained and printed, saying the congressman wants to avoid a ""litigious situation,"" but that the chickens ""should not be permitted."" CNN reached out to the attorney to confirm the authenticity of the email, but he declined to speak on the matter. In response to the complaint, Hampton built a pen for the chickens, though ""in the evenings, yes, I do let them run in my yard,"" she said. While she watches them as they roam, they sometimes cross onto the Braley property. Republicans have seized on the situation, saying Braley, a trial lawyer, is threatening to sue Hampton, a military veteran, which is not in true ""Iowa nice"" fashion. Braley has denied the accusation, and no suit has been filed. First lady to campaign for Democrat in tight Iowa Senate race . ""It's just one of those ridiculous election-year political things that comes up,"" Braley told CNN. ""Nobody in Iowa cares about chickens at Holiday Lake in terms of how it's going to affect their vote in the Senate. What they care about is what you do, and what you can bring to the table to make their lives better because they care about the future."" Braley may be right. While this issue has been in the news for months, the latest CNN poll from Iowa shows him deadlocked with his opponent, Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst, 49% to 48%, respectively, within the poll's margin of error. Previously polls have found the same result, or had a slight edge for Ernst. CNN has found no reliable polling on the chicken dispute. ""What's so strange about this story is it's an example of where, when somebody else's animals are in your yard, you're the bad neighbor,"" Braley said. As for Hampton, a longtime Democrat who says she's voted for Braley in all four of his previous congressional races, the chicken dispute hasn't cost him her vote yet. ""I am weighing my options,"" she said. ""It gives me some thoughts to ponder. I wouldn't necessarily say I wouldn't vote for him because of just this."" CNN chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Roaming chickens in Senate candidate's neighborhood becomes issue in Iowa .

"(CNN) -- Five months after being injured in a deadly limo bus crash, Tracy Morgan is fighting to return to the person he once was, his lawyer said Tuesday. And it seems the ""30 Rock"" star's injuries weren't just the broken ribs, broken nose and broken leg that were previously reported. According to attorney Benedict Morelli, the 46-year-old comedic actor also suffered a ""severe brain injury."" ""Mr. Morgan is a fighter,"" Morelli said, according to NJ.com. ""He's fighting to get better. And if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that. But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury."" Police: Driver charged in Tracy Morgan crash was awake 24 hours . On June 7, Morgan was a passenger on a limo bus that was rear-ended by a Walmart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. The crash killed Morgan's friend and fellow comedian James McNair, and left Morgan and his other companions with injuries. As previously reported, a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board showed that the Walmart truck was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit, and that its driver was almost at his drive-time limit. In July, Morgan and three others filed suit against Walmart, stating in a complaint that ""the defendants' negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing plaintiffs' injuries."" Tracy Morgan sues Walmart over deadly crash . The retailer responded in September by placing part of the blame on Morgan and the other passengers, saying that the injuries sustained were ""caused, in whole or in part, by plaintiffs' failure to properly wear an appropriate available seat belt restraint device."" The driver who was operating the Walmart truck, Kevin Roper, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by automobile. Tracy Morgan: I can't believe Walmart is blaming me . On Tuesday, as representatives for both sides in the lawsuit arrived in court for a scheduling conference, Morelli said that ""the jury is still out"" on whether Morgan will be able to fully recover. ""When you have a traumatic brain injury, it takes a very long time to find out how you're going to do and how much you're going to recover,"" Morelli said. ""So that's where he is. He's still fighting and trying to live his life at the same time and trying to get better, and he's just not better. We're hoping and praying to get him back to where he was."" Morgan, who spent weeks in the hospital and rehabilitation following the crash, showed gratitude to his fans in September for their continued support. ""I want to thank my fans for sticking with me during this difficult time,"" the ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran said. ""I love you all. I'm fighting hard every day to get back.""","Tracy Morgan's lawyer says the actor sustained ""severe"" brain injury in June crash .

"(CNN) -- Beyonce's hit song ""Run the World (Girls)"" could very well have been the theme music for the world of comedy in 2011. One month after the song's April release, ""Bridesmaids"" -- a movie seen as a risky box office proposition when it first came out -- landed in theaters, drawing in audiences (of both genders) in droves. Some $169 million later, having quickly surpassed the records for highest grossing female-driven comedy and highest grossing Judd Apatow-produced comedy, it has also helped transform Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and the rest of the cast into major stars while also racking up Golden Globe and Screen Actors' Guild nominations. So, looking back, why was it seen as so risky? Quite simply, as ""Bridesmaids"" co-star Ellie Kemper put it to CNN earlier this year, ""There aren't a lot of huge studio films with huge female ensembles."" Kona Gallagher writes for CliqueClack.com and pointed out that, ""We still have a long way to go in the way women are portrayed, especially in movies. For every 'Bridesmaids,' there are three depressing rom-coms in which a woman derives her self-worth from the success of her relationship."" Time will tell if that changes. There were also some changes on the small screen this year. As ""Bridesmaids"" surprised just about everyone in the movie business, the major television networks (otherwise known as ""SNL's"" Wiig, ""Mike and Molly's"" McCarthy and ""The Office's"" Kemper's day job employers), picked up a number of comedy series with female protagonists, all of which have since been successful enough to get a full season order. In fact, the only sitcom with a lead male character to get picked up for the remainder of the season is Tim Allen's ""Last Man Standing"" on ABC, as opposed to quickly canceled male-centric shows like ""Man Up"" and ""How to Be a Gentleman."" If there is one big star to come out of this TV season, it is Zooey Deschanel, whose show ""New Girl"" has beaten lead-in ""Glee"" in the ratings on several occasions. ""Zooey Deschanel is a genuine breakout star,"" said TV critic Ed Bark of the site UncleBarky's Bytes. ""Without her, maybe that show wouldn't work. She really makes the show. I instantly liked it, because she brought something very distinctive and appealing."" Deschanel's quirky (or ""adorkable,"" if you will) character is based in large part on ""New Girl's"" creator, first-time show runner Liz Meriwether. ""I think probably (after) 'Bridesmaids,' there's just sort of a feeling of more trust from the people in charge that women actually want to see shows and movies that are written and created by women as opposed to sort of shows created by men that women are just supposed to like,"" Meriwether told reporters in November. ""I feel like that trust just from a business sense is really important for empowering more women (who create) shows."" One such creator has not one, but two series that were given full seasons early on in the fall. Stand-up comic Whitney Cummings is the creator and star of the NBC sitcom ""Whitney,"" and the co-creator, with ""Sex and the City's"" Michael Patrick King, of ""2 Broke Girls."" The CBS series, about a street smart food server (Kat Dennings) who has to teach a former rich girl (Beth Behrs) how to get by, has been regularly appearing among the 10 shows with the highest ratings each week. ""It's very telling to the times -- our dealing with being broke and being in that time where it's hard to get a job, and I think people can relate to it,"" Behrs said. ""With 'New Girl,' the way they play with that relationship with her and the guys, it's very relevant to the times. I think that's one reason they're all so successful. And seeing women pushing boundaries, like on our show."" Indeed, one thing that sets ""2 Broke Girls"" apart is the bawdy dialogue between the two stars. ""Girls our age do talk like that a lot of the time,"" said Behrs. ""It's shocking, but a lot of what we say and do is very realistic to that, in our generation."" ""I remember growing up on 'I Love Lucy' reruns and I was always a big Carol Burnett fan,"" said Behrs. ""Women in comedy have been something I've followed my whole life. I don't think it's like, 'Look, we're letting women be funny.' Women have always been funny, it's just more recognizable, and there's just so much at once. It's not just one TV show, there's this influx of it -- and I'm definitely glad to be a part of that. I'm proud to be in the company of all these funny women."" Indeed, one only needs to say the two words ""Tina Fey"" (or ""Amy Poehler"", for that matter), to realize this moment has been a long time coming. ""What's really interesting to me about the surge of women in television and film comedies is that a large part of it is really driven by 'Saturday Night Live,'"" said Gallagher. ""Lorne Michaels is directly responsible for Tina Fey being able to do '30 Rock,' which really kicked off the whole movement by showing that women can be the driving force of comedy on a show, instead of just the beleaguered wife reacting to her husband's jokes. Michaels also produces 'Up All Night,' which does a great job of letting both Christina Applegate and Maya Rudolph shine, even in a more traditional sitcom setting."" ""Up All Night"" stars Applegate and Will Arnett as a couple adjusting to a new baby, and in a change of pace for TV, even in 2011, Applegate works as a producer for a talk show host, played by Rudolph, while Arnett's character stays home with their daughter. Rudolph, who also starred in ""Bridesmaids,"" was asked about the movie having positive implications for women in comedy, shortly after ""Up All Night"" (created by her writing partner, Emily Spivey) premiered on NBC. ""Having people say that out loud certainly doesn't hurt. It's just kind of surprising to me because if I knew people felt that way I think I would have thrown in the towel a long time ago,"" she said. ""I'm just going to keep my head down and keep doing what I'm doing, because it shouldn't matter, because that's not what I'm doing it for. But if it allows people like me and my friends more work and more jobs, it's great. But I'm not going to lie. It's surprising to hear that people are really that behind the times."" Rudolph isn't the only former ""SNL"" female cast member joining prime time with Fey and Poehler. Ana Gasteyer, is a regular presence on ABC's new hit, ""Suburgatory,"" which focuses on a teenage girl's move from New York City to the suburbs. ""We always looked at the fictitious suburban town, Chatswin, as being the land of the moms. The idea was this family without a mom moves into a town that is dominated and run by moms,"" said Emily Kapnek, creator of the show, who like Behrs was also a big Carol Burnett fan growing up. ""Creating an ensemble of these women who -- parenting is their full time job, not just parenting these children but other people's children. We found the best and brightest we could think of to populate this world."" Those moms include Cheryl Hines of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" in the scene-stealing role of Dallas Royce. ""I think you're getting roles for women that are written by women that come at it differently and feel in some ways more authentic,"" said Kapnek. ""I was a single mom when I had my older son, and everyone wanted a single mom show and I was always so surprised at the way they wanted to develop those shows. 'Why does she have to be perfect? Why isn't she a mess, why doesn't she fall down on her face?' I think right now, we have so many female show runners, you have a more undiluted feed to what their point of view is and I think people are identifying with that and it feels different."" Bark said that women being behind the camera more and more will be the most important thing. ""This season, (that development) is welcome and it should continue and if these shows work, it will continue."" (On that note, already on tap for 2012: NBC's ""Are You There, Chelsea?"" and ABC's ""Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23."") As for right now, ""New Girl's"" Meriwether said that it's great to see the diversity of shows by and about women being produced. ""I personally think that they are all really funny, so I'm just really happy to be sort of a part of this, whatever it is ... new moment, I guess.""","""Bridesmaids"" broke box office records in 2011, part of female dominance in comedy .

"Lille, France (CNN) -- Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka each faced questions heading into Switzerland's Davis Cup final in France. For Federer, how would his tender back hold up? For Wawrinka, would he recover after a tough -- and contentious -- loss to his higher-profile Swiss at the World Tour Finals in London last week? We got our answers Friday at the Stade Pierre Mauroy on a record setting day in Lille -- but for once Federer wasn't the one rewriting the history books. In front of the largest ever tennis crowd for a pro match -- at 27,432 it eclipsed the 27,200 that turned up to watch Spain beat the U.S. in a converted Seville bullring in the 2004 Davis Cup final -- Federer not only fell to Gael Monfils but couldn't put up much of a fight. The 6-1 6-4 6-3 result against Monfils -- who piped down his histrionics -- marked his most lopsided defeat in 45 singles matches in the competition. ""You accept the fact that you're playing the way you feel,"" Federer told reporters. ""But it wasn't all negative. I started to feel better as the match went on. That's very encouraging, I must say."" Also encouraging for Federer and the Swiss, Wawrinka thumped a listless Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day. Federer's performance, coupled with France's apparent advantage in Saturday's doubles, means it's the home team who'll be happier come the end of play. One of the two major titles to elude Federer in his glittering career is a Davis Cup crown and how disappointed he must have been that on his debut in a Davis Cup final he was at less than full strength. Monfils, however, remains one of the most athletic players in the game and owned a pair of wins over Federer. With French captain Arnaud Clement able to rein him in during changeovers, he played focused tennis. ""Definitely one of the top three matches in my life,"" said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open. Monfils broke early in the first and facing an immediate break point, struck a courageous second-serve ace that delighted his many fans. Clay can be classified as the least forgiving of surfaces when it comes to unforced errors, which made Monfils' tally of 44 winners and 18 unforced errors extremely impressive. In truth at times he was quick to pounce on short Federer balls. He earned the key break at 2-2 in the third in breath-taking fashion, slamming a forehand down the line and later in the game sliding into his backhand prior to sending it past Federer and down the line. And what a way to end it: Monfils produced another shot down the line, a backhand from a difficult angle. Wawrinka, meanwhile, sparkled against French No. 1 Tsonga, displaying some of the artillery that won him the Australian Open in January for a maiden grand slam title. His stats were even better than Monfils' -- 61 winners and 29 unforced errors. ""I know how to play those matches,"" Wawrinka said. ""I did so many big matches, so many important matches this year. ""Today it's important to show them that I'm there. They (were) maybe too focused (on) Roger and maybe they forgot about me."" He showed no after effects of the loss to Federer, when he blew four match points and was reportedly taunted by Federer's wife, Mirka. For large parts of the affair he targeted Tsonga's backhand with his own sublime one-handed backhand, easily getting the better of the 2008 Australian Open finalist. At one stage, even the crowd -- most of course were rooting for Les Bleus -- admired Wawrinka's laser-like backhand in reply to a slack Tsonga forehand volley. Wawrinka stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second, it appeared as if the Swiss No. 2's better form would see him cruise in three. But Tsonga hung on, altered the momentum and for a brief spell in the third set was in the ascendancy. The loudest the crowd got in the opener was in that third set, when an agitated Tsonga implored them off their feet when he saved a set point with an ace at 2-5. The outstretched arms of Clement at precisely the same time suggested an expression of, 'It's about time,' and the Swiss cow bells were temporarily silenced. There's no doubt that Wawrinka was slightly rattled. Tsonga smelled blood when Wawrinka trailed 0-30 on serve, but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match, realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points. Tsonga was annoyed with his performance but also with the French fans, who he felt weren't vocal enough. ""When the teams were introduced, they applauded Stan more than us, Roger more than us,"" he said. ""We hear the Swiss spectators more than we hear the French ones. ""Stan, for example, announced that the ball was out, and it was in. ""I just went to check the mark, and I was booed in my own country -- maybe not by the French spectators but by the Swiss spectators. It's annoying."" With Monfils' victory over Federer, it guaranteed so-called 'live' action Sunday and Clement would surprise a few if he stuck with the out-of-sorts Tsonga to begin the reverse singles. For the time being, Federer isn't ruling himself out of Saturday's doubles. ""Now I'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too,"" said Federer. ""It was not a five-setter (that left) me totally exhausted. So if I have to find something positive about it, I'll say that. ""But it is clear that I want to play better. If I play the doubles and the singles, it needs to be a lot better than today. Now I have the information and I know exactly what I have to do."" Wawrinka and Federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon Saturday.","Switzerland and France are tied after the opening day of the Davis Cup final in Lille .

"(CNN) -- Search-and-rescue dog handler Denise Corliss loves Disaster City. That's what the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service calls its 52-acre search and rescue training center in College Station, Texas. Disaster City is a classroom for chaos -- a manufactured jungle of concrete, rebar and other rubble you might find in the aftermath of a hurricane or explosion or the 9/11 attacks. ""It's like a playground for first responders,"" says Corliss, a member of the Texas Task Force 1 urban search and rescue team. ""It's like my second home."" Search and rescue teams travel to the facility from around the nation to receive training certified by the Federal Emergency Management Administration. Most of the trainees are human. Some are dogs. Hundreds of FEMA canine teams have trained at Disaster City. For 15 years, Corliss has spent two weekends a month at the center working with dogs. That includes her golden retriever, Bretagne, one of the last surviving 9/11 search and rescue dogs. Dogs and their handlers climb up and down the piles of concrete, hiding objects for canines to find. Trainers teach and test the dogs to hone their smelling and searching skills by sending them down into simulated tornado shelters and up into second story buildings. Back in 2001, Corliss and Bretagne (pronounced, ""Britney"") were fresh graduates of Disaster City when they were deployed to New York shortly after the World Trade Center attacks. Corliss joined hundreds of other search and rescue teams sent from around the world to find survivors at ground zero, working 12 hours a day for two weeks straight. We know now there were very few survivors found in the rubble of the twin towers, and Bretagne, like so many other searchers, worked hard -- only to find none. But Corliss discovered something unexpected: rescuers and firefighters would approach Bretagne and pet her. Soon they'd be sharing their personal stories with Corliss, describing the missing friends, loved ones and colleagues they were searching for. Bretagne had become a kind of therapy dog. ""Dogs can be so comforting, so it makes sense to me now,"" she says. ""I just didn't anticipate that, then."" 9/11 was only the first of many national disasters that called Bretagne and Corliss into action. Deployments followed for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and other storms. Once Corliss watched Bretagne risk her own safety when the dog found herself standing on the end of a dangling staircase. ""She walked to the edge of it and she stopped -- turned -- and she came back down,"" Corliss recalls. ""She did exactly what she was supposed to do, but it scared me a bit."" Despite all that training, Corliss admits ""there were still times when I held my breath and said, 'I hope she does this right. I hope she's OK.' "" Pushy puppy . It's no coincidence that search and rescue dogs such as Bretagne succeed while working under such dangerous conditions. From the time they're puppies, dogs must survive a rigid screening process before they can do this kind of work. When Corliss spotted Bretagne, she had a feeling this dog might be right. The puppy was pushy. Sharing a plastic kennel with eight other puppies, Bretagne buffaloed her way through the pack from back to front, to greet Corliss. ""That kind of pushy behavior helped her be the persistent don't-give-up-style of working dog that I needed later,"" says Corliss. A few other qualities Corliss says are key to good search and rescue dogs: . -- High toy drive: ""Their toy is their paycheck. We're looking for the dog that's going to be so over-the-top crazy for their toy that they're going to be happy going over this rubble pile."" -- High prey drive: ""They've got to be persistent. They're going to hunt for survivors, and continue to hunt, and not give up."" -- Nerve strength: ""We need dogs that are not going to be scared to climb a ladder up to the second story of a building -- alone without a handler â€” or to go down into a dark tunnel."" -- Focus: ""The dog can't be concerned about a nearby jackhammer or loud truck or crane or emergency sirens."" Bretagne left Texas Task Force 1 in 2009 to focus on her work as a local fire department search and rescue dog. Then after a couple more years, it was time for her to retire altogether. But that didn't mean the end of Bretagne's public service. Now 15, Bretagne spends time once a week teaching kids how to read. Really. She visits elementary school classrooms, where children, who ""may be intimidated or uncomfortable reading out loud to their classmates, have an opportunity to develop reading skills by reading to her,"" Corliss says. Corliss has raised and trained two other golden retriever search and rescue dogs: Aid'N, now 10 and retired, and Taser, age 3. Taser will continue the legacy that Aid'N and Bretagne have carried, dedicating their lives to helping people survive calamity. Flying drones and other robotic technology provide new options for search and rescue teams, but Corliss says dogs will always be a part of the toolbox, along with cameras and listening devices. ""I don't think there will ever be a substitute for their agility and sense of smell,"" she says. ""In that way, they're better than any other tool that we have out there.""","Bretagne, one of the last living 9/11 search and rescue dogs, trained at Disaster City .

"(CNN) -- Place a tennis ball into a yellow sock and tuck it into the back of your pants. Now start running. Congratulations! You are a snitch. Don't get caught, or the game ends. This is quidditch, as played by muggles. In JK Rowling's novels, the snitch is a sort-of magical, winged squash ball, pursued by ""seeker"" Harry Potter in a variety of high-stakes, airborne quidditch contests. Nobody on the UCLA campus has a magical, winged squash ball. A man with a tennis ball dangling from his shorts will have to do. ""The snitch is the surrealist aspect of the game,"" concedes Sebastian Milla, former UCLA quidditch player and star of a fly-on-the-wall documentary about his sport. Mudbloods -- a title taken from the novels' derogatory term for wizards with non-magical parents -- explores the result when you take a fictional sport and make it real. In 2005, eight years after the publication of the first Potter book, Vermont's Middlebury College gave birth to ""muggle quidditch,"" which translates Rowling's imaginary sport into our world. Nobody can fly, but a broom between the legs remains mandatory. Three circular goals are used at each end of the field, as per the books. Ten points are scored for getting the ""quaffle"" (a volleyball) through those hoops, and 30 for catching the snitch. Where magical ""bludgers"" are unavailable, they are replaced by dodgeballs thrown at rival players. Finally, and unusually, both magical and muggle quidditch are mixed-gender, full-contact sports. Becoming real . The intrigue for many viewers of Mudbloods will be seeing how this sport works, and discovering who wants to play a sport so closely associated with the world of fantasy fiction. ""It's hard to be taken seriously when people think you're a bunch of geeks,"" MIlla is heard to say as the documentary begins. Players, some of whom have never actually read the Harry Potter books, lament the disdain of athletes from other college sports. Training sessions attract intrigued crowds wielding camera phones. Filmmaker Farzad Sangari, who raised almost $27,000 on Kickstarter to make the documentary, says: ""If anybody actually watched it or played it, they would realize the amount of athleticism and mental dexterity it takes to play this sport."" Therein lies the dilemma for quidditch: how to take its next step and, like a sporting Pinocchio, become a real boy. Originally conceived as a light-hearted distraction for college students, the sport is easily looked down upon for its wizarding roots. Yet quidditch has almost surprised itself by creating groups of elite, dedicated, and athletic players across the United States. Ten thousand fans turned up to the last Quidditch World Cup. Nine years since the first official game, there is now a governing body -- US Quidditch -- with five full-time staff, led by commissioner Alex Benepe. ""We have 170 college club teams around the country, and most of them are official club sports who receive funding,"" Benepe tells CNN. ""Teams are increasingly competitive. Players have to go to tryouts and have mandatory practices."" At college level, the sport is stronger than ever. On top of that, the first generations of college players are graduating and taking quidditch into the wider world. Those graduates are finding each other and forming what the sport calls community teams, those clubs created beyond the bounds of college. ""Community teams have grown significantly and they're starting to get very good,"" says Benepe. Tom Marks, another former UCLA player depicted as the team's driving force in Mudbloods, adds: ""I wouldn't be surprised if, in the next half a decade, there was a separate league formed for community teams. ""They're going to become these all-star teams."" 'Completely unique' Yet for some people, this was supposed to be ""whimsical, grass-roots quidditch,"" as Benepe calls it. Now, Marks is talking ""all-star teams."" Can a sport inspired by Harry Potter really turn into a professional athletic endeavor? ""There are obviously moments where you can be nostalgic for how it started,"" says Benepe. ""There are certain core elements you don't want to change, ever -- the fact that it's co-ed, full-contact, is completely unique and that can really change the way people look at gender. ""But it's important that the league is always developing, and there's something really impressive about the idea of taking this from a book and growing it into a professional and legitimate sports entity. ""Somewhere down the line, a professional league would be really cool."" Each player interviewed by CNN brought up the word ""legitimacy."" ""It's not unique to quidditch,"" says Milla. ""There are a lot of sports that people don't really consider to be 'sport'. ""There's a narrow definition of sport that has a lot of things tied to it -- are the athletes paid millions of dollars? Is it televised? Sport is legitimized in different ways. ""I haven't met one person who has played quidditch and said, 'This isn't a sport.' All it takes is one or two games on that broom and you're exhausted."" For some observers, the idea of a ""snitch"" with a ball dangling from their pants, running across campus to evade capture, stops quidditch being taken seriously. 'People and respect' By contrast, Milla argues that is precisely why quidditch deserves recognition: it has something new to offer. ""The snitch is what sets quidditch apart from other sports. It makes you question what is important to you,"" he says, adding that games are often won or lost thanks to highly contentious decisions regarding who did, or did not, catch the snitch. ""You are going to lose on [unfair] snitch catches,"" he continues. ""So are you playing to win, or are you playing because you love this sport and your teammates and you think it's awesome? It makes you question what the entire point of doing these things is. ""One of the big problems we have in sport right now is that it has become so much about the winning, and paying the people who win, that it has stopped being human in a lot of aspects. ""That's why you're seeing a lot of domestic violence cases in the NFL, that's why you're seeing so much corruption in sports and sports industries. It's this whole, ugly scene. ""That's what I like about quidditch -- it is about teams, people, and respect."" Marks, who played alongside Milla at UCLA, hopes quidditch can hold on to its origins while maturing into a sport that's more high-performance, and less Hufflepuff. ""There are two camps, two mindsets,"" says the 23-year-old, now an assistant editor at PC Gamer. ""One is it should continue being this fun, open thing. The other is it is this aggressive sport that should be treated as such. I think it should do both. ""We should continue fostering that competitive environment because there are real athletes who really want to compete in this brand-new sport. ""But we also need to foster the ability for anyone to play. Not everybody has six hoops and 14 brooms in their back yard. The barrier to entry for quidditch is quite high. ""My hope is it becomes a competitive league on one side, and people doing this in the park on the other. I think the sport needs both sides to survive.""","'Muggle quidditch' replicates Harry Potter's magical sport in the real world .

"(CNET) -- Months after teasing us at CES with an announcement of Skype's native VoIP client for the iPhone, the free Skype for iPhone will finally be available to download from the iTunes App Store sometime on Tuesday. A new application will allow Internet chatting via Skype on Apple's iPhones. We got a chance to sit down with the application's principal engineer before the announcement was made at CTIA 2009, to see Skype for iPhone do its thing. While most of the features aren't too surprising--Skype does want to maintain some consistency across its mobile applications, after all--there are a few capabilities that are notably missing, and a few iPhone-only perks that are refreshing to see. In terms of navigation, Skype's VoIP app for iPhone looks more like your traditional iPhone app than it does Skype 4.0 for Windows. For many who already prefer Apple's sleek interface archetype, that's a triumph, but those who enjoy Skype's branding may feel disappointed. Skype's screens are well organized and use the iPhone's ability to add filters, for instance, to sort your contacts alphabetically, or by who's online. There's chatting as well, though Skype's flagship feature is its VoIP calling that's free to other Skype users and an inexpensive per-minute fee to landlines. Calls on Skype for iPhone work only if you're in range of a Wi-Fi network, so your call quality will in part be at the mercy and strength of wireless networks nearby--calls will not work over the cell phone network on the iPhone (but chatting will). Assuming your connection is solid, you can dial a number or quickly call a contacts stored in your address book. iPod Touch users will need earphones with an embedded mic to talk. During a call, you can mute the line, go on hold, or put the call on speakerphone. In the My Info window, you can follow a link to buy more SkypeOut credit online. Taking a photo from within Skype to serve as your avatar image, or pulling a picture in from the camera roll are two iPhone-only features that makes use of the phone's hardware attributes. Another imperfect, but still neat, feature is the ability to accept incoming conference calls. While you won't be able to initiate a call, we're told, you will be able to jump on one if a buddy invites you in. We hope the next version includes placing conference calls from the iPhone. Skype left a few more skills out of its maiden iPhone voyage. SMS, setting up a conference calling group, purchasing SkypeOut credit directly, and being able to field a second incoming Skype call are a few. File transferring and getting Skype voicemail native on the phone are two more. We expect to see at least two of these added in the next version, but we'll hope for more. Skype versus the competition . Here's the big question on our minds: will Skype's iPhone app replace competitors like Nimbuzz and Fring, which focus on cross-network IM but also include VoIP calls with Skype pals even though they've been available for the iPhone for months? Kurt Thywissen, the principal engineer for Skype for iPhone, thinks so. He says what the other apps use is a workaround that requires them to channel calls through a server and transcode audio, resulting in poorer-quality calls than Skype can do in its own app. He may be right, but those who IM more than they vocalize probably won't ditch the likes of Fring too soon. They might, however, let Skype handle the calls and let another app take care of the multinetwork chatting. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- You know those little ""winglets"" that point up from the tips of airliner wings? Those were developed by NASA. And, you know those little grooves in runways that channel away standing water? NASA again. America's space agency isn't just about space. It also develops ways to make our airliners safer and more efficient. Guess what? You may have been flying with NASA technology for years, and didn't even know it. Shape-shifting wings? They're coming . Now, an ongoing project could radically change the way airliners look and, more importantly, save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fuel costs. NASA calls it the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge project, or ACTE. It's best described in three words: Shape. Shifting. Wings. Those words sound like science fiction, but NASA and a company called Flexsys are developing wings that change shape in response to flight conditions and weather. Superflexible very strong composite materials make it possible. What does that mean to air travelers? You've probably looked out the window of an airliner to see the hinged metal flaps on the rear edge of a wing. New flexible materials allow the wing to change shapes without hinges. NASA shows off new flight technology . This week, NASA invited dozens of aerospace bloggers and social media mavens to see new aviation technology at its Armstrong Flight Research Center in California's High Desert, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. They got an exclusive look at NASA's flexible wing project and other ongoing research aimed at aviation. They also got a chance to hang out with engineers and pilots. Then, they tweeted about it. Project manager Tom Rigney compared the flexible wings to ""watching a bathtub bend. You don't expect something shaped like that to bend into a very fluid looking shape."" If these new wings end up on airliners in the coming decades, they'll transform our flying experience into smoother, more comfortable and less expensive journeys. But don't expect them until after 2025, said Rigney. So, the big question about the flexible wing is pretty simple: How does it work? That's a proprietary secret. NASA is prohibited from telling us. But here's what the NASA engineers could say: It morphs to compensate for changing flight conditions. In the future, ""a pilot could be flying through a strong gust and the wings adjust so passengers won't feel the forces of the gust,"" Rigney said. It could change the way engineers design airliner wings. ""Now we have wings that are made heavier to withstand gusts, but with this technology, they may not have to design heavy wings like that anymore,"" said Rigney. Moving wings in-flight . A three-member crew of a heavily modified NASA Gulfstream III has been flight testing this new wing material. Inside the cockpit sits a mascot: a little stuffed animal named Scrat, the prehistoric squirrel character from the film ""Ice Age."" NASA loves its acronyms, so Scrat has been defined as the ""SubsoniC Research Aircraft Testbed."" The test flights climb to around 40,000 feet and accelerate to about 75% of the speed of sound. Never far away is a chase plane, in case an issue comes up and they need an exterior set of eyes on the wings. The wing material ""is just one, smooth surface,"" said NASA test pilot Tim Williams. ""It's very, very solid."" Right now, the wing is adjusted before each flight, not while airborne. Once this test program is complete, the next step would be to design a new wing. ""I would think that wing would be moveable in flight,"" said Williams, ""and it will make a big difference."" Someday this new wing technology may join the list of NASA innovations that have made air travel safer and more convenient. Here are five big examples . 1. Airborne wind shear detection . A weather phenomenon called wind shear poses danger to airliners during takeoffs and landings. Wind shear involves sudden changes in wind speed, horizontally or vertically. Airplanes now have sensors that can predict it while in flight. In the 1980s and '90s, NASA conducted wind shear research and validated the technology surrounding the sensors. 2. Digital fly-by-wire . Older airliners used heavy cables and pulleys to connect the cockpit controls to the wings and tail. Now, thanks to NASA research in the 1960s and '70s, pilots control newer airliners via electronic wire-based systems. 3. Lightning protection standards . Airliners are safer from lightning strikes now, due to NASA research during the 1970s and '80s. What NASA learned has helped protect airliner avionics and electronics from damage by lightning strikes. 4. Engine nozzle chevrons . Chevrons -- serrated shapes on the rear edges of the nacelles, the jet engine housings -- cut noise in the cabin and on the ground. These were developed thanks to NASA computer simulations in the 1990s and 2000s. 5. Winglets . Vertical extensions developed by NASA during the 1970s and '80s led to airliner ""winglets,"" which allow planes to slice through the air more efficiently, saving fuel and money.","NASA and Flexsys are developing shape-shifting wings for airplanes .

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN)  -- Sarah Palin's not a quitter, she wants the public to know. Sarah Palin's attorney said there is no legal reason that compelled her to resign as governor. ""I am not a quitter. I am a fighter,"" Palin told CNN on Monday while on a family fishing trip, on the heels of her Friday bombshell announcement that she was resigning as Alaska's governor. Palin did her interview standing on the shores of Dillingham, Alaska, wearing waders. She granted 10-minute interviews to CNN and three other news networks Monday. She resigned because of the tremendous pressure, time and financial burden of a litany of ethics complaints in the past several months, she said. The complaints were without merit and took away from the job she wanted to do for Alaskans, Palin said. The decision to resign a year and a half before her term ends, and her rambling, often-disjointed resignation speech Friday, fueled days of debate among political analysts.  Watch Palin explain her decision » . Speculation has run rampant that Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008, will seek the presidency in 2012. When pressed about her future, Palin would say only that she would work in public service. She did not rule out a run for the White House or any other political office. Palin is to leave the governor's office in late July. The days since her resignation had been exhilarating and she loved being in Dillingham, a town of only a few thousand people and no cell phone service, Palin said. On Monday, her personal lawyer also spoke about her resignation. No legal ""bombshell"" or personal scandal lies behind Palin's resignation, but off-color jokes by talk-show host David Letterman contributed to her decision to step down, Thomas Van Flein said. The governor needed a break after being ""on duty now for two and a half years solid,"" he said. ""There is no bombshell. There is no shoe to drop. There are no investigations of any type that I'm aware of -- no IRS audit, no federal investigation, no state investigation,"" Van Flein told CNN. ""There is no legal reason in terms of a legal problem that compelled the governor to resign."" Friday was ""deliberately chosen"" for the announcement because of its proximity to the July Fourth holiday, Van Flein said: ""She declared her independence from politics as usual."" Palin reiterated that statement in her interview. Rep. Les Gara, an Anchorage Democrat and a frequent Palin critic, said everyone was ""wildly surprised"" by Palin's announcement. ""A lot of us were pretty disappointed in the concept that she can't finish out a governor's term,"" Gara said. Palin's resignation speech was ""kind of similar to everything that has gone wrong since the governor has gotten back from her vice presidential campaign,"" Gara said. ""When she came into office, everything was about openness and transparency, and now everything's about excuses,"" he said. But Rep. Jay Ramras, a Fairbanks Republican who leads the state House Judiciary Committee, said when it comes to public opinion, ""The concrete hasn't set up yet."" ""Those that seem to have responsibilities to manage businesses that manage people seem to be much less tolerant of what she did,"" Ramras said after attending Independence Day events over the weekend. Those people consider her ""a quitter,"" he said. ""And then there's another group, where Gov. Palin has been successful in being able to imply -- and certainly these people have inferred -- that she was a victim."" The 45-year-old governor had faced intense scrutiny since Sen. John McCain picked her out of relative obscurity to be his running mate last year. Though her acceptance speech drew rave reviews, her subsequent shaky performance in network news interviews, the drama surrounding her 18-year-old daughter's pregnancy and two ethics probes into her earlier firing of the state's public safety director dogged her throughout the rest of the campaign. ""In my opinion, she was the national campaign for Republicans last fall,"" Van Flein said. ""I know John McCain was the candidate, but the decision was really about Sarah Palin and could she take on Obama. That was a lot of weight on her shoulders to carry that campaign, and they almost pulled it off."" As Election Day neared with McCain trailing in the polls, campaign aides began sniping at Palin as a ""diva"" who ignored top advisers and lacked ""fundamental understanding"" of key issues in the race. The McCain-Palin ticket ultimately lost to Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden last November. Van Flein also said Palin would remain involved in public service, with no other decisions made at this point. But Gara said it was clear to him that Palin has her eye on another bid for national office.  Watch reaction to Palin's decision » . ""We can all guess,"" he said. ""My guess is the governor wants to be president, and that's what she should have said at her press conference."" Palin thought she would stop being a ""lightning rod"" once she returned to Alaska, but ""it never really did simmer down,"" Van Flein said. Ethics complaints from critics led to her paying back taxes on state per diem funds she received while living at her home in Wasilla, outside Anchorage; another investigation led to her paying about $8,100 in travel expenses for her children. Van Flein said the state's ethics process, which Palin signed into law, has been ""abused"" to harass her and may lead Alaskans to ignore more serious allegations. And he said Letterman's early June joke about one of her daughters being ""knocked up"" by New York Yankees outfielder Alex Rodriguez ""demonstrated to her that there's some sort of disconnect here."" ""When people don't accept normal bounds of decency making jokes like that about children, maybe this is not good for the state right now,"" Van Flein said. ""And maybe somebody else who is not the subject, and whose family is not the subject of this scrutiny, can move the state forward."" Letterman said the joke was aimed at Palin's older daughter, Bristol, who had a son with her high-school boyfriend in December. However, Palin was in New York traveling with her 14-year-old daughter Willow at the time, and she accused Letterman of making jokes about sex with an underage girl. The CBS ""Late Show"" host ultimately apologized, saying ""If you have to explain the joke, it's not a very good joke."" Despite leaving office about two-thirds of the way through her term, Palin ""is not a quitter,"" Van Flein said. He added that she ""already accomplished her major goals,"" including winning legislative approval for a massive natural gas pipeline. But Ramras, who calls himself ""a pro-development, conservative Republican,"" called that assertion ""crazy."" Though the pipeline project won approval in the state Legislature, Alaska has yet to establish a ""durable and predictable"" financial structure that will get producers to commit to the plan. ""Anyone who thinks we've started anything is delusional. ... What she did was she created a Gordian knot and then handed it off to someone else,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- As the developing world becomes more developed, the rise in prosperity in these countries could also result in the rise of a lethal infectious disease -- tuberculosis (TB). Changes in diets and lifestyles are taking place across emerging economies, particularly as more people move to urban settings to earn a living. The changes are resulting in higher rates of diseases such as type-2 diabetes. The condition decreases the body's ability to produce insulin and absorb glucose from the bloodstream and affected 382 million globally in 2013. The International Diabetes Federation predicts that over 70% of type-2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with the adoption of healthier lifestyles. Worryingly, diabetes also triples the risk a person will develop TB. Nine million people developed TB in 2013 and 1.5 million died from the disease, according to the World Health Organization. Today, increasing numbers of people affected by diabetes could hamper efforts to control new TB infections. Concern was raised in a recent report published by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases and the World Diabetes Foundation, warning of a burgeoning co-epidemic of the two diseases. Reduced immunity . Infection with TB does not always lead to someone developing the disease as the bacteria can hide and lie dormant within the immune system -- known as latent infection. On average, people have a 10% chance of an infection progressing to the active form of the disease. But when the integrity of your immune system is compromised, this chance increases. ""Diabetes reduces peoples immunity,"" says Dr. Anthony Harries, senior adviser to the International Union. The same biology underlies the interaction between TB and HIV, which attacks and destroys your immune system. ""Globally we have about 2 billion people with latent TB,"" says Harries. ""Put diabetes into that equation and you immediately see there is a problem."" TB is an airborne disease spread via symptoms such as coughing. It has long been a disease associated with poverty, with those affected often residing in the slums and townships of high-burden countries such as India and South Africa. In contrast, diabetes is a condition once linked to the affluent, as diets high in fat and sugar are one of the causes underlying the development of the disease. But this is not the case today. ""Eighty percent of people with diabetes live in low and middle-income countries,"" states Dr. Anil Kapur, of the World Diabetes Foundation. Kapur is concerned that patients in these countries often remain undiagnosed. ""The symptoms of both (TB and diabetes) can be similar -- loss of weight, tiredness, malaise,"" he explains. In some regions of the world nearly half of TB patients suffer from diabetes. In the state of Kerala in India, this was the case for 44% of patients, according to the report, and affected countries often lack the systems in place to take on diabetes. ""Most countries focus attention on infectious diseases (like TB),"" says Kapur. Unlike TB, there is no cure for diabetes and patients are required to take treatment to maintain their insulin levels. The lifestyle changes associated with a rise in type-2 diabetes among a population are the same changes causing increasing levels of obesity. But ironically the two conditions have opposing effects on the likelihood of getting TB. ""Obesity reduces the risk of TB,"" says Kapur. ""This creates complications in managing the two afflictions."" Raising the alarm . Globally, the rate of new TB infections is falling by just 1.5% each year and any factors increasing the likely development and spread of the disease could be disastrous, as was the case with TB and HIV/AIDS 20 years ago. ""For years we had medical evidence that the two diseases were working together as HIV destroyed people's immune systems, allowing TB to quadruple in many countries,"" says Harries. In 2013, 1.1 million of the 9 million with TB were also HIV positive. Harries wants to learn from the slow progress and many years it took to mobilize a response to the problem. ""We want to raise an alarm so that we don't watch history repeat itself with TB-diabetes,"" he adds. The number of people with diabetes is predicted to be 592 million by 2035, with the majority living in countries with high rates of TB, such as India, China, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and Russia. The cost of treating diabetes could be huge in these nations and the unfaltering levels of drug-resistant forms of TB in recent years make any factors influencing the onset of disease a cause for further concern. Currently, drug-resistant TB takes at least two years to treat. One solution is to preempt the problem with early diagnosis. ""We are doing integrated disease management,"" says Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, the Minister of Health for South Africa, where one in every 116 people was newly infected with TB in 2013. The rates of TB-HIV co-infection in South Africa are among the highest in the world and Motsoaledi is learning from experience. ""People must not only test for HIV, they must also test for TB, for diabetes, for high blood pressure,"" he says. This is known as bi-directional screening. However getting people to be tested is a further challenge. ""Many went on to test only for HIV because it's the in thing,"" explains Motsoaledi. ""We'll make sure when you go to a hospital for diabetes, then other (tests) are available for you and when you test for TB the other tests are available for you."" The goal is to identify people who don't realize they suffer from more than one of the diseases. The main countries being targeted, however, are those in South Asia, where the co-epidemic is at its peak. This screening was pioneered in India, where over 2 million people had TB in 2013 and projections predict 109 million people will be living with diabetes in 2035. ""We can pick up people who never knew they had diabetes,"" concludes Harries. ""That's a good thing to do.""","Nine million people developed TB last year and 1.5 million died of the disease .
Diabetes weakens the immune system, increasing chances of developing TB .
Diabetes is on the rise globally, particularly in low and middle-income countries .
Almost 600 million people are predicted to have diabetes by 2035 ."
"(CNN) -- Talk about wasted energy. After all the shouting and handwringing, what President Barack Obama appears prepared to do over the next few days to fix some of what's broken with the immigration system isn't likely to have much effect at all. His right-wing opponents act as if what he's planning will lead to an apocalypse, while his supporters seem determined to oversell it as some sort of new Emancipation Proclamation. The truth is very different. There are a few reasons why: . For a start, there are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, and less than half would be covered by what Obama has in mind. And on top of that, if the experience with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is any guide, only about a third of those eligible will find the courage to come out of the shadows and accept the administration's offer. Besides, the executive action probably won't take effect for about six months, which will give Republicans in Congress time to stop beating their chests and start passing legislation that makes permanent changes, the sort that would render the executive action meaningless. Meanwhile, during all this, deportations of the less fortunate would continue, and might even be ramped up. It hardly seems surprising then that the major networks are reportedly not going to be airing the President's speech when he delivers it at 8 pm ET. (Although Spanish language channel Univision is expected to break into its coverage of the Latin Grammys for the speech). Obama is scheduled to follow up the address with a trip to Las Vegas on Friday, where he'll flesh out the details of what he has in mind during a visit to Del Sol High School, a location that will bring the President full circle -- it was at this school last year that Obama laid out his vision for comprehensive immigration reform. Over the weekend, Obama will make the rounds of Spanish-language media. There, he'll try to persuade Hispanic voters -- 70% of whom supported his reelection in 2012 -- that he doesn't deserve the moniker of ""Deporter-in-Chief."" Of course he can hardly be surprised this is the way Hispanic voters see him: That's the reputation you get when your administration deports 2 million people in five years, divides hundreds of thousands of families, and reportedly sends thousands of U.S.-born children to foster care after they were left behind when their undocumented parents were deported. All this hasn't stopped Obama's opponents on the right portraying him as Santa Claus for the undocumented, a bizarre interpretation of reality given the last five years of removals. Of course, we all know what's behind this portrayal: It's meant to stir up fear, anger, and anxiety. And, sure enough, it's working. Ignorance has the power to do that. In fact, it's really startling how the immigration issue can make smart people say dumb things. Just a few days ago, David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, insisted that Obama wants to ""rewrite"" immigration laws through his executive action. Brooks doesn't get it. But he is not alone. Obama isn't ""rewriting"" anything, but simply applying discretion in enforcing the law. Let me explain: When a policeman pulls you over for speeding, but he lets you off with a warning, he didn't ""rewrite"" the traffic laws. He merely used his discretion to not give you a ticket, probably so he can focus his time and resources on more egregious offenders. It's this kind of discretion that is at the heart of what Obama intends to do about immigration. Not only is it not ""illegal"" as alarmists on the right have prematurely characterized Obama's planned executive action, it's standard operating procedure in America's criminal justice system. In fact, much of what the President is said to be considering seems tame and, dare I say it, conservative. Besides the fact that not many people will apply or qualify for this relief, it's also not the equivalent of permanent legal residency. No president can confer that, despite what clueless right-wing pundits are saying about how Obama is handing out ""amnesty."" This isn't overreach by the President -- in fact, some on the left will consider it underachieving. Still, Mr. President, an explanation of what type of executive action you plan to take would be nice. After all, you've made a mess of the discussion so far, even as you poisoned the nation's overall immigration debate. And you've reminded us that, when the nation is starved of principled leadership on a tough moral issue, broken promises and flip-flopping and stall tactics and finger pointing are left to fill the gap. And one last thing. While you're setting the record straight about what actions you intend to take and who will benefit, you should also do something that you are probably reluctant to do: You need to level with immigrant advocates about how, no matter what you say or do, deportations of illegal immigrants will likely continue at the same pace that they have throughout your administration. After all, no one is debating whether individuals who are here without the proper documents should be removed. That seems a given. Last year, for example, PBS reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has established a yearly quota of 400,000 deportations. And although ICE has denied there is such a quota, the agency has miraculously managed to hit that figure, or get very close to it. So we have a pretty good idea that this is going to continue no matter what Obama says tonight from the White House, or tomorrow from Las Vegas, or on Spanish-language media in the days to come. The fact is that the deportation machine is unlikely to be toyed with, and that 400,000 removals per year will likely become the new normal. Why? Because like any self-sustaining government bureaucracy, ICE justifies its funding level by how much it does. And, if it does less, it could lose some of that funding to another agency. The same goes for U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country that prosecute the people that ICE apprehends. Bureaucrats are people, too. They want job security just like the rest of us, especially in a shaky job market. So if the administration isn't deporting one group of people, then it will focus on another. So, however much manufactured outrage we hear from Obama's opponents on the right in the coming days, the fact remains that the ""business"" of our nation's immigration enforcement agency is deporting illegal immigrants. And no matter what executive action Obama takes, when the smoke clears and tempers cool, it'll be business as usual.","Ruben Navarrette: Obama immigration plan unlikely to bring big changes .

"(CNN) -- A self-professed American dating expert who has said he feels like the most hated man in the world has been banned from entering another country -- Britain. The UK has declined to issue a visa to Julien Blanc, an executive coach at Real Social Dynamics (RSD), a group that charges clients thousands of dollars to learn what have been described as sexist, misogynistic and violent acts towards women. On its website, RSD describes itself as the world's largest dating coaching company, and promises to teach clients how to ""attract the women you've always wanted."" ""All of the material that we teach works amazingly well on women of younger age groups, and works just as well on women that are older and more mature,"" the website says. Earlier this month, Blanc was forced to leave Australia after an online campaign pushed venues to cancel his bookings, and authorities to revoke his visa. ""This guy wasn't putting forward political ideas. He was putting forward abuse that was derogatory to women and those are values abhorred in this country,"" Australia's Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told Sky News. Petitions also call for him to be barred from South Korea, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Iceland. Hashtag campaign . Blanc first attracted attention with a video where he described his exploits in Tokyo, Japan, telling rows of seated men, ""If you're a white male you can do what you want."" Outraged by what she saw, Washington-based Jennifer Li started a Twitter account and hashtag to #takedownjulienblanc, which has since inspired a Facebook page of the same name. A portion of Blanc's message to clients about Tokyo was quoted in a Change.Org petition signed by 150,000 people to ban his entry to the UK. ""I'm just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls' heads, just like, head, pfft on the dick. Head, on the dick, yelling, 'pikachu,' with a pikachu shirt,"" he said. Writing in Japansubculture, Li said: ""I was outraged, with him especially. How dare he violate these Japanese women's spaces! How dare he pass on his disgusting views and methods onto other men! This guy was in essence, assaulting women and getting away with it. And not just getting away with it -- he was REWARDED for it. I could not believe that he could go about doing this without consequences."" Blanc issues apology . In his first interview since the storm of criticism sought to shut down his seminars, Blanc told CNN's Chris Cuomo said he'd been ""overwhelmed"" by the online campaign against him. ""I feel horrible,"" he said. ""I'm not going to feel happy to feel like the most hated man in the world."" Blanc said he was ""extremely sorry"" to anyone he had offended. Asked to explain images showing him clutching women's throats, posted with the hashtag #ChokingGirlsAroundTheWorld, he said: ""They were a horrible attempt at humor."" But he also added ""they were taken out of context."" ""How could they be taken out of context?"" Cuomo asked. Blanc said: ""You can make anything look bad in a picture."" Blanc said his courses were designed to ""teach guys how to gain confidence.. in order to socialize with women and perhaps get into a relationship with a woman."" On Tuesday, actor Russell Brand distanced himself from the controversy after he was asked to explain a photo that showed him with his arm around Blanc's shoulders. In a video tweeted to his 8.5 million followers, Brand said, ""I never knew who that was... people come up to me all the time."" Referring to Blanc's training, Brand said: ""Any system for chatting up women is in itself questionable, but any that's based on objectifying or undermining women I'd never, never, never, never endorse.""","UK denies visa to Julien Blanc, from Real Social Dynamics .

"Lille (CNN) -- The stage is set for Roger Federer. Arguably the greatest tennis player of all time, one of the two things missing from his resume -- which must be a dozen pages if not longer -- is a Davis Cup title. But after his Switzerland beat France in the pivotal doubles tussle Saturday, the Swiss are one win away from wrapping up the final in Lille -- and it's Federer who has first crack at completing the job. You wouldn't possibly bet against him, would you? ""Nothing is done yet,"" Federer told reporters. ""We won the doubles match and we are preparing for tomorrow, as we have to do."" Federer entered the final -- one of the most anticipated in decades due to his presence and France's love of tennis -- under an injury cloud. He was forced to withdraw from the final of the World Tour Finals last Sunday with a bad back and then looked unlike his usual self in a crushing loss to Gael Monfils on Friday. Yet Federer was adamant he felt better as the match wore on against Monfils and hinted he wanted -- and was ready -- to play doubles. Swiss captain Severin Luthi wasn't about to go against the 17-time grand slam champion, and he was duly brought in alongside the surging Stan Wawrinka to replace the originally scheduled duo of Michael Lammer and Marco Chiudinelli. The decision paid off, with Federer and Wawrinka snapping a four-match losing streak in doubles together in the Davis Cup by easing past Richard Gasquet and Julien Benneteau 6-3 7-5 6-4. ""I'm fine now,"" Federer said when asked about his back. ""I understand you want to know everything about it. But I know as much as you do. ""I've been very open and honest. For me it's just about now whatever it feels like, I feel like I am at 100%. I'll give it 100%. That's all I can do right now."" Only twice since 1990 has the nation trailing 2-1 in the final rallied to triumph, such is the task facing the bewildered Bleus. ""Nothing is broken,"" French captain Arnaud Clement told reporters. ""But it is a difficult situation. It's tough to take. I can't lie about that. Gasquet has had a longstanding love-hate relationship with the French tennis public. They were in awe of his ability and he rose to the fore by toppling Federer as an 18-year-old in Monte Carlo in 2005. His hunger, willingness to fight and mental toughness have all been questioned, however, and the naysayers will have more ammunition following his display Saturday. He was the least comfortable player on the court. Clement has some serious thinking to do overnight, pondering who will battle Federer on Sunday. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is due to be that player, but Tsonga underwhelmed in a loss to Wawrinka on Friday and the head of the French Tennis Federation, Jean Gachassin, reportedly said the French No. 1 had an elbow injury. It might explain why Tsonga didn't play with Gasquet after they practiced together Saturday morning and excelled in doubles in the semifinals against the Czech Republic. Gasquet was out of sorts in the doubles Saturday, and Clement would raise many an eyebrow if he opted for Benneteau. Despite his good play in the doubles and possessing two wins over Federer, Benneteau's record in singles finals -- 0-10, which is an Open Era record of futility -- hints he is unable to function at his best when the pressure is really on. Benneteau's serve was broken in the first set for the lone break, but Gasquet didn't hit two volleys cleanly in the game, allowing the Swiss to pounce. ""I didn't play an exceptional match today and I'm disappointed,"" Gasquet told reporters. It was nothing compared to the decisive second set, which began slightly late as Gasquet and Benneteau left the court for a toilet break. France had five break points in three different games. At 1-0 for France, Gasquet's tame second-serve return let the Swiss off the hook. At 2-1, Benneteau mistimed a forehand return into the net and Gasquet's forehand down the line clipped the net and strayed wide. Chants of 'Richard, Richard' from most of the 27,360 in attendance at the Stade Pierre Mauroy -- less than 100 fans short of Friday's record number for a pro tennis match -- prior to the return clearly didn't work. Then at 4-3, Gasquet's return off a second serve failed to put the Swiss in any danger. Gasquet didn't have much of an opportunity on the final break chance, with Wawrinka pummeling a serve. With France reeling, the inevitable break for Switzerland came at 5-5 when Federer struck a backhand return winner. ""If Richard's return didn't hit the tape, the stadium would have gone crazy and the energy would have been different,"" Benneteau said. ""It was tough to lose this second set because we had the feeling that we really could have won this one."" There was no way back for France, and its fate was sealed when the Swiss broke for 3-2 in the third. With Federer now looking sharper and the French in some disarray, the home team's fate in the tie appears to be sealed, too.","Roger Federer and Switzerland are one match away from winning a maiden Davis Cup .

"(TIME.com) -- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder among children, and as incidence of the condition continue to rise, parents and patients are asking what happens next. How does ADHD affect children as they become teens and adults and start to form relationships, find jobs and establish families of their own? Does the condition put them at a disadvantage for coping with life's inevitable challenges? With 5.4 million children ever diagnosed with ADHD in the U.S., and 3% to 7% of school-aged children currently struggling with the condition, it's worth considering how ADHD affects their adult lives. TIME.com: Why youngest kids in class most likely to be diagnosed . Rachel Klein of the Child Study Center at New York University Langone Medical Center and her colleagues studied the potentially long-term effects of ADHD among men who were diagnosed as kids. In their 33-year follow-up study, Klein and her team looked at 135 middle-aged men with childhood ADHD who were referred to the study by their teachers when they were between six to 12 years old. The researchers compared this group to 136 men without ADHD and found that men with ADHD struggled more in occupational, educational, economic and social arenas later in life compared to men without the diagnosis. TIME.com: New definition may make ADHD easier to spot in adults . At the 33-year follow-up, when the men were in their forties, those with childhood-diagnosed ADHD without conduct disorders had about 2.5 years fewer years of education compared to the other men; only 3.7% had higher degrees compared to nearly 30% of the control group. The majority (84%) were holding jobs, but at significantly lower positions than peers without ADHD and were therefore at a financial disadvantage. On average, the researchers say, the ADHD group earned $40,000 less in salary than their unaffected counterparts. Socially, men with ADHD also struggled with higher divorce rates, more antisocial personality disorders and substance abuse. On the positive side, however, they did not have higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders, like depression. TIME.com: 25% of adults who seek treatment don't have ADHD . Overall, the ADHD adults showed higher rates of psychiatric hospitalizations and incarcerations, which the authors conclude supports a continued need for monitoring and treatment of kids with ADHD, even when a conduct disorder is not present. Dr. Klein says even when children with ADHD are not disruptive, they may still be at a higher risk for developing antisocial behaviors later on, like lying, stealing and cheating. But addressing the needs of children with ADHD, by providing academic support in school to help them overcome their frustrations and challenges in paying attention and retaining what they learn, and by giving them emotional support from the family, can given these students the coping skills they need to meet their adult challenges â€” in the workplace, in relationships and in social interactions â€” as well. ""One of the very important messages [from our findings] is that most kids [with ADHD] do OK, and some do very well. As a group they did well,"" says Klein. While ADHD's effect can linger into adulthood, it doesn't have to be either debilitating or inevitable. ""It does affect their lives, but not to the point that they're very badly off,"" she says. The study was published online in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. This story was originally published on TIME.com .

"London (CNN) -- It may appear to be the height of bad taste: a collection of handguns clad in silver and studded with precious stones. But although these weapons, which were produced by Tiffany & Co in the late 19th Century, were able to deliver lethal force, they were never designed to be fired. ""So far as we know, the guns never killed anybody,"" says Pierre Terjanian, the head of the Arms and Armor department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where a collection of seven such guns is kept. ""They were produced to symbolize the potency of American manufacturing and craftsmanship, and were created using techniques that nobody else could equal."" Guns not blazing . Tiffany & Co had been producing decorative presentation swords that were awarded to American officers during the Civil War and Mexican-American War of 1846-8. In the 1880s, the company moved into firearms, taking delivery of standard-issue Smith & Wesson handguns and transforming them into one-off works of art. They were clad in silver, etched with intricate designs, and studded with precious jewels. Each weapon was unique; one was adorned with an American buffalo hunting scene, while others were inspired by Japanese or Islamic design. These formed the centerpiece of the American display at the World's Fair series of exhibitions, which started with the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace, London, in 1851, and then were held around Europe and the United States. ""At the time, a great aura surrounded the Wild West in Europe,"" says Terjanian. ""It was at the time of the closing of the frontier, and people were already thinking nostalgically about it. ""Tiffany took Wild West symbolism and combined it with high-quality craftsmanship. It confirmed that Tiffany was an American firm with global ambitions, which could do things that nobody else could."" Uniquely beautiful objects . Among the techniques that the weapons showcased were advanced enameling -- two colors were blended together in a way that had never been seen before -- and the use of chemical etching, as opposed to straightforward engraving. Tiffany & Co also produced a Winchester rifle, which was famously used in the conquest of the West. Although it was technically able to fire bullets, the thick silver cladding made it impossible to disassemble and clean, and the heavy ebony wood made it too heavy to use effectively. Despite the focus on display, several weapons were purchased by American businessmen, including Jason ""Jay"" Gould, the prominent railroad magnate. According to Terjanian, a particularly beautiful weapon -- which had a butt made of carved ivory -- was acquired by a well-known sharpshooter named John Wynans, who used it to demonstrate his skills. In all, about 50 guns were produced by Tiffany. The project was abruptly discontinued in 1911, when New York adopted gun control laws. ""These are very important objects,"" says Terjanian. ""They showed that objects may have a function, but their symbolic meaning can be greater. ""They stood not for combat but for handiwork and the imagination. They surprised and impressed everybody, and acted as ambassadors for Tiffany & Co and for the United States."" The future Underground: London's new spaceship-style tube trains .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Another case of bird flu has been reported in China, taking the total infection count to 83 people, as health authorities inside and outside the country try to determine how to stop its spread. The most recent case was detected in a 38-year-old poultry trader in Henan province, according to state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua. Earlier, the World Health Organisation said an additional 19 cases were found in the eastern provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu as well as the city of Shanghai. Seventeen people have died from the H7N9 strain of the virus which, while common in birds, hadn't been detected in humans before the first cases were reported in March. The WHO says it's still exploring the possibility whether the virus can be spread between people. ""In a significant percentage of cases there is no known contact with poultry. It means that we still don't know what the disease reservoir is,"" WHO spokesman Timothy O'Leary told CNN. ""We need to establish where the virus is living in which animal it has its reservoir and then try to figure out how it's being transmitted to people. All the evidence points to animal-to-human transmission but which animal and how is it being transmitted? This is the big mystery."" Authorities are monitoring more than 1,000 people who have come into close contact with confirmed cases, but O'Leary stressed ""so far there's no evidence of ongoing or sustained human-to-human transition of the virus."" Particular attention is being paid to clusters of people who have contracted the illness, including one family where a father and two sons fell ill. The 87-year-old father died of the virus in March, followed soon after by his younger son. It hasn't been confirmed whether the son had the illness, according to Feng Zijian, director of the health emergency center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Because he had died, further tests weren't possible, Feng added. The elder son was confirmed to have had the virus but has since recovered. He is one of five people who have been discharged from hospital after treatment, according to Xinhua. So far, one boy is confirmed to have been an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, meaning he tested positive for the illness but didn't display any symptoms. The discovery of an asymptomatic carrier is worrying because it could make the spread of the infection more difficult to monitor, experts say. The four-year old was part of a sweep of people tested for the illness because they'd come into close contact with the first reported case in Beijing. Authorities took throat swabs from a group of people connected to 24 poultry farmers in Naidong Village, Cuigezhuang County in Beijing's Chaoyang District, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. Meanwhile, a number of international experts have arrived in China, at the invitation of the Chinese government, to help local health authorities trace the source of the illness, the WHO said. The team includes Chinese experts on epidemiology, laboratory tests and clinical treatment, as well as experts and officials from the U.S, the European Union and the WHO, who will ""assess the outbreak and the response to guide further the prevention and control measures,"" WHO spokesman Glenn Thomas told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday. Journalist Peter Shadbolt in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","NEW: One new case reported in Henan, taking total flu cases to 83, Xinhua reports .

"(CNN) -- When the moment finally arrived, 86 of us stood up to utter 31 sacred words. I raised my right hand. My heart was pounding. All those years spent in public schools in America, I'd refrained from saying the Pledge of Allegiance. It was wrong to say it when my loyalties lay elsewhere. But that changed with a ceremony on a July day six years ago. And it changed me. I learned lessons about the meaning of country and more importantly, about myself. I'd been in America almost three decades but happily retained an Indian passport. Over the years, each time it was renewed, my green card changed to pink and white but the status remained the same: permanent U.S. resident. I'd lived here so long that I felt just as much American as I did Indian, but I had my reasons for not taking that last formal step that made my Americanness official. One was practical -- there was a matter of inheriting my father's property in Kolkata, India, and for a long time, that process was excruciatingly painful without Indian citizenship. My father knew what a bureaucratic nightmare inheritance could be, and as long as he was alive, he encouraged me to stay an Indian. The other reason I held back was far more personal. India does not allow dual citizenship with the United States, and assuming U.S. citizenship would effectively mean renouncing India. That felt like betrayal, a severance with the land that gave me birth and shaped me. I spent a chunk of my childhood in India. When my family finally settled in the United States, I struggled to find myself. I learned to speak English well, even with a twinge of Southern drawl, some would say. I went to high school dances and loved my Levi's and even went out on dates, something I would never have done in India at that time. But I never felt fully accepted. I was always an ""other"" on forms that asked for race and ethnicity, before the days when Asian-American became a census category. In high school and college, I found myself fighting stereotypes and answering absurd questions about India, such as ""do people live in grass huts?"" Sometimes, I felt Americans simply didn't understand me and that everything would be better if I could just go back to India. The yearning for home and family grew stronger with age, especially after my parents moved back to India in 1985. I felt a need to rediscover my roots, not uncommon, I suppose, among immigrant children. But every time I returned home to visit, I realized I could never feel fully at home in India anymore. I was too Americanized. A memsahib, the elders in my family joked, referring to the term for British women during colonial times. That, too, is not uncommon among immigrant children. Many of us feel neither here nor there, straddling two cultures as we navigate key years of our lives. In my case, I was happy to go on as a citizen of one country, a resident of another. I paid my taxes and enjoyed all the freedoms afforded Americans save two things. I never served on a jury and more importantly, I could not vote. I never had an electoral say in India either because it did not allow absentee voting. I hailed from the world's largest democracy and lived in the world's most powerful one, but was unable to take part in a free society's most essential expression. I always felt cheated, or worse, that I was falling short. In 2004, I covered the presidential elections for an Atlanta newspaper, and after months of excitement and intrigue I was frustrated that I could not cast a ballot on Election Day. By then I had cleared the biggest legal hurdles in India in settling my father's property. And so it happened that I sat down to fill out the necessary forms declaring my intent to become American. I was fingerprinted, passed citizenship tests that challenged my knowledge of the Constitution and was finally called to take the oath in July 2008. At the suburban Atlanta offices of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, I scanned the room to see faces from Vietnam to Venezuela. There were people from 38 different countries there that day for the naturalization ceremony. I thought back to all the people I had met in my career as a reporter, of people who fought for freedom in lands that kept them caged, and others who clawed their way to these shores to break free. I remembered Cuban dissenters I had met on my trip to Havana, and Afghan women who risked their lives to make things better for their little girls. Now, all we have to do is look to the men and women of the Arab Spring, who took to the streets to oust governments that kept them down. Think of how much people risk to attain the kind of freedom we enjoy in America. And how much people in our own country have struggled to rid our society of prejudice and persecution. My naturalization ceremony was testament to the American spirit. I looked around me and realized that this wasn't just about the journeys people had made; it was about the potential of all they could achieve in their new nation. I thought about the Americans I'd met who worked hard, determined to achieve the American dream; about how their expectations were greater than their fears. Such was the case with Fernando Andrade, who left behind Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military rule in Chile and arrived here without a college degree or English skills. He started in construction jobs and worked his way up to become a successful businessman. Or Darly Pierre, who fled the brutal dictatorship of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier. She came to America ready to fulfill her dreams. In Haiti, she said, she never had that chance. I thought, too, about all the Americans I met who inspired me to carry on in the face of adversity. They, too, championed the American spirit. Dylynn Waters lost her New Orleans home to Hurricane Katrina, resettled in Atlanta only to lose her home again in a fire. Waters persevered with a smile on her face. She said she had learned that it was not possessions that made a home. Richard Ingram was a young cavalry scout whose arm was blown off in a roadside bombing in Iraq. He returned home determined to make the best of life. He is the first severely wounded soldier in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to become an officer. America is filled with such stories. It is a nation that gives people hope. On that July day, I felt proud, and extremely lucky, to be a part of this land. I glanced at Francisco Montiel of Venezuela, standing to my right, dressed for the occasion in a khaki suit and blue tie. And on my left stood my friend Vino Wong, a photographer for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper and a native of Malaysia. I wondered what they were thinking as they, too, became U.S. citizens. Did they have the same emotions I did? Was their joy tinged with the melancholy of giving up a homeland? My eyes welled as I began the oath. ""I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. ..."" Two worlds collided in my head as I drove to the Fulton County Courthouse with my new certificate of citizenship so that I could register to vote in time for the 2008 presidential elections. That November, America made history with the election of Barack Obama as its first black president. The election became an important part of my own history as I stepped up to a voting booth and cast a ballot for the very first time. Since then, I've come to think differently of my new citizenship. I know now that swearing allegiance to the red, white and blue gave me new nationality. But nothing can ever take away my identity or that of the 40 million other people living in America who were born in other countries. My Indian roots run deep, and I strive to carry with me every day the very best of two lands. That is, after all, what makes America great. What does U.S. citizenship mean to you as we approach July 4th? Share your take in the comments section below.","CNN reporter Moni Basu writes about making her ""Americanness official""

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old mathematics major from Austin, Texas, was identified Tuesday as the suspected gunman who fired shots from an AK-47 and then turned the gun on himself, the University of Texas at Austin said. The Travis County Medical Examiner identified Colton Tooley, a sophomore at the university, as the campus shooter. No one else was injured in the incident. Tooley's motive was not immediately known. According to the university, Tooley began firing the AK-47 near the Littlefield Fountain at about 8:10 a.m. Officers from the University of Texas Police Department and the Austin Police Department pursued Tooley, who went into the Perry-Castaneda Library. He killed himself at the library during the incident, police said. Austin and University of Texas police were searching Tooley's home in south Austin, CNN affiliate KXAN reported. Police were checking campus buildings for possible explosives left behind, said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. Authorities said earlier they were searching for a possible second suspect, but Robert Dahlstrom, chief of staff in the Austin Police Depart, said they now do not believe there is one. ""A suspected shooter in PCL library is dead,"" said an alert posted on the university's emergency website at 10:30 a.m. ""If you are off campus, STAY AWAY. If you are on campus, lock doors, do not leave your building. All organized classes for today, September 28, are canceled."" The campus had been on lockdown since an alert went out, but spokeswoman Rhonda Weldon said students were allowed to leave, and shuttle buses were to transport students and staff away from the campus. The university canceled all classes for the day. An ambulance was seen just before 9 a.m. in front of the Perry-Castaneda library, CNN affiliate KXAN reported. SWAT teams, armored vehicles and helicopters surrounded the campus. ""I extend my sympathy to the family, friends, and classmates of the young student who took his life,"" said university President Bill Powers, who thanked police for their response to the emergency. ""In the days ahead we will attempt to understand his actions and to learn from this tragedy."" University of Texas professor Randall Wilhite heard gunshots on his way to class and saw students scrambling to safety. He said he saw a man in a dark suit and a ski mask pulled over his face running toward the direction of the library a little after 8 a.m. Wilhite said the man was carrying what appeared to be an assault rifle and fired it randomly. ""When I pulled up in my car, he stood right in front of me and didn't stop running but turned in my direction, fired three shots into the ground to the left of my car and kept running. I wasn't sure it was real until I saw the bullets strike the ground to my left."" Student Micah Geisenberg was already on a bus to the university when he received an e-mail alert to stay away. ""It's chaos right now,"" said Geisenberg, who heard a gunshot as he got off the bus near the library. Matt Holiner heard a series of loud bangs from his dorm room, a couple of blocks south of the library. He suspected they might be gunshots, especially when he saw people running away. By mid-morning, there were at least 10 police cars outside his window. ""It's been quite an exciting morning to say the least,"" he said. The library is about two blocks from clock tower, where student Charles Whitman went on a shooting spree after killing his wife and mother. On August 1, 1966, Whitman, 25, killed three people in the tower and then another 10 from the tower's observation deck before police shot him dead. His actions were blamed on narcotics abuse coupled with health, family and legal problems. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","Gunman identified as Colton Tooley, 19, of Austin .

"(CNN) -- Some court-appointed guardians for incapacitated seniors are not screened before they're appointed, and many are not monitored by the courts after they've taken over the affairs of their charges, resulting in hundreds of allegations of abuse, a federal probe found. An investigation by the Government Accountability Office found allegations of abuse by legal guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia, according to an advance copy of the report obtained by CNN.  The report is scheduled to be released Wednesday. In 20 cases studied by the office in which criminal or civil penalties resulted, investigators found that guardians stole at least $5.4 million in assets from 158 victims, the report said.  In some instances, these same guardians abused or physically neglected the people they were supposed to help and protect. In six of the 20 cases examined, the courts failed to screen guardians before giving them control over the financial affairs and care of their wards, the federal agency found.  In one case in Missouri, a former taxi driver and convicted bank robber was appointed the legal guardian of a wealthy customer who had no family.  As the elderly man developed Alzheimer's disease, his guardian stole more than $640,000 from him, writing checks out of the victim's estate to pay for exotic dancers and a new Hummer, court records show. In Arizona, an 80-year-old woman's niece was appointed guardian of her wealth and well-being, despite having declared bankruptcy twice and being arrested numerous times for writing bad checks, according to court documents cited in the GAO probe. The elderly woman's attorney had objected to the appointment, saying the two were not close, but the court disregarded the protest.  In the end, the niece misappropriated more than $150,000 from her aunt's estate, court records show. A certified professional guardian failed to visit one of her wards for eight months, according to documents from a case in the state of Washington.  The same guardian was then appointed to oversee another elderly person's estate, despite having $87,000 in tax liens filed against her. Courts failed to oversee the conduct of appointed guardians in 12 of the 20 cases studied in the federal investigation, therefore allowing the abuse and financial exploitation to continue unobserved, sometimes for years, the federal report said. It cited the case of a couple in Kansas who ran an unlicensed group home for mentally ill adults.  The husband became the guardian of a 50-year-old female patient, allowing the couple to steal $250,000 from the woman, court documents show. ""In addition, they forced her and other residents to perform sexual acts for almost two decades as part of the fraudulent therapy treatment that they billed to Medicare, a federal court and jury found,"" according to the federal report. The abuse was discovered when children on a school bus reported seeing naked people working on the farm, the GAO report said. ""At the husband's sentencing, the judge compared conditions at the house to those of a third world prison, and concluded at the wife's sentencing that '...but for the sighting by the children on the school bus, I am firmly convinced that [the group home] would be in business today,'"" the report said. Federal investigators also tested guardian certification required in a handful of states.  To test to see whether this certification process would deter criminal-minded guardians from entering the system, investigators applied for the certification in Illinois, Nevada, New York and North Carolina. None of these states checked the undercover investigators' credit, nor did they validate their Social Security numbers to confirm their identities. The GAO report was requested by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, chaired by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin.  The committee says its next steps will be to consider federal legislation that will help state court systems improve their training of guardians, judges and legal personnel who handle adult guardianship cases. The committee is also considering legislation that would help reduce fraud by unscrupulous guardians who receive the Social Security and veterans' benefits of incapacitated beneficiaries.","A GAO investigation uncovers hundreds of allegations of elder abuse by guardians .

"(CNN) -- ""We face neither East nor West, we face forward."" Those words were spoken by Kwame Nkrumah, the man who led the creation of the independent nation of Ghana out of British colonization in 1957. And over half a century later, they are still inspiring a man who is doing his best to lead a small sporting revolution in his homeland. It is no small irony that the focus of his mission so far was the Commonwealth Games -- a competition formerly known as the British Empire Games, bringing together nations and dependent territories from around the globe. And when Jedidiah Amoako-Ackah took to Glasgow's velodrome last week, he became Ghana's first international track cyclist. It was some achievement -- the 23-year-old had only taken up the sport the previous September, and did not know his best event until March. ""I had never competed in cycling or track in any kind of level, so it was a big ask,"" he tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It was quite a steep learning curve to start with the aim of competing at the Games. ""I was very excited by it, but also, my common sense told me that, you know, you've never done this before. All the logical things go through your head, 'What are you thinking? You must be mad.' ""You know all these things, but I think it's worked out fantastic and taking that risk has proved worthwhile."" To some degree, Amoako-Ackah had the benefit of home advantage at the Commonwealth Games -- but it was a long journey. Born in the town of Asamankese, by the age of five he had moved almost 3,000 miles south to Botswana with his mother, a midwife, and father -- a pastor. ""I learned to ride a bike in Botswana,"" he recalls. ""It's just something I did recreationally and it's the quickest way to get from A to B without paying any money, so it was a thumbs-up for me."" The family's wanderlust meant that by 2000 they ended up in London, the former control center of Britain's once-proud global reign, and a year later had settled north of the border in Scotland -- a country which will hold a referendum on the issue of independence from the UK on September 18. ""I've lived in Glasgow for nearly 14 years now, so it's my home,"" Amoako-Ackah says. ""I feel like I've got a great connection with the Scottish people."" He had been studying sports therapy at university when a chance opportunity arrived that would reconnect him with the land of his birth. With the Commonwealth Games heading to Scotland, a fellow expatriate Ghanaian businessman had a plan -- but he needed someone to execute it. ""In Ghana, track cycling is not really a sport. We're really big on road and time-trialing,"" Amoako-Ackah says. Deep into his studies, he initially decided not to take part. But his first trip back to Ghana in 18 years changed his thinking. ""It was all new to me and I kind of fell in love with the place again and really enjoyed my seven weeks there,"" he says. ""After I came back to the UK, it made so much sense to actually do something for the Ghanaians who I've got to know and love after my holiday there."" So in September 2013, Amoako-Ackah took a year out of university and began the process of trying to catch up with cyclists who'd been training for more than a decade. You have to pass tests just to be allowed to ride on the steep contours of a velodrome. ""The first time I got on the track, I thought it was very, very easy,"" he recalls. ""Then it got harder and harder in terms of bike handling skills and techniques on the track, and I had to repeat my accreditations I think about eight times, so it was slightly embarrassing and one of those moments where you either quit or you fully commit."" You need to know what you're doing in track cycling -- the bikes have fixed gears and the punishment for mistakes can be painful. ""It's not like a road bike where you just put on the brakes and you're safe from any drama,"" Amoako-Ackah says. ""I always say to my friends I've got little pieces of me on the Glasgow velodrome!"" By the end of the year he had decided to keep pursuing his dream. ""It was kind of do it yourself, go onto the internet, watch YouTube videos, download journals and read and read and kind of consume as much as possible,"" he says. ""Because of my sport background, I had an understanding of how to write training programs and through reading journals about track cycling and just asking the coaches there, I started to write programs."" By March, he realized he was not suited to endurance events, so switched to sprints. And his hopes were boosted by the support of Englishman David Daniell, who had won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games but was now part-time coaching after injuries restricted his riding opportunities. ""A lot of the local community were very supportive and very inspired by what I was doing,"" Amoako-Ackah says. ""I find it quite funny because I never thought I'd be one of those guys, but they've been amazing and encouraging and a lot of local businesses in Glasgow have contributed a lot to funding and paying for the track sessions and equipment."" Ghana's cycling federation was in no position to help financially, but supported his bid to make history in Glasgow. ""They really motivated me, gave me advice and assisted me in finally being able to be part of the Ghana Commonwealth Games team. Their support and their encouragement has been incredible."" He went into the competition not expecting great results -- and that proved to be the case. Amoako-Ackah was 26th out of 28 in the men's sprint qualifying (12 riders went into the final) and was last in both his heats in the keirin -- watched in the latter event by his parents, two brothers and younger sister. ""It was a very good experience to get an idea of what it's like to compete at the very top,"" he says. ""These guys have been doing it for 20-plus years and you come in after 10 months in the sport to challenge them -- the audacity of it! ""In terms of performance I didn't do as well as I could have, or I wanted to, but I think the lessons will help for Rio 2016. I've been encouraged by the other teams here. One of the New Zealanders came up to me at the end and gave me a jersey, shook my hand and said, 'Well done mate.' "" Next he is targeting the 2016 Olympics, both on the track and off it. Ghana had a road cycling team for the first time in Glasgow, sending five riders. ""We're a very small nation in terms of cycling and we're taking it one competition at a time,"" Amoako-Ackah says. His long-term dream is to build a national cycling center in Ghana, and he has started down that path by setting up the Gift A Bike foundation to both help children in Ghana with transport and stimulate their interest in cycling as a sport. ""Cycling as a whole is developing rapidly on the continent of Africa,"" he says, and cites the example of 2013 Tour de France champion Chris Froome, who was born to British parents in Kenya and started his racing career in South Africa. ""I think there should be an eye kept out on these countries because if you look at their development in athletics, it's going to be similar,"" Amoako-Ackah says. ""The only difference is they just need the time, the facilities and the funding to get the talent -- which is tremendous there -- to the platforms where they can compete."" And that will hopefully mean he's not another one-man band on the track at the 2016 Olympics. ""Representing Ghana as the first track cyclist is a tremendous honor,"" he says. ""It's a privilege for me, who has only been involved in this sport for a very short time, so I hope to do them proud and progress the sport and facilitate Ghana's long-term involvement in track cycling.""","Jedidiah Amoako-Ackah is Ghana's first international track cyclist .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to believe it's been more than a year since I stood before the audience at one of my favorite forums, TED. But a year later, our vision for an oil-free world where electric cars are more convenient and affordable than gasoline-powered cars remains the same. It's been a turbulent year for the global economy, and the events of recent weeks only underscore the urgency of our situation as a society and as a planet. We see firsthand the severe damage oil can inflict, not only on our global economy but also on our environment. Just look at the tragedy unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico. We will soon see the damage of this horrific event in very human terms, as the damage to the industry, the environment and the livelihood of those in the Gulf grows and all struggle to recover in the coming months and years. My hope is that we will soon get to a point where we see that the cost of oil in human capital is no longer acceptable and that the increasing complexity of finding and retrieving this diminishing resource no longer makes economic sense. The good news is we are already seeing a shift that will ultimately take us from a transportation system based on a volatile oil ecosystem to one based on a more sustainable model using electric cars that creates a market for clean energy. The shift to electrification is inevitable, and we're seeing some of the world's leading countries make strong commitments to electrification. China, France, Japan and Israel are just a few. Motivations vary from country to country, but the end result will be the same: a stronger economy, healthier automotive sector and increased development of clean energy, leading to a healthier society. We will see new countries emerge to lead the way, and we will see former powerhouses who fail to act, left behind in this new sustainable global economy. While governments have the ability to accelerate the shift, the question remains how quickly we can get there. My start-up, Better Place, has made great progress in the past 12 months, and we're moving forward in all of our committed markets. We began the year by raising $350 million in a financing round led by HSBC, and we continue to drive toward a full system test in Israel later this year, followed by our commercial launches in Israel and Denmark in late 2011. On April 26 of this year, we launched the first switchable-battery electric taxi project in Tokyo. With the support of the Japanese government, we've partnered with Nihon Kotsu, Tokyo's largest taxi operator, to show what's possible in a rigorous environment with cars that drive almost continuously. Tokyo has much to gain from this: The city's 60,000 taxis may only represent 2 percent of all cars in the city, but they are responsible for 20 percent of emissions. If the switch works for taxis, imagine how it can work for average drivers. Just two days before our Tokyo launch, Better Place signed a memorandum of understanding with Chery Automobile Co., China's largest independent auto producer and exporter. You can't talk about the future without considering China: They get it, they'll do it, and it's that simple. Today, only 2 percent of China's population owns a car, but 80 percent of sales last year came from first-time car buyers, presenting a huge opportunity to get it right. The Chinese recognize EVs as a solution to the problem of the oil monopoly and its associated pollution, as well as an opportunity to leapfrog internal combustion engine technology and the rest of the auto industry. In fact, recent research from HSBC predicts that China's share of the global EV market will grow from 2.7 percent this year to 35 percent by 2020. In late 2011, we're planning countrywide rollouts of the Better Place model in Israel and Denmark. With the infrastructure deployment under way, both of these countries will be ready when the first EVs from Renault come to market. We are talking about mass market with these cars -- as Better Place and Renault have committed to 100,000 electric cars for Israel and Denmark beginning in 2011. This is just the beginning, and we're seeing clear direction and new visionaries emerge such as Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault Nissan, who sees a future where EVs are mass marketed and make up 10 percent of all car sales by 2020. Call it a revolution or an evolution, but this shift is happening today. While we still face a number of challenges, over the past 12 months, we've seen a new willingness from the global auto industry to change. Two years ago, most automakers considered electric cars a niche market, but today, we see almost every automaker in the world producing electric vehicles. As the benefits of a more sustainable transportation model are realized, we will very quickly see a dramatic change in the global economy, the health of the car industry and, most importantly, in the air we breathe. All of this points the way to a bigger, brighter future. It's simply up to us to make it happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shai Agassi.","Shai Agassi says Gulf spill makes it ever more obvious oil costs too high for powering cars .

"(CNN) -- Since 2007, Anderson Cooper has hosted ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" a gala that honors the Top 10 CNN Heroes of the year. In preparation for this year's show, CNN asked Cooper for his thoughts about the event and who he admires. CNN: Who is your personal hero? Anderson Cooper: Growing up, I had someone who was sort of a mentor who was really a hero to me -- a man named Gordon Parks, who actually was quite famous. He was the first African-American photographer for Life magazine, first African-American to direct a major Hollywood picture (""The Learning Tree"" in 1969). And he passed away just a few years ago, and he's somebody who still to this day I think of often. CNN: Why do you think Gordon Parks was heroic? Cooper: Gordon Parks was a guy who was born into nothing. ... There was no strong family. There was no one telling him how he should be and what steps he should take. You know, there's that term, you pull yourself up from your own bootstraps? Well, he built his own bootstraps. And he felt something inside of him that pushed him to pick up a camera. And to start taking pictures. And then to get himself to be the first African-American photographer at Life magazine. And to take some of the pictures he did, and what he told us in the story of his pictures ... he told stories that Life magazine wasn't covering before. Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam. And gangs in Harlem. And Gordon could get access that other people couldn't get. And yet what I found so heroic about him is that he had such a decent heart. And he was driven. But it wasn't a drive purely about himself. It wasn't a drive to make the most money. It was a drive to give back and a drive to sort of give voice to the feelings inside him, whether that was through photography or through poetry or through writing. He wrote best-selling books. Directed films (including ""Shaft"" in 1971). He was truly a Renaissance man. It's always very interesting to me why some people have that inner drive and that push forward. And he certainly did. And there was no reason for him to have it. He could have had every excuse in the book for not accomplishing something with his life, but he lived many lives and he accomplished things in all of those lives. And I think that he was a true hero. CNN: Sounds like Gordon Parks had quite an impact on you. Cooper: I think he's the person who probably put the spark in me about reporting and about getting out there and seeing the world. He took photographs in Brazil and in the favellas in Rio and wrote books about one of the young men he met there. There were just so many stories that he would tell. And he was such a cool character. He was so incredibly dashing. He was the coolest guy. Before I even knew what the word cool meant, I knew Gordon Parks was cool. CNN: This year will mark the fourth annual ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which has become a Thanksgiving tradition on CNN. What do you think about the show? Cooper: I just find it so moving that we are able to bring people from around the world to one place and to tell their stories and give them the attention that they so desperately need and deserve. And to see the impact that the recognition has on their lives and on their work, it is a great night. I think it's why we keep doing it. There is something very special about this project. And it's a hard project, because it's not about stories in the headlines. So it's a hard thing to get people to pay attention to. But once they actually pay attention to it a little bit, read about it, watch the program -- you really see what an impact this has on people's lives. And the stories are just so incredible. You cannot meet some of these CNN Heroes and not be inspired and not, kind of, look at your own life and think: ""Well, what am I doing? What am I really contributing? And what more can I do?"" And there's a lot more that all of us can do. Certainly myself included. I think I've learned from the CNN Heroes I've met so far, and I'm looking forward to hearing the stories of the next group that we encounter. CNN: What do you think makes these stories, these people, so special? Cooper: It's the kind of thing that you see in movies and you see in television shows and read about in books. It just doesn't seem real. But to know that there are people out there now, doing this ... who are giving up their lives in order to help others. And they are as surprised as anyone when they get the recognition. It should be that these people are recognized every day of the year. I'm glad that we're able to do it in the way we are. There's an awful lot of recognition that these people truly deserve.","CNN's Anderson Cooper pays tribute to  photojournalist Gordon Parks .

"(The Frisky) -- Kate Middleton's engagement ring just so happens to be a hand-me-down from the late Princess Diana. It's a blue sapphire surrounded by diamonds set in white gold. Although this family treasure is very dear to Prince William's heart -- it was his mother's engagement ring -- the superstitious may think that 28-year-old Kate should never have accepted it. Not because she doesn't want to marry her Prince Charming (literally), but because some believe jewelry can be cursed. Another big blue stone, the Hope Diamond, was not good luck for French royals. Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were the last royals to enjoy the stone before it was stolen and they lost their heads. The Frisky: 6 things Prince William shouldn't repeat from parents' wedding . Even if you don't believe that jewelry can be cursed, I've heard an old wives' tale that claims engagement rings are supposed to carry the energy of the marriage from whence they came.

The Frisky: Found out my engagement ring was piece of junk . Diamonds, not pearls, on your wedding day . In medieval times, people believed that pearls were unlucky because they represent tears. Diamonds, however, were considered great luck because they were thought to have the power to drive away witches and also prevent the wearer from ever going insane. Hence, why wearing pearls instead of diamonds on your wedding day would be thought to predict an unhappy marriage. The Frisky: 10 things to know about Kate Middleton . Don't remove ring; Don't put one on . It is considered bad luck if a woman removes her engagement ring before the wedding for fear that the wedding may not actually happen. Also, you are not supposed to let another woman try your ring on if you don't want her to steal your man. Conversely, it is considered bad luck for a single woman to wear a ring on her engagement finger as it might curse her to be single forever. Stick to your own stone? Some people think that it's bad luck to wear a birthstone that isn't yours. Uh, aren't diamonds the official birthstone of the month of April? Does that mean every bride who doesn't have an April birthday is cursed? Silver earrings keep bad spirits out . Wearing a pair of silver earrings was once thought to keep the devil away.

"(CNN) -- Gidget, the 15-year-old dog best known for her Taco Bell ad campaign, died of a stroke Tuesday in Los Angeles, California, said Sue Chipperton, her trainer. Uttering the words ""Yo Quiero Taco Bell,"" Gidget's popularity soared in the fast food restaurant's ads. Uttering the words ""Yo Quiero Taco Bell,"" Gidget, a female dog, played a male dog in the commercials. She was cast as the girlfriend of the Taco Bell Chihuahua, but the director changed his mind at the last minute and made Gidget the lead dog, Chipperton said. Chipperton worked with Gidget since she was an 8-week old pup and traveled everywhere with the dog. Gidget even opened the New York Stock Exchange. Roles were hard to come by for the pooch after her popularity soared from the Taco Bell ads, according to her trainer. ""She was kind of typecast, so she never really got much work after that,"" Chipperton said. Gidget was cast in the 2003 film, ""Legally Blonde 2."" She also had a role as an extra in the 2008 animal-themed movie, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua."" ""That's what her life had come to over the years,"" playing small background roles, Chipperton said.  Watch Gidget's top dog years with Taco Bell » . The Chihuahua loved being on set. She ""acted like a big dog and had a big dog attitude,"" Chipperton said, adding that once she arrived on a soundstage, she had no trouble finding her way in front of the camera.

"(CNN) -- Cross-country skiing is less speedy -- and therefore less intimidating -- than its steep-sloped cousin, downhill skiing. It also burns more calories, as skiers glide along snowy trails and skate up inclines. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adults -- but ask about specials. So, for those of you trying to stay true to your 2009 resolutions, the sport may be the perfect way to get more exercise and take in a dose of nature in the process. CNN asked Ron Bergin, publisher of Cross Country Skier magazine, to recommend five places to hit the horizontal slopes. Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, Lake Tahoe, California . The area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border between California and Nevada, is ripe with cross-country skiing opportunities. So much so, said Kevin Murnane, general manager of the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, that ""you can spend a whole week here and ski at a different area every day."" Bergin said the lakeside scenery is top-notch, as is the skier culture. You likely will find buddies who will share trail stories and a drink after a long day on the trails. Murnane's ski area allows dogs on some trails and offers free lessons to help learners adjust to the balance-intensive sport. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adults, but ask about specials. On Tuesdays, passes run $12. Groups and early-morning skiers also get a discount. Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe, Vermont . Owned by descendants of Maria von Trapp -- yes, that Trapp family, whose life inspired ""The Sound of Music"" -- the Trapp Family Lodge brings a little piece of Austria's lively hills to the mountains of Vermont. Johannes von Trapp, the real Maria's youngest son, helped open the lodge in 1968. The family had been in the lodging business before the musical film starring Julie Andrews debuted in 1965. For Bergin, the history itself is a draw. So is the fact that the luxury lodge, which still pulls off a quaint charm, is dedicated to cross-country skiing. ""It's beautiful. It backs up to the mountains and you've got a great view of a lot of trails,"" Bergin said. The lodge offers a range of promotions, from wine-and-dine packages to those geared toward ""winter wellness."" The lodge offers rooms and chalets ranging from $275 to $475 per night. Go for the two-night package and you'll get ski rentals, breakfast, dinner and lodging for both days for $500 per person. Methow Valley, Winthrop, Washington . Northeast of Seattle in the Cascade Mountains, nearly 125 miles of ski trails connect the villages of Methow Valley. It's almost as if cross-country skiing becomes a form of transportation in and around the area, Bergin said. While the linear path is ""not a typical layout"" compared to most cross-country loops, Bergin said the trails offer a sense of adventure and exploration. At one end, you'll find The Sun Mountain Lodge, which is the area's luxurious gem. But the valley also has hangouts for the Bohemian traveler: The Old Schoolhouse Brewery sells $4 pints in a smart red building and the local food cooperative offers organic smoothies and sandwiches. Trail passes run $20 for adults and $10 for teens ages 13 to 17. Stokely Creek Lodge, Goulais River, Ontario, Canada . Located in Ontario, Canada, north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this remote lodge gives skiers a serene escape from the bustle of everyday life. ""You ski away from the lodge and immediately you feel like you're out in the wilderness,"" Bergin said. ""All of a sudden, you're just transported from the day-to-day."" The natural scenery -- more than 12 square miles of it -- is varied and always exciting, he said. Around some curves, skiers will find a cold creek. Other areas are known for hills or lakes that seem like they're in the middle of nowhere. The lodge offers $15 day passes for groups of ten or more; kids 18 and younger pay $10 and adult passes are $18. For the full treatment, though, two adults can stay the night at rates ranging from $98 to $170. That includes two ski passes and three meals, which, according to lodge manager Jamie Martin, are almost as big a hit as the skiing. The kitchen serves highbrow treats like filet mignon and Cornish hen, he said. Cable Area, Cable, Wisconsin . Northern Wisconsin is proof that you don't need huge mountains for good skiing. The Cable Area -- which includes the towns of Cable, Drummond, Namakagon and Grand View -- boasts one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races and is regarded by some as the birthplace for the sport in North America, Bergin said. Bergin, who lives in the area, called the Cable Area the ""Mecca"" for cross-country skiing in the region. ""Within the radius of an hour's drive, you could probably find 30 or 40 trail systems of all sizes and shapes,"" he said. ""There's quite a skiing culture."" The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: $11 per day. Lodging at the resort ranges from $79 for a room in the lodge to $275 for a 1,000-square-foot condo, said Darrell Buchmann, the resort's general manager.","Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area allows dogs on some trails .

"(CNN) -- For the past year, Laura Miller has been living a double life of sorts: administrative assistant by day, secret agent of kindness by night. The 32-year-old Duquesne University employee only recently revealed herself as the woman behind ""Secret Agent L,"" a giver of random acts of kindness that has been brightening the days of unsuspecting Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, residents since July 2009. The project began, Miller says, with the birthday of one of her blog readers who had become a close friend. But instead of asking for the latest book on the best-seller list or an iTunes gift card, the friend suggested Miller perform an act of kindness in her name. So with a single, lavender hydrangea bloom tucked under the windshield wipers of a random vehicle, Secret Agent L was born. Miller used her friend's birthday idea to launch a new blog documenting subsequent secret missions, posting photos of the gifts -- all inexpensive to fit within her administrative assistant salary -- that have included $5 Starbucks gift cards, a roll of quarters at a laundromat and decorative cards emblazoned with uplifting quotes. The gifts are all tagged with a business card printed in ""secret agent-y"" type, she laughs. Her tagline: ""All-Around Swell Chick."" The blog -- with the help of Twitter -- took off, and Miller now has about 80 ""Affiliated Agents"" across the United States and abroad who are implementing the idea in their cities. Her favorite mission came on Valentine's Day when she took blank notecards and wrote inspirational messages about how the holiday ""isn't just about romantic love."" ""I wanted people to know that today's the day you can celebrate love for your own family, your own friends and your own life,"" she says. ""I left them all over the city, and I just thought it felt so good."" She tries to do at least one mission a week, but notes ""if I had the money, I would do it every single day,"" calling the project ""one of the greatest honors of my life."" Miller says she decided to reveal her double life at a coming-out party last month to help advance her charitable efforts. The party was a fundraiser for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an organization ""near and dear"" to Miller, she told HLN's ""Prime News"" on Wednesday. More than $1,500 was raised, she said. ""I think people are so hungry to not feel alone and not feel weird and that they don't matter,"" she says. ""I think people really want to feel valued and noticed because there's so much hurt out there and my project is an attempt to heal some of that."" She hopes her anonymous gifts will help at least bring smiles to those going through a tough time -- though she never sticks around to see who finds them. ""I think that's part of the fun -- it's just sort of putting the gift there and leaving, and just knowing that somebody's going to get it and it doesn't matter who,"" she says. She often receives e-mails afterwards from gift recipients to her secret agent account. ""One of the sort of themes that I've noticed in these e-mails is that they all seem to find things on days when they're having a really bad day,"" she says. Mission: Accomplished.","Laura Miller has been giving anonymous gifts of kindness for the past year .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Question: How many years since the Civil War have both U.S. senators from Pennsylvania been Democrats? Sen. Arlen Specter's breed of fiscally conservative, socially progressive lawmakers is on decline in Northeast. Answer: two. The state sent Democrats Francis Myers and Joseph Guffey to the Senate between 1945 and 1947. If you knew that, you understand just how far the Republican Party has fallen in its ancestral homeland of the Northeast, a decline that was underscored by Sen. Arlen Specter's recent decision to leave the party. Specter's decision to join Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey on the Democratic side of the aisle raises a host of questions about a party that, after years in power, suddenly finds itself hemorrhaging voters and ceding vast swaths of electoral terrain. First and foremost, who killed the Rockefeller Republicans? What happened to Specter's breed of fiscally conservative, socially progressive, temperamentally moderate Northeastern officeholders? And if they can be resurrected, should they? Liberal to moderate Northeastern Republicans once were as much a part of the political landscape as today's liberals from Massachusetts. Now, they live mostly in the history books. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine may be the last ones standing in today's Senate. The Northeast region sealed the deal for Abe Lincoln in 1860. It broke the back of William Jennings Bryan's populist Democrats in 1896. It kept the Republicans in power for all but 16 years between the Civil War and the New Deal. Specter's home state was the only large industrial state to back Herbert Hoover over Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. Even after FDR started tilting the region to the Democrats, it produced a slew of moderate GOP officeholders, postwar leaders like New York's Nelson Rockefeller and Jacob Javits, Pennsylvania's Richard Schweiker and John Heinz, Maine's Margaret Chase Smith and William Cohen, Massachusetts' Leverett Saltonstall and Ed Brooke, Connecticut's Prescott Bush and Lowell Weicker, Rhode Island's John Chafee, New Jersey's Clifford Case and Maryland's Mac Mathias. So what happened? In short, notes CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, there has been a slow but steady Northern backlash to the GOP's four-decade-old ""Southern strategy."" Race and religion brought Southern whites into the Republican Party but also began pushing out a lot of affluent Northern suburbanites. Those socially moderate voters formed the core of the Rockefeller Republican constituency. Major political realignments don't happen overnight, however. A lot of disaffected Dixiecrats continued voting Democratic in state and local elections for a long time, even after being wooed by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Old habits die hard, and Southern Democratic parties slowed their decline by continuing to nominate candidates more in step with voters in their states. The same story, only in reverse, held true in the Northeast. Thirty years ago, after Nixon but before the Reagan Revolution, the 11 Northeastern states stretching from Maryland to Maine still sent 37 Republicans to the House of Representatives and another 10 to the Senate. Today, those same states have 18 Republican representatives in the House and three in the Senate. The numbers are more stark in New England and New York. New England no longer has a single GOP representative in the House. The 29-member New York House delegation has only three Republicans. And what about Specter's home state? Since Nixon implemented the Southern strategy in 1968, the Republican presidential nominee's share of the popular vote in Pennsylvania has been smaller than his share of the nationwide vote in every election. The erosion of the Rockefeller Republican vote is clearly seen in election returns from Specter's political base, the moderate Philadelphia suburbs. In 1976, Gerald Ford lost Pennsylvania to Jimmy Carter while carrying suburban Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties. In 2008, John McCain lost Pennsylvania to Barack Obama while getting crushed in those same counties. McCain lost Delaware and Montgomery counties by more than 20 points. Those same suburbs are now represented by only one Republican congressman, moderate Rep. Jim Gerlach, who has been elected in each of the past four cycles by the skin of his teeth. Increasingly precise gerrymandering to create safer districts for incumbents has taken a bad situation for moderate Republicans and made it worse. Safe Republican districts are conservative districts, and conservative districts don't nominate moderates. When Specter announced his defection to the Democrats, he noted that more than 200,000 Pennsylvania Republicans changed their registration to become Democrats in 2008. Specter knows that the bulk of those switches came from the moderate suburbs. After barely beating conservative challenger Pat Toomey for the 2004 GOP nomination, he could read the writing on the wall for the 2010 primary. Now that Specter's gone to the other side, should Pennsylvania Republicans nominate a conservative in 2010? Not if they want to have a good chance to win. A new Quinnipiac poll of Pennsylvania voters suggests that Specter would beat Toomey, a former congressman, by 20 points in a general election contest. Former Gov. Tom Ridge, a social moderate in the Rockefeller Republican mold, trails Specter by only 3 points, a statistical dead heat. It's not impossible for more conservative candidates to win statewide in the Northeast -- former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum won two terms before losing in 2006 -- but it is significantly harder and happens much less often. Conservative candidates in step with today's Southern-dominated GOP are out of step in the Northeast. They also represent a distinct ideological minority on the West Coast, much of the Midwest and, increasingly, the Southwest. Of course, GOP strategists are right when they say the party has been left for dead before, only to spring back to life. Barry Goldwater's 1964 blowout loss was followed by major Republican gains in the 1966 midterms and Nixon's triumphant return in 1968. The party's 1974 Watergate debacle laid the groundwork for Reagan. And Bill Clinton's 1992 win paved the way for the GOP's first House majority in forty years. But what may make the fallout from 2008 different is the clear regional nature of the GOP's setback. The wipeout in the old Republican heartland has been a long time coming. At the same time, the Republicans have lost some ground in the South and the West because the Democrats have been willing to nominate candidates who differ with national party leaders on hot button social issues like gun control and abortion. They also haven't been afraid to throw a few fiscal conservatives into the mix. Winning national coalitions are rarely unified on all of the big issues. The GOP now has to decide whether it wants to copy the Democrats' strategy in the Northeast or whether it would rather circle the ideological wagons. The decision may dictate the shape of American politics for years to come.","Liberal, moderate Northeastern Republicans once a strong part of landscape .

"Editor's note: Donna Rose is a speaker and advocate for transgender and transsexual issues. She is the author of a memoir, ""Wrapped In Blue: A Journey of Self-Discovery."" Her Web site is http://www.donnarose.com/ . Donna Rose says transgender people don't fit the stereotypes society often tries to impose. (CNN) -- It was only a matter of time. The real-life drama of being transsexual has come to Hollywood. Chastity Bono, the impossibly cute little blond girl who, for many of my generation, remains frozen in time as the sweet, chubby-faced cherub closing many a Sonny and Cher show in the arms of her doting parents, recently announced that he is transsexual and will be transitioning from female to male. He will go by the name of Chaz. As shocking as this news may be to some, it is yet another reminder that all is not necessarily as it appears and that each of us is more complicated than simply the skin and bones of our bodies. Rather, it is our heart and spirit that defines us. Transgender people -- that is, people who may not experience or express their gender in ways that are necessarily typical for the physical sex of their body -- have been part of the fabric of cultures for as long as history has been recorded. We're a cross-section of society -- pilots, engineers, doctors, factory workers, artisans and pretty much anything else you can imagine. It was only a matter of time before we came to Hollywood. Make no mistake -- Chaz isn't the first and certainly won't be the last. Despite what others choose to believe, transsexual people are no longer relegated to hiding in safe little shadows for fear that society will detect them and punish them. We are far more than traditional stereotypes of transpeople as hookers, drug-users, porn stars or social misfits relegated to the fringes of society. In a very real sense, transgender people are no one thing. We are everyone, everywhere. Whether you realize it or not, we go to your school, we are active in your communities of faith, we are your neighbors, your co-workers, your family members. We live in a world that tries to force all of us to conform to the expectations and roles established for our bodies at birth, yet our heart and our spirit often realize that we have been miscast in life. We are forced to ask questions of ourselves about things that few ever consider. The search for answers is indeed the pathway for overall happiness and fulfillment in life. This is a journey that each of us is on -- trans and not -- and the simple fact of the matter is that the transgender journey may appear unique, but the end goal is a universal one: Happiness. Needless to say, there are those who continue to live in a world where ""different"" somehow automatically means bad, or is a threat. These are people who would keep transgender people trapped in stigmas of mental illness, moral weakness, sexual perversion and general societal freakishness. Our defense is a simple one: We prove who we are, individually and collectively, not with words but with the courage to come out and the ability to live our lives with dignity and grace. It may come as a surprise for many people in this country to recognize that many of us who are transsexual are not embarrassed, ashamed or otherwise apologetic of who or what we are. We refuse to go back into the stifling closet of trying to be something we're not. We enjoy each and every day being unique, as men and women and everything in between, and we rejoice in our diversity rather than fear it. The ties that bind us are far more than the obvious connections of gender. They are bonds of courage, authenticity, integrity and pride. This is not a journey about surgery. It is not a journey about being ""fixed."" It's not about the clothes. It's not about sexuality, or hormones, or any other single thing. It is a journey of self, full of uplifting revelations and heartbreaking realizations. A major point on that journey is gaining a sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance. Chaz's recent announcement indicates that he has reached that point and is well on his way to be who he will become. Chaz will face hurdles. It may come as a surprise to some that it is still legal to fire someone in this country, or to deny housing simply because they come out as transgender. Transgender people are victimized by crime more frequently than the general population. Many of us find ourselves unemployed and unable to be hired for jobs for which we are well qualified simply because we are transgender. And, as harsh as this life can be for us, many previous generations had it even worse. Things are changing -- slowly but surely. Why are they changing? Because transgender people are here to stay. We've been here all along and we're finally acknowledging that our unique journey is part of who we are, but not ALL of who we are. Chaz is a courageous brother. He is a role model to others struggling with similar issues and questions. He is someone who has taken control of his life and intends to live it to the fullest. These are not things to fear. These are things to admire. The message here is not one of our bodies, but one of our spirits. It is not one of becoming something you're not; it is of accepting what you are. As French writer Andre Gide said: ""It is better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you're not."" Many of us have experienced these words first-hand and know them to be true. Chaz knows who and what he is. That is not something to fear. That is something to celebrate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Rose.","Donna Rose: Chastity Bono highlights transgender presence in Hollywood .

"Washington (CNN) -- One of the most famous veterans of the ""Greatest Generation"" has joined the ranks of recently injured members of the military at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Former Sen. Bob Dole was so badly wounded 65 years ago that he almost didn't make it off the battlefield. Now, he is recovering from surgery alongside troops injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I'm just sort of one of the group. We show up at 10 o'clock and do our stuff,"" Dole said as he pedaled a stationary bike during a morning physical therapy session. Dole, who turns 87 this month, is at Walter Reed for rehabilitation connected to knee replacement surgery. A bout with pneumonia lengthened his post-op recuperation, so he's been with the young troops since they arrived from the battlefield. ""I've been here long enough to watch when they first came in, and then to see them today. Whether it's Lee or Chris or Levi, it's amazing,"" Dole said, as he watches Army Spc. Levi Crawford do a step exercise. ""He couldn't stand up on that step yesterday."" As a veteran-turned-lawmaker, Dole has advocated for the nation's veterans throughout his career, including serving as co-chair of a 2007 presidential commission that investigated shoddy conditions at Walter Reed, but he has nothing but praise for the medical care he has seen. He marvels at the stark contrast between treatment today and his own experience in 1945, which left his right arm paralyzed. ""These modern medical miracles, you see them every day here,"" he said. ""If they're wounded on one day, they can be in Walter Reed the third day. It took me nine hours to get off a battlefield. It took me weeks to get home."" Dole sympathizes with Air Force Sgt. Christopher Curtis, 32, who was in dire shape after his CV-22 Osprey crashed in Afghanistan back in April. ""I couldn't move. I was in a body cast,"" Dole said. ""That's all behind me, but it does give you pause. I think about, 'Jiminy - was I ever in as bad as shape as Chris?'"" Curtis said recovering alongside Dole has inspired him. ""Knowing that I'm going through what (Dole) went through...I'm not in a full body cast or anything like that,"" he said. ""They've basically eliminated that factor and here I am already in rehab (thanks to) surgeries and advanced technologies."" The servicemembers said that when Dole comes to physical therapy, he always talks to everyone in the room, including family members who are always by their side -- just like his mother was there for him 65 years ago. While opinions about wars may change, Dole said, a family's support is ""one of those values that never changes."" Everyone welcomes the former senator's wise-cracking sense of humor. ""He's a very funny guy, so he keeps everybody around him laughing and in good spirits,"" Curtis said. Dole is even willing to take a few jabs at himself and his failed run for president in 1996. After Curtis told him he voted for him for president, Dole called him ""a smart fella,"" then deadpanned, ""I finally found somebody that voted for me."" Dole said he doesn't dwell on how close he came to becoming president. ""You've got to move on, you know. Life's short you got to keep pushing and realize we live in a great country,"" he said. ""One chapter ends and another chapter starts. You keep going."" Army Sgt. Lee Langley, 26, said knowing how much Dole has accomplished after being seriously wounded on the battlefield gives him, and troops with more severe injuries than his, hope. ""It just means that I have all the opportunities in the world,"" Langley said. ""A lot of people are paralyzed, a lot of people don't have legs or arms, but they can still have a good life afterwards."" Surrounded by his young friends at the end of physical therapy, Dole makes a few wisecracks about age with Crawford, Curtis, and Langley like he's one of the group. ""This is what America is all about, right here,"" Dole said, pointing to the young troops.","Dole is recovering from knee surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .

"(CNN) -- The only country that has gone without a government for longer than post-Hussein Iraq ended its record-breaking run Tuesday. Hint: It's in Europe. Another hint: It's one of very few multiethnic countries still chugging along on the continent. Got it yet? OK, last hint: Home of Tintin, chocolate and the European Union. Yes, it's Belgium, which went 589 days without an elected government. New Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and his ministers met the king and took the oath of office Tuesday, the Belgian Parliament said. Di Rupo is due to make his first official statement as head of government on Wednesday. That caps Belgium's year-and-a-half run without a government, since Prime Minister Yves Leterme's resignation was accepted April 26, 2010. A temporary caretaker government had been in place since then, with politicians locked in a stalemate between the Dutch-speaking North and the French-speaking South. Di Rupo, of the Belgian Socialist Party, is leading a coalition government of six parties, the Belgian Parliament said Tuesday. Chocolatier Alice Le Fevre told CNN in September that the lack of a government had little effect on her daily life. ""For us it doesn't make any difference,"" she said. ""We still have a life outside of work. We can go on vacation. We have public transport."" There were even street parties when Belgium claimed the world record title from Iraq earlier this year. Some argued that political gridlock has even had its benefits. ""A government without power can't introduce new taxes,"" said Herman Matthijs, a professor of politics at the Free University of Brussels. ""On the other hand, a government without full powers can't take new measures concerning the outlays. The political crisis relating to the public finance saved money."" State governments in Belgium continued to function normally during the crisis, as did the European Union. But in the long term, according to Matthijs, Belgium needs a central government to make massive mandatory budget cuts and introduce reform of public finances. CNN's Erin McLaughlin and Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","It's the only country that has gone longer than Iraq without a government .
It held street parties when it broke the record .
Ordinary people say the lack of government hasn't been a problem .

"(CNN) -- Born without the lower portion of his spine, Kurt Fearnley was given just a week to live. Medical staff deemed his condition so severe they even asked his parents if they actually wanted to take him home. Yet Glenn and Jackie Fearnley had no doubts about that, and their youngest son has gone on to claim three Paralympic gold medals, win the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, trek the notoriously-challenging Kokoda Trail and lunch with Britain's Queen along the way. It's a mightily impressive collection but in his earliest moments, the prospect of such an action-packed life looked decidedly slim. ""There was quite a period of time when they weren't sure whether I would live out the hour, the day, the week, the month,"" the Australian, 33, tells CNN's Human To Hero series. ""It was slowly after we had been transferred to Sydney that there was the understanding I might be here to hang around, and my parents were then allowed to choose to take me back home -- even though they were offered alternatives."" Despite his condition -- sacral agenesis, which affects approximately one in 25,000 births -- young Kurt was constantly told by his parents that he was no different to his four elder siblings and that he could achieve anything he wanted. So they perhaps shouldn't have been so surprised when he informed them of his choice of career. ""Telling Mum and Dad that I was turning down my place at university to be a teacher to become a wheelchair racer instead, I could have been sitting across from them saying I wanted to be a professional unicorn hunter,"" Fearnley recalls. But he was backed to the hilt -- and not just by his family. Growing up in the tiny New South Wales village of Carcoar, whose population even now is little more than 250, Fearnley was much-loved and terrifically supported. Despite having legs so weak that they cannot support his weight, he would enter high jump competitions and play rugby league among other sporting pursuits -- and this indomitable spirit did not go unnoticed. So when he had to turn down an invite to compete in the United States because he knew his family lacked the funds to send him, the people of Carcoar came to the rescue -- raising enough money within a week to buy both his flight and a racing chair. Two decades on, the boy from the backwater has become a byword for bravery and belief -- and he did go on to become a teacher, qualified in physical education, as well. ""There were two turning points in my sporting aspirations. One of them would have been when I started to realize that I wasn't going to play cricket or rugby league for Australia as I wasn't competitive in that line,"" he says with a grin. ""Then there was the introduction to what my life is now -- wheelchair sports. I was about 13-14 when introduced to that lifestyle and culture. It changed my world."" ""It was 1994 and I saw these guys who were just these big men and better than any footballer or cricketer. They were these gladiators and I loved it. ""I wanted to be them and here I am 20 years later. I think I'm almost there."" Fearnley's modesty grossly belies his herculean feats. This is a man who can boast six silver medals and two bronzes on top of the three golds he has won since first competing at the Paralympics in 2000, on home soil in Sydney. This is a man whose times in his 5,000 meters and marathon category (T54) have never been beaten. And this is a man who has won a staggering 35 marathons out of the 54 he has contested around the world -- finishing on the podium another 14 times. ""The thing I love about racing wheelchairs is that when I get into my wheelchair, there is not another person in the world that is more made to do what I do,"" explains Fearnley, who won 1,500m silver at last month's Commonwealth Games. ""There are moments when you are racing that the speed is at a certain level or you're taking a corner at the right speed -- and at that moment, you feel like you are absolutely perfect and that this is what you are meant to do. It's an incredible feeling."" And Fearnley, who stands just 4 foot 7 inches and weighs around 50 kg, is an incredible competitor. He won 2004 Paralympic gold after suffering a puncture with five kilometers still left to race, under a fierce Athenian sun. Two years later, he set a record time in the New York Marathon despite falling over when hitting a pothole. ""The most important quality any athlete needs is resilience. It's essential for a marathoner,"" says a man who has also survived two serious car crashes, one of them while in his wheelchair. Yet merely relaying Fearnley's professional exploits doesn't come close to conveying the fullness of his extraordinary drive and ambition. Just consider his approach to the Kokoda Trail, a testing single-file trek that runs 96 kilometers (59 miles) through the mountains of Papua New Guinea. The path's rugged nature and precipitous river crossings are so challenging it can take any able-bodied person anywhere from 4-12 days to traverse it, so one can barely imagine the difficulties endured for someone who chooses -- in Fearnley's own words -- to ""crawl"" across it. Nonetheless, he took it on for both charitable and patriotic reasons. In 1942, Japan wanted to seize control of what was then New Guinea before launching a direct assault on the Australian mainland lying south, with seven months of intense fighting required before being ultimately repelled. ""The Kokoda Trail is the only sport in the world where Australia has really fought for the direct defense of Australia. It holds unlimited important to who we are as a nation,"" Fearnley says. ""It is 96 kilometers of mud and untold amounts of hills. The hills are these mudslides that are covered in a honeycomb of tree routes where you just have to try to keep trudging on. ""I crawled it in 2009, and it feels like it was a lifetime ago. I often wonder how it actually took place. When I was asked in the lead-up to it, it was just 'Why not?' If I think I can do something somewhere in the world and I want to, then wouldn't I make that happen?"" It's an attitude that sits very comfortably alongside his approach to life. ""My motto is probably that struggling is alright, and any struggling is strengthening,"" he says. For precisely this reason, he chose to spend his Christmas holiday in 2011 on board the 100-foot Supermaxi yacht Loyal as it won the famous Sydney to Hobart race. Being pummeled by waves and tossed around a buccaneering boat is not everyone's idea of fun but for the pragmatic Fearnley -- who also has a love of surfing -- it was all a way of readying himself for the 2012 Paralympics in London. ""I have had some incredible experiences outside of wheelchair racing, such as sitting down with 12 other people for lunch two years ago and one of them being the Queen,"" he smiles, referring to his meeting with visiting British royalty. ""Finding myself on board a yacht on the Sydney to Hobart and winning by 300 meters, having crawled around on this thing for 58 hours -- crawling, in the middle of the night, through people's vomit just doing my job and whatever needed to happen."" In spite of his unorthodox methods and his intense training regime, Fearnley failed in his objective to win the 2012 Paralympic marathon in his category. Yet he was involved in one of the great Paralympic races, taking bronze even though he finished less than a second by the winner. So he is unequivocal when asked to describe the biggest challenge of what has been a gloriously colorful career. ""I would say the next one -- turning up at the Rio Olympics in two years' time to try to get back to that number one position,"" he ventures. ""People may think there is not a lot between first and second (and third) place. In my case it was 0.8 of a second over a marathon, but that 0.8 of a second is absolutely everything in my sport. ""So I would say that the biggest challenge that I would ever have come through over the last 20 years will be trying to rectify that 0.8 of a second in the next two years.""","Kurt Fearnley is one of the world's most successful wheelchair racers .

"(CNN) -- Sing in the shower, not in public. That's the message to anyone visiting one South Carolina beach community. The town of Sullivan's Island has proposed an ordinance that would make it illegal to belt out show tunes, pop songs, or any musical notes, for that matter, if they disturb the peace. ""I haven't had one islander complain about it,"" said Andy Benke, the town administrator. ""There are places where you can go and be loud and vociferous. Sullivan's Island is not one of them."" ""We want you to have a good time but in the same sense we want you to act respectful and if you don't we have a tool to deal with it,"" Benke added. That tool would be a ticket from a police officer for a maximum fine of $500. And the ban isn't just for singing. The measure reads as follows: . ""It shall be unlawful for any person to yell, shout, hoot, whistle, or sing on the public streets, particularly between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or at any time or place so as to annoy or disturb the comfort, or repose of persons in any office, or in any dwelling, or other type of residence, or of any persons in the vicinity."" The town, which is on a barrier island just north of Charleston Harbor, has a population of about 2,000 but swells to around 5,000 during summer weekends, Benke said. He called it ""first and foremost a single residential community. ""There are a lot of visitors to the beach 24 hours a day,"" he said, ""and we just need a way to maintain the quiet family atmosphere."" The town council has already voted two times for the ordinance and after a third vote in July, it is expected to be put into effect in August, Benke said. He said the welcome mat is always open for people to enjoy the town but made it clear loud, disruptive noises, including public singing during quiet hours, will not be tolerated. ""There are probably six or seven little restaurants in the town that stay open until 2 a.m.,"" he said. ""People are leaving, (having) had a good time all night. Maybe they don't know they are being loud and think it's okay. But it's not.""","Beach town of Sullivan's Island wants to keep things quiet .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a 15-year-old girl who appeared on ""The Tyra Show"" as a self-described sex addict is suing the daytime talk show host for up to $3 million, claiming the show flew the girl, Jewel Ciera Washington, to New York and put her on TV without parental consent or the proper work papers required by the state of Georgia. ""It's like I'm trapped in a dark place with no light shining down, like I'm a prisoner,"" Washington said on the TV show. ""I know that I need help for this. ... I know it for a fact,"" she added.

"(CNN) -- The only scene I really loved in ""Star Trek: The Voyage Home"" was when Scotty tried speaking verbal commands to a Macintosh Plus. Keyboards always seem to get in the way of doing what I want to do -- and nowhere is this as apparent, or frustrating, as on smartphones and tablets. With the recent launch of the iPhone 4S, Apple's not-really-new voice recognition system Siri has been getting a lot of attention. Yet it took the India-based software company Dexetra just eight hours to create the initial version of Iris -- a blatant Android knockoff of Siri. Even the name ""Iris,"" which is the reverse of ""Siri,"" stands for ""Intelligent Rival Imitator of Siri"" according to Dexetra's blog. (And yes, I'm just waiting for the trademark suit from Apple.) Granted, Dexetra wasn't starting completely from scratch. This company had already been working on natural language processing and machine learning -- two notably thorny, complex technologies -- for more than a year. A few days later, Dexetra made an improved version of Iris available as a free app in Google's Android Market and as of this writing it has been installed more than 50,000 times. I put Iris on my Android phone this weekend, and it's amusing. For instance, here's a discussion I had with Iris yesterday: . Me: ""What time is the John Scofield concert at Yoshi's Jazz Club in Oakland tonight?"" Iris: ""I have no idea."" Me: ""Who is John Scofield?"" Iris: ""John Scofield, born 1951, the musician."" (Shows a photo of Scofield performing.) Me: ""Where is Yoshi's, Oakland?"" Iris: ""Right now being pulled in by a black hole."" So Iris is about as entertaining as Siri seems to be. (I don't own an iPhone, but for comparison I've been checking out the STSS Tumblr blog, a crowdsourced collection of weird and wonderful wisdom from Siri.) Still, neither Iris nor Siri seems very useful so far. Fortunately, there are better voice control options on both the iPhone and Android handsets than either Siri or Iris. And they've been around for a while. For some time the Android mobile operating system has had pretty well integrated speech-to-text functionality (Google Voice Actions). I use this often for texting, searching, navigating and e-mailing on the go. Also, whenever I bring up a keyboard in any Android app, there's a microphone option for voice entry. Generally it recognizes pretty well what I want to say or do. If Android guesses wrong, I can use the keyboard to correct it, and it does seem to learn over time. Then there is Vlingo, a voice control app for all the major smartphone platforms. I've tried it, and for some tasks it works reasonably well. On the iPhone, Siri does integrate with some of Apple's own productivity tools (such as the calendar). But as my CNN.com colleague Mark Milian pointed out, Siri can't yet execute many basic commands like taking a picture. Most importantly, Siri doesn't integrate with any third-party iOS apps, such as Shazam or Tweetdeck. Given Apple's closed iOS ecosystem, it's an open question whether such integration will ever happen. Besides Siri, there are other iOS apps and tools that provide some voice control. ExtremeTech recently published a list. Such baby steps are important -- but on any mobile platform, we're still a long, long way from phones that you can just talk to and they'll do what you say. This is frustrating from the consumer perspective. Smartphones are, first and foremost, phones. They're supposed to be for talking. Typing on any mobile device, through a physical or virtual keyboard, is a chore. That's why QR codes are getting popular -- they eliminate the need to type on a mobile device. The challenge of typing on handheld devices is exactly why the kind of voice control Scotty expected is such an alluring and intuitive idea. Eventually we'll probably get there. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Android has had pretty well integrated speech-to-text functionality .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- In response to a video of a California man's dispute with airport security officials, the Transportation Security Administration said Monday it tries to be sensitive to individuals, but everyone getting on a flight must be screened. The video, in which software engineer John Tyner refuses an X-ray scan at the San Diego, California, airport, has sparked a debate over screening procedures. Tyner told CNN on Sunday that he was surprised to see so many people take an interest in his refusal and the dispute with airport screeners that followed it. But he said he hoped the video will focus attention on what he calls a government invasion of privacy. ""Obviously, everybody has their own perspective about their personal screening,"" TSA administrator John Pistole told CNN. ""The question is, how do we best address those issues ... while providing the best possible security?"" Tyner, 31, said his hunting trip to South Dakota was cut short before it even started Saturday morning -- when TSA agents asked him to go through an X-ray machine. ""I don't think that the government has any business seeing me naked as a condition of traveling about the country,"" Tyner said. Pistole said the agency is ""trying to be sensitive to individuals issues and concerns,"" but added, ""the bottom line is, everybody who gets on that flight has been properly screened."" The cell phone video Tyner recorded of his arguments with security screeners over the scan and pat-down they proposed had garnered than 200,000 hits on YouTube by Monday afternoon. Tyner said that after he declined the body scan, a TSA agent told him he could have a pat-down instead. Once the procedure was described, Tyner said he responded, ""If you touch my junk, I'll have you arrested."" The dispute that followed, Tyner said, included police escorting him from the screening area and a supervisor saying he could face a civil lawsuit for leaving the airport before security had finished screening him. In fact, Tyner could face a civil penalty as high as $11,000, according to Michael Aguilar, the TSA's federal security director in San Diego, who defended the behavior of his officers during the confrontation. ""He's violated federal law and federal regulations, which states once you enter and start the process you have to complete it,"" he said. Tyner called the whole incident ridiculous and said he will not fly ""until these machines go away."" ""Advanced imaging technology screening is optional for all passengers,"" the TSA said in a statement released Monday. ""Passengers who opt out of [advanced imaging] screening will receive alternative screening, including a physical pat-down."" But anyone who refuses to complete the screening process will be denied access to airport secure areas and could be subject to civil penalties, the administration said, citing a federal appeals court ruling in support of the rule. The ruling, from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, says that ""requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post-9/11 world. Such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by 'electing not to fly' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found."" The TSA's advanced imaging technology machines use two separate means of creating images of passengers -- backscatter X-ray technology and millimeter-wave technology. At the end of October, 189 backscatter units and 152 millimeter-wave machines were in use in more than 65 airports. The total number of imaging machines is expected to be near 1,000 by the end of 2011, according to the TSA. The agency has previously said that the new technology is safe and protects passenger privacy. ""Strict privacy safeguards are built into the foundation of TSA's use of advanced imaging technology to protect passenger privacy and ensure anonymity,"" the agency says in a statement on its website. Images from the scans cannot be saved or printed, according to the agency. Facial features are blurred. And agents who directly interact with passengers do not see the scans. But Tyner isn't the only one with concerns about the new security procedures. Grass-roots groups are urging travelers either not to fly or to protest by opting out of the full-body scanners and undergoing time-consuming pat-downs instead. Industry leaders are worried about the backlash. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano met with leaders of travel industry groups to discuss the concerns. ""We certainly understand the challenges that DHS confronts, but the question remains, where do we draw the line? Our country desperately needs a long-term vision for aviation security screening, rather than an endless reaction to yesterday's threat,"" the U.S. Travel Association said in a statement after the meeting. ""At the same time, fundamental American values must be protected."" During a press conference in which Napolitano announced the expansion of a security awareness campaign, she also reiterated the need for hand searches should a passenger decline electronic screening. ""If you refuse the [Advanced Imaging Technology] altogether, then you can go to a separate area for a same-gender pat down,"" she told reporters on Monday. ""If there are adjustments we need to make as we move forward, we have an open ear,"" she said. ""We will listen."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Phil Gast, Marnie Hunter and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: The California man involved in a TSA dispute could face an $11,000 fine .

"(CNN) -- A labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents and staff Friday disputed comments made by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer that most illegal immigrants coming across the southern border are smuggling drugs. Brewer initially made the comments earlier this month during a debate of Republican gubernatorial candidates. She repeated them Friday when asked by a reporter for the basis of the claim. ""Well, we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules,"" Brewer said. ""They're coming across our borders in huge numbers. The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration. ""So they are criminals. They're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs."" When pressed, Brewer explained that many are simply coming to the United States to look for work but ""are accosted, and they become subjects of the drug cartels."" T.J. Bonner of the National Border Patrol Council told CNN that Brewer's claims were ""clearly not the case."" Bonner said that some undocumented immigrants caught by border patrol agents have drugs on them, and that they sometimes blame pressure from the drug cartels. But, he said, those claims have little credibility because drug smugglers are typically transporting much larger quantities of drugs. And besides, he said, if what Brewer said were true, there would be many more prosecutions for drug smuggling. Brewer's comments, Bonner said, don't ""comport with reality -- that's the nicest way to put it."" Brewer doubled down on the comments later Friday, however, issuing a statement reiterating them. ""The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs,"" Brewer's statement said, according to the Associated Press as reported in the Arizona Republic. ""It is common knowledge that Mexican drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking."" Brewer said the ""human rights violations that have taken place (by the cartels) victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent."" Brewer's statement is the center of a controversy over a recently passed law that requires law enforcement officials to ascertain the citizenship of the subject of any investigation if they have reason to believe their suspect is in this country illegally. The U.S. Department of Justice is considering whether to file suit against the law.","Border patrol agents' union rejects governor's comments .

"(CNN) -- A 25-year-old woman from Seattle, Washington, has become the fifth person to die from burns suffered when her fiance's uncle invited them to his house in Puerto Rico and allegedly set them afire. According to a website set up by friends of the couple, Kate Donahue, 25, died Thursday at Jackson Memorial Burn Center at the University of Miami, in Florida, where she and her fiance had been flown for treatment. Her fiance, Jesus Sanchez, died earlier in the week. Donahue worked at Group Health in Seattle; Sanchez was an engineer at Boeing. ""They are very much in love,"" Donahue's mother, Michelle, told reporters when they were first hospitalized. ""Their last words before they were intubated were for each other. She loves him, he loves her and the last six months have been the happiest time of her life and the most important thing is love."" The couple had traveled to Puerto Rico so that Sanchez could introduce Donahue to his relatives. ""I got a text from her on New Year's Eve telling me 'Happy New Year' and what a wonderful time she was having,"" Patrice Moore told a reporter about her niece, Donahue. ""And that was the last thing I heard from her."" The next day, Donahue and Sanchez were among 13 dinner guests at the house that Justino Sanchez Diaz shared with his parents and sister in the town of Florida, in north-central Puerto Rico, police said. But the 45-year-old unemployed furniture mover had prepared for the party by soaking the walls of his house with kerosene and placing kerosene containers in each corner of the dining room, according to Sgt. Frank Perez of the Arecibo Region Police Department's homicide unit. At about 4:30 p.m, the suspect set fire to the room and the people in it, Perez said. ""There was no opportunity for anybody."" Nearly all of those who died suffered burns over 80 percent of their bodies, he said. Though the suspect had no police record, relatives told police they had long had problems with him, Perez said. He said Sanchez Diaz had burned down a henhouse in the backyard of his brother's home five years ago. ""Many times the family hides their own problems,"" he said. The suspect's mother, 83, died, he said. Also dead were his 17-year-old niece, who ""died quickly"" with burns over 90 percent of her body. Another relative, age 32, was fatally burned, Perez said. The suspect's father suffered a heart attack the day after the attack. Upon his recovery, he was told that his wife had died, Perez said. Three other relatives were being treated for burns at the Medical Center of Puerto Rico in San Juan, according to Perez. Meanwhile, the suspect -- who suffered slight burns that required no treatment -- is being held in lieu of $1.5 million bond in a psychiatric correctional center, Perez said. His next court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 14.","Fifth victim is a woman who had traveled to Puerto Rico to meet her fiance's family .

"Washington (CNN) -- Recent remarks from a Supreme Court justice have alarmed those still pushing for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, three decades after an earlier attempt failed. Congressional supporters of such an amendment say there's now some urgency to include the concept of equality in the document after Justice Antonin Scalia was quoted as saying ""nobody ever voted for that."" A 1972 proposal fell short of ratification by three states before its 1982 deadline. Scalia, in last month's issue of California Lawyer magazine, said that if ""society wants to outlaw discrimination by sex, hey, we have things called legislatures."" Lawmakers responded Thursday on the East Front of the U.S. Capitol, across from the Supreme Court. ""Today, while the House is reading the Constitution, we are here to point out what is so troubling about what Justice Scalia believes,"" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York. If Scalia's view spreads to a high court majority, Maloney said, it ""could overturn all of our body of work to protect the rights of women."" The key Senate supporter, New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez, said three-fourths of Americans assume the Equal Rights Amendment is already part of the Constitution -- but because the measure has never been ratified by the states, ""the courts might not guarantee it,"" he said. Menendez underscored the need to take action, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in last year's Citizens United case against business. He said the justices ""would elevate a corporate entity to have the rights of an individual, and yet say that women do not have rights as an individual under the Constitution. That is incredibly alarming."" Scalia's remarks date to September, during an interview with a California law professor. He is quoted as saying, ""Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't."" Maloney said many women's groups have acted as if prevailing law and practices are enough to assume women have equal rights, but she noted that several prominent groups now have fresh concern. ""We have waited far too long,"" said Eleanor Smeal of the Feminist Majority. ""We've got to make sure it's explicit in the Constitution."" Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, held up a pocket copy of the Constitution and read part of the 14th Amendment, saying ""nor shall any state deprive any person of equal rights under the law."" ""A man in power like Antonin Scalia insists that the word person in the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to half the population of the United States,"" she said. Lawmakers who passed the 1972 proposal extended a seven-year deadline to 1982, yet ratification stalled at 35 out of the needed 38 states. Supporters believe the 35 ratifications could be kept alive by Congress if and when another three states endorse that 1972 proposal. ""The three-state strategy was developed following ratification of the Constitution's 27th Amendment in 1992, more than 203 years after its passage by Congress in 1789,"" notes the website www.equalrightsamendment.org. The 27th Amendment blocks lawmakers from voting themselves a pay raise to take effect during the same session of Congress in which it was passed.","Scalia says the Constitution does not prohibit discrimination by sex .

"Washington (CNN) -- A program that puts air traffic controllers in the cockpit to view life ""on the other side of the frequency"" is being resurrected almost a decade after it was killed by Sept. 11 security measures. The program allows controllers to fly in the cockpit ""jump seat"" of commercial jets so they can become acquainted with the pilots' workloads and responsibilities, and ultimately become better at their own. FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt, a former airline pilot, said the program benefits both controllers and pilots. ""It's a two-way dialogue. And it helps both parties understand some of the work environment that the other is operating in,"" Babbitt said. Previously known as ""fam trips,"" short for ""familiarization trips,"" the program and the name both were casualties of September 11. The terrorist attacks led to barricaded cockpit doors and to strict protocols on who could pass through them. And the term ""FAM"" is now used by the Federal Air Marshal Service. In the decade that has elapsed, thousands of new employees have joined the ranks of controllers, meaning that fully one-third of the work force has never had the chance to ride in an airline cockpit. ""I think it's an outstanding idea,"" said Derek Bittman, a controller at an FAA facility in Atlanta. ""We tell the airplanes what to do, and they make it work. And if controllers got back in the cockpit, we would understand what it takes to make that request work,"" Bittman said. Officials say the program has minimal costs because the controllers sit on a ""nonrevenue"" fold-down seat behind the pilots. The program will be voluntary, and will be open to controllers who meet certain minimum work experience requirements. Union chief Paul Rinaldi, who participated in the former program, said he found the experience valuable, and it helped him understand when pilots have the busiest workloads and how to better communicate with them. Babbitt said the Transportation Security Administration has approved the program, and that he expects it to begin in the coming weeks. The TSA said it has worked with the FAA on ""a tightly controlled, restricted access program."" ""Air traffic controllers who ride in the cockpit as part of training are vetted and are thoroughly screened at the checkpoint,"" the TSA said. ""From a security standpoint, it makes sense to ensure that air traffic controllers have a clear understanding of what happens inside the cockpit.""","Air traffic controllers to get flight in cockpit .
