Andy Ray Harris was arrested after chewing and swallowing the tiny, pink rodent during a sickening 45-second clip. But despite eating the hairless animal and washing it down with a mouthful of beer, Harris, from Tooele, Utah, escaped punishment in court after a judge ruled rats are not a protected species. Gruesome: Harris prepares to chew on the baby rat during the sickening 45-minute video clip . All done: The 31-year-old then opens his mouth to prove he has gobbled the entire hairless baby animal . The 31-year-old had been charged with aggravated animal abuse in April after police were alerted to the footage which had drawn complaints from horrified internet users. The disturbing 45-second clip shows the small pink rat squirming on top of a notepad in a pub. A spectator is then heard goading Harris, by telling him to 'go on and eat it'. He picks up the helpless creature, snarls at the camera and pushes it into his mouth before chewing for around five seconds and taking a drink. Disgust: Harris was charged with aggravated animal abuse for eating what appears to be a hairless rat . Stunt: Harris's video on Facebook was reported to the police by the animal cruelty charity PETA after they received complaints . Swig: Harris drinks from an oversized cup during his dare . Animal rights charity People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) reported it to police after a string of complaints. Harris told police he ate the rat 'on a dare from my friends' but pleaded not guilty to a charge of aggravated animal abuse. Prosecutors argued the baby rat deserved protection because it was not wild and was killed in a way that is 'not an accepted fashion'. Grotesque: Harris admitted eating the baby rat for a dare at an earlier court hearing, but left the court unpunished after a judge ruled it was 'not a protected species' But last week Harris went away from court unpunished after the judge dismissed the charges against him, declaring that rats were not a protected species. Harris admitted his actions were 'grotesque' but was not cruel. He'd also claimed his actions were not cruel because the rat was going to be eaten by a snake. He added that 'for centuries rats have been a scourge to humanity and should have no legal protections'.","Judge ruled creature is 'not a protected species'

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 2:36 PM on 14th October 2011 . Jailed: Leigh Clift could face life behind bars after being convicted of murder . A man who has already served five years in prison for plunging a screwdriver into the head of a Tesco worker has now been convicted of murder for the same attack. Leigh Clift, 31, attacked Jonathan Barton in a pub car park in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, in 2000, leaving the victim severely brain damaged. Mr Barton spent the rest of his life in and out of hospital, unable to speak or even feed himself, and eventually died in 2009. Clift was found guilty of grievous bodily harm in 2002, but has now been found guilty of murder after doctors ruled his victim's death was a result of the horrendous attack nine years earlier. Mr Barton was described by his family as a good boy with a caring nature, before the random pub attack. Clift, of Lincolnshire Close, Bletchley, was convicted at Aylesbury Crown Court in January 2002. The original trial heard that Mr Barton, then 19, became embroiled in an argument with his killer outside The Beacon pub in Bletchley. The argument escalated and Clift was later seen with a screwdriver in his hand and Jonathan lying on the ground bleeding from his head. Clift ran off, discarding the screwdriver and a top he had been wearing. Attacked: Jonathan Barton was left with severe brain damage after the screwdriver attack . After being rushed to hospital, it was discovered that a wound from the screwdriver had passed through the left side of Mr Barton's head and into his brain and across to the right side. He was to spend the rest of his life in hospitals, rehabilitation units and at home, where he had to be fed through a tube inserted into his stomach. He was unable to feed himself and his only way of communicating was moving his face or hands. After Jonathan's death in 2009, Clift was arrested and in January of this year charged with murder. It followed medical findings that despite the length of time between the attack and Jonathan's death, he had died as a result of the injuries sustained at the time. Justice for Jonathan: Mother Kim Barton, with her sons Aaron (left) and James outside Luton Crown Court . Outside the court, Jonathan's mother Kim Barton, flanked by her three other sons, Aaron, 25, James, 31 and Anthony, 27, said: 'We are so relieved this ordeal is over. It's justice for Jonathan, but there are no winners.' Earlier in the court's public gallery after the jury returned it's verdict, she had passed a box of tissues to the young woman partner of Clift, who sobbed uncontrollably. Ms Barton, who had her home converted . to look after her son, and who became his full time carer, said: 'Now we just want Jonathan to rest in peace. We will try to re-build our lives even though there a gaping great hole that he left behind.' She added: 'I am . just so grateful we had him all that time after what happened. He gave . us moments of complete joy with his smile and he has left us with some . beautiful memories."" Mr Justice Saunders adjourned the sentenced until a later date. The judge said 'a life sentence' would be passed but he said he needed time to consider how long Clift must serve behind bars. 'This is an unusual situation and I will get all the help I can,' he said before Clift was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced in the near future.","Lee Clift was jailed for GBH in 2002, two years after attack in pub car park that left victim brain-damaged .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Last updated at 10:04 PM on 15th October 2011 . Pro-hunting Labour MP Kate Hoey has launched a bid to stop David Cameron’s local hunt sacking the huntsman to the Chipping  Norton set. The former Sports Minister is furious that the 176-year-old Heythrop hunt in the Cotswolds plans to oust employee Julian Barnfield. Mr Barnfield, a friend of Mr Cameron, is being prosecuted by the RSPCA for illegal fox-hunting. Furious: Labour MP Kate Hoey is unhappy that the Heythrop hunt plans to oust its huntsman Julian Barnfield. He is being prosecuted by the RSPCA for illegal fox-hunting . Ms Hoey, chairman of the Countryside Alliance, says if the hunt does not support professional huntsman Mr Barnfield in the run-up to the trial in the New Year, it could ‘damage’ the reputation of hunting across the country. The court case, disclosed in The Mail on Sunday last month, is threatening to embarrass Mr Cameron, who has ridden with the hunt, because it will reopen political divisions over the pastime and increase pressure on Ministers to overturn Labour’s 2004 ban. The row has also caused divisions in the Chipping Norton set – an influential group of MPs and media professionals who live close to the Oxfordshire market town. Bad news for Cameron: How we broke the story last month . Wealthy landowners, including Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson and Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of the JCB excavator company, allow the hunt to ride through their woods and fields. The issue could surface at next month’s annual £90-a-head black tie hunt ball at the home of former racing trainer Charlie Brooks and his wife Rebekah, the former chief executive of News International – who is at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal. The fate of Mr Barnfield, one of the country’s best-known professional huntsmen, is to be decided at an emergency general meeting just days before the ball. Insiders are predicting a fierce backlash if a decision is made to remove the popular huntsman and they believe many hunt supporters would boycott the ball. The row began after the current senior master of the hunt announced he was standing down next year, and the person chosen to replace him, Charles Frampton, said that he wanted also to take over the role of huntsman, who is in charge of the hounds during hunt meetings. Miss Hoey and senior figures in the Countryside Alliance fear that such a move would undermine Mr Barnfield’s court case. In a letter to Mikey Elliot, chairman of the Heythrop hunt, which has been leaked to The Mail on Sunday, she said:  ‘We must distinguish between the running of the hunt, which is your concern, and the public reputation and future of hunting as a whole, which is ours. ‘We are concerned that to replace, demote or make redundant the defendant in this case, at this particular time, to be potentially damaging for the wider cause of hunting, and the very people upon whom we rely to keep hunting going.’ Mr Elliot, an arable farmer who is married to three-day eventer Ginny Leng, is backing Mr Frampton. He said: ‘Julian has our full support in the legal action, but we needed  a new senior master who could organise the hunting and our seven full-time staff.’ Mr Barnfield declined to comment.","David Cameron's friend is being prosecuted by the RSPCA for illegal fox-hunting .

The chain has signed a deal to stock two eReaders made by Canadian tech firm Kobo, with a starting price of £89. The deal will give users access to the largest eBook catalogue in the UK, with more than 2.2million titles and one million free books. The growth of Kindle and iPad poses a huge threat to traditional book sales, which at WHSmith are down by around 4 per cent on last year. Kobo's eReader - available through WHSmith stores from next week - is £110, offers 2.2 million books and is the first widely available touchscreen wi-fi reader in the UK. A non-touch version is available for £89 . Bosses have apparently taken the view . that the only way to counter the threat is to move into the business of . virtual books themselves. Chief executive Kate Swann said the . move would complement the chain’s existing real book sales rather than . just encouraging shoppers to swap formats. ‘If e-books are ultimately . successful they will be incremental for us given our physical-books . customer base tend to be lighter book readers,’ she said. At £89, the Kobo eReader is the same . price as the latest basic Kindle. It weighs 221g and can store up to . 10,000 eBooks. There is a touchscreen version at £109.99. The readers will be available via WH Smith's 750 outlets. British book chain Waterstones has also said it plans to launch its own eBook reader . Books can be . transferred between devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Despite the fall in book sales, WHSmith reported a 4 per cent rise in profits to £93million in the year to August 31. The eBook launch comes as part of a revamp at . the chain and follows a strategy of cutting out products with low margins, . such as CDs and DVDs, to focus on core areas of news, magazines, books . and stationery, a move that impacted sales but boosted profits. Kobo already has five million customers worldwide and is the biggest eBook company in both Canada and Australia. Profits from stores at airports and stations rose by eight per cent to a record £57million, though like-for-like sales fell as passenger numbers were hit by the tough economic climate.

A British woman whose immigrant husband abandoned her weeks after getting into the UK via an arranged marriage revealed yesterday how the authorities spent ten years ignoring her pleas to deport him for flouting the law. The 32-year-old, who has asked to remain anonymous after threats from her husband’s family, spoke out after learning to her horror that he has been told by the Home Office that he can stay in the UK. She has spent a decade enduring his taunts about how he has taken the immigration system for a ride. Ignored: The woman whose immigrant husband abandoned her weeks after getting into the UK following an arranged marriage. She has asked to remain anonymous . She even took police to the house where the man was hiding – only for him to escape via the back door when bungling officers left it uncovered. Worse, she says her life is ‘ruined’ because she can never recover from the shame of Sharia law divorce – even though they are still married under British law. Her protest has been taken up by Deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans, who is collecting a dossier of similar cases for Home Secretary Theresa May. He said: ‘It is scandalous that this lady spent ten years telling the police and the Home Office of her husband’s illegal behaviour – yet they did nothing. ‘It makes our immigration system look like a joke.’ Supportive: Deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans said the case makes the immigration system look 'like a joke' The incident came to light after  Ministers said two thirds of people who come to the UK on marriage visas have never set foot in the country before. The Government is proposing several new curbs, including encouraging people to report suspected illegal immigrants, outlawing forced marriages and making families of would-be immigrants pay a cash bond. The woman, who contacted The Mail on Sunday, is a respected member of her community in Blackburn, Lancashire. The daughter of Pakistani immigrants, she was born in the UK, is ‘proud to consider myself English’ and has a full-time professional career. She said she had been happy to enter an arranged marriage because she considered it ‘part of her culture’. Aged 21, she went to Pakistan to meet her husband, who was her cousin, and they got married. She returned to Britain, where she bought and renovated a house while she waited for her husband to join her. She said: ‘It wasn’t a love marriage, though I believed love would come after we married. ‘But eight weeks after he arrived, he moved out and moved in with an uncle who lived round the corner. 'I was very shocked. We phoned his mother back in Pakistan and she said “just give him a visa and throw him out”. We couldn’t believe it. They had been planning it all along. I had kept his passport, and he sent people round to get it. I refused. I knew he would destroy it to remove any evidence of when he had entered the country. Getting tough: Immigration Minister Damian Green says the Government is toughening the system to prevent abuse . ‘Then he started harassing me. He even sent his grandmother to berate me. He pushed his way into my mum and dad’s house and abused them. I had to call the police to stop him. The Home Office and the UK Borders Agency said they couldn’t do anything until his one-year marriage visa expired. ‘All the time he taunted me over the way he had got into the country. On one occasion I tracked him down myself. I called the police and they knocked on the front door of the house where he was staying. He got out via the back and has never been seen again. ‘Recently I was informed he has been given leave to remain here for three years. He qualifies for benefits even though he has never paid a penny in tax because he works for cash illegally. Incredibly, he is now using legal aid to divorce me. He wants to marry someone else to increase his chances of staying here for good. ‘I have been humiliated. I obtained a Sharia divorce on the grounds of desertion, but we are still man and wife under English law. My life is ruined. As a Muslim once you are divorced, no one will marry you. ‘I have been telling the authorities for years that he should be sent back, but they have done nothing. The people who suffer most are genuine immigrants who come here legally because it makes people hostile to them.’ A spokesman for Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ‘For too long the immigration system was allowed to get out of control, decisions were not taken quickly enough and that meant those who should not have been allowed to stay were able to do so. ‘The Government is toughening the system to prevent abuse.’","Woman speaks out after learning that partner can stay in the UK .

Stacked up against Ikea flatpack furniture, this was the moment nine Albanian stowaways were caught trying to sneak into the country. The foreign nationals spent 14 hours in a tiny hideaway before being discovered in the largest immigration interception at a North East port. UK Border Agency officials intercepted the Romanian registered vehicle, which was on its way to deliver furniture to an Ikea store in Gateshead, after sniffer dogs picked up a scent at North Shields ferry terminal. Busted: The stowaways spent 14 hours hiding in the compartment before being discovered . Covered in dirt, the stowaways, all aged between 20 and 50, were found in a hidden compartment of the lorry, and questioned before being sent back to The Netherlands, The Newcastle Evening Chronicle reported. Last week the lorries set off from Bucharest in Romania and travelled across Europe to Amsterdam where it is believed the Albanians, desperate for a life in Britain, were staying. John Spence, assistant director at the UKBA, told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle: 'Officers at Tyne Dock use the latest technology, sniffer dogs and their own experience and expertise to stay one step ahead of illegal immigrants. Caught: The nine were busted at the North Shields ferry landing . 'The UK Border Agency’s strong presence at the frontier helps protect the whole country from people illegally entering the UK and then heading for places across Britain. 'We will not hesitate to take strong action against hauliers who fail to secure their vehicles.' UKBA officers use hi-tech search equipment to combat immigration crime and also detect banned and restricted goods that smugglers attempt to bring into the country. They use an array of search techniques including detection dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners, as well as visual searches to find well-hidden stowaways, illegal drugs, firearms and cigarettes. The haulier was later fined £5,000. Destination: The lorry was bound for an Ikea store, similar to the one pictured .",Biggest interception by immigration officials at a North East port .

A gay man has married a transgender woman in Cuba - in what has been hailed as a 'significant step forward' for gay rights in the communist Caribbean country. Ignacio Estrada, 31, and Wendy Iriepa, 37, tied the knot in a simple civil ceremony on the same day as Fidel Castro's 85th birthday - in what they called a 'gift' to the former leader. They then draped themselves in the rainbow flag of gay pride to ride through the streets of Havana. Here comes the bride: Wendy Iriepa (left) and Ignacio Estrada (right) tied the knot in a simple civil cermony on the same day as Fidel Castro's 85th birthday - in what they called a 'gift' to the former leader . Technically it was not a same-sex marriage, which is banned in Cuba, because Iriepa is legally a woman - having undergone the country's first state-funded sex change operation. Born as Alexis, she had surgery in 2007 as part of a pilot programme that, from 2008, made gender-reassignment procedures part of the island's universal health care system. But the wedding was aimed at advancing gay rights in the country, where, in the 1960s, homosexuals were placed in camps for being 'counterrevolutionary'. That initiative, that took place in the years following his 1959 revolution, prompted an apology from Fidel Castro last year, who admitted it had been a 'mistake'. Sealed with a kiss: Bride Wendy Iriepa (left) and groom Ignacio Estrada (right) married in what has been hailed as a 'significant step forward' for gay rights in the Communist Caribbean country . Ecstatic: The couple said they met three months ago and fell in love . New life: Technically it was not a same-sex marriage, which is banned in Cuba, because Iriepa is legally a woman - having undergone the country's first state-funded sex change operation . The ceremony was attended by some of Cuba's best-known dissidents and U.S. diplomats. The bride, wearing a strapless white wedding dress, made an exuberant arrival in a 1950s Ford convertible. She arrived sitting up on the back seat, holding the gay pride flag high with both hands as she smiled with happiness. Stepping down from the car, she said: 'I'm very happy and very nervous. This is really the happiest day of my life.' Momentous: Wendy Iriepa arrived on the back of a car for her wedding with gay rights activist and dissident Ignacio Estrada . Popular: Crowds thronged the car as Wendy Iriepa arrived for her wedding day in the suburbs of Havana . Estrada, who has Aids, was decked out in a white suit and red tie. He arrived separately in a white Mercedes, and said he was also happy and nervous, but that the day's importance extended beyond him and his bride. He said: 'This is the first wedding between a transsexual woman and a gay man. 'We celebrate it at the top of our voices and affirm that this is a step forward for the gay community in Cuba.' Proud: Wendy Iriepa held the rainbow flag above her shoulders as she arrived to take her wedding vows . Celebration: Wendy Iriepa was showered in confetti as she arrived for her wedding . The couple, who met three . months ago and fell in love, arrived to a throng of applauding . supporters, reporters and curious Cubans.

Prominent . dissident bloggers Yoani Sanchez and husband Reinaldo Escobar, who were . Maid of Honour and Best Man, participated in the wedding. Laura Pollan and Berta Soler, leaders of the dissident group Ladies in White, also attended. Sanchez tweeted from the ceremony: 'We are very happy with what has occurred today. A big step in a small Cuba.' Cuba's most prominent gay rights activist Mariela Castro, Fidel Castro's niece and President Raul Castro's daughter, did not attend. But as head of the National Sex Education Centre, where Iriepa worked until recently, she congratulated the couple and said: 'One of our accomplishments has made it possible for Wendy to get married. 'It seems she found the love of her life and we wish her many congratulations, because all of our work has been for this, the well-being and happiness of our sisters.' Mariela Castro's group runs anti-homophobia campaigns and is lobbying for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Cuba.

The officers work behind the scenes checking files for basic spelling and grammatical errors, as well as ensuring sums add up. As many as 500 ‘evidential review officers’ – mostly sergeants on up to £43,000 a year – are employed by the Metropolitan Police alone. Hundreds of police sergeants are having to waste time correcting the poor English of frontline colleagues . The news will enrage ministers desperate for police chiefs to cut bureaucracy and ensure officers spend their time catching criminals. It comes after independent police pay and conditions reviewer Tom Winsor sparked controversy when he revealed he had been told the work of some officers was ‘barely literate’. The former rail regulator endured a torrent of abuse after claiming reading, writing and mathematical skills in the service had fallen ‘significantly’ since the 1930s. He was accused of ‘contempt’ for rank-and-file officers, who said higher educational standards were not necessary for much of their work. Evidential review officers examine the huge volume of paperwork generated by investigating officers, including witness statements, interviews and other documentation. They ensure all the necessary items are correct before offering advice and deciding how an inquiry should progress, if at all. But many chief constables around the country have scrapped the posts  to focus on the front line. In London, there are 199 evidential review officers in 32 boroughs, and up to 300 in specialist departments. A straw poll of other forces revealed West Yorkshire Police employs 11, while Thames Valley Police has 24 ‘case director sergeants’. Greater Manchester Police said it employed none and senior officers in the West Midlands said the role was made redundant two years ago. A Metropolitan Police spokesman defended literacy levels in the force, saying officers had to reach a minimum standard set by the Home Office. He added the main role of evidential review officers was to ‘facilitate the criminal justice process’ by checking files from an ‘independent viewpoint’ and ensuring the correct procedures had been followed.",Up to 500 'evidential review officers' are employed by the Met alone .

Scientists are studying the DNA of a woman who was the world's oldest person until her death at the age of 115, in the belief it could contain the secrets to long life. Dutch woman Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper was born in 1890 and became the word's oldest person in May 2004 before her death in August the following year. What made her even more remarkable was the fact she remained mentally sharp right up until her death. Miracle: Scientists are examining the DNA of Hendrikje van . Andel-Schipper to try and discover how she remained so mentally sharp until her . death aged 115 . She showed no signs of Alzheimer's disease which most experts assume would be inevitable for someone of her years. Nor did she suffer from may other conditions normally associated with people who live over the age of 100 such as hardening of the arteries. The Dutch woman has become the oldest person to have her complete genetic code sequenced . Now, six years after her death she has become the oldest person to have her complete genetic code sequenced as scientists hope to unlock the secrets to her good health and longevity. Ms van Andel-Schipper was an avid supporter of Ajax Football Club and attributed her old age to not smoking, pickled herrings and limiting alcohol to 'a small advocaat with cream on Sundays and holidays'. A team from VU University medical centre in Amsterdam have now begun comparing her DNA in an attempt to understand how genetic mutations develop in blood and brain tissue. Dr Henne Holstege, who is leading the study, said she hoped to discover if it was Ms van Andel-Schipper's genes that protected her from common age-related conditions or if it was down to other factors. Following her death in 2006 Ms van Andel-Schipper's brain was examined by Dr Holstege's father Gert, a neuroscientist at the Universtiy of Groningen, who was shocked to discover no signs of Alzeimers or dementia. He said: 'That came as something of a surprise. 'Everybody was thinking that when you have a brain over 100 years, you have a lot of problems. 'This is the first (extremely old) brain that did not have these problems.' In 1972, the then 82-year-old Van Andel called the University of Groningen in order to donate her body to science. She called them again at age 111 because she worried she might no longer be of interest. Dr Holstege senior tested her mental . abilities at the age of 112 and 113 and although she had problems with . her eyesight, she was alert and performed better than the average 60 to . 75-year-old.

Ms van Andel-Schipper was born prematurely weighing only 3.5 pounds and her family feared she wouldn't survive. She lived at home until the age of 47 and married tax inspector Dick van Andel who died in 1959. She had no children. All her siblings lived past 70, and her mother died at the age of 100.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 5:30 PM on 14th October 2011 . The UK's analogue TV era will come to an end on October 24, 2012, it was announced today. Eighty years from the first experimental broadcasts, the old five-channel system will be switched off for good. The digital television switchover started in 2008, giving millions of viewers extra channels and clearer pictures. There are just four million people left in Britain watching analogue TV, according to Digital UK. All set for the future: The digital switchover has been taking place for the past few years, with 23million households now enjoying multi-channel TV . This map shows the areas that have already converted to digital TV and those that have yet to switch . There are five regions yet to make the switch: London, Meridian, Anglia, Tyne Tees and Northern Ireland. It’s estimated that over 23million households in Britain now have digital TV on their main set. Anglia: This region is underway and completes next month, November  2011 . Meridian: February to June 2012 . London: April 2012 . Tyne Tees: September 2012 . Northern Ireland: October 2012 . Announcing the end-date for analogue TV and switchover, David Scott, Digital UK chief executive, said: ‘The analogue era was a defining period for TV but the fully digital age will be even better, with a greater choice of channels for viewers everywhere. ‘I'm looking forward to October next year when we will have brought the benefits of digital to every corner of the country.’ The first experimental analogue television broadcasts started in August 1932. The technology was officially launched by the BBC in 1936 and went on to inform and entertain viewers with coverage of landmark events such as the moon landings and classic shows from Nationwide to Morecambe and Wise. At its conclusion in 2012, inside the timetable set out by Government, more than 15million new viewers will have been brought into coverage for Freeview services, Digital UK said. New era: Buying a digital set-top box like this is one way to make the switch . Households in many parts of the UK are currently unable to receive multi-channel TV services. Switching off the existing analogue broadcasting system will create the capacity necessary to extend coverage to the whole country. Broadcasting in digital format is also a more efficient way to transmit television signals and will free up airwaves for new services such as ultra-fast wireless broadband and mobile television. The organisation added it was on course to complete the project at least £53million under budget. The . last analogue TV signals will be switched off in Northern Ireland where . ‘virtually all’ households will receive the new digital signal . ‘including half-a-million viewers who cannot receive it now’. To help the elderly make the switch to the potentially confusing new digital era the BBC set up a Digital Switchover Help Scheme. However, Age UK found that many older people who needed financial or technical support to make the switch to digital TV did not qualify for this help, so they formed a secondary help group. A spokesperson for the organisation said: 'To tackle this problem, Age UK, along with Community Service Volunteers formed Digital Outreach Ltd which offers advice and support both to those who are eligible for the Help Scheme and those who benefit from extra support and advice but are not eligible. 'They focus on those with sensory, mobility or dexterity impairments, people with learning difficulties, people with mental health issues, those who speak English as a second language and socially isolated people.'","London, Meridian, Anglia, Tyne Tees and Northern Ireland yet to switch ."

Arrested again: Police released their latest mugshot photo of Loni Bouchard, far left, as she was arrested again yesterday. It is the third mugshot that has been taken of the 20-year-old since July . Southington police confirmed that they . arrested Bouchard on the fresh sexual assault charges and that she is . being held on $25,000 bail. Bouchard’s lawyer said today she is in counselling and hopes people will not pre-judge her. In July, Bouchard was arrested following a three-month investigation into her relationship with a boy she babysat regularly. According to police records, Bouchard repeatedly stayed over at the home of the boy, and offered him alcohol and marijuana in addition to having sex with him. Also charged: Bouchard's mother Kimmy Bouchard has been charged with providing alcohol and marijuana to one of the under age boys . When the boy’s mother discovered their relationship through Facebook messages, she notified police. Court records reveal details of . evidence seized that included a notebook with a photo of Justin Bieber . on the cover that Bouchard had used as a journal detailing her . relationship with the most recent 14-year-old. In the handwritten notes Bouchard writes about the 'amazing' sex . she had with the boy and professed her love for him. Babysitter's seduction: Loni Bouchard is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy who she was hired to look after . 'I know there is a five-year age difference, but why does it have to matter?' she wrote in the journal. 'I don’t care about the law.  I just want to be with him and not have to hide it. 'How can the law tell us who to fall for, who to like and who to . love and especially who to date? I thought America was a free country. Bouchard’s mother, Kimmy Bouchard, is also charged in providing alcohol and marijuana following the affair. It has also been revealed that the boy's parents filed a restraining order against Miss Bouchard in May. Around that time, she wrote in her journal: ‘His mom absolutely HATES me because of the situation and I understand why, but she's being immature about it.’ She also wrote that she was cutting herself and used a bracelet the boy gave her to cover the scratches. In a separate notebook seized from her home, police found letters written to the boy, where Miss Bouchard said she was upset his parents had filed the restraining order, and missed waking up next to him. Bouchard, who had been freed from jail after posting $1,000 bond, faces charges of second-degree sexual assault, purchasing alcohol for a minor and two counts of risk of injury to a minor.","Loni Bouchard  allegedly plied the boys with alcohol and marijuana .

Sentence: Vivek Balliga pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court, pictured, to three counts of voyeurism against the two doctors . Disgraced Baliga, who is studying for a PhD in Leeds, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to three counts of voyeurism against the two doctors. Prosecutor Carmel Pearson told the court that Baliga set up the recording devices between September 2007 and December 2009 to store the films of his two female friends on his laptop. Ms Pearson said: 'They considered him a close friend. Both had considered him part of their social . group and had allowed him into their homes.' One of the doctors discovered she had been videoed when she visited Baliga’s home on 13 December 2009 with her boyfriend. The defendant suggested she use the shower in his en-suite bathroom. Ms Pearson said: 'While she was showering she discovered a video camera. It was switched on and had recorded her taking a shower. She tried to delete the images of her. She was . horrified. 'She went back to the bedroom and told her partner. They left without speaking to the defendant. 'He tried to stop them from leaving. They just drove off.

Ms Pearson said that after a great deal of consideration she finally reported the matter to police. Police seized his computer equipment and discovered he had taken a camera to another woman’s house and installed it in her shower and a toilet. She told police she had invited him to stay at her house more than once. Richard Reed, for the defendant, said his client was of previous good character and was full of 'profound regret and remorse for his behaviour'. He said the implications for him were 'far-reaching' with the General Medical Council investigating his behaviour. 'He has had to disclose these offences to employers and colleagues,' he said. 'That is enormously stressful and he now faces court.' In a text message to one of his victims he wrote: 'I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. I made the biggest mistake of my life. I will never forgive myself. I will regret it forever. I have lost a good friend. I am an idiot.' Judge Scott Wolstenholme told the defendant he would receive a community order for three years and said his behaviour would be 'considered by almost everyone to be disgusting and despicable'. In addition he said Baliga, of Horsforth, Leeds, was prohibited from approaching either of the victims and he is barred from operating any device capable of recording images.","Vivek Balliga banned from 'devices capable of recording images'

A traffic officer who was jailed for giving his ex-girlfriend genital herpes today walked free from prison on bail after launching an appeal against his conviction. David Christopher Edward Golding, 28, from Braunston, Northamptonshire, was jailed for 14 months at Northampton Crown Court last month after admitting causing grievous bodily harm. But new evidence could cast doubt on whether it was Golding who actually passed on the sexually transmitted infection to the woman, the Court of Appeal heard today. A prosecution-commissioned medical report suggests that it could not be proved that it was definitely Golding who gave the victim the disease. Mr Justice Burnett, sitting at the London court, granted Golding's application for bail to allow him to go home while new evidence is gathered for his appeal. Golding, who worked for the Highways Agency, was accused of recklessly infecting his then partner with the genital herpes virus when they were together about two years ago. But his jailing caused outrage among sexual health groups, who said the sentence would add to the stigma attached to carriers of the 'trivial' condition. The appeal is to be based around . examination of a blood sample given by the woman some time ago, which . might cast doubt on Golding's guilt, Mr Justice Burnett told the court. 'This whole matter should not go into the long grass whilst both parties seek further expert evidence,' the appeal judge added. 'It is important that this proceeds . with some speed. If the conclusion following the further medical . evidence is that causation really could not be proved, then the sooner . that is, the better. 'As importantly, if the outcome . excludes the possibility of causation by another route, then that needs . to be known as quickly as possible because the appellant may, in those . circumstances, have to return to custody to continue to serve his . sentence.' Granting bail pending appeals is a rare move for the Court of . Appeal, pictured, but Mr Justice Burnett said Golding's was an 'exceptional' case. Granting bail pending appeals is a rare move for the Court of . Appeal, but Mr Justice Burnett said Golding's was an 'exceptional' case. His legal team may also argue that it . was wrong that he pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, rather . than the less serious offence of causing actual bodily harm, which . carries a lesser sentence. At the time of the sentencing, Golding’s parents, Janet, 64, and Christopher, 59, said they were shocked by the jail term. Mrs Golding said: ‘This is David’s . first offence and we are distraught at what might happen to him in jail. He’s a good son who did not deserve this.’ Her husband said that he found the sentence ‘difficult to understand’. The virus which causes genital herpes . could cause an outbreak or lie dormant for years, during which time it . is not infectious. Many people remain unaware they are infected. Those who do display symptoms usually suffer fever, headache and tiredness and small blisters and itching. Nigel Scott, spokesman for the Herpes . Viruses Association, said Golding’s sentence was ‘outrageous’ and . compared the case to prosecuting children for ‘giving their friends . chicken pox’. He added: ‘It is such a trivial . infection that most people don’t notice it. It has exactly the same . medical implications and consequences as an ordinary facial cold sore.’ Marian Nicholson, director of the . HVA, added: ‘Many of those who are diagnosed are reluctant to disclose . their status but this is because of the unnecessary stigma, not because . it is serious ... emphatically it is not.’ The appeal is unlikely to return to court . for at least a month, but Golding will be allowed to go home while . further investigation is undertaken.","Granting bail pending appeals is rare but Mr Justice Burnett said Highway Agency worker's case was 'exceptional'

Ridge Barden, a 'lineman' - someone who specialises in play at the line of scrimmage - from Phoenix's John C. Birdlebough High School, complained of a headache and later died. The 16-year-old was face down after the play Friday . and was able to sit up unaided, but he collapsed when he tried to stand. Scroll down to see a news video . Ridge Barden, a 16-year-old lineman from John C. Birdlebough High School in Phoenix, died after complaining of a headache following an American football collision . His death has stunned his school community and comes at a time when youth sports are under scrutiny over whether enough is being done to protect young players' heads. The Birdlebough team were playing at Homer, south of Syracuse, and the hit came about six minutes into the third quarter during a play, Homer police officer Donald Warner said. An ambulance took Barden, who turned 16 last month, to hospital, . and he was being transferred to a larger medical centre in Syracuse when . his condition deteriorated, Phoenix School District Superintendent Judy Belfield said. The 16-year-old was playing for a team at John C. Birdlebough High School in Phoenix when the fatal accident happened . Barden's distraught mother speaking to ABC News . The ambulance turned around, but doctors were unable to save the boy's life. The team coaches didn't learn until well after the game that the boy's injuries were so severe and Belfield said: 'The coaches and trainers went over. He was talking. He rolled on his back by himself.' Officials opened the high school on Saturday to students or staff who wanted to talk about what had happened. 'It just one of those freak things,' Belfield continued. 'The Homer players have to be feeling just as much sadness.' The Homer Central School District posted a message on its website on Saturday morning saying the community had been 'deeply saddened and shares in the grief of the Phoenix School Community'. Warner, who was working at the game, said police were investigating but there was no suspicion of criminal activity. 'It looks like just a bad accident,' he said. Head injuries in football have been a concern across the country in recent years, with some medical evidence emerging to suggest that the equipment players use may not be enough to protect them from serious, long-term injuries. A handful of high school students suffer fatal on-field injuries every autumn, according to the University of North Carolina's National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research. Team-mates remember the talented teenager . A player at Frostburg State University, in Maryland, died after suffering a head injury in a practice in August. Belfield said the school district sends its football helmets out to be reconditioned every year, and that each has to pass a safety inspection before the season begins. She said: 'Over the course of the past few years, they have really tried to improve the protection of the head, but there is always a risk of injury or of death.' She added that an investigation would be conducted to try to determine what went wrong. In New York, a law signed this summer requires school coaches to bench student athletes who have symptoms of a concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury with symptoms such as dizziness or headaches. Students can play again only after they are symptom-free for 24 hours and cleared in writing by a doctor.","'It just one of those freak things' says detective .

'Justice for the 96': Liverpool fans still display banners in reference to the Hillsborough disaster, which will be debated in Parliament tonight after 100,000 people signed an online petition . In the letter, published by The Mirror, . Mr Cameron wrote: 'The Government is committed to full disclosure of the . Hillsborough information it holds. We have proposed that disclosure . takes place to the families prior to wider publication.' In particular, they are keen to see the minutes of a cabinet briefing which they say took place the following day between the then-Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher and senior officers at South Yorkshire Police. It was three days after the meeting that The Sun newspaper published an infamous story, quoting an unnamed police source, which blamed the disaster on a group of drunken Liverpool fans. The article, which was subsequently heavily discredited by Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry, also claimed some Liverpool fans had pickpocketed the dead and urinated on police as they tried to control the situation. Taylor's report into the disaster in August of the same year said: 'Not a single witness was called before the inquiry to support any of those allegations.' The anger it created in Liverpool led to a boycott of the paper in the city that remains in place today despite efforts to apologise. The chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group has today called on The Sun to reveal the identity of the unnamed police source quoted in the story. Tragedy: Fans carry an injured supporter off the pitch during the disaster which claimed 96 lives . Margaret Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old son James in the disaster told The Guardian: 'If we are now to discover the real truth, let the Sun tell us who gave them those lies which caused so much damage. 'If the Sun wants to make amends, they should reveal who it was, not allow their sources to hide behind anonymous briefings 22 years later, and help the families to understand what happened.' The families believe a major incident plan was never initiated by South Yorkshire Police meaning crushed fans were denied emergency and potentially lifesaving medical attention. Boycott: Many Liverpool fans refuse to buy The Sun newspaper after its reporting of the story . The families also dispute the findings of the single inquest into all 96 deaths which ruled the victims had all sustained their fatal injuries by 3.15pm. This meant the coroner did not hear any evidence of what happened after that point - even though many bereaved families believe their loved ones could still have been alive. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. The families say it is an injustice that no individual or organisation has been held fully to account for the disaster. Writing about the issue on his blog today, The Guardian's media commentator Roy Greenslade said: 'The South Yorkshire force had a motive - to distract attention from its own failings, as highlighted by Taylor - and the opportunity to brief journalists off the record.' However, he also points out that he doesn't think the The Sun revealing the name of the source would shed much new light on the subject. 'It is possible that the release of internal police documents will point a finger towards an individual, though I somehow doubt it,' he wrote. Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to restate the government's position is a 'commitment to full transparency about the Hillsborough disaster through full public disclosure'. However, there are some issues surrounding the legality of publishing the documents because standard practise maintains that those details are not usually published for 30 years. The documents set to be disclosed will include cabinet papers from the time, but it is as yet unclear if that tranche of information will include the meeting between Thatcher and South Yorkshire police. A panel of independent experts has been established to examine the documents, and will then report on what the new details add to the public understanding of the disaster. It is the second petition to be debated in the Commons since the coalition introduced the e-petition system. MPs considered the riots last week, and are also set to discuss British membership of the European Union.","Families of victims want to see cabinet minutes of briefing between Margaret Thatcher and South Yorkshire Police .

One of America’s priciest divorce cases is coming to an end now baseball power couple Frank and Jamie McCourt are said to have come to a deal. Former LA Dodgers CEO Jamie will reportedly abandon claims for a share of the team from the owner - her husband Frank - and get $130million. It means Jamie will no longer prevent Frank’s plan to remain owner by selling the troubled baseball team’s television rights in a bankruptcy court. Power couple: Frank and Jamie McCourt were married for nearly 30 years, before their separation sparked one of the costliest divorce fights in California history . Big league legal brawl: Jamie McCourt had sought half of the Dodgers franchise after a judge deemed her post-nuptial agreement with Frank McCourt invalid . A divorce filing valued the marriage at $1.2billion, including six homes and the $800million LA Dodgers. The couple lived a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet and $10,000 a month for Jamie's hair stylist. They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing and Frank once shelled out $80,000 on a Caribbean vacation. A settlement would end the two-year case . of what is believed to be California’s costliest divorce ever, . reported the Los Angeles Times. It will also clear the way for Frank . to take on Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig in court as he . tries to keep hold of the Dodgers. The couple spent more than $20million . over the divorce in July - and the battle over who owned the Dodgers . could have added another $14million. The couple announced in October 2009 that they would be ending their 30-year marriage - and Frank fired Jamie as CEO. Comfortable living: This a Los Angeles property of Frank McCourt. The couple lived a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet . Strike: The Los Angeles Dodgers' Andre Ethier in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks last month. The team are currently in serious financial trouble . The McCourts continued their brawl . over the team’s ownership and then the MLB took control of the club's . day-to-day operations in mid-April. The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in June and lawyers for Jamie alleged that Frank was running the team into the ground. But Frank’s counsel claimed it was Jamie who was refusing to accept any settlements and was allowing the case to drag on. The Dodgers blamed a cash-flow crisis . on the MLB's refusal to pass the television deal that Frank was . counting on to keep the team afloat. A judge ruled last December that a post-nuptial marital agreement that gave Frank sole ownership of the Dodgers was invalid. That allowed Jamie to seek half the team under California's community property law. The McCourts had reached a settlement that was contingent on MLB's approval of the TV deal with Fox, worth up to $3billion. But Commissioner Selig rejected the . deal at the time, saying it was not in the best interests of baseball. The battle will soon continue in court.","Two-year dispute between Frank and Jamie McCourt .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:01 PM on 29th September 2011 . A husband convicted of killing his wife underwater more than a decade ago is a free man again after a panel of judges overturned the ruling. It was alleged David Swain, 55, killed Shelley Tyre, 46, by tearing off her scuba mask as they swam by a shipwreck in the British Virgin Islands. But the expert diver today walked free after appeal judges found problems with jury instructions read by a judge during the trial in 2009. Free: David Swain, centre, and his daughter Jennifer Swain Bloom, right, speak with a guard after his release from jail in the British Virgin Islands today . Swain, of Rhode Island, has protested his innocence since she died in 1999, claiming he tried to revive her with CPR after an accident. Now Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court of Appeal judges have found problems with jury instructions read out during the trial. The court did not order a new trial because of concerns about recalling defence witnesses, given the amount of time passed since the death. ‘I feel elated,’ Swain said as he left court with his daughter Jennifer Swain Bloom, who has also long maintained her father's innocence. Conviction overturned: It was believed David Swain, 55, killed Shelley Tyre, 46, by tearing off her scuba mask while they swam by a shipwreck in 1999 . He said the two intend to return to Rhode Island ‘sooner rather than later.’ A jury had unanimously convicted Swain in October 2009 of murdering Ms Tyre in what authorities described as a near-perfect crime. He was ordered to serve at least 25 years of a mandatory life sentence. But defence lawyer J.S. Archibald argued the judge did not adequately advise the jury on how to handle evidence from a related civil suit. Authorities initially ruled Tyre's drowning near an isolated shipwreck at a depth of 80ft as an accident. British Virgin Islands: A jury had unanimously convicted Swain in October 2009 of murdering Ms Tyre in what authorities described as a near-perfect crime . But they later charged Swain with murder following a 2006 civil trial in Rhode Island that found him responsible for her death. The civil jury awarded Ms Tyre's family $3.5million, and Swain later filed for bankruptcy. Prosecutors had argued that Swain killed Tyre because he was in love with another woman and wanted to obtain his wife's money. Their case rested largely on experts who believed Swain attacked his wife from behind, yanked off her scuba mask and cut off her air supply. Authorities said her mask was damaged, the mouthpiece of her snorkel was missing, and that her fin was found embedded in a sandbar. When dive shop owner Swain was sentenced . to at least 25 years in jail, the world believed that the mystery which began . in 1999 when his wife's body was found floating had been closed . for good. Two years ago: David Swain, second right, is escorted to the prison vehicle after being found guilty of murdering his wife (file picture from October 2009) But Thursday's news of an overturned conviction is just another chapter in an amazing story. Police at first wrote off her drowning as a tragic accident - a strange but otherwise unremarkable death of an experienced diver on a romantic getaway to one of the world's premier dive spots. Prosecutors accused him of drowning his wife on the last day of their holiday so he could pursue a romance with a Rhode Island chiropractor as well as gain his wife's inheritance of $630,000. But defence lawyers maintained a poor post-mortem report could not rule out medical reasons for her death, including the possibility she had a heart attack or stroke during an accidental drowning. The case, which attracted TV shows including 'Dateline NBC,' produced one of the most sensational trials in the history of the tiny British Caribbean territory, where violence is relatively rare.","David Swain, 55, allegedly killed Shelley Tyre in 1999 in British Virgin Islands .

"By . Paul Sutherland . Last updated at 11:48 AM on 3rd October 2011 . Housed in a dome almost the size of Big Ben and containing a mirror nearly half the length of a football pitch, it wasn’t exactly rocket science for astronomers to find a name for this telescope. And, sure enough, they came up with the European Extremely Large Telescope – just about the only routine thing about the world’s largest and most powerful ‘eye on the sky’. Astronomers reckon it may finally shed light on whether there really is life somewhere out there by helping them find Earth-like rocky worlds that are home to other beings. And British scientists might be among the first to find out – as their work is crucial to the project. Key . instruments for the telescope will be developed thanks to £3.5million . funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The device in the Atacama Desert, Chile, will be built in a dome that covers an area the size of a stadium. It . has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater . than any previous telescope, and is designed to help astronomers peer . back to the first galaxies 14billion years ago. This . could unlock secrets of dark matter and dark energy – little-understood . forces in space – to help explain how the universe evolved, according . to the plans. The British . instruments are being developed by the universities of Durham and . Oxford, with the UK Astronomy Technology Centre and Rutherford Appleton . Laboratory. They will include spectrometers to . analyse the light received from space, as well as gadgets to help remove . blurring distortions caused by the Earth’s atmosphere, a process known . as adaptive optics. This will produce pictures 15 times sharper than those taken by the Hubble space telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990. Professor . Isobel Hook, E-ELT project scientist at the University of Oxford, said: . ‘This new financial commitment from the STFC means that UK astronomers . will have access to the earliest scientific results from this . revolutionary telescope – an exciting prospect.’ The Atacama, pictured, is a favoured location for the project because the dryness and clarity of the air provide exceptional observing conditions . It is believed the telescope will . bring hundreds of millions of pounds of benefits to British companies . involved in building it. They . include a consortium based at the OpTIC Technium in North Wales, which . is developing prototypes for the huge segments needed to make the . 43-yard mirror. Engineers . will have to blast the top off Chile’s 9,900ft Cerro Armazones mountain . peak to build the telescope if final approval is given by the European . Southern Observatory’s 15 international partners in December. It is . hoped the observatory will be operating by 2020. The E-ELT will be the latest tool to join observatories operated in Chile by Europe. The Atacama is a favoured location because the dryness and clarity of the air provide exceptional observing conditions. Established . telescopes include the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a set of dishes . that forms the highest observatory in the world at 16,000ft.

The new policy will bring the carrier into line with its parent company Southwest Airlines, which already requires its 'customers of size' to shell out two-fold. The airline's revised stance comes as obesity levels hit record proportions, with more than a third, 33.8 per cent, of American adults now obese. Fattist?: AirTran is to forcing fat passengers to buy a second seat bringing the carrier into line with its parent company Southwest Airlines . Starting from March flight attendants and check-in staff will identify those who can't sit in a single seat with the armrest lowered and require them to buy a second place. Equality campaigners have denounced the policy as 'humiliating'. Peggy Howell, a spokeswoman for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution some passengers end up 'embarrassed and humiliated' when they're asked to buy a second seat at the airport. 'I’m sorry to hear that they’re now going to be passing on their bad policy to another airline,' Howell said. 'We are paying customers.' Howell also raised concerns that there are few guidelines for the enforcement of the policy, rather it is to be left to the judgement and discretion of staff. The new policy follows the carrier's acquisition of Air Tran in May this year. Economy seats are 18 inches wide in Air Tran's economy class according to SeatGuru.com, the website which gives details of airline seating plans and sizing. Previously, the airline did not have a definitive 'customers of size' policy, but employees at the airport gate usually offered a second seat or an upgrade for a fee to passengers considered larger than average, Southwest said. Southwest's policy had been standing for 30 years but affects 'less than half on one percent of customers, the airline said. The policy states: 'Customers of size,' are those  'who encroach upon any part of the neighbouring seat[s]. ... The armrest is considered to be the definitive boundary between seats.' Acquisition: The new policy comes after Air Tran merged with Southwest in May . If there are remaining seats on the plane, plus-size passengers who have been charged for an extra seat will be entitled apply for a refund. Southwest introduced the policy following an increase in the number of complaints from passengers whose seat had been infringed upon by a large person, their website said. 'We could no longer ignore complaints from customers who travelled without full access to their seat due to encroachment by a large seat-mate whose body extended into the neighbouring seat. These customers had uncomfortable [and sometimes painful] travel experiences,' Southwest said. Excess baggage fees on AirTran will also increase from $50 to $110 per item from April as part of the merger. Strict policy: AirTran will begin requiring fat passengers to purchase two seats from March 1 .","Move is in response to news that a third of Americans is now obese .

Relatives of Mr Tomlinson gasped from the public gallery as Harwood, 40, denied the allegation against him. Appearing in the dock wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, he spoke clearly to confirm his name before he was told: . 'You are charged on this indictment with manslaughter, that on April 1 2009, you unlawfully killed Ian Tomlinson. 'How do you plead: guilty or not guilty?' He answered: 'My Lord, not guilty.'

Dozens of FBI agents arrived to search the home where the mother of Baby Lisa is staying - just hours after she admitted she was blackout drunk the night her daughter vanished. Kansas City mother Deborah Bradley made the drinking admission in a tearful interview on NBC's 'Today' on Monday morning. Ms Bradley also said she believes she will be arrested over the disappearance of Lisa Irwin, who was 10-months-old when she was reported missing in the early hours of October 4. Hours after the sit-down, search dogs were combing over a family property where Ms Bradley and her fiancé, Jeremy Irwin, have stayed throughout the investigation. Scroll down for video . Blackout: Deborah Bradley, pictured with Baby Lisa's father Jeremy Irwin, admits that she was drunk on a box of wine she bought before her daughter disappeared . Quizzed: Johnny Tanko was seen in the neighbourhood the night 10-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing from her crib at her parents' Kansas City home. Agents closed the 5200 block of North Walrond to media and would not say what they were searching for, reports FOX 4. Agents were also seen searching an area along the Buckeye Greenway park with shovels. In another interview with People . magazine, Bradley had said she bought boxed wine hours before Lisa . disappeared and that 'it's a possibility' that she drank to the point of . blacking out. Ms Bradley has claimed the girl was swiped from her crib in the dead of night as her mother and two brothers slept. She maintained she did nothing to harm her child. 'No, no... I don't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that,' she said in the television interview. High-powered: Parents Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin (right) have hired Joe Tacopina (left) as their lawyer. Tacopina is best known for defending Joran Van der Sloot, the Dutch man suspected in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway . The mother also changed a key point in her story: She initially told authorities she last checked on Lisa at 10:30pm, but she told NBC she actually last saw Lisa when she put her to bed at 6:40pm. She gave no explanation for the modified times. Meanwhile Joe Tacopina told reporters Monday . that he had been hired to represent Jeremy Irwin, the baby's father, and Ms Bradley. His past clients include Joran Van der Sloot, suspected in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba, rapper Foxy Brown when she 'attacked' a salon worker, Sopranos actor-turned-killer Lillo Brancato, and Ken Moreno, one of the New York police officers recently acquitted of rape. Tacopina praised Kansas City police for their investigation but insisted the parents have 'nothing to hide.' On Sunday, military police from the Missouri National Guard joined FBI agents and officers from several police and sheriff's departments from nearby communities in the search for Lisa in a large wooded area near the family's home. Caught on tape: Deborah Bradley was caught on a store's surveillance video buying a box of wine and baby supplies with her brother, five hours before Lisa vanished . Hunt: Police are searching an abandoned house near the Irwin residence where diapers and baby wipes were found . Ms Bradley and Mr Irwin, have told . authorities that he arrived home from a night shift to find the front . door unlocked, the house lights on, a window tampered with and the baby . gone. Ms Bradley and their two sons were asleep elsewhere in the home. Authorities have already searched the family's neighbourhood, nearby wooded areas, a landfill and abandoned homes. Police have said they have no suspects or major leads. Bradley said police accused her of killing Lisa and that she believes she will be arrested. 'I was the last one with her,' she said. 'That's kind of a fear that I have.' She said is scared that her arrest would precipitate an end to the search for her missing baby. 'If they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her and I'll never know what happened,' Bradley said. Where is she? As the search for the baby who disappeared from Kansas City, Missouri, continues a $100,000 reward was put up for her return or the conviction of anyone involved in her going missing . Missing: Her parents say she disappeared from her crib overnight as her mother and two brothers slept . She also said her two sons, aged 6 and 8, say they heard noises the night Lisa disappeared, although she doesn't know if they heard noises before they went to sleep or later in the night and she doesn't want them to be involved in the investigation. 'I have not sat down and talked to them about it, specifically to not have to put them through anything else,' she said. A local handyman was questioned over the weekend in connection with the child's disappearance. Johnny Tanko was . seen in the neighbourhood on the night ten-month-old Lisa Irwin was . reported missing from her crib at her parents' Kansas City home. Missing: It has been almost two weeks since 10-month-old Lisa Irwin was last seen . The odd job man, known locally as 'Jersey' was arrested and questioned. He is not being considered a suspect. Previously, in an attempt to keep the case in the public eye, the family had decided to reveal unseen home videos of the baby aged only three months.

Peter Foster, 35, was arrested a few hours before the body of Heather Cooper, who gave birth to a daughter last month, was found in Blackdown Woods, near Lurgashall in West Sussex. Murder squad officers are investigating whether the couple’s other child, a three-year-old boy, witnessed her death. Held: Former detective Peter Foster, left, was arrested on suspicion of murder after the discovery of the body of Heather Cooper in woodland near Lurgashall in West Sussex . Police arrived at the family’s £700,000 rented home at 11.30pm on Sunday after a relative dialled 999. They discovered the woman detective’s body concealed among undergrowth four miles away. Forensic officers in white overalls last night conducted a finger-tip search of the wood and a Home . Office pathologist was called in to examine the body before it was taken . away. Bags of evidence were also removed from the couple’s home in Haslemere, Surrey. Search: Police officers comb the woodland area near where the 30-year-old's body was found looking for clues and evidence . A police cordon is still in place at the scene where body was discovered concealed among undergrowth as investigations continue . Today police investigating the killing urged witnesses to come forward. A spokesman said: 'Officers are keen . to hear from anyone who may have seen a silver BMW estate in the area of . West Street, Haslemere, and Tennyson’s Lane near the Blackdown Woods . car park between the hours of 11am and 11pm on Sunday, 16 October.' Detective Chief Inspector Nick May, . of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We are continuing work . to build up a picture of events on Sunday and I am urging anyone who . may have seen this vehicle during that day in these locations to contact . police. 'Your information could prove vital. Officers have now been granted a further 36 hours to question the suspect.

Murder probe: Forensic investigators are examining this house in Haslemere, Surrey, tonight after a woman police officer's body was found in woodland four miles away . ‘It was a case of wrong place, wrong . time and the man who shot him was imprisoned,’ said the friend. ‘But it . affected his whole family hugely. Peter was particularly upset.’ He added: ‘How much tragedy does one family have to deal with? ‘It is so shocking and his family are . devastated. Their children are so young, their little girl is only just a . month old, and we are very concerned for them. ‘Peter left the police some time ago, before the death of his father. ‘He found it very difficult to deal with. But the idea he could kill the mother of his two children is just unbelievable.’ A neighbour said: ‘I think he was in an elite unit of the police.’ Fears: The police investigation began after officers were notified of concerns for their colleague's safety . Another said: ‘Heather gave birth to a . little girl just a few weeks ago. I remember seeing her walking around . heavily pregnant. They have a little boy who is about three.’ After . leaving Surrey Police, Foster set up a plumbing and heating firm from . his house, which is opposite a police station. A website promoting the company says . it is family run and there are testimonials from letting agencies, pub . landlords and homeowners. A job advert published in April offered a ‘competitive salary, company vehicle and company bonus scheme’. Foster had spent more than five years . with the small and close-knit Surrey force, becoming a detective . constable working on violent crimes. Investigation: At this stage it is not known how the policewoman died . Police say another man called Peter Foster, a detective inspector, currently works for the force. Miss Cooper was a detective constable . with Guildford CID and worked on several high-profile cases including an . attempted kidnapping last year. An assistant at Waitrose in Haslemere . said Foster had shopped for groceries there on Sunday afternoon. ‘He just seemed perfectly normal,’ he . said. ‘He was not behaving out of the ordinary or acting in any way that . would cause alarm. I just cannot believe it.’ A post-mortem examination was expected to take place today at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford. Police were called to the family's home in West Street, Haslemere on Sunday and the woman's body was found four miles away in Tennyson Lane in Blackdown Woods . A Surrey Police spokesman said: . ‘Following inquiries officers went to Blackdown Woods near Lurgashall, . where a search of the woodland led to the discovery of the body of a . woman in her 30s. ‘Police have cordoned off the area of . woodland and forensic officers are on site carrying out inquiries. The . woman’s body has not yet been formally identified. ‘A 35-year-old man from Haslemere has . been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the incident and . remains in custody.’ The woods in which Miss Cooper’s body was found are in a part of the South Downs owned by the National Trust.

But there’s a bit more to it than that now. The fast food giant is launching McTV - high definition television in its restaurants, featuring local news, sport and entertainment features. ‘Survivor’ and ‘The Apprentice’ producer Mark Burnett is joining with BBC America and KABC-TV to provide content for 800 California restaurants. New idea: Customer Steven Price sits at a table near a HDTV screen showing the new McDonald's channel in Norwalk, California, on Monday . ‘While they're in line getting their hamburger there is no escape,’ Landor Associates brand expert Allen Adamson told the Los Angeles Times. ‘The podiums where companies can tell their stories have eroded - after the Super Bowl the list gets very short very fast.’ The in-store channel will be launched across restaurants in California by Los Angeles entertainment and technology firm ChannelPort. Restaurants will be fitted with two high-definition screens of up to 46 inches that can be seen from 70 per cent of areas where food is eaten. Involved: 'Survivor' and 'The Apprentice' producer Mark Burnett is joining with BBC America and KABC-TV to provide content for 800 California restaurants . The fast food chain once seemed to want to get its customers in and out as quickly as possible - but now it's inviting them to stay and relax. Harsh red and yellow tones are being replaced by muted colours. Sticky fibreglass tables are being replaced by wooden ones and harsh fluorescent lighting is going. Students are encouraged to study using wi-fi facilites and families can enjoy sitting in open booths. The clown-style red roof on some restaurants is being ditched for a subtle orange version and the iconic golden arches have been transformed into a 'semi-swoosh'. Audio will be broadcast from the screen or ceiling speakers - but customers not wanting to listen or watch can sit in ‘quiet zones’ instead. Programmes will be shown on a one-hour cycle and eight minutes of the hour will be for adverts - of which 90 seconds will be used by McDonald’s. Mr Burnett, who also produced ‘Survivor’, is also involved with the channel, which is being launched over the next few months. ‘We believe there are so many screens in America that people are able to watch on and aggregate,’ he told the Los Angeles Times. ‘And it's more than sitting at home watching TV. McDonald's: The in-store channel will be launched across restaurants in California by Los Angeles entertainment and technology firm ChannelPort . 'Our company can do digital content on a national scale but with a local focus.’ McDonald’s is hoping to reach up to 20 million people every month – and there are plans to expand it nationwide if all goes to plan. ChannelPort founder Leland Edmondson said they want to ‘catch and engage the customer’ and make viewers ‘active and participatory’. Businesses from petrol stations and grocery stores to Starbucks are beaming more entertainment directly to customers, trying to address a captive audience in a world crawling with options. ‘People today are using our restaurants differently than they have in the past,’ a McDonald's spokesman told the Los Angeles Times.","Chain to launch TV station in 800 California restaurants .

Hundreds of bailiffs plan to start bulldozing Dale Farm tomorrow, after the travellers finally lost their court battle to stay on the illegal site. A Court of Appeal judge yesterday put an end to their farcical attempts to stop their eviction, following years of protracted legal wrangling. Bailiffs and police officers will begin moving into key positions next to Europe's largest illegal traveller site today. End of the road? A Court of Appeal ruling this afternoon denied Dale Farm residents permission to appeal against a previous ruling that the council could evict them . A source close to the £22million operation said officials will attempt to gauge the strength  of the opposition on Tuesday before forcing their way through the barricades on Wednesday. Last night menacing anarchists living on the site in Crays Hill, Essex, went into 'lockdown' to stop bailiffs entering. The huge metal gates at the front of the site were locked and every other entry point was heavily fortified with high  metal fencing, barbed wire, gas cylinders, car tyres and old washing machines. Dozens of activists returned to the site yesterday in the hope of taking part in the 'Battle of Basildon'. One shouted: 'This time it’s war - bring it on.' Protesters send out emails and text messages to sympathetic friends in an attempt to increase their numbers. A month ago Basildon Council, which is responsible for clearing the greenbelt site, sent hundreds of bailiffs to Dale Farm to start the eviction. Lockdown: An activist today carries a gas cylinder as he climbs a ramp on the main gate barricade at Dale Farm site . On watch: Security guards pictured today observing from the council compound next to the Dale Farm camp . But they were forced to turn back from the illegal camp after the travellers’ lodged an 11th hour legal bid to stay. Should the Dale Farm travellers be forcibly removed? This time Basildon Council will not tell the travellers exactly when they plan to evict them in an attempt to stop any last minute delays. Tony Ball, leader of the council said: ‘We will not be giving further notice of when a site clearance will now begin. ‘We are required to give 48-hours-notice to three plots and that we will do but the rest of the site will now be cleared at a time of our choosing. ‘The recent court proceedings were merely a temporary suspension. Our job is now to clear this site in a safe and dignified manner and this is what we intend to do.’ At the Court of appeal yesterday Lord . Justice Sullivan said there was no evidence likely to persuade appeal . judges that the council's decision to enforce eviction notices was . unlawful. He said there . would be a ‘loss of public confidence’ if the breaches of planning law . and breaches of criminal law were allowed to continue. The picnic's over: Dale Farm residents, and sisters, Margaret, Maria, Nora and Kathleen McCarthy sit and drink tea outside the High Court on Friday . Day in court: Tony Ball, leader of Basildon Council which is attempting to evict the travellers, arrives at the High Court on Friday . Applications for three judicial reviews, which sought to argue that the eviction was in breach of the travellers’ human rights, were turned down. Travellers moved onto the greenbelt site a decade ago after the buying land and set up homes without planning permission. The eviction is expected to cost up to £22million and involve around 400 residents being removed from the site, including about 100 children. Len Gridley, 52, who has spent a decade fighting for the travellers to be evicted from land at the bottom of his garden, said he was cautiously optimistic that the clearance would start soon. Or will you? The travellers now face removal by bailiffs if they refuse to leave the land . Nowhere left to go: Dale Farm resident Kathleen McCarthy, pictured leaving the Court of Appeal today, said they had now been left with no choice . ‘I think they might actually have reached a point where it could happen but until I have waved goodbye to that last caravan I will never be sure,’ he said. ‘We have been at this point already before and then the travellers have another trick up their sleeve so we shall see.’ Candy Sheridan, vice-chair of the Gypsy Council and an adviser to the Dale Farm travellers, said: ‘It seems like the end of the road.’ Dale Farm resident Kathleen McCarthy . added: 'The lawyers say this is the end. We'll have to fight the . bailiffs off. We're already in lockdown.' 'We've been left with no choice - we really have nowhere else to go. Do you think we'd put ourselves through this if we did? 'The . law is prejudiced against travellers. We were told 15 years ago to get . off the road and buy our own land, but now they are forcing us and our . kids out on to the road again. 'The barricades are all that stand between . us and homelessness now.'","Eviction at Dale Farm will begin on Wednesday .

He has previously admitted working for special branch between 1980 and 2006, but has never revealed his past as a police spy. Ironically, Mr Lambert's secret undercover work was revealed on Saturday at a Unite Against Fascism conference, at which he was a speaker. Fellow activists at the event claimed he used the alias Bob Robinson while a member of London Greenpeace between 1984 and 1988. The group campaigned for environmental issues including nuclear disarmament and claims 'Robinson' attended numerous protests and meetings. It is also believed that Mr Lambert infiltrated animal rights groups. But he was actually a member of the Special Demonstration Squad, a police unit dedicated to infiltrating political groups thought to pose a threat to public order. When urged to apologise at the conference for his undercover work, Mr Lambert refused to comment, the activists claim. Undercover: Mr Lambert (wearing a red jacket) attends a protest during the period he infiltrated London Greenpeace . He last week urged people to attend to 'show a united front against hatred and bigotry and celebrate the diversity of our multicultural communities'. In the late 1990s, Mr Lambert became head of the Special Demonstration Squad and was responsible for placing police moles in political organisations. From 2002 to 2007, he was in charge of Scotland Yard's Muslim Contact Unit, tasked with preventing Islamic extremism by way of two-way dialogue with the Muslim community. Since 2006, he has lectured at Exeter and St Andrew's universities.Mr Lambert is the seventh police officer to be unmasked as a spy inside protest organisations. Alternate life: Mark Kennedy spent seven years undercover as an eco-activist before allegedly going 'native' and naming another campaigner as an officer . The most high-profile of these was Mark Kennedy, who spent seven years undercover as an eco-activist before allegedly going 'native' and naming another campaigner as an officer when he was rumbled. A spokesman for London Greenpeace today said: 'By publicly exposing this latest scandal, campaigners have demonstrated that the recent police spies outed were not ""rogue officers"", but part of an unacceptable pattern of immoral infiltration of environmental groups, condoned at a high level. 'We demand action to ensure that the full truth is revealed and that justice is done.' A report into Kennedy and the work of undercover police officers in protest groups is scheduled to be published on Thursday. Racked with guilt at betraying his new friends after seven years of pretence, Kennedy apparently confessed that a female officer in her 30s was also a spy. She lived in Leeds and played a major part in organising a protest intended to close down the Drax coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire. The group had already grown suspicious after she disappeared overnight in 2008 claiming she had fallen in love with a man in Coventry. She was never seen again. Senior police chiefs were in January said to be worried Kennedy, who went under the name Mark Stone in his alternate life, had also compromised the safety of other officers working covertly. Telling friends who were protesters that the officer was working undercover is a serious breach of protocol which could mean other operatives have to be moved for their safety.","Bob Lambert worked for Special Branch for 26 years .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 7:00 PM on 17th October 2011 . A pilot averted disaster after discovering in mid-air that his flight instruments had been sabotaged with glue. Doug Blair had already taken off in . his light aircraft, accompanied by his five-year-old son Daniel, when he realised that the . airspeed indicator was not working. North Wales Police confirmed today that they are investigating what the 56-year-old said was 'malicious interference' and have issued a warning to other pilots after the incident at Mona airstrip in Anglesey, North Wales. Sabotage: Doug Blair was in mid-air when he realised that his Red ARV Super2 - similar to the aircraft pictured - had been tampered with . Without an airspeed indicator the pilot . has no way of knowing how fast he is going and faces the possibility that the plane will stall and crash. Keeping a cool head, the . father-of-two managed to land . the ARV Super2 plane. It was then that he discovered glue had been used to tamper . with the aircraft's instruments. Mr . Blair, a Scotsman who lives in Conwy, told how he was forced to . speed up his plane and land as his wife and other son James, 4, watched from below. He said: 'This . was potentially very serious, not having the airspeed indicator working . leaves the danger of stalling. 'A similar problem was blamed for an Air France crash in 2009. 'I noticed the problem soon after take-off. I was only a few feet off the floor when I realised but I didn't just want to land on the same runway. I wanted time to think about how I landed. Crime scene: The Mona airstrip at Anglesey Airport, where the suspected sabotage took place. A police investigation has been launched and pilots have been warned to be vigilant . 'The . key thing is to remain calm in these situation, which was hard because . my son was next to me and my wife and other son on the ground, listening . to the radio messages. 'Thankfully . because of the long length of the runway at Mona I could raise the . speed to ensure there was no danger of stalling and still bring the . plane to a stop on the runway.' Fortunately, some weeks prior to the incident, Mr Blair had read a magazine article in which a fellow pilot described how he dealt with a similar situation. Once he landed, Mr Blair examined the pitot tube and found it had been blocked by glue or another resin. The pitot tube is a pressure measurement gauge, not too dissimilar to a straw, has a cap on it. For the tube to become blocked it is most likely the cap was removed and the resin was pushed into the quarter-inch diameter tube. Mr Blair said that in hotter climates than Anglesey he had heard stories of larger insects laying eggs in the pitot tuibe, but that explanation was very unlikely in this situation. Following the incident on September 4 North Wales Police launched a sabotage probe and forensic officers are understood to be examining parts of the plane. Inspector Gareth Evans told MailOnline today: 'I can confirm that North Wales Police are investigating the incident. 'Forensic tests are being carried out and we are speaking to members of the flying club. 'Our inquiries continue and in the meantime we have urged the club members to be vigilant.' After the discovery, pilots in the area were warned to be vigilant. The message read: 'I write to inform you all of an extremely serious occurrence in the hangar at Mona. 'A few days ago Doug Blair discovered that his ASI was non functional. 'His fault investigation yielded the possibility of malicious interference as the pitot tube appears to have been blocked with glue. 'The matter is now the subject of a police investigation. 'Clearly we all need to be extremely vigilant particularly before flying.'","North Wales police launch investigation .

A girl of 17 who had her identify stolen at the age of three was left in financial hell after fraudsters racked up $700,000 of debt in her name. Criminals used the social security number of Caitlin Hemmerle to go on a spending spree that included three mortgages and a string of cars. They also took out more than 42 credit cards or other accounts in the name of the Scottsdale, Arizona, girl - without her even realising. Scroll down for video . Upset: Criminals used the social security number of Caitlin Hemmerle to go on a spending spree that included three mortgages and a string of cars . Over the years the debt totalled $600,000 in mortgages and $100,000 in car loans and credit cards. Miss Hemmerle only became aware of their activities when her parents asked a private company to run a credit report on her - even though she is just 17. They filed a police report and were able to close down all but one of the accounts, although her credit score has still not recovered. The case is the latest instance of ID thieves targeting children and babies for identity theft, leaving them with what one parent has called a ‘financial birth defect’. Using simple software they can predict their social security numbers numbers, in some cases before the children are even born. Fraudsters consider these to be a ‘blank cheque’ as nobody ever suspects until it is too late. Children as young as two have been left ‘bankrupt’ whilst those just a few years older receive a shocking surprise when they go to apply for their first credit card. Being left with low credit scores means they are unable to get a loan, a mortgage or in some cases even a bank account. Spotting problems: Jamie May, chief investigator with AllClear ID, left, advises parents to 'check for misuse of their child's information early' An investigation by NBC’s Today show took up Miss Hemmerle’s case and tracked down one of the men who allegedly defrauded her to Arizona. When one was confronted him with the . allegation he had fraudulently taken out $500,000 in loans he initially . claimed he did not understand but then said: ‘Why I see no cops?’ 'It burns me up. He (the thief) can walk around living on my child’s social and nothing’s being done about it' Caitlin Hemmerle's father . A . second suspected thief denied taking out more than $35,000 in debts. Asked if he had anything to say to his alleged victim he said: ‘I don’t . know’. Fighting back the tears Miss Hemmerle told NBC how it had affected her and said: ‘It’s not fair’. Her father added: ‘It burns me up. He (the thief) can walk around living on my child’s social and nothing’s being done about it’. ID theft is on the rise in America - In 2009 11.1million people were victims, up from 8.4 million in 2004. One in ten Americans are thought to have had their identities stolen with each losing an average of $5,000. The total cost to the US is estimated at $54billion, but worldwide it adds up to a staggering $221billion each year. National spread: This map shows pink dots representing where AllClear ID have positively identified the location of a suspect . Getting your life back can also be a long and complicated process. According to consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research each ID theft victim spent an average of 59 hours last year recovering from the incident, up from 41 hours in 2009. 'Children's Social Security numbers are uniquely valuable because they're essentially a clean slate for an identity thief' Jamie May, chief investigator with AllClear ID . Victims often have to spend lengthy periods on the phone to their bank or go to branches to present documents - only to find it is happening all over again. Miss Hemmerle only discovered that she was the victim of ID Fraud when her parents asked for a scan by identity protection company AllClear ID. The firm then advised her how to get the money back and stop it happening again. ‘Children's Social Security numbers are uniquely valuable because they're essentially a clean slate for an identity thief,’ said Jamie May, chief investigator with AllClear ID. ‘A thief can pair a child's Social Security number with any name, date of birth or address and create a new identity. ‘The best advice to parents is to check for misuse of their child's information early, before they run into problems like Caitlin's’.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 9:50 AM on 19th October 2011 . David and Teresa Yeates outside Bristol Crown Court yesterday, for the trial of Vincent Tabak . Joanna Yeates's mother wept in court yesterday as photographs were shown of her daughter's dead body. Until that point, Teresa Yeates and her husband David had chosen not to be present during those parts of the murder trial when images of the 25-year-old's corpse were displayed to the jury. Mrs Yeates, 58, broke down as a mortuary image of the landscape architect was shown on court screens before she and her husband both averted their eyes. The picture showed Miss Yeates lying in the foetal position with her pink top pushed up, exposing her bra. Comforting his wife and holding both her hands tightly, Mr Yeates, 63, then turned his head and glared for several seconds towards the dock, where his daughter's killer, Vincent Tabak, sat facing the floor with his hands clasped over his head. The jury was told that 33-year-old Tabak could have placed Miss Yeates's body inside a cover sheet he used to protect his bicycle before she was bundled into the boot of his car. Lawyers for the defence suggested that traces of his DNA found on his victim’s  breasts and jeans could have come from this ‘bicycle bag’. The same post-mortem examination images seen by Mr and Mrs Yeates had caused Tabak, who admits manslaughter but denies murder, to cry when they were first shown to the jury last week. The pictures were displayed during evidence from a forensic scientist who had examined blood stains found on a wall next to the country road where Miss Yeates’s snow-covered body was found on Christmas morning last year. Witness: Chaplain Peter Brotherton, left, leaves court after giving evidence for the trial of Vincent Tabak, right . The expert said the blood pattern indicated smearing rather than spattering, meaning it was unlikely that Miss Yeates had been assaulted at the spot on Longwood Lane in Failand, near Bristol. Tanya Nickson told the jury: ‘The presence of the blood on the top of the wall may indicate an attempt was made to deposit the body over the top of the wall.’ The court also heard that when Tabak was arrested a month after his next-door neighbour Miss Yeates was announced missing, he appeared ‘shaky’ after the police’s early-morning arrival at the friend’s flat where he and his girlfriend were temporarily staying a couple of miles away. In the police station later on, the jury heard, two small wounds were seen on his left arm. Tabak, who had been under 24-hour supervision at HMP Long Lartin, was said to have told Mr Brotherton of his plan to plead guilty three weeks after his arrest . An artist's impression of Greg Reardon giving evidence yesterday in the ongoing trial of Vincent Tabak pictured with his head in his hands . The 6ft 4in Dutchman told a custody nurse he had been taking sleeping pills and drinking more in the weeks after Miss Yeates died ‘to help him relax’. He was later interviewed several times by detectives, who questioned him about his activities on the night Miss Yeates was killed. The court heard that Tabak refused to comment when police asked him a series of questions, including whether Miss Yeates had invited him into her flat in the Clifton area of Bristol, if he made sexual advances to her and if he had been inside her bedroom. The jury was also told that the Dutch engineer claimed to police he had gone to take pictures of Clifton in the snow on December 17, before returning home and visiting a nearby Asda because ‘he liked to be in large supermarkets at night’. Testimony: Miss Yeates' bereaved boyfriend Greg Reardon walks into court yesterday . The defendant said he had brought his car into the drive during the evening to defrost it and get it ready to collect his girlfriend from her work Christmas party. He also said he had slipped over on the pathway to his flat – but did not mention having any contact with Miss Yeates. Tabak is said to have ‘squeezed the life’ out of his neighbour in a ‘desperate’ struggle at her flat just minutes after she arrived home alone, while her boyfriend Greg Reardon was away. CCTV: Joanna Yeates, seen here in newly released footage, visited Waitrose at 8.10pm on the night of her death . Final sighting: CCTV of Miss Yeates in a . Bristol branch of Tesco after leaving colleagues in a nearby pub to walk . home on December 17 last year . He is alleged to have driven with the body in the boot of his car to Asda, where he bought beer, rock salt and crisps. Miss Yeates sustained 43 separate injuries before being dumped in the snow. A couple walking their dog found her body, partially clothed, 100 yards down the lane, on Christmas Day morning. The trial at Bristol Crown Court continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:35 AM on 18th October 2011 . A university lecturer showed the strain today after he admitted drug possession following the death of a schoolgirl during a party at his house. Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, died after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party at Brian Dodgeon's west London home in April. And leaving court today after admitting having a cocktail of drugs in his home, Dodgeon -  who seriously injured himself . in a failed suicide attempt following the girl's death - showed signs of the ordeal having taken a considerable toll on him. The 61-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of possession, including the party drugs ecstasy, LSD and ketamine, when he appeared at West London Magistrates' Court. The 61-year-old pleaded guilty to owning a number of drugs, which were valued between £735 and £2,435 . Showing the strain: The 61-year-old, pictured leaving London Magistrates' Court today (left) with a crutch after injuring himself by jumping off a flyover out of remorse, was looking much older than he did at the time of the incident in April . The University of London research fellow also admitted keeping psychedelic drug 5-MeO-DIPT - better known as Foxy Methoxy. Around 30 teenagers attended the party, at Dodgeon's home in North Kensington on April 22 this year and were drinking cider, wine and spirits and smoking marijuana, magistrates were told. Dodgeon and his partner Angela Hadjipateras were away at a party in Hastings at the time. Prosecutor Nisha Dutt said that Dodgeon's daughter Beatrice Hadjipateras, 14, told party-goers that she had previously found a stash of cannabis in her father's drawer. Three of the teenagers went to an 'out-of-bounds' bedroom in a bid to find more drugs. They found a canister containing a selection of drugs including capsules, plastic containers and bags. Ms Dutt said: 'Isobel took two tablets. Mr Dodgeon's daughter and two other youths took one each. 'By 3am Isobel had shown signs of deterioration. She had started hallucinating and became very hot and red-faced. Isobel Clara Reilly, 15, died in April after taking MDMA at a party at Dodgeon's West London house. The 61-year-old was not in attendance . 'Her friends wanted to call ambulance but she insisted that they did not because they would get into trouble. 'After about an hour she lay on the bed frothing at the mouth, went pale and was motionless. 'She stopped breathing and friends could not find a pulse.' Her friends called for an ambulance and attempted to perform mouth-to-mouth and CPR. Isobel was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington but was pronounced dead at 6.30am. Dodgeon's 14-year-old daughter and two 14-year-old boys were also detained in hospital after the party. Dodgeon, a former social worker, was arrested at the hospital and questioned by police. He told officers that he was a recreational drug user and described himself as an 'old hippie', the court was told. He said he had accumulated the drugs over a number of years. In 'the most dramatic exhibition of remorse' Dodgeon leapt from a bridge in a suicide attempt a week after the incident, said Rhona Friedman, mitigating. He required brain surgery, broke . numerous bones - including a femur, an elbow and a a heel - and . fractured his skull after he jumped off a flyover on the North Circular . Road in Walthamstow, east London. Friends of Miss Reilly are pictured holding a vigil at a park in Chiswick, West London . In court, he used a crutch to make his way to the dock and was wearing a navy suit and a white shirt. Magistrates . heard that he did not supply the drugs to anyone and they were stored . in his bedroom, which was off-limits to party guests - who were invited . to the event through Facebook. Dodgeon, . whose research subjects have included health inequalities and alcohol . consumption patterns, told police that it had 'never crossed his mind' that someone would find the drugs, which were valued at between £735 and . £2,435. But Dodgeon and his partner of 25 years knew that the party was going ahead and had warned neighbours in advance, the court was told. Ms Friedman said that Dodgeon, who had previously worked for the National Council for Single Parent Families and as a social policy officer for the Citizens Advice Bureau, was full of 'remorse and regret' and has been abstinent since the incident. The court was also told that Isobel, a pupil at Chiswick Community School, was going through a 'challenging' period at the time of her death. 'At the time, it was said her behaviour was being increasingly challenging,' Ms Dutt said. 'Her attendance had been poor, she had been known to smoke, drink and use cannabis.' She added that the school had referred Isobel to drug and education services. An inquest into the death of the teenager, who lived in South Acton, was opened and adjourned in May. Ms Dutt told the court that the cause of her death was listed as MDMA - more commonly known as ecstasy - ingestion. Dodgeon will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on November 18.","'Old hippie' Brian Dodgeon, 61, admitted keeping ecstasy, LSD and ketamine at home .

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 6:58 PM on 13th October 2011 . It is a cruel irony for the millions of holidaymakers who slam Ryanair for charging them for hidden ‘extras’ while flying. Because soon, the budget airline’s passengers will feel grateful for the chance just to spend a penny. For it plans to rip out even more toilets from its planes – whittling them down to just one loo per aircraft. No stranger to controversy: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary argues that the move would ultimately benefit passengers, as it 'would fundamentally lower air fares by about five per cent.' The move, which takes ‘no frills . travel’ to a whole new level, could see 200 passengers vying to share . one facility – forcing them either to wait in very long queues or cross . their legs and pray. Michael O'Leary's plan is the latest scheme from the budget airline. Some have been implemented, while others have not. They include... Charging passengers £1 to use the toilet on flights . Ryanair chief executive Michael . O’Leary said he wants to replace the toilets with extra passenger seats . in order to offer cheaper air fares. He is pressing Boeing to . ‘re-certify’ Ryanair’s aircraft to enable six extra seats to be . installed, particularly for short-haul flights. The airline flies only one type of . aircraft type, the Boeing 737-800. It has 189 seats on each plane, the . maximum allowed under current rules. Fitting six extra seats would mean . ripping out two of the three loos – leaving 200 passengers to share just . one. But Mr O’Leary insists: ‘We very rarely use all three toilets on . board our aircraft anyway.’ The move ‘would fundamentally lower . air fares by about 5 per cent for all passengers – cutting £2 from a . typical £40 ticket’, he added. There is no legal stipulation for an . airline to provide toilets on its aircraft. Boeing declined to be drawn . on the plans, saying: ‘We don’t discuss those conversations.’ The budget airline has announced plans to remove two of the three lavatories from its planes - a move that it believes will allow space for up to six extra seats . Ryanair will carry 75million . passengers this year. Its longest UK route is from Rhodes to Liverpool, . taking four hours and 25 minutes. Initially, though, the higher-capacity . aircraft would be deployed on shorter routes. A spokesman for the Association of . British Travel Agents said: ‘We all know how inconvenient it can be if a . toilet on a plane is out of order. This move could be a step too far.’ But aviation consultant John . Strickland said: ‘High fuel prices are making it difficult for even . Ryanair to keep fares low, so anything which helps reduce costs is . essential.’ Last summer Ryanair said it planned to . introduce flights where passengers stand up rather than sit, from £4 . per ticket. The plan would remove the back ten rows of seats from its . 250 planes and replace them with 15 rows of vertical seats. The Office of Fair Trading is investigating a ‘super-complaint’ by the Consumers’ Association into charges by low-cost airlines. Ryanair – which charges up to £20 per . piece of checked luggage per flight – faced outcry in 2009 for plans to . charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet. The plans to . ‘charge a pound to spend a penny’ have now been dropped, Mr O’Leary . said.","Airline's plan would make space for six extra seats .

An Islamist militant bomb blast in Somalia has killed over 70 people outside the Ministry of Education in the country's capital. An explosion ripped through a security checkpoint in Mogadishu today, killing more than 70 and leaving dozens more injured. Scores of blackened corpses were left on the debris-strewn street, while uniformed officers were seen dragging the wounded away. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Blast: Somalis carry the body of a man killed in the explosion by a security checkpoint in Mogadishu . Wounded: A man covers his blood-soaked head with a cloth near the scene of the blast in Mogadishu . The bomb blast was the biggest attack in Somalia's capital since Al-Qaeda withdrew forces from the area in August. Ali Abdullahi, a nurse at Medina hospital said they were treating people with horrific wounds, including amputated limbs, burns, and patients who have lost their sight in the attack. He said: 'It is the most awful tragedy I have ever seen. 'Imagine dozens are being brought here minute by minute. Most of the wounded people are unconscious and others have their faces blackened by smoke and heat.' Ali Muse, the chief of Mogadishu's ambulance service, said that at least 70 people had died and at least 42 others were wounded. Fatal: A Somali woman pours water on a smouldering body at the scene of the bomb blast . Scene: The deadly attack was the first of its kind since Al-Qaeda withdrew its forces from the Somali capital in August . 'The explosion has not only affected . the targeted place, but even passer-by people and car passengers died . there. The death toll may increase and we are still carrying many dead . bodies' he said.Al-Shabab immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on a website it uses. 'Our . Mujahideen fighters have entered a place where ministers and AMISOM . foreigners stay,' al-Shabab said in a brief post on a website, referring . to the Ugandan and Burundian forces who make up the African Union . peacekeeping mission. But it was not clear whether the ministry building . was their intended target. The Somali government said that no senior government official was wounded in the bombing. People watch the smoke rising from the scene of a car bomb explosion in Somalia's capital Mogadishu . 'The casualties are mostly students and parents who were waiting for results of scholarships from the Ministry of Higher Education,' the government said in a press release. 'The attack shows that the danger from terrorists is not yet over and that there are obviously still people, who want to derail the advances that the Somali people have made towards peace.' Ali Hussein, a police officer in Mogadishu, said the vehicle blew up after pulling up to a checkpoint at the entrance to the Ministry of Education. Suicide bombings were unheard of in Somalia before 2007 but have become increasingly frequent. Al-Shabab claims allegiance to al-Qaida, which often uses car bombs and appears bent on gaining a foothold in the Horn of Africa. The vehicle had exploded after passing a security checkpoint in Mogadishu, Somalia . Al-Shabab includes militant veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts who have trained Somalis in tactics like suicide bombs and sniper fire, and until recently hosted the most wanted al-Qaida operative in Africa. The fugitive Fazul Abdallah Mohammed, al-Qaida's top operative in East Africa was killed by a Somali government Soldier at road block in June. Mohammed was mastermind behind the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Al-Shabab carried out a double suicide bombing in Uganda in July 2010 that killed 76 people watching the World Cup final on television. Americans of Somali heritage also have joined the group. In 2009, a suicide bomber attacked a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, killing 24 people, including three government ministers, medical students and doctors. Somalia has endured mostly anarchy for the last two decades. The nation is gripped by famine, which is mostly affecting southern parts of the country controlled by al-Shabab.","42 more injured by blast at security checkpoint .

The building was looted and torched in May by angry mobs amid Nato air strikes on the Libyan capital. Mr Hague announced more details of the package of support the UK is providing to the interim government, including providing medical and security expertise. Important role: Mr Hague shakes hands with Mr Abdul Jalil after praising the 'great progress' the NTC has made in stabilising Libya and improving the war-torn country's relations in the international community . He added: 'The Libyan people’s decisive break with the past means we are now able to open a new era in UK-Libya relations, building on our military, political, diplomatic and humanitarian support to the Libyan people during their revolution. 'I am therefore pleased to make the following announcements: . 'First, the UK will make available places for Libyans injured in the conflict to receive treatment in the UK. 'Up to 50 more patients who have suffered traumatic amputations will be offered rehabilitation and prosthetics care. 'Libyan health experts will be invited to observe the care so that they can support these patients on their return to Libya and others with similar injuries.' Secondly, he said, the UK was also increasing its contribution to security and stability in Libya. Welcomed: Mr Hague meets Libyan employees after re-opening the British embassy in a 'watershed' moment for UK-Libya relations . 'We are making available further support for emergency de-mining activities by the UN Mine Actions Service,' he added. 'This will help to protect thousands of people so that they can return to their homes including around Sirte and Bani Walid. 'And along with the US we are destroying hundreds of Man Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS) to improve security throughout Libya.' Thirdly, Mr Hague said UK experts on policing civil society and public financial management are now working in Libya at the NTC’s request. He added: 'Fourth, the final . requested shipment of Libyan banknotes frozen in the UK will be . delivered to Libya, helping the economy to get back on track and provide . for the Libyan people. 'To . date, the UK has allocated £20.6million to support Libya’s stabilisation . and up to a further £20million to support political and economic . reform. 'Our embassy will . have an important role to play as we build our relations with the new . Libya, as will the diplomatic office we are maintaining in Benghazi, and . I have every confidence that our diplomats here will do so with . distinction.'

Gaining steady support, the number is up from 46 per cent last year and has climbed from 12 per cent since 1969, when the research firm first asked about legalising marijuana. The findings come months after the Obama administration toughened its stand on medical marijuana in the 16 states where pot is legal for people with doctors' recommendations. Marijuana: Support for legalisation of the drug is up from 46 per cent last year and has climbed from 12 per cent since 1969, according to new data . The data is based on telephone . interviews conducted October 6-9 with a random sample of 1,005 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older. Results show more young people support . legalising the drug than their elders, with those 18 to 29 showing a 62 . per cent approval rating, compared to only 31 per cent for those 65 and . older. More men than women support reform, at 55 to 46 per cent, relatively. Those in the West (55 per cent) and Midwest (54 per cent) are more likely to favour it than those in the South (44 per cent). Reforming views: A graph shows a steady rise in support for the legalisation of marijuana, and steady decline in opposition over recent years, according to Gallup . Liberals are twice as likely as conservatives to favour legalizing marijuana, with relative 69 and 34 per cent approval ratings. And Democrats and independents, both . at 57 per cent, are more likely to be in favour than are Republicans, 35 . per cent of which support the legalisation of marijuana. Breakdown: According to the research firm, 62 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds are in favour, compared to 31 per cent for those 65 and older . The poll numbers come shortly after . the Obama administration toughened its stand on medical marijuana . following a two-year period during which federal officials had indicated . they would not move aggressively against dispensaries in compliance . with laws in the 16 states where pot is legal for people with doctors' recommendations. The Department of Justice issued a . policy memo to federal prosecutors in late June stating that marijuana . dispensaries and licensed growers in states with medical marijuana laws . could face prosecution for violating federal drug and money-laundering . laws. Possession, sale, distribution and . transportation of marijuana, medical or otherwise, remain completely . illegal under federal law. Under the U.S. Controlled Substances . Act (CSA), marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, . meaning that it has no accepted medical use. The advocacy group National .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 9:51 AM on 18th October 2011 . MPs were last night labelled ‘skivers’ as they announced plans to take an extra five-day holiday in November. The deal was offered after politicians complained about being recalled twice over the summer recess to discuss phone hacking and riots. In an attempt to placate them, Commons Leader Sir George Young has proposed they enjoy a five-day ‘mini-break’ next month. Question time off: MPs have voted to give themselves an extra five-day mini-break in November to compensate for the days lost during the recall of Parliament for the London Riots . Not shirking: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, said this parliament will sit more in its first two years than was the case under the last parliament . But the idea has enraged union . leaders, who have accused MPs of going ‘on the skive’ at a time when . families are working hard just to make ends meet. The row comes after David Cameron promised to cut MPs’ holidays to show he understands public concern about their conduct. While most workers in the public and . private sectors get four or  five weeks off annually, this  deal – . thrashed out in behind-the-scenes talks with all parties – will bring . the number of Parliamentary recess days this year to 87, excluding . weekends. The holiday, which begins on November . 15, would replace the break usually given around that time ahead of the . Queen’s Speech, which has been postponed by the coalition until the . spring. But the mini-break begins just six . weeks after MPs have returned from their three-week conference break – . and is followed by a three-week Christmas holiday only  a month later. Bob Crow, general secretary  of the . National Union of Rail,  Maritime and Transport Workers, said: ‘While . working people are struggling round the clock to make ends meet, the . same politicians who unleashed the austerity programme have been caught . out on the skive. Recalled: MPS were brought back to Parliament during the recess because of the London riots . It looks bad: Labour MP John Mann, left, has criticised the decision saying it risks making his colleague look like 'part-timers' while union boss Bob Crow, right, said it shows MPs are 'on the skive' Change of plan: The mini-break replaces the holiday traditionally held around the same time, ahead of the Queen's Speech, which has been postponed by the coalition until the spring . In defence: Sir George Young says MPs often conduct constituency business while on holiday . ‘We will take no more of the “We are all in this together” rubbish from this crowd.’ A spokesman for Sir George said MPs . would be sitting for a greater number of days during this Parliament . than the last one and insisted the mini-break was shorter than those . given in the past around the Queen’s Speech. Next year’s summer holiday will also . be shorter than those in previous years, with MPs returning to . Westminster in September ahead of party conferences. The spokesman added: ‘The Government . is ensuring that the House sits more evenly throughout the year, rather . than breaking up for an 82-day summer recess as under the previous . government. ‘As usual, MPs continue to undertake . important constituency and select committee work, even when the House is . not sitting for the days in question.’ But Emma Boon, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s utterly astounding that some members want a . holiday barely six weeks after returning from their  last recess. ‘This motion makes Parliament look . incredibly out of touch at a time when many ordinary families don’t have . the time or the money to enjoy a vacation themselves.’ Meanwhile, Commons speaker John . Bercow revealed that a new security chief could be appointed to protect . Parliament following the foam pie attack on media mogul Rupert Murdoch . in July. He said a review into the incident had found that there was ‘inadequate’ security in the committee room at the time.

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 7:49 AM on 18th October 2011 . Barack Obama offered more support for global financial system protesters after a weekend of demonstrations across the world. Speaking at the dedication of a new memorial to Martin Luther King on National Mall, Washington, the U.S. President called on protesters not to 'demonise' Wall Street workers. He said: 'Dr King would want us to challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonising those who work there.' Message: U.S. President Barack Obama voiced support for global financial system protesters at the dedication of a memorial for Martin Luther King in Washington, DC . It comes after several hundred protesters were arrested in at least seven U.S. cities over the weekend supporting the growing Occupy Wall Street movement. The arrests were largely peaceful, but were made after demonstrators refused to obey police orders to leave public areas. They included 175 people detained at a park in Chicago, as well as at protests in Washington DC; New York; Fairbanks, Alaska; Bulington, Vermont; Rapid City, South Dakota, Tucson, Arizona, Phoenix and Cheyenne, Wyoming. In Rome, the protests turned violent after rioter hijacked a peaceful gathering and smashed windows, tore up pavements and torched vehicles. An estimated $1.4million of damage was caused to the Italian capital. Anti-capitalist: Thousands of protesters take part in an Occupy Wall Street demonstration in Times Square, New York . Unrest: Protesters camp out overnight in a church grounds in Toronto, Canada. Demonstrations took place in cities across the world . The Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives, Eric Cantor, originally compared the protests to 'angry mobs'. But he told Fox News yesterday that Republicans agreed there was 'too much' income disparity in the U.S. 'More important than my use of the word [mobs] is that there is a growing frustration out there across the country and it is warranted,' he said. 'Too many people are out of work.' Backlash: A little boy is carried on his father's shoulders in Times Square over the weekend. Hundreds of people were arrested in the U.S. as part of protests . Global: A protester holders up a banner outside the Philippine International Convention Centre in Manila . Among those arrested in Washington DC was civil rights activist and Princeton University professor Cornel West, who was detained on the steps of the Supreme Court protesting about corporate influence in politics. In Canada, demonstrators gathered from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Vancouver, British Columbia, with hundreds protesting in the heart of Toronto's financial district. Icon: Mr Obama said civil rights leader Martin Luther King would have supported challenging the excesses of Wall Street . Mr Obama is expected to use public anger at Wall Street excess to turn up the heat on congressional Republicans as he tries to gain support for his stalled jobs bill. He will head to North Carolina and Virginia over the next three days - both vital to his 2012 reelection chances - in visits aimed at winning passage for parts of the $447billion jobs plan. Spokesman Josh Earnest said: 'The president will continue to acknowledge the frustration that he himself shares about the need for Washington to do more to support our economic recovery and to ensure that the interest of the 99 per cent of Americans is well-represented.' Mr Obama's strategy is to force Republicans to give ground or be painted as obstructionists more interested in shielding 'millionaires and billionaires' - the '1 per cent' used by the protesters - from paying their fair share of tax.","U.S. President calls on protesters not to 'demonise' Wall Street workers .

The son of Britain’s first black Cabinet minister sexually assaulted a sleeping woman, a court heard yesterday. Benjamin Boateng is alleged to have attacked the 23-year-old when she passed out drunk on a sofa after a night of clubbing. The 27-year-old, whose father is Lord Boateng, is said to have climbed on top of the woman while she was ‘dead to the world’, yanking down her underwear. A jury was told she woke in shock to find a stranger sexually assaulting her and screamed: ‘How can you do that when I was asleep? 'I don’t know who you are.’ The court heard the alleged victim and a friend started a ‘club crawl’ of the West End of London at 1am on September 19 last year and downed four vodka cocktails. At 4am, their friend Ryan Bish invited them to drink free champagne and vodka in the VIP lounge of the Jet Black nightclub, which is owned by his father. They moved on to a party at his riverside flat in Battersea, and Boateng turned up an hour later just before the woman passed out at 8am. Yesterday she sobbed while giving evidence at Kingston Crown Court in South-West London. ‘I was starting to wake up and I thought it was my boyfriend,’ she said. ‘I kissed him back because I did not know what I was doing.

The court heard that traces of cocaine . were found on the woman’s body. She denied taking drugs, however, telling jurors Boateng’s fingers may have had cocaine on them. Heather Norton, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr .

Only a few areas of the dictator's hometown of Sirte remain loyal to him following the collapse of his regime. In Bani Walid fireworks were being set off and car horns blasted as the city was captured by the NTC.

Computer hacker Gary McKinnon is challenging a U.S. bid to extradite him on charges of hacking into highly sensitive military computers . Gary McKinnon . should not be protected from extradition – but asylum seekers must get . fresh safeguards, a ‘whitewash’ inquiry has concluded. It said a treaty between the UK and . the U.S. was not ‘lopsided’ and did not need changing to stop British . citizens being unfairly bundled on a plane to America. And it rejected calls for new rules . blocking transfer to a foreign country when the alleged offence took . place largely in Britain – as in the case of computer hacker Mr . McKinnon. But it did call for a new law to offer greater protection to those claiming asylum. The panel recommended that anybody . claiming refugee status – whether they lodge their claim before or after . the extradition process begins – be saved from being sent overseas . until the asylum case is closed. It means a foreign national claiming asylum has better protection than a British citizen. Campaigners called for David Cameron . and Nick Clegg – who personally called the 2003 Extradition Act . ‘lopsided’ – to throw the report straight in the dustbin. Politicians are not bound by the panel’s findings and are free to begin efforts to renegotiate arrangements with the U.S. Mr McKinnon’s mother, Janis Sharp, . attacked the £250,000 report, which took a year to prepare, as a . shameful ‘whitewash’. She told the Daily Mail: ‘This is a missed . opportunity for British citizens to be shown that they matter and aren’t . just being thrown to the dogs. ‘What message does it send to the . world when the British Government doesn’t even care enough about its own . people to give them the same protection as other countries give . theirs?’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, at a protest calling for a fair trial for Gary in 2009 . The independent panel, headed by Sir . Scott Baker, was set up by the Coalition to investigate whether the . treaty should be changed. Its recommendations contradict the . findings of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which called for the . Government to renegotiate the treaty to make it balanced. The U.S. requires ‘sufficient . evidence to establish probable cause’ before agreeing to extradite . anyone to the UK, but Britons going in the opposite direction are not . afforded the same protection. Waiting game: The review criticised the delay in cases such as that of Abu Hamza, a Muslim cleric who is fighting an extradition bid to the U.S. on terror charges . Instead of strengthening the powers . of the Home Secretary to stop unjust extradition cases, the panel said . she should have reduced responsibilities for determining human rights . appeals. Theresa May is reconsidering Mr McKinnon’s case on the grounds . that he has Asperger’s and could take his own life if extradited. If the . recommendations were enacted, she would lose such responsibility. Mr McKinnon hacked into U.S. military . computers from the bedroom of his north London flat. On his case, the . panel said: ‘We have no evidence that any injustice is being caused by . the present arrangements.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘As the . Joint Committee on Human Rights highlighted, the operation of the Human . Rights Act means that in practice many innocent British citizens subject . to extradition have lower human rights safeguards compared to foreign . national criminals we are trying to deport. Those double standards . corrode public confidence in the justice system.’ A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘We will set out our response in due course.’ In a second controversial decision, . the European Arrest Warrant was declared to be working ‘reasonably . well’. The EAW requires countries to send criminal suspects to the . nation requesting their arrest.

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 2:13 PM on 19th October 2011 . Theresa May yesterday pledged to release every government document relating to the Hillsborough disaster to help victims' families get to the truth about the tragedy. She spoke during an emotional Commons debate, which was called after almost 140,000 signed a petition calling for full public disclosure, 22 years after 96 Liverpool fans died in the tragedy. One Liverpool Labour MP called on David Cameron to issue an apology for the 'misinformation' and cover-ups over the disaster, just as he had done for Bloody Sunday. Promise: Theresa May has pledged to release every government document relating to the Hillsborough disaster . Pledge: Theresa May (left) said the release of the documents would help victims' families find out the truth about the tragedy . The Mail has recently highlighted the Hillsborough families' long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed. Yesterday all 96 names of the crush victims were read to the House. Relatives are particularly keen to learn about briefings South Yorkshire Police gave then prime minister Margaret Thatcher during a visit to the Sheffield Wednesday stadium the day after. The Home Secretary restated the Government's position is a 'commitment to full transparency about the Hillsborough disaster through full public disclosure'. She apologised for any anxiety caused by the decision to oppose a Freedom of Information request from a BBC reporter but it was right that the families, and not the wider public, should receive the information first as they needed to be treated with 'dignity and respect'. Moving tribute: Liverpool fans packed Anfield in April 2009 for a memorial service commemorating the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough . Campaign: Many feel that the police should take responsibility for the tragedy . 'Let me say here and now, in this House and on the record, that as Home Secretary I will do everything in my power to ensure the families and the public get the truth,' she told MPs. 'As a Government we fully support the Hillsborough Independent Panel and the process the panel is leading to disclose the documents telling the whole story. No government papers will be withheld from the panel, no attempts to suppress publication will be made, no stone left unturned.' But she said there may be some redactions, including the names of some junior civil servants and the details of the victims’ confidential medical files. People began collapsing or were being brought out onto the grass. Hoardings were used as stretchers . Sombre: Then Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish (left) with players and families at the Hillsborough memorial service at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral in 1989 . Labour's Steve Rotheram, a former lord mayor of Liverpool, used the debate to attack the 'smears' and 'establishment cover-up' which led to fans initially being blamed for the 1989 disaster. He added: 'I call on the Prime Minister to make a statement in this House and apologise for the mistakes that were made and the mishandling of this whole tragedy on behalf of a previous government. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, we will never stop fighting for justice for the 96.' The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said all of the papers on the tragedy have already been handed over to the Hillsborough Independent Panel. History: How the Mail has covered the search for justice from the victims' families . The panel, chaired by Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, was set up to look at the options for creating an archive of Hillsborough material and ensuring the maximum possible public disclosure of the information. The Prime Minister's spokesman said it was a matter for the panel to decide when to pass on the official documents to the Hillsborough families or to publish them more widely. Trevor Hicks, the president of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, said they wanted to ensure there was full disclosure of the government documents and there would be 'no possibility that the shutters will come down'. He said the Sunday morning meeting between Mrs Thatcher and South Yorkshire Police was crucial as it appeared to mark the start of the 'scurrilous' reports that fans were partially responsible.

"By . James Slack and Michael Seamark . Last updated at 10:52 AM on 18th October 2011 . Case drags on: Race hate cleric Abu Hamza is fighting an extradition bid to the U.S . European human rights judges are costing the British taxpayer millions of pounds by stalling the extradition of six of the world’s most wanted Islamist terror suspects. The independent panel that has been reviewing extradition laws will today accuse the European Court of Human Rights of being inefficient and slow. The six terror suspects – who include hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza – have been languishing in British jails for a combined total of almost 50 years. The cost to the taxpayer of their incarceration alone is an estimated £2.5million. They are accused of running terror training camps, plotting atrocities and running extremist websites. But the controversial European court has halted their extradition to the U.S. in case their human rights are breached by lengthy jail sentences. The court has allowed their cases to drag on for years. Campaigners point to the stark difference between the way the court has dealt with terror suspects and its treatment of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon. Gary, who searched NASA computers from his North London home looking for evidence of ‘little green men’, is facing extradition to the U.S. on computer hacking charges. Still fighting: Gary McKinnon, left, is facing extradition to the U.S on computer hacking charges. His mother Janis Sharp, right, is leading the attack against the Extradition Act . Nick Clegg has broken a lot of promises, but it is the Liberal Democrat leader’s failure to honour his pledge to fight for Gary McKinnon that many people find most appalling. In opposition he claimed to be one of Gary's biggest supporters but fast forward to 2010 when he was lording it over the country as Deputy Prime Minister and he said the case has nothing to do with him. Shamefully, he even refused to meet with Gary’s mum, Janis Sharp, to discuss the case, writes JAMES SLACK. Read more here . But the European judges dismissed his appeal against extradition in little more than a day. Gary’s extradition, under the Extradition Act, is the subject of the Daily Mail’s ‘An Affront to British Justice’ campaign. It was temporarily halted by Home Secretary Theresa May last year. She wants to examine advice on whether the 45-year-old is fit to be sent abroad. Today the review panel, established by the Home Office and led by Lord Justice Scott Baker, will urge ministers to put pressure on the Strasbourg court to reform the way it works. In particular, it wants cases to be dealt with much more quickly. The Government, which has been embroiled in a long row with the court over votes for prisoners, will jump at the chance to issue a rebuke to the judges over terror. The Mail has learnt that the six cases involve terror suspects that the U.S. is desperate to put on trial. They . include hate-preacher Abu Hamza and his trusted lieutenant Haroon Aswat . – who are wanted by the U.S. authorities for allegedly plotting to set . up a jihad training camp in Oregon. Hamza’s case alone has already cost the public purse £1.1million in legal aid. He was jailed for seven years in February 2006 for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque in North London. He . would be eligible for release but remains in jail while his extradition . case continues. If Strasbourg rules definitively that he cannot be . extradited, officials would have little option but to release him on to . Britain’s streets. Two . other men, Baba Ahmad and Seyla Ahsan, are accused of conspiracy to . commit terrorist atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups. They have been held in British jails – at a cost of £50,000 each per year – for between five and seven years while they fight extradition on human rights grounds. Another man, Khalid al-Fawwaz, who is considered one of the U.S.’s most wanted terror suspects, has been in jail here since 1999. Allegedly an associate of Osama Bin Laden, he was arrested over bomb attacks on two U.S. embassies in East Africa which killed more than 200 in 1998. The sixth man, Adel Abdul Bary, is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings and has been held in prison for 13 years. All have exhausted their rights of appeal in UK courts and are being held in high-security detention. The European court has stalled extradition on the grounds that the lengthy jail terms they face if convicted may breach their human rights. Last night Gary’s mother, Janis Sharp, told the Mail: ‘We appealed to the European court one night and the next day they refused to consider it. It was literally rejected overnight. ‘This treaty [the Extradition Act] was meant for terrorists but it is not being applied to terrorists and it’s not terrorists being extradited. All this treaty is doing is uprooting vulnerable people, like Gary. It’s appalling.’","Independent panel will accuse European court of being inefficient and slow .

"By . Jack Doyle . Last updated at 8:23 AM on 18th October 2011 . More than five children a day are detained at Britain's ports and airports after trying to enter the country, official figures revealed last night. Nearly 700 were held for up to 24 hours over a four-month period this year. Worryingly, one in three was not even accompanied by an adult. The figures were uncovered by the Children's Society, which said the numbers were excessive. Stowaway: Immigration officials greet a teenage boy found in the back of a lorry at Dover port . But officials said it was sometimes necessary to hold some youngsters while their immigration status is determined and others are being sent home. Bob Reitemeier, chief executive of the Children's Society, called for the Home Office to investigate why so many children are held. 'We are horrified at the excessive numbers of children being held in the South East and very disappointed that the Government has not kept these numbers to a minimum,' he said. 'It is of great concern that this appears to be happening without sufficient monitoring centrally by the Home Office, including why they are being held, their age and – critically – the length of time that they were held.' The figures from the UK Border Agency, obtained using the Freedom of Information Act, showed that 697 under-18s were held between May and August. They cover short-term facilities at the port of Dover and at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. The children can be held for up to 24 hours after arriving in the UK. Often they remain in the facility until they can be put on the next flight home. Almost 700 children were held at UK airports and the Port of Dover in four months this summer . Children arriving at London’s two main airports can be moved to ‘family friendly’ facilities at Tinsley House, an immigration detention centre near Gatwick. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We have always been clear that we would retain the ability to hold families who have arrived at the border without the right to enter. Bob Reitemeier of The Children's Society is 'horrified at the excessive numbers of children being held in the South East and very disappointed that Government has not kept these numbers to a minimum' ‘Where it is considered in the family’s best interests not to stay at the airport until the next flight, we will make arrangements for them to stay at Tinsley House.’ But Mr Reitemeier accused ministers of reneging on a promise to end the detention of children. He pointed to a report earlier this year which found conditions at Heathrow used to hold children were degrading and ‘wholly unsuitable’. Part of the Coalition agreement was to end the practice of holding child migrants due to be deported. Nick Clegg announced the closure of a family wing at Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre responsible for causing ‘significant harm’ to youngsters. Instead, accommodation has been constructed at the Cedars centre in Pease Pottage, West Sussex. The charity Barnardo’s has agreed to give support to families at Cedars – leading to accusations it is ‘legitimising detention’.","Figured obtained due to Freedom of Information Act .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:10 AM on 19th October 2011 . The high-powered New York lawyer . hired by an anonymous donor to represent the parents of missing baby . Lisa Irwin gave an interview this morning, alongside the family's . private investigator, to tout the couple's innocence in spite of recent . claims that the mother may have been blackout drunk on the night of the . 10-month-old's disappearance. Federal aviation officials have also . stepped into the search, by temporarily restricting flights that go over . a wooded area near the Missouri couple's home, where authorities are . now searching for the fourth time in hope of clues. The flight restrictions were . announced Tuesday and, according to NBC News, they are in effect 'to . provide a safe environment for law enforcement'. The restricted area is . 1500 feet above and two nautical miles surrounding the wooded area. Scroll down for video . Missing: It has been over two weeks since 10-month-old Lisa Irwin was last seen . FBI investigators have continued to . search the family's home, and also spent hours pumping water out of the . stream behind the Irwin's home, both in an effort to discover new clues. 'We have been all over the city in . the last 14 days following up on leads, interviewing people, furthering . this investigation, and this is just another step in the investigation,' said FBI spokesman Bridget Patton. Lawyer Joe Tacopina said this morning . that the fact that Lisa's mother Deborah Bradley has now changed the . timeline of events from the disappearance should not be used as a reason . to consider her a suspect. 'It's not an inconsistency,' Mr . Tacopina said on Good Morning America Tuesday. 'It may be a recollection . refreshed at some later point, but it's certainly not material to . whether or not she had anything to do with the disappearance of her . baby.' High-powered: Parents Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin (right) have hired Joe Tacopina (left) as their lawyer. Tacopina is best known for defending Joran Van der Sloot, the Dutch man suspected in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway . Sure: Joe Tacopina says he would not have taken the case if he had even the slightest hesitation that the parents were involved, and he said he spoke to them for a week before signing on to the case . In previous reports, Ms Bradley had . said that she put Lisa to bed around 6.30pm and then checked on her . around 10.30pm. On Monday, Mrs Bradley changed that statement and said . that she had not actually checked on her after putting her to bed. Her lawyer, who has worked on . controversial cases like that of Joran Van der Sloot who was involved . with the Natalee Holloway disappearance case as well as this summer's . case against a New York City cop who was accused of raping a drunk . woman, said that Ms Bradley's revelation is not a game changer. 'There's not a four hour gap,' Mr . Tacopina urged. 'At one point during one of the 13 hours of interview, . she had said she believed she check on her at 10:30.' Ms Bradley's revelation comes amid . complaints from police that the couple have refused to be questioned for . the past ten days- meaning they stopped talking only five days after . Lisa disappeared on October 3. 'The last time that the mom and dad . sat down with detectives to answer questions about things they might . only know was October 8. And that time, and previous times, there came a . point when Deborah became uncomfortable and stopped the questioning,' said Kansas City Police Captain Steve Young. Caught on tape: Deborah Bradley was caught on a store's surveillance video buying a box of wine and baby supplies with her brother, five hours before Lisa vanished . Blackout: Deborah Bradley, pictured with Baby Lisa's father Jeremy Irwin, admits that she was drunk on a box of wine she bought before her daughter disappeared . Mr Tacopina criticized local Kansas . City Police officials, saying 'some of the local police officers have . conducted themselves in a way to me is baffling'. Mr Tacopina was hired by an anonymous . donor, who is keeping their identity secret in order to keep the focus . on the case, who is the same man responsible for footing the bill of a . private investigator. This is the same anonymous donor who . has put up the $100,000 reward for finding baby Lisa, and the donor is . said to have a direct tie to the family, though that tie is going to . remain unclear. Bill Stanton, the investigator, also spoke on Good Morning America, echoing Mr Tacopina's sentiments of the parent's innocence. 'We are starting to look outside the . home,' Mr Stanton said, making clear that they he and his team do not . consider Ms Bradley or Lisa's father Jeremy Irwin suspects. Hopeful: Investigator Bill Stanton thinks that given Lisa's age, she is likely to still be alive and either be part of a trafficking scheme or be kidnapped . Where is she? As the search for the baby who disappeared from Kansas City, Missouri, continues a $100,000 reward was put up for her return or the conviction of anyone involved in her going missing . In spite of the fact that there have . been no new clues released and baby Lisa has now been missing for over . two weeks, Mr Stanton is still hopeful. 'My feeling is that the baby is . alive, someone has her. When you look at the statistics, no one's taking . a 10-month-old to do harm; they're taking I would say either for . trafficking or to have their own [child].' Ms Bradley and Mr Irwin, who are . engaged, have told authorities that he arrived home from a night shift . to find the front door unlocked, the house lights on, a window tampered . with and the baby gone. Ms Bradley said police accused her of killing Lisa and that she believes she will be arrested. 'I was the last one with her,' she said. 'That's kind of a fear that I have.' Baby Lisa: Deborah Bradley said that she put her daughter in her crib at 6.30pm on October 4 . She said is scared that her arrest would precipitate an end to the search for her missing baby. 'If they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her and I'll never know what happened,' Bradley said. She also said her two sons, aged 6 . and 8, who were asleep elsewhere in the home at the time of Lisa's . disappearance, say they heard noises the night Lisa disappeared although . she doesn't know if they heard noises before they went to sleep or . later in the night and she doesn't want them to be involved in the . investigation. 'I have not sat down and talked to them about it, specifically to not have to put them through anything else,' she said.

A teenage girl missing since July - from an area in Florida where neighbours said three suspects in  the 'house of horrors' gang had come from earlier this month - has been located in Philadelphia. It's the latest twist in the extraordinary story of the filthy basement where four disabled victims were kept chained to a boiler, which reeked of . waste from the buckets they used to relieve themselves. Three of the four victims today spoke out of their horror at being locked up in a low-ceiling, dank room that contained a mattress with bedding and a flat board with a pillow and a boiler. Scroll down for videos . Horror chamber: The dark and filthy basement in Philadelphia where four disabled people were kept chained to pipes and made to usual buckets as toilets . Vile: Makeshift beds and dirty blankets filled the sub-basement which was home to four vulnerable individuals who were being robbed for their social security cheques . The squalid conditions of the sub-basement were revealed behind a locked door under apartments in the city's Tacony . neighbourhood. There were a few water bottles but no food. And now there's a new twist. Benita Rodriguez, who was missing since July from West Palm Beach in Florida, where neighbours said the group had come from earlier this month, has been found. 'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong... I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was coming up' Victim Derwin McLemire . The girl's mother said the . 15-year-old had been friends with one of the suspect's sons, Gregory . Thomas Jr, and was found by Philadelphia police on Monday. UPI reported that she was found with the three suspects in the case. She was not in the basement with . the four adults but was found shortly after they were. Details surrounding Miss Rodriguez's connection to the case . are sketchy and police are not yet sure how much she knew about the . 'house of horrors'. Meanwhile, the identity of one victim has been . revealed as Herbert Knowles, who went missing three years ago from his . home in Norfolk, Virginia. The family of Mr Knowles, 40, said he . moved in with a girlfriend and her mother, Linda Weston three years ago. That was the last time they heard from him until he was rescued at the . weekend. Found: Benita Rodriguez, 15, who was missing since July 4 from West Palm Beach, Florida, has also been located by Philadelphia police. Her boyfriend's father is one of the three suspects - Gregory Thomas . Mr Knowles's niece Tiffany Davis told Wavy TV: 'The way they describe him, as if he was some kind of animal. You got him chained in the basement. All the lights are out. There are buckets for him to use the bathroom.' Derwin McLemire, 41, another victim, told KYW: 'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong.' The North Carolina man said he tried to escape from Weston's home 'and I didn't get away, so they got me'. Mr McLemire had forgotten what day it was after being held captive for so long. 'I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was coming up,' he told CBS Philly. He said of his alleged captor Linda Ann Weston: 'She wouldn’t let me do nothing.' A third victim was identified by Tamara Breeden. She alleged to KYW that she was hit in the head by Weston and 'all this was bleeding and everything'. The fourth victim's name has not been released. Victims: Tamara Breeden, Derwin McLemire and Herbert Knowles (left-right) speak after being rescued . Ms Breeden, 29, was reported missing six years ago - but the case was reportedly closed by police last year in Philadelphia even though detectives had not found her, reported myFOXphilly.com. There were growing fears that the cases were part of a wider network to abuse and steal social security . cheques from the vulnerable after  identity cards and power-of-attorney forms for 50 people were discovered upstairs. Three people have been arrested in . connection with the incident. Two have been identified as Linda Ann . Weston, 51, and Gregory Thomas, 47. Held captive: Herbert Knowles went missing from his home in Norfolk, Virginia three years ago . Eddie . Wright, 50, homeless, was also facing charges of criminal conspiracy, . aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, . false imprisonment and other related charges, according to police. Lieutenant Ray Evers said: 'Without a . doubt. This is just the beginning of this investigation. We think she's . been doing this for quite some time.' The 'dungeon', as it was described by officials, was littered with bottles, blankets and clothing items. The four captives, who are said to have the mental age of a ten-year-old, were taken to Frankford Hospital and have since been discharged to a group home, where they were being looked after. Police said they were malnourished and some had bruises and bed sores. At least one was kept chained to a pipe in the room. They are thought to have been held captive for more than a year. It was also revealed that Weston, the . alleged ringleader of the gang, had previously served eight years for . starving someone to death. She . was convicted of starving Bernardo Ramos, 25, to death after he refused . to support her sister's unborn child, the Philadelphia Inquirer . reported. Police said while officers were in the . basement of the eight-unit apartment building, they heard a noise . behind a locked steel door that sounded like a dog. The . door was opened to reveal four people in a room not tall enough for an adult to stand up straight in. Locked in: There are fears that the four found in Philadelphia are just some of many across the country being kidnapped for money and held captive . Grim discovery: Sgt. Joseph Green walks down the steps leading to the sub-basement where four weak and malnourished adults, one chained to a boiler, were found at the weekend . Vicious crime: Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey stands by the entrance to the dank basement room where four people were held against their will . It was not clear how the suspects know the victims - a . 29-year-old female and three males, aged 31 to 41. On Saturday night, evidence . technicians carted out several feet of chains from the basement of the . apartment building. One emergency responder overheard some of the captives say they were handing over their government checks to a caretaker. A police spokesman said that getting information . from the victims had been difficult due to their disabilities, but they . apparently had been brought to Philadelphia about ten days before they . were found. They had apparently been in West Palm Beach, Florida, and . before that in Texas. 'Ringleader': Linda Ann Weston, 51, is one of three suspects accused of detaining four mentally disabled people . Charged: Gregory Thomas, 47, (left) and Eddie Wright, 49, (right) are also accused of stealing the victims' Social Security checks . Philadelphia Police Deputy . Commissioner Richard Ross said: 'This case just makes you shake your . head; it's despicable and unspeakable. When you look at the conditions under which they were kept, it's something out of a dungeon actually.' Joan Sendef, who lives several blocks away, told the Philly News: 'You think you've seen it all.

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 2:35 PM on 18th October 2011 . Two Britons are being questioned by an anti-terror unit in Kenya today after they were arrested near the border with Somalia. The pair are believed to be from Cardiff and are British citizens, although police said one is of Somali descent and the other Pakistani. Charles Owino, deputy spokesman for the Kenyan police, said: 'They were arrested crossing into Somalia. They are under investigation by the anti-terrorism unit of the Kenyan police.' Two Britons are being questioned by an anti-terror unit in Kenya today after they were arrested near the border with Somalia. Kenyan troops, meanwhile, are pushing towards the strategic Somali town of Afmadow (file picture) South Wales Police have been in contact with officers in Kenya to try to obtain more information about why the pair were detained. A statement from the force said: . 'Officers are currently in liaison with the Kenyan authorities in . respect of two British nationals who have been detained near to the . border with Somalia. 'The identities of these persons have . yet to be formally confirmed, both are believed to be from the Cardiff . area... The force is liaising with local law enforcement to . establish the circumstances of their detention. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We . are aware of reports of two British nationals detained in Kenya on . October 16 and we are seeking normal consular access.' The arrests come after six weeks during which Somali gunmen have kidnapped four Europeans and killed a fifth inside Kenya. This led Kenyan forces to move into Somalia en masse over the weekend. The push by Kenyan ground forces towards the strategic Somali town of Afmadow has been slowed by heavy rain, a military spokesman said today. Warning: Al-Shabab spokesperson Ali Mohamud Rage yesterday threatened Kenya during a news conference in Mogadishu . As Kenya's defence and foreign ministers arrived in Mogadishu for talks, Kenyan troops and pro-Somali government forces are heading towards the town just north of the port city of Kismayo, where the militant group al-Shabab is entrenched. Major Emmanuel Chirchir said Kenyan forces were at the Somali town of Qoqani, about 50miles from Afmadow. Residents of Afmadow yesterday reported that al-Shabab fighters were leaving as the troops approached, although Major Chirchir said progress has been slowed by rain. Abdinasir Serar, a commander with the pro-government Ras Kamboni militia, said: 'Our troops are heading to Afmadow now, and we expect to capture it either today or tomorrow.' In Mogadishu, Kenya's ministers of defence and foreign affairs were to meet with the leaders of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, said government spokesman Abdirahman Omar Osman. Kenyan forces moved en masse into Somalia over the weekend, following a declaration on Saturday by Kenyan leaders that the country had the right to defend itself. Mr Osman said previously that Kenyan troops were not needed in Somalia's south. Al-Shabab fighters display weapons as they conduct military exercises in northern Mogadishu, Somalia, recently . Al-Shabab yesterday denied . involvement in the abductions, and warned Kenya of terrorist attacks on . its soil unless its forces retreat. The group threatened to . bring down Nairobi skyscrapers and referenced the July 2010 bomb attacks . they masterminded in Kampala, Uganda, that killed 76 people. Al-Shabab said the attacks were . retaliation for Uganda's troops contributions to the African Union . peacekeeping force in Mogadishu. 'Remember what happened in Uganda's capital,' Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, an al-Shabab spokesman, said. Although Kenya said the kidnapping attacks were the catalyst for the invasion, there are indications the push into Somalia has been in the works for some time. Military analysts say it is highly unlikely Kenya could organise such a complex military operation so quickly in response to the kidnappings. The Kenyan invasion comes at a time when al-Shabab has been weakened by famine in its strongholds, has been pushed from the capital of Mogadishu by African Union troops and finds itself increasingly challenged by clan militias. Kenya moved two battalions of about 800 troops each across the border in two locations, a Nairobi-based official said. Tanks, helicopters and artillery have also been deployed. The invasion is the most significant foreign deployment of the Kenyan military since independence from Britain in 1963. Kenya's final objective remains unclear. It has spent the last two years pushing for a buffer zone between it and troubled Somalia. Kenyan forces trained and equipped the so-called Jubaland militia of more than 2,000 Somalis and have frequently said they want to take Kismayo, a port city whose customs revenues are the insurgency's biggest cash cow. Al-Shabab's key line of defense for Kismayo is in front of the Juba river. There are only three bridges across it strong enough to take the movement of vehicles.","The pair are believed to be from Cardiff .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 10:03 AM on 19th October 2011 . E! True Hollywood is a popular American documentary series which delves in to the lives of famous Hollywood celebrities - and now Casey Anthony is being given the silver screen treatment. The 25-year-old dominated U.S. headlines this year before she was acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter, Caylee, who went missing Orlando, Florida in July 2008. Her six-week televised trial was described by Time magazine as 'the social media trial of the century' and her tale will be broadcast tonight and includes interviews with a number of people close to the case which gripped the nation. Given the Hollywood treatment: E! True Hollywood Story will focus on Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of murdering her daughter, tonight . In the full glare of the media Anthony was on trial in Orlando from May 24 until July 5, this year. She was found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. However, she was charged with four misdemeanour counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. Those quizzed for the one-hour . special include journalists who were reporting on the case, ex-boyfriends, school friends and her defence lawyers. Two-year-old Caylee Anthony went missing in June 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later . Casey Anthony leaves from the Booking and Release Center at the Orange County Jail (left) in July after she was acquitted of murdering her daughter, Caylee. Zenaida Fernandez Gonzalez (right) is bringing a defamation case against Anthony . The show - E! True Hollywood Story: Casey Anthony airs tonight at 10pm ET (3am GMT+1) In addition, Zenaida Gonzalez, a . woman with the same name as the fake nanny Anthony said had kidnapped her daughter, has also been interviewed. Last week the former murder suspect gave video evidence in a defamation lawsuit brought by Ms Gonzalez, disguised in a wig, . baseball cap and sunglasses. The documentary series on E! deals with Hollywood stars and well-known public figures. It began in 1996, has enjoyed 13 series and there have been over 500 episodes. Topics covered on the programme include re-tellings of Hollywood secrets, show-biz scandals, celebrity murders and mysteries. In addition there are porn-star biographies, and 'where-are-they-now?' investigations which look in to the lives of former child stars. Frequently the show features in-depth interviews, courtroom footage, and dramatic re-enactments. The show - E! True Hollywood Story: Casey Anthony - about Anthony, once called 'one of the most hated women in America' by a Florida probation spokeswoman - airs tonight at 10pm ET (3am GMT+1). Throughout the trial her defence lawyer, Jose Baez, said baby Caylee had drowned in the family swimming pool. That revelation contradicted Anthony's accounts which she had provided to police, which stated her belief that her daughter had been taken by nanny Zenaida Gonzalez. The real woman with that name - who had no link to the family - said she and her family were harassed and Ms Gonzalez told E!: 'It started going down like, ""You're a baby killer, you killed that baby."" 'They were going to kidnap my daughters and see how I like [it] and then they started saying that they [were] going to kill them and they [were] going to send them to me in pieces in a box to my house.' Anthony has hardly been seen out in public since her case was acquitted, in part due to the frenzy and furore created by the verdict handed down. Further, she has to pay the legal and investigations costs which total $217,449.23 (£138,187.27) and the defamation case brought by Ms Gonzalez still has to be concluded. Meanwhile a Florida Bar spokeswoman has stated that two complaints pending against lawyer Baez both relate to his role as lead counsel during Anthony's murder trial. Bar spokeswoman Francine Walker confirmed yesterday that one of the complaints relates to Mr Baez failing to turn over information to prosecutors during pre-trial discovery before Anthony was tried. Another is related to Mr Baez not informing the court that Anthony was serving a year of probation for a check fraud conviction while in jail awaiting the start of her murder case.","Ex-lovers, school friends and lawyers interviewed .

The corporation has been screening 1976 editions of the show on BBC Four. King appeared in April of that year with his hit It Only Takes A Minute, which reached No 9 in the charts. However, his appearance was cut from the re-run for fear of offending viewers – a decision which King described as a ‘Stalinist revision of history’. Jonathan King performing his hit It Only Takes a Minute on Top of the Pops in 1976. Cambridge graduate King started his career as a record company executive, discovering multi-million selling acts Genesis and 10cc, before becoming a pop singer . Now 66, King was convicted in 2001 of sexual assault on five teenage boys in the 1980s. He was given a seven-year jail sentence and was released on parole in 2005. He complained to the BBC’s director general Mark Thompson about being left out of the programme in April this year. In his response, which King has posted on his website, Mr Thompson apologised and wrote that the omission should ‘not have happened’. Mr Thompson wrote: ‘The BBC’s complaints process begins with a response from the relevant programme makers and I therefore asked my colleagues in BBC Four to address this matter. Sorry: The BBC's Mark Thompson, who personally wrote to King to apologise . ‘Their response is as follows: “We are sorry that Mr King’s appearance was edited out of this particular programme. We accept that this should not have happened and we would like to apologise for any upset this caused”. ‘I want to join BBC Four in apologising for this incorrect decision.’ King has also been assured that no more of his Top Of The Pops appearances will be edited out. Mr Thompson’s response continued: ‘We can assure Mr King that there is no policy in place requiring any of his appearances, or those of any one else, to be removed from repeats we show on the channel. ‘We can also assure Mr King that his performance will not be edited out of any future repeat of this particular episode of Top of the Pops.’ Dear Jonathan Thank you for your email. Please accept my apologies for the delay in replying. I am sorry to hear that you were unhappy that your performance was edited out of an episode of Top of the Pops recently repeated on BBC Four. The BBC's complaints process begins with a response from the relevant programme makers and I therefore asked my colleagues in BBC Four to address this matter. Their response is as follows: ""We are sorry that Mr King's appearance was edited out of this particular programme. We accept that this should not have happened and we would like to apologise for any upset this caused.""We can assure Mr King that there is no policy in place requiring any of his appearances, or those of any one else, to be removed from repeats we show on the channel. ""We can also assure Mr King that his performance will not be edited out of any future repeat of this particular episode of Top of the Pops."" I hope this response is helpful, but please come back to me if there are any further points you wish to raise and I will ensure that these are dealt with in accordance with our complaints process. I want to join BBC Four in apologising for this incorrect decision.Best wishes Mark Thompson Director General BBC . King was delighted with his victory over the BBC. He said: ‘I wrote to Mark Thompson asking why the BBC have adopted the Stalinist revision approach to history, and this is a very nice response. ‘The principle of not altering history is a far bigger one than It Only Takes a Minute – would they remove Hitler from retrospectives?’ He claimed Seventies star Gary Glitter, 67, who was convicted of possessing child pornography in the UK before being convicted in Vietnam for committing obscene acts with minors, had also been removed from repeats. He went on: ‘I hope this means that any other showings of any other episodes will also feature my performances – the Seventies were full of them, and in the Eighties shows, I’m on virtually once a month doing American chart rundowns. ‘And I hope other censorship, such as removing Glitter from earlier shows, will now be corrected.’ Cambridge graduate King started his career as a record company executive, discovering multi-million selling acts Genesis and 10cc, before becoming a pop singer. As well as continuing to perform and produce pop records, he presented popular programmes including Entertainment USA. He was shamed in September 2001 when he received a seven-year sentence for six offences against five boys aged 14 to 16, committed between 1983 and 1989. King was arrested in November 2000 after the allegations were made public. At the time, he was released on £150,000 bail, with £50,000 of it put up by X Factor creator Simon Cowell. He was re-arrested two months later. The BBC had no further official comment on Mr Thompson’s apology to King . A corporation source, however, said: ‘The BBC doesn’t think it should be rewriting history so will be showing these programmes in their entirety.’",King was convicted in 2001 of sexual assault on five teenage boys in the 1980s .

The branches of Mitt Romney's family tree can be seen stretching into Mexico as new light is shed on the presidential contender's roots. Mr Romney’s great-grandfather Miles Park Romney fled to Mexico's Chihuahua desert in 1885 to escape anti-polygamy laws in the U.S. He had five wives. Romney's roots: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney greets voters during a campaign stop last week in Los Angeles, California .

Romeny's father George was born in Mexico before moving back to the U.S. as a small child. Romney family ties: From left, Karen Romney sits with her grandson, Tyton, and brother-in-law Leighton Romney after church service in Colonia Juarez, Mexico . Pursued by U.S. Marshals following the 1882 crackdown on polygamists, Miles Park Romney set up shop in Mexico with other Mormon settlers. Michael Romney, one of Mitt's cousins, told the Washington Post that his  great-grandfather's wives 'lived like sisters.' A place to call home: The great-grandfather of presidential hopeful Mitt Romney settled in Mexico's Chihuahua desert in 1885 to escape U.S. anti-polygamy laws . Today, however, the Mormons of northern Mexico no longer practice polygamy, and the Mormon church officially banned the practice in 1890. Front-runner: Mitt Romney is seen by many as the top Republican presidential contender . In his 2004 book Turnaround, Mitt Romney wrote: 'Despite emigrating, my great-grandfather never lost his love of country.' While the Romney name is a political powerhouse in the U.S., his relatives staying in Mexico are feeling pressure from a violent drug war. Two years ago, Mr Romney’s cousin Meredith Romney was kidnapped and held for ransom in a cave for three days. Meredith Romney, 70, said: 'I just figured my time was up. I later found out they’d kidnapped 18 people and killed 14 of them.' Despite the threat of reprisals, the Mexico Romneys are standing firm. Michael Romney said: 'We’re not going anywhere. There’s too much history.' The Romney family can be traced as far back to 17th century Great Britain, when William Romney served as lord mayor of London.","Dozens of Romney cousins still live in Mexico, staying since Mitt's great-grandfather fled anti-polygamy laws ."

"By . Jack Doyle . Last updated at 3:27 PM on 27th September 2011 . Thousands of civilians have been given sweeping police-style powers allowing them to fine people and demand personal details. Following a worrying expansion of a discredited Labour project, more than 2,200 civilians including street wardens, housing officers, traffic marshals and stewards can issue financial  penalties for ‘offences’ such as dropping litter, dog fouling  and truancy. Coalition ministers have allowed the numbers signed up to the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme to grow by a third over just 12 months. New powers: 2,200 civilians, such as these street wardens in London, will be able to fine the public following an expansion in the number of people able to issue penalties for 'offences' such as dropping litter . It comes despite senior Liberal Democrats and Tories strongly condemning the scheme when in opposition. Under it, councils and private sector firms pay a few hundred pounds for accreditation by the local police force. They . then pay as little as £32 for each employee they want to be accredited. Those chosen undergo a short training course and are given a uniform . and a special badge approved by the Chief Constable. As . well as handing out fines of up to £80, the accredited civilians – . dubbed ‘Jacqui Smith’s Irregulars’ after the former Labour home . secretary – can photograph  members of the public and demand their names . and addresses. It is an offence to refuse to provide . such details when they ask. But they have no power to detain or arrest . and must call a police officer or PCSO. Before the election, former shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve – who is now Attorney General – said the scheme was ‘a consequence of the Government’s obsession with policing on the cheap’. And Chris Huhne, now a Cabinet minister, said the scheme was part of the ‘slow march towards instant justice’. But Home Office documents uncovered by the Mail reveal a startling expansion of the CSAS last year. Hundreds of organisations have signed up, including councils, shopping centres, Newmarket Racecourse, the Essex YMCA and the British Cycling Federation. There are huge concentrations of accredited civilians in some areas – including 366 in Essex, 223 in Gwent, and 124 in Cleveland. In Merseyside, Bedfordshire  and Cumbria, by contrast, the police forces do not operate the scheme at all. Simon Reed, vice chairman of the Police Federation, said: ‘I’m sure that the public would have huge concerns knowing that we have people walking around in this pseudo-enforcement role without proper accountability and legitimacy.’ Nick Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘In some cases this appears to be policing on the cheap, in others it is downright ridiculous. The Coalition should recognise the risk this scheme poses to civil liberties and urgently act to curtail it.’ In May, the Mail requested details of the numbers accredited under the scheme from Home Office officials, using the Freedom of Information Act. Officials initially refused to answer, claiming a policy review was under way, but they have since done so, revealing that in 2008, 1,406 individuals were accredited under CSAS. That increased by almost a fifth to 1,667 the following year. But by the end of last year  the total had rocketed to 2,219, a rise of 33 per cent. In 2008 there were 95 ‘approved organisations’ allowed to enrol individuals onto the scheme. By December last year that figure hit 153, up more than 60 per cent. If the numbers accredited have continued to grow at the same  rate the total will now be approaching 3,000. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Creating safer communities isn’t just a job for the police, it’s about all of us taking responsibility for the areas where we live and working with the police to challenge and tackle low level crime and anti-social behaviour. ‘Accredited persons assist the police and the public in dealing with low level crime and disorder. ‘CSAS frees up police time, allowing officers to respond to more serious crime, and providing a localised partnership approach to keeping the public safe.’ The British Cycling Federation said the powers allowed volunteers to act as traffic marshals during road races. A spokesman said: ‘This has been a useful tool to keep the police costs down.’",Move comes despite senior Liberal Democrats and Tories strongly condemning the scheme when in opposition .
"By . Deborah Arthurs . Last updated at 9:22 PM on 18th October 2011 . Imagine if you could find your perfect jeans without the endless trawl around denim stores trying on countless pairs. We've all been there - wrestling on pair after pair of jeans in cramped, overheated changing rooms in an attempt to find the Holy Grail of denim - the pair that will do the impossible of slimming, lengthening and lifting. Given that it's a Herculean task to ask of any item of clothing, it's no surprise that women try on an average of 15 pairs before settling on the perfect pair... Or giving up and going home. The Bodymetric scanner takes readings from 300,000 points all over the body, creating an accurate map of the body's curves and contours . Well, luckily for us, the High Street is beginning to sit up and listen. From today, customers at the New Look store at Westfield Stratford will be able to avoid the traumas of ill-fitting jeans (goodbye, gaping waists, too-short legs and baggy bottoms) thanks to the installation of a Bodymetrics 3D body scanner. Shoppers will strip to their underwear and step into the scanner, which is shaped like a photo booth. Low-power, infra-red lights will read more than 300,000 points all over the body. The whole process will take no more than 7 seconds. One hundred vital statistics can be gathered - from bottom, waist and hip measurements down to the size of the left ankle, thigh girth and inside leg. The Bodymetrics pods have become smaller and more compact thanks to advances in technology, meaning more stores across the nation will be able to accommodate one in their changing rooms . Once the customer has been scanned, a dedicated denim Fit Stylist will analyse the curves and contours of the body-mapping, using the information to pick and pick out the perfect pair - and hey presto, the jean genie's work will be done. The team will then email the customer their unique body map for future reference - based on the theory that as more stores implement the technology, the details could help with accurate fitting. The technology is not new - it first launched 2001, and was tipped to be the next major development for fashion brands, with many vowing to install them in their changing rooms. A Fit Stylist will analyse the body mapping results and use the information to pick out the perfect pair for the customer . At the time the technology was . launched, it was tipped to revolutionise the way we try on and buy . clothes. Ten years on though, the pods have not made their way to . fashion's front line in the way that was originally predicted. Then, upmarket department store Selfridges installed a pod in their own denim room  - but until now, that is the only Bodymetrics pod that has been available for consumers, and it has never reached the masses on the High Street. Behind the scenes, a handful of . companies - New Look included - have been using the technology in-house . to ensure uniformity of size for garments manufactured in factories . across the globe. Now though, Bodymetrics' CEO Suran Goonatilake says major advances in technology mean that vision could soon become reality. 'There's been a big leap in technology - new body scanners are smaller, cheaper and faster. 'Fashion is one of the few industries where no sizing standards exist. Size labels vary from retailer to retailer and from brand to brand, and one person can be as much as three different size labels in three different brands - for example, ranging between 8 and 12, because of the discrepancy. 'Soon, as more retailers take up the technology, Bodymetrics will allow you to discover what size you are in different brands. Furthermore, Goonatilake believes the body scanners could transform internet shopping. 'One of the key barriers in internet shopping is that because you can't try items on, returns are between 20 and 40 per cent of all garments sold,' he says. 'It's a real inconvenience for the consumer, and hits the bottom line of the retailer. 'It's not good for the environment in terms of transporting garments back and forth either. 'Our vision is that over the next few years, most retailers will have body scanners which will allow people to shop in store as well as online and help find clothes that fit perfectly their size, shape and style. 'Once you have your body scanned, it will be uploaded to your Bodymetrics account which can be accessed online, so you can shop for clothes knowing they're going to fit. Bodymetrics 3D body scanner will be in store at New Look Westfield from today until 1 November.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 1:11 PM on 17th October 2011 . A mining company has triggered a modern gold rush in the U.S. after discovering 3.1million ounces of the precious metal near a small South Carolina town. Canadian firm Romarco Minerals Inc expects to pour its first gold bar in early 2014 after re-opening the historic Haile Gold Mine this year near Kershaw. At today's prices, the mine could yield more than $5billion if estimates of the mine's reserves are proven correct. Precious project: An amusing sign welcomes visitors to the Haile Gold Mine's Gold Rush Festival 2011, which was held in recognition of the support shown by the community for the renewed mining exploration . If only it were real: A child (left) digs for pretend gold (right) at the festival. Romarco Minerals Inc is hoping to pour its first real gold bar in early 2014 . Plans afoot: Two employees discuss their schedule for the day near mining machinery on the site of the Haile Gold Mine . Once environmental impact studies and permits are complete, Haile will be the only modern gold mine operating east of the Mississippi River. It will also be the first since the Kennecott Minerals mine closed in Ridgeway, South Carolina, in 1999, Romarco's chief executive Diane Garrett told Reuters this week. Based on the gold reserves found in samples, the Toronto company estimates it has 3.1million ounces of the metal at Haile. The mine will produce an average of 150,000 ounces of gold a year for five years and the company expects to be there for at least 13, possibly 20. The plans look set to create hundreds of jobs for Kershaw, which according to its mayor, has been 'begging' for new employment. 'It sits on one of the most significant trends of gold in the United States,' Garrett said. 'A lot of people had forgotten just how significant the gold production was in this area.' Renewed interest: The gold at Haile was found in volcanic rock in the Carolina Slate Belt, sparking a flurry of activity from other mining companies in that area . Romarco's success at finding the gold left at Haile has sparked renewed industry interest in the southeastern United States. The gold is embedded in microscopic flecks in volcanic rock along what geologists call the Carolina Slate Belt, which winds from northern Georgia through the Carolinas and into Virginia. Vancouver's Revolution Resources Corp said in early October that it had begun drilling at several historic North Carolina gold mine sites along the Slate Belt. Strongbow Exploration Inc, also from Vancouver, said this summer that it had bought mine properties in South Carolina and had begun drilling at North Carolina historic Parker Gold Mine. Erin Ventures Inc, another Canadian company, also is prospecting for gold in North Carolina, according to its website. Michael George, gold commodities specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said the 'unprecedented climb into the stratosphere' for gold prices has spurred the eastern development. Past and present: A sign (left) recounts the history of Haile Gold Mine which has been successfully re-opened by Canadian company Romarco Minerals Inc . 'We may have three or four mines started up in the next 10 to 15 years in the southeastern United States,' he said on Friday. Gold prices this week posted their biggest gain in six weeks, buoyed by optimism about European plans to contain the region's debt crisis. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were up $14.50 at $1,683 an ounce. Gold was first discovered in the United States in 1799 when a 12-year-old boy found a large nugget in a North Carolina creek. The story goes that his family used the nugget as a doorstop until a jeweler bought it for $3.50, said Kenneth Taylor, North Carolina's chief geologist. Positive futures: Miners working with a drilling tool on the site of the mine, which could yield as much as 3.1million ounces of gold if estimates prove right . 'There are hundreds of old gold mines all over North Carolina,' Taylor said. 'When the gold rush in California came in (in the 1840s), the experienced miners were here in North Carolina, so they went west.' Gold was first found on the Haile property in South Carolina in 1827. Mining continued off and on into the 1990s. Romarco owns about 10,000 acres that include the 4,200-acre mine site. The . company has spent about $350 million on site preparation and hiring . and, by the time it produces gold, will have spent about $650 million. 'Mining is a capital-intense industry,' said Garrett, whose company also owns two gold exploration sites in North Carolina. 'When . you look out West, this mine is quite small. Out there, you've got . mines that go for 20 miles and go thousands of feet deep.' Back in the day: Miners at Haile Gold Mine around 1903. The site closed in 1912 before briefly operating during the world wars and in the 1990s . The microscopic gold at Haile will be extracted by crushing tons of rock into dust and using a cyanide solution to separate the gold. The Army Corps of Engineers requires . an environmental impact study from Romarco on how it will replace 160 . acres of wetlands it plans to destroy. Environmentalists . also are concerned about an endangered freshwater mussel, the Carolina . heelsplitter, found in creeks near the site. Garrett said the company would propose land restoration and creating wetlands to replace those destroyed. The . environmental impact study will take about a year and has set back . groundbreaking and hiring, she said. The mine has 106 employees, she . said, and Romarco expects to hire up to 800 mostly local workers. Kershaw . Mayor Wayne Rhodes said the company would have a huge impact on his . economically depressed town of about 1,800 people, and he is concerned . about the delay in hiring. 'People here are begging for jobs,' Rhodes said. Tragedy: The hey day of the mine ended after a boiler explosion killed one worker and injured several others in August 1908 .","Reserves at Haile Gold Mine could yield more than $5billion .

A Muslim American accused of plotting to fly . explosives-packed remote-controlled model planes into the Pentagon and . the U.S. Capitol has pleaded not guilty. Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, is charged in the plot to fly three tiny aircraft into the government buildings and to follow up the attacks with a ground assault. He is also accused of attempting to provide material support and resources to the global Islamist militant network Al-Qaeda for attacks on U.S. soldiers overseas. Accused: Rezwan Ferdaus (right) and his attorney Catherine Byrne stand during Ferdaus' arraignment hearing in federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts, yesterday. He denies all the terrorism charges against him . Ferdaus' brother and his mother Maria leave the federal courthouse after Ferdaus' arraignment hearing . Ferdaus, an American citizen and resident of Ashland, Massachusetts, yesterday pleaded not guilty to all charges in U.S. District Court in Worcester. It marked his first public appearance since he was arrested on September 28 following a months-long undercover investigation led by the FBI. Ferdaus, a 26-year-old with a physics degree from Northeastern University, was arrested in Framingham after federal agents posing as Al-Qaeda members delivered what he is said to have believed was 24 pounds of C-4 explosive. Authorities said the public was never in danger from the plot. The accused's lawyer Catherine Byrne said the case was 'orchestrated and facilitated by the government'. She told reporters after yesterday's hearing: 'We have asked for a continuance for additional time in order to prepare and to further investigate so that we can present a more complete picture of what happened.' Conduit: A scale model of a U.S. Navy F-4 Phantom fighter plane similar to one of three Ferdaus allegedly planned to use in a coordinated attack . Chilling: This model F-86 Sabre is similar to another of the three tiny planes that Ferdaus allegedly planned to load with plastic explosives . The arrest was the latest in a string of terror arrests to emerge from similar sting operations. A . federal affidavit says Ferdaus began planning jihad - or holy war - . against the U.S. in early 2010 after becoming convinced through jihadi . websites and videos that America was evil. A group of nearly a dozen family members and friends attended Ferdaus' court appearance. Several . women, including his mother, wept as the charges against him were read.

Apple leaders, employees and pop culture stars celebrated the life of Steve Jobs in a tribute on Wednesday to a computer visionary who changed the world when he incorporated music, media and lifestyle into a sleek line of products. The service at company headquarters in Cupertino drew hundreds of employees. They crowded into an outdoor amphitheater to reflect on the legacy of the company co-founder, who died on October 5 after battling pancreatic cancer. Across the country, Apple stores shut their doors for several hours so retail employees could watch through a live webcast. The ceremony was closed to the public and media handlers shooed reporters away from the famously private company.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 11:46 AM on 20th October 2011 . Vincent Tabak’s lawyer admitted yesterday that his client’s behaviour after killing Joanna Yeates was ‘frankly disgusting’. William Clegg QC told a jury three times that he would not attempt to justify Tabak’s actions in the weeks before his arrest when he attended dinner parties and went to work as if nothing had happened. Giving the first detailed account of Miss Yeates’s death, Mr Clegg said Tabak had killed the landscape architect when she screamed as he tried to kiss her after being ‘beckoned’ into her home. The 33-year-old engineer put one hand around her throat and the other over her mouth and in ‘seconds’ Miss Yeates was dead, it was claimed. Trial: Vincent Tabak (right) claims it was 'pure chance' he killed Jo Yeates (left), Bristol Crown Court heard . Mr Clegg said: ‘What he did after that won’t be excused by us. His conduct afterwards was frankly disgusting. ‘He took the body and hid it, thereby . causing untold anguish and agony to Joanna’s family who had no idea . what had happened to her, and did everything to cover his tracks.’ Mr Clegg added that Tabak was a . ‘calculating person’ who had told ‘lie after lie’ in the weeks after his . crime but told the jury that what the defendant did after he killed his . neighbour was not what he was on trial for. ‘What he is being tried for is . whether, when he killed Joanna Yeates, that was planned and premeditated . and something that he intended to do, or whether he panicked and did it . without thinking of the consequences.’ Forensic investigations: Computer analyst Lyndsey Farmary, left, arrives at court to give evidence in the trial and Tabak's lawyer William Clegg, pictured yesterday morning (right) Mr Clegg said the Dutchman’s act had . not been planned, and came after the victim had invited her next-door . neighbour into her flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, Bristol. Seeing him through her kitchen window, . the 25-year-old beckoned for Tabak to come in and then offered him a . drink, Bristol Crown Court was told. Mr Clegg said that although they had . never really met, both had been alone, ‘bored’ and at a loose end on the . Friday night a week before Christmas last year. But while Miss Yeates, whose boyfriend . was away from the flat they shared, was simply being ‘sociable’, the . court heard that after a brief chat, 6ft 4in Tabak ‘completely misread . the situation he had walked in on’. View through Jo Yeates' kitchen window: The court heard that Vincent left his flat and he was walking towards his car, when he passed Joanna's kitchen window . Joanna's living room: The court heard that Joanna opened her front door and invited Vincent into her flat . Tabak, who admits manslaughter but denies murder, broke down and wept as his crime was described to the court. Mr Clegg told the jury: ‘He misread . her friendliness towards him and made a move towards her as if he was . about to kiss her on the lips. He put one  arm behind her back to draw . her closer to him.’ At this, the court was told, Miss . Yeates let out a ‘loud piercing scream’. Tabak is then said to have . panicked, put his hand over her mouth and told her to stop making a . noise. When he removed his hand, she continued to scream, the court heard, and he panicked again. Mr Clegg said: ‘He put one hand around her throat and the other over her mouth. In seconds, Joanna went limp. She was dead.’ Arrival: Joanna Yeates' bereaved boyfriend Greg Reardon, right, walks into court for Tabak's trial yesterday . As Mr Clegg addressed the jury Miss . Yeates’s parents David and Teresa, her brother Christopher and her . boyfriend Greg Reardon listened intently from the front row of the . public gallery. Mr Clegg insisted that his client had . never intended to kill Miss Yeates and said it was ‘pure chance’ that . the pair had even met on December 17. If Miss Yeates had stayed on in the . pub with her colleagues for one extra drink and not arrived home when . she did, it was said, ‘she would still be alive today’. Mr Clegg added: ‘If Vincent Tabak had . left 30 minutes earlier to go to Asda, as was his intention, he would . not be standing in the dock now.’ The jury was told that after realising . ‘to his horror’ that he had killed Miss Yeates, Tabak carried her body . to his flat where he wrapped her in a bicycle cover before bundling her . into the boot of his Renault Megane and dumping her body by the side of a . country road. He also placed in a dustbin the pizza . Miss Yeates had bought on her way home along with a grey ski sock  that . had fallen off her foot and the bike cover. The trial continues.

An air traffic controller who fell asleep while working alone on an 'insane' night shift knew he was struggling to stay awake shortly before dropping off, according to a report. The unnamed tower controller admitted he was 'dragging... slipping, struggling' as he became increasingly tired while three planes approached Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. in March. As a result, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report published today, two planes landed in error after a regional controller mistakenly gave the pilots the impression they could land using rules for airports with manned towers. Official report: An air traffic controller at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. who fell asleep while working alone on an 'insane' night shift knew he was struggling to stay awake shortly before dropping off . Both planes, which were carrying a total of 165 passengers, landed safely. The controller,  began working for the Federal Aviation Administration in 1990 before becoming a supervisor in 2005, was temporarily suspended. He had been the only person working in the Reagan tower at the time. The report said: 'When his awareness returned, he thought he had only been out for a couple of minutes. 'He heard one pilot calling in a ""forceful voice"", and shortly afterwards the pilot of the other flight was asking for the tower's phone number. That was when he realised he had missed quite a bit. 'The supervisor said that he knew he wasn't coherent, and now believes that he had been asleep.' At the time of the near-miss, air traffic controllers at Reagan were required to work a week of shifts starting at midnight each month, a schedule the controller described as 'insane'. The report details how the controller recalled waking up as if coming 'out of the haze' and found it difficult to talk for three or four minutes. Air traffic controllers are barred from sleeping while on shifts, even on breaks, although some workers admit to covering for friends . The following day, concerned that he . may have suffered a stroke, he visited his doctor. Although the doctor . failed to diagnose a stroke, he said it was likely the controller's . shift pattern was to blame for his falling asleep. The . report also revealed that the controller had recently returned to the . U.S. after travelling abroad and was suffering from jet-lag. Since . the March incident, and a handful of other near-misses involving tired . controllers, the FAA has made it law for a minimum of two controllers to . be working n a tower at any one time. A recording of the radio chatter of one of pilots that had to land 'blind' was revealed in April. The . pilot of an American Airlines jet is heard as he is told the ground . control tower is unmanned - probably because the controller 'got locked . out'. The one-minute . conversation between an American Airlines jet and a regional FAA . facility 40 miles away in Virginia, shows the horrifying line-by-line . reality of the dangerous situation. The regional controller in Virginia starts by outlining the problem to the pilot of the incoming AA jet.' FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt (left) and Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air . Traffic Controllers Association (right), visited air traffic control . facilities following numerous incidents of controllers falling asleep earlier this year . He said: 'The tower is apparently not manned, we've made a few phone calls. 'I'm going to take a guess and say that the controller got locked out, I've heard of this happening before.' The AA pilot then responds: 'First time I've heard of it.' Virginia tower: 'Yeah fortunately its not very often , it happened about a year ago.' AA Pilot: 'Interesting.' Virginia tower: 'It is.' Virginia Tower: 'American 1012, tower is back in business.' AA Pilot: 'That was a close call.' The incident raised serious questions about controller fatigue, a long-standing safety concern. John . Goglia, a former NTSB board member, said at the time: 'You have to . watch your schedules to make sure (controllers) have adequate rest. 'It's worse when nothing is going on. When it's busy, you have to stay engaged. 'When it's quiet, all they have to be is a little bit tired and they'll fall asleep.","Report details how Reagan National Airport controller remembers struggling to stay awake .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 8:45 AM on 19th October 2011 . Accused: Brian Regan, who played Terry Sullivan in Brookside, denies murder . A former star of Brookside was a getaway driver for a gang who shot a father-of-one dead, a court heard. Brian Regan, 53, who played Terry Sullivan in Channel 4's Brookside for 14 years, is accused of driving alleged gunman Edward Heffey to and from the murder scene. Nightclub bouncer Bahman Faraji, 44, was gunned down at close range outside a pub in Liverpool. Former actor Regan told police after he had been arrested in connection with the murder: 'I done nothing wrong and I didn't do anything willingly.' He also apparently added: 'I want to help you but I'll be shot.' Regan claims he did not know Heffey was carrying a weapon when he drove him to the Aigburth suburb. Mr Faraji, an Iranian known as Ben, was lured to the pub where he was shot in the face on February 24 this year by a series of phone calls, Liverpool Crown Court was told. Regan is standing trial alongside Heffey, 40, Lee Dodson, 42, and Simon Smart, 32. Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told the jury: 'Edward Heffey was the gunman who . actually shot the victim, and Brian Regan, by arrangement with Lee . Dodson, drove Heffey to and from the scene of the shooting, fully aware . of the purpose of Heffey's trip.' A man approached Mr Faraji and asked: 'Are you Ben?', the prosecutor said. He added: 'Mr Faraji nodded and the . man raised what appeared to be a shortened double-barrelled shotgun and . fired it directly into Mr Faraji's face. 'There was a cloud of smoke and Mr . Faraji fell to the ground. The gunman fled the scene on foot and . witnesses saw him carrying a gun under his arm. Shot dead: Bouncer Bahman Faraji, 44, was shot in the face at close range . 'He then got into a waiting vehicle driven by Brian Regan.' Mr Faraji died instantly, a post mortem examination found. Detectives launched a murder investigation and began a hunt for the getaway car. The following day police stop-checked . a Ford Escort estate in Liverpool city centre and inside the vehicle . were Regan and his girlfriend Christine Line. Regan gave a witness statement saying the car belonged to a friend but he had the use of it, Mr Cummings said. 'He said he'd been using the car the . previous evening but he had not been in the area where the murder took . place,' the prosecutor added. 'Christine Line's witness statement said broadly the same thing but there were some significant differences,' he added. Police became suspicious and both were arrested. Liverpool-based Brookside began on Channel 4's launch night in November 1982 and ran for 21 years until November 2003. Regan joined the soap from episode . six and his Terry Sullivan character was at the centre of some of . Brookside Close's most dramatic storylines until his final appearance in . 1997. The soap opera, noted for confronting . gritty issues, turned scores of actors into household names, including . Sue Johnson, Amanda Burton and Anna Friel. All the men deny murder. Regan and his girlfriend also deny perverting the course of justice. The trial continues today.","Brian Regan told police after his arrest: 'I done nothing wrong and I didn't do anything willingly'

"By . Chris Johnson and Nadia Mendoza . Created 10:15 AM on 20th October 2011 . She should be in the prime of her career, posing for magazine shoots instead of prison mugshots. But Lindsay Lohan has been subject to her FIFTH mugshot in just four years at the tender age of 25. Today, a tearful Lohan was led away from court in handcuffs and taken into custody after a judge blasted her for violating probation. Booked: This photo was taken after Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody, making it the FIFTH mugshot of her life . The troubled actress previously had the embarrassing photographs taken on July 24 and November 15 of 2007 and later again on July 20 and September 24 of 2010. The first mugshot was taken three weeks before filming was scheduled to resume on Poor Things, when Lohan was arrested for a second DUI and ordered to return to rehab. The second was when she served a grand total of 84 minutes behind bars following her DUI. Her third photograph came after she violated the terms of her probation and was sentenced to 90 days in jail - she served just 14 . The fourth came after her probation was revoked following a failed drug test, just before attending the Betty Ford Center for three months until early January 2011. Welling up: Lindsay Lohan appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom today where a judge revoked her probation and ordered her into custody . Lohan has had her latest probation . revoked pending a November 2 hearing after Judge Stephanie Sautner . slammed her for failing to complete time at the Downtown Women's Centre. The . Mean Girls star is now understood to have been released after posting . $100,000 and will not spend time behind bars - for now, at least. The outcome is pending the November . hearing, which was scheduled by the judge today, where the court will . hear further testimonies before deciding on the course of action. Becoming a habit: Lindsay Lohan is getting quite acquainted with the orange jumpsuit as she posed for police mugshots on September 24 and July 20 last year . Still pouting: Despite the severity of the situation, the actress managed to look photogenic during her mugshots on November 15 and July 24 2007 . Lindsay was formally arrested in court today and taken into custody after Sautner revoked her probation. On her booking sheet, the Los Angeles . County Sheriff's Department accidentally listed her sex as male, and . detailed how she weighed 116lbs. Sautner said Linsday should serve 16 . hours at the morgue on clean-up duty between now and her next court . hearing in an attempt to mitigate the current situation. Cuffed: Lohan was led away in handcuffs and taken into custody after the hearing. It is likely she will post bail and be released by the end of the day . The actress had been sentenced to 480 hours community service earlier this . year as part of her punishment for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery . store. During the hearing, Sautner asserted Lohan had managed to wilfully get herself kicked off the programme by cancelling . on the women's centre nine times. Faces of pain: Lindsay was her usually-animated self during today's hearing . Making an impression: Lohan arrived to court in an eggshell blue dress and gold peep-toe heels, teamed with a Chanel handbag, but was sporting rather heavy-handed make-up . Lohan welled up as her lawyer Shawn Holley Chapman fought her corner, pointing to the 'glowing report' by the Probation Service. But despite Lohan completing some . volunteer work this week at the Red Cross, the judge ruled it as void . because it was not part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier . hearing. She says Lohan should have gone to the . morgue for clean-up duty to complete some of the hours of community . service instead - which was the second part of the probation Sautner had . originally stipulated. 'Nobody has the power to change my sentence,' said an incredulous Sautner. Frenzy: . The actress was greeted by an army of photographers as she arrived at . the Los Angeles Superior Court West District Airport Courthouse . Fighting her corner: She was represented by her lawyer Shawn Holley Chapman . Packing punch after punch, an unimpressed Sautner told Lindsay: 'Probation is a gift as I see it. There is something called looking a gift horse in the mouth.' Sautner was also perplexed as to why the Probation Service had given Lohan such a positive report. She said her work this week at the . Red Cross would not count towards the 60 days of community service Lohan . has been ordered to complete. Sautner also estimated that Lindsay . has only managed to fulfil three days out of the 60 so far, also . taking into account the time taken to complete a shoplifters course. She noted that Lindsay had been a . no-show at the women's centre nine times and had only managed to do . around a day-and-a-half there. In the spotligh: Teams of paparazzi and TV camera crews were on hand to capture the actress's arrival and departure . Back home: Lindsay returns to her Venice Beach home in California after a dramatic day . Sautner suggested it was Lohan's . inability to keep to schedule and disruption of the programme that . eventually left women's centre with no option but to cancel her role there. The star pulled up to the courthouse at 9.55am for the 10am hearing at the Airport Branch Courthouse. Dressed in an eggshell blue dress and white scarf, the actress was also sporting rather heavy handed make-up. She had her hair tied back in a ponytail and stepped out of her black Cadillac Escalade to a barrage of flashbulbs. The Mean Girls actress has also served 35 days under house arrest this year as part of her sentence for the necklace theft. Pulling no punches: Judge Stephanie Sautner revoked Lohan's probation pending a hearing . Arrest: Lohan's sex is incorrectly listed as 'male' on her booking sheet processed today following her court appearance . The actress' once promising movie career has been derailed by multiple trips to jail and rehab since 2007. The judge dismissed Lohan's lawyer Holley's argument that the actress had to go abroad to work, where she has been seen partying over recent weeks in Europe. 'She is supposed to be an actress from what I hear,' Sautner said. Holley admitted that 'unfortunately' Lohan's career opportunity are not in America right now and that she has been to Europe to earn money to support herself and her family. But Sautner was more concerned about the logistics of how Lohan had attended weekly appointments with her U.S.-based shrink, which was part of the terms of her probation. While the psychological report said she had attended every week, Sautner was doubtful, pointing to the time frames of Lindsay's flights between various European destinations. Judge Sautner was sceptical about the glowing report written about Lindsay by the Probation Service.  In the . documents, the actress' probation officer says her psychotherapist . believes she is 'doing really well, she is making changes, and is trying . to become more disciplined in her actions' and that she is 'turning her . life around'.  The report also says she has been going to therapy every . week, which the judge disputed because of Lohan's travels overseas. The . report details how Lohan said the women's shelter community service was not 'fulfilling' - which was also slammed by the judge . Troubled: Lohan and her bail bondsman will now have to deal with the paperwork to get her released from custody . Familiar scene: An outside view of the Airport Courthouse in Los Angeles where Lohan attended today . Lindsay Lohan was given a leave of absence from her shoplifting course to have emergency dental work done. It came just two days after her red carpet appearance in Los Angeles where she displayed shockingly discoloured teeth. The actress's probation report detailed various dates of her excused absences from probation, including October 14 for a trip to the dentist. 'Ms. Lohan has not been absent to any regularly scheduled activities, . except the session scheduled for her on Friday, October 14, 2011 due to . her need to seek dental work,' the report stated. 'Client presented evidence of attending her dentist office. As a result her absence was excused.' Lohan now has her Hollywood smile back in place after having her teeth fixed. Before and after: Lohan's discoloured teeth, left, were transformed to pearly white just a week later .","Mean Girls star taken into custody after hearing .

Anger: Sir Oliver Popplewell, pictured when he sat as a High Court judge, suggested Hillsborough families should follow the example set by relatives of those killed in the Bradford City stadium disaster . A retired judge has sparked fury by calling on the Hillsborough families to behave with more 'dignity' - like the relatives of victims of the Bradford City stadium disaster. Sir Oliver Popplewell, who chaired the public inquiry into the 1985 fire at the Valley Parade stadium that killed 56 people, called on the Liverpool families to look at the 'quiet dignity and great courage' relatives in the West Yorkshire city have shown in the years following the tragedy. His controversial comments came a day after MPs took part in an emotional Commons debate on the tragedy in which Home Secretary Theresa May pledged . to release all possible documents on the 1989 FA Cup semi-final tragedy . that left 96 Liverpool fans dead. In a letter to The Times he said: 'The citizens of Bradford behaved with quiet dignity and great courage. 'They did not harbour conspiracy theories. They did not seek endless further inquiries. 'They buried their dead, comforted the bereaved and succoured the injured. 'They organised a sensible compensation scheme and moved on. 'Is there, perhaps, a lesson there for the Hillsborough campaigners?' Labour MP Steve Rotheram (Liverpool Walton) told The Times: 'How insensitive does somebody have to be to write that load of drivel? 'It is unbelievable. To mention other tragedies simply because they are football-related, as if there is some common denominator because they happened in football stadiums, beggars belief. 'Was there a conspiracy after the Bradford fire? 'Did the government try to blame the Bradford City fans for setting fire to the stadium on purpose? 'It shows how people right at the top of the Establishment still harbour prejudice and ignorance.' Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, told the newspaper: 'He ought to be ashamed of himself.' Angry Liverpool fans also took to Twitter to condemn the former judge. Brian Durand said: 'Sir Oliver Popplewell, you are a pompous self-centred, attention seeking oaf. A knight of the realm? Says it all about this country.' Tragedy: A policeman enters the pitch at the Hillsborough stadium to tell the referee to stop the match as the 1989 tragedy unfolds during the FA Cup game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest . Flash fire: 56 supporters died when the blaze swept through the Valley Parade stand at Bradford City's ground . David Cameron today told MPs there 'were regrets' over the 1989 Conservative government's handling of the Hillsborough disaster. Speaking . at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, he repeated his pledge to . release official documents detailing the tragedy at Sheffield . Wednesday's football stadium. Mr . Cameron said: 'We are gong to open up those papers and publish those . papers as we promised, so people can see what was happening.' He . said the Taylor Inquiry launched in the aftermath of the tragedy was a 'proper and thorough investigation' which led to huge changes in the way . football grounds and crowds are managed. But . Labour MP Steve Rotheram, who led Monday's Commons debate on the release . of Government papers, urged the Prime Minister to admit governments had . made mistakes over the tragedy. Concern has focused on briefings given to then prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet. Mr Rotheram (Liverpool Walton) added: 'Twenty-two years is 22 years too long to fight for the truth. 'If . it's proven that there was an orchestrated cover-up, despite two decades . passing, justice should still prevail and those really responsible for . the Hillsborough disaster should be brought to book.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:44 PM on 19th October 2011 . Pacific islanders have denied claims that a missing German tourist was eaten by cannibals after insisting: 'We prefer hot dogs to people'. Fears that German traveller Stefan Ramin had been cooked and devoured erupted after his charred remains were found on a campfire on the French Polynesian island of Nuku Hiva. The horrific discovery was made last week by police hunting for 40-year-old Ramin and local hunter Henri Haiti after they failed to return from a jungle expedition. World tour: Stefan Rami and Heike Dorsch at one of the idyllic locations they visited before the horrific episode . Dental records sent from Germany proved the teeth found in the fire belonged to Mr Ramin. Germany's Bild said: 'It is the suspicion of the authorities that the hunter carved his victim up, ate parts of the body and burned the remainder along with animals cadavers. He is regarded as a cannibal.' The island's prosecutor Jose Thorel said a hunt was now underway for 31-year-old Haiti on suspicion he had killed Mr Ramin. But he insisted reports that Haiti had also eaten his victim were wrong. Mr Thorel added: 'The theory of cannibalism is in no way a part of our investigation.' Wanted: Guide Henri Haiti is still missing and soldiers are helping police hunt for him . Although locals described their shock at the island being linked to cannibalism, a picture of Haiti revealed that he sports a tattoo of a Kaioi warrior on his left shoulder. According to a German tattoo expert, the tattoo is of a Kaioi warrior in a canoe. The Kaioi are said to have eaten their victims. Cannibal expert Dr Gundolf Kruger said: 'Polynesians are now Christian and literate, therefore pious and educated. But it is entirely possible that the criminal was led by old rituals into this crime.' Journalist Alex Du Prel on the neighbouring island of Tahiti said locals were shocked at claims Mr Ramin had been eaten. He wrote in his Nouvelles de Tahiti newspaper: 'Trust me, we'd rather eat hot dogs than humans around here. 'These tales of flesh-craving islanders are totally invented. 'Believe me, French civilisation has taught these people to eat cheeseburgers and canned food, not people. And the wild pigs we breed here are far tastier.' Mr Ramin had been sailing around the world with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, for three years when they stopped on Nuku Hiva on September 16. The day he disappeared he had gone with his guide Haiti to hunt goats. Ms Dorsch said Haiti later returned to their boat without Ramin and tried to convince her to come into the jungle, saying her boyfriend had been injured. When she refused, she claimed he tied her to a tree and tried to sexually assault her. She escaped and raised the alarm but Haiti had fled, police said. The hunter is said to have 'an unrivalled knowledge' of the densely forested terrain and would 'probably find it easy' to elude his pursuers, officials said. The 40-year-old from the small town of Haselau in north-west Germany was on a round-the-world trip with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, when they anchored off the coast of the Polynesian island on September 16. He went off on a goat hunt with Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - and never returned. It was only on Wednesday last week that the human remains were found. Among the embers were bones including a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings. The German traveller is feared to have been eaten during his visit to French Polynesia . Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'. A family friend said: 'It is a tragedy that a man with such a zest for life should have his days ended in such a brutal fashion.' He bought his catamaran Baju in Turkey and had planned to spend the next two years island hopping in the South Pacific. Mr Ramin and Miss Heike began their travels in 2008 and dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva last month . On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'. Last month, they dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva, largest of the Marquesas islands, which over the centuries have featured in many reports of cannibalism. Deborah Kimitete, deputy mayor of Nuku Hiva, told local news website Les Nouvelles: 'No one can believe what has happened. This has never happened here before, this is the first time, it's horrible.' It was not clear whether Miss Dorsch is still on the island or whether she has returned home to Germany. Nuku Hiva has a population of just over 2,000 and featured in the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick.

Al-Qaeda inspired Al-Shabab unleashed near simultaneous suicide bombings at public venues in Kampala in July 2010 as crowds gathered to watch the World Cup final on TV, killing 76 people. The militant group said the attack was in retaliation for Uganda's deploying troops to Mogadishu as part of an African Union peacekeeping force. Hundreds of Kenyan troops poured into Somalia over the weekend following the kidnappings of four Europeans inside Kenya near the Somali border. Kenyan officials say the country has the right to defend itself from Somalia's most powerful militant group, though Rage denied the group had anything to do with the kidnappings. ‘We say to Kenya: “Did you consider the consequences of the invasion?” We know fighting more than you and defeated other invaders before,’ Rage said. Formidable: Al-Shabab fighters display weapons as they conduct military exercises in northern Mogadishu, Somalia (file picture) ‘Your attack to us means your skyscrapers will be destroyed, your tourism will disappear. We shall inflict on you the same damage you inflicted on us. You have to see what happened to the other aggressors, like (Uganda President Yoweri) Museveni and his country when they invaded us. We hit them in their country,’ Rage said. Rage said that Kenyan troops had pushed 60 miles (100 kilometres) across the Kenya-Somalia border. A Kenyan military spokesman, Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir, declined Monday to say how many Kenyan troops have moved into Somalia. ‘We have sufficient forces,’ he said. Chirchir said that five Kenyan troops died when a helicopter crashed in a Kenyan town near the border late Sunday. The deaths were the first confirmed casualties of the military push. Residents in Somalia say fighter jets and helicopters have been flying overhead since the weekend. Witnesses in the Somali town of Dhobley today said an estimated 40 Kenyan military vehicles entered the town on Sunday. Ali Abdullahi, a resident in Dhobley, said the army vehicles were towing what he described as ‘big guns’. Escape: Mogadishu residents with their belongings piled on donkey carts and vehicles flee from Huluwa district in southern Mogadishu to avoid the fighting . No large-scale fighting has yet broken out, the residents said. Kenyan officials on Saturday said they would send troops into Somalia. That declaration came two days after armed militants kidnapped two Spanish aid workers with the group Doctors Without Borders from the Dadaab refugee camp in northeast Kenya, a sprawling expanse of temporary homes where almost 500,000 Somalis live. On October 1, Somali gunmen took a wheelchair-bound Frenchwoman from her home near the resort town of Lamu. Somalis also abducted British woman Judith Tebbutt, 56, and murdered husband David, 58, while they were staying at the Kenyan coastal resort of Kiwaya in September. Kenya's push east into Somalia will open another front that Somali militants must contend with. African Union forces from Uganda and Burundi have expanded their control of Mogadishu in recent months and have almost completely forced al-Shabab out of the capital.","'Your attack to us means your skyscrapers will be destroyed,' warns Al-Shabab .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 5:36 PM on 17th October 2011 . A figure skater discovered a deadly brain tumour the size of a tennis ball after falling on the ice. Lisa Armitage, 30, from Grimsby suffered a concussion when she fell during a practice session and was rushed to hospital. Following brain and MRI scans doctors spotted the mass in her head which, although not . malignant would have eventually killed her. Dancing on ice: Lisa Armitage, 30, was saved after a skating accident revealed she had a brain tumour the size of a tennis ball, doctors are now ensuring it doesn't grow or alter . She was diagnosed  with an extremely rare central neurocytoma -  a type of nervous system tumor  - and operated on nine days later at Hull Royal Infirmary. Specialists say the growth was nothing . to do with her fall last July and it could have started developing . at birth. Lisa, who works as a finance manager and has been figure skating for three years, said: 'Its unbelievable that I had such a large tumour and had no symptoms, without the fall I wouldn't have known about it. Discovery: A brain scan revealed the tumour which is highlighted here in the white shaded area . 'It was falling on the ice that helped this tumour get discovered and ultimately saved my life.' She was discharged after a majority of mass had been . removed and she had received radiation therapy at Sheffield Royal Hallamshire hospital. The therapy, also known as gamma knife . surgery, is non-invasive and involves a high dose of radiation delivered to a very small area of the brain to kill the tumour, preventing damage to normal tissue, nerves and blood vessels. As the growth, is . attached to the wall of Lisa's brain, doctors cannot remove it in fear of damaging her sight or other brain functions. Still smiling: Lisa says she feels lucky . Instead they are ensuring that the growth - which is now the size of a small strawberry - doesn't grow or . alter. Lisa, who now has regular brain scans, added: 'My outlook has changed. Before I used to be so focused, but now I am just grateful to be doing the thing I love. 'I look back to the fall and I'm so glad it happened. The tumour . would have grown more if it wasn't treated and it would've affected my . vision. 'If it had not been detected when it was, it could have been too late and I could have died.' Lisa, who finally finished her treatment in May this year, has . decided to postpone her marriage to fiancé and skating coach Mark Wood, 25, until further tests next year determine if more treatment is needed. She is hoping to compete in figure skating . competitions and was back on the ice just five . months after the accident. She said: 'My skating is no where near the level it . was before my accident, so I have to work a lot harder, but that's ok. 'I used to practice four or five times a week, but now I just go twice a week for a couple of hours. The slow growing grade two tumour, is so rare it accounts for less . than one per cent of all brain tumours. Brain tumours can affect people of any age and around 4,500 new cases are reported in the UK each year. Symptoms depend on size but if the mass causes increased pressure on the brain they can include epilepsy or fits, severe headaches, irritability, vomiting and partial loss of vision or hearing.",Lisa wasn't showing any symptoms as a result of the brain growth .
"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 8:53 AM on 20th October 2011 . Killed: Northampton University student Nabila Nanfuka died in the nightclub . A university student was killed in a nightclub stampede as revellers were told their coaches home were about to leave without them. Nabila Nanfuka, 22, is believed  to have suffered a heart attack after being crushed on a landing area halfway down a staircase as bodies piled on top of her. Two others were critically injured in the tragedy, which happened at an ‘urban music’ night attended by students from all over the country. Yesterday there were claims that the event at the Lava & Ignite club in Northampton was overcrowded and tickets had been oversold. The stampede followed an announcement that students had ‘ten minutes to get on the coaches or they will go without you’ at around 3.30am yesterday. A fire alarm was then also triggered, which caused the crowd surge to escalate further. One 19-year-old who passed out in the crush said that when she regained consciousness, she saw the lifeless body of a woman trapped under other fallen clubbers. The student, who travelled to the ‘Wickedestwickedest’ event from London, said: ‘People were pushing, pushing, pushing to get out. A lot of us just couldn’t breathe. ‘I ended up on my front, trying to find a gap to breathe through, but there were so many people on top of me. ‘Every time somebody was pulled out of the pile of bodies, more people fell forward on top of us. It was awful. I thought I was going to die. ‘I’m sure I passed out for a few minutes. When I came around, I saw a girl’s body below me, to my left. ‘Her eyes were closed and she had people lying on top of her. Everybody else was trying to move or screaming, but she was motionless.’ The event was attended by students from universities as far away as Canterbury, as well as others across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Birmingham and the East Midlands. Promising: Northampton University student Nabila Nanfuka died in the crush, which also injured two others . Grief: Friends of Nabila Nanfuka comfort each other at the scene of where she died in the early hours of this morning . Distraught: Mourners gather outside the nightclub to pay their respects and lay flowers in memory of the student . Students paid £15 for a ticket to the event, which included coach travel. But some of those attending alleged . that although the event was a sell-out in advance, extra tickets were . sold on the door, pushing the attendance well above the venue’s 1,300 . capacity. By 1am, it was so busy staff were said to be turning away even those who already had tickets. One clubber claimed as many as 2,000 people may have been inside by the end. Miss Nanfuka, from Neasden, North-West London, was in the third year of a leisure and tourism degree at Northampton University.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 8:34 PM on 18th October 2011 . Beaten to death: Father-of-two James Tierney . Two drunken youths who beat an innocent father-of-two to death - simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time - have been jailed for 15 and 12 years. James Tierney had taken a shortcut home from his girlfriend's flat when he was cornered by hooded thugs Dale Duncan and Aisar Khan. The pair challenged the 41-year-old to a fight and, when he refused, launched a savage beating. They repeatedly hit Mr Tierney over the head with a piece of drainpipe which had been ripped from a nearby wall and, as their victim begged for mercy, they stamped on his face before he slipped into unconsciousness and they left him to die. Mr Tierney, a tyre fitter, suffered multiple broken bones in his face, a broken voicebox and a brain haemorrhage. He was pronounced dead later in hospital. Tests revealed it was most likely that the brain haemorrhage that killed him, but doctors said he could also have been a heart attack induced by having his voicebox crushed, or he may have drowned in his own blood. Khan and Duncan were today convicted of murder and jailed for life. Khan must serve a minimum 15 years whilst Duncan will serve 12 years before being considered for parole. Mr Justice Alan Wilkie told them: 'You both attacked this man despite him pleading to go home. You pursued him and cornered him and attacked him with whatever came to hand and beat him to death. 'Your victim was vulnerable, he was alone in the streets at 5am and in no state to prevent an attack from two fired up, young men like you.' The tragedy occurred last April after Mr Tierney had been visiting his girlfriend, Tracy Johnson, in the Farnworth area of Bolton, Greater Manchester. He was taking a shortcut home at 5am when he accidentally bumped into Khan and Duncan who had been drinking at a nearby late night house party. Jailed: Dale Duncan (left) and Aisar Khan were given life sentences for the murder of Mr Tierney . It is believed Mr Tierney has asked to be let past but the hoodies were said to have 'taken offence' at his request and launched a vicious attack. One neighbour woken up by the noise, looked out of his bedroom window to see Duncan rip a drainpipe from the wall of a house and then use both hands to swing it repeatedly at Mr Tierney as he pleaded for mercy, shouting 'I want to go home'. Damian Bentley, 22, told Manchester Crown Court: 'I opened the window as he was ripping the drainpipe off the wall because I was trying to stop him from ripping it off our property. 'I banged on it once to try and stop him, but he ignored me. The drainpipe broke in half as he ripped it off the wall. He then brandished it as a weapon and started swinging it. 'He tried to swing it as hard as he could to make as much impact as possible. The victim was shielding himself with his arms over his head, trying to stop the drainpipe from hitting him.' The jury heard that patterned bruises on Mr Tierney's face matched the sole of Duncan's trainers. His head was stamped on at least four times and he was also hit with an unknown rod-like object as well as the drainpipe. He suffered 25 injuries in total to his face, head and neck. Death scene: The sport where James Tierney was attacked by two drunken yobs . Khan and Duncan were arrested later. Khan intially said he was so drunk he had no recollection of the attack. But in court he claimed in the run up to the attack he had spent the afternoon drinking and playing arcade games at the Trafford Centre before meeting Duncan then going partying with friends. He blamed Duncan for starting the attack on Mr Tierney and also claimed the victim had racially abused him and tried to punch him. Duncan said he only stamped on Mr Tierney's face because Khan had told him to 'do him in'. He said: 'Aisar punched him, then he fell on the floor. Aisar punched him while he was on the floor, and stamped on him. On his face. 'Aisar told me to come and do him in. I went and copied what he did. Because Aisar told me to. I was scared because of what me and Aisar had done.' Duncan, of Bolton Road, Farnworth who was said to have the literacy and numeracy skills of a six to eight-year-old pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but not guilty to murder. Khan, of Devon Street, Farnworth, pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter. In a statement Mr Tierney's sister Maureen Cassidy said: 'I am aware of when I see someone who resembles James and then all the same thoughts keep rushing back. 'This is having a massive impact on my own life. They took the life of a father from his two children. They are both devastated by the loss of their dad.' Sharon Stone, mother of Mr Tierney's children - Bradley, now aged 18 and Elise, 16 - said: 'His presence would put smiles on the children's faces, they craved their father constantly. 'Now the children are very scared and angry with the people who have done this to him. They do not understand why this had happened. They were unable to hold their fathers hand for the last time. 'I found the funeral extremely upsetting because these children have had their father stolen from them. Having to prepare your children for their father's funeral is awful but having to prepare them for their father's murder trial is something no mother should have to do.'","Dale Duncan and Aisar Khan hit father-of-two with drain pipe .

"By . Richard Pendlebury and Arthur Martin . Last updated at 4:45 PM on 20th October 2011 . It is a haunting scene which could have come straight from a Hollywood film set - a lone female protester stands clutching a crucifix against a desolate backdrop of burning caravans and smouldering embers. But the carefully-crafted image at Dale Farm is not all that it seems – far from it. For the woman in the picture is not even one of the travellers who had vowed to ‘fight to the death’ for their homes. Despite this, she has made it onto the front pages of the majority of national newspapers. Not even a traveller: Minty Challis holds aloft a crucifix at the Dale Farm site amid the burning rubble. She's a regular at the site for three years in the lead up to the eviction at the illegal camp . She is actually an agitprop activist who . hurries to join anarchist groups wherever they are gathered. Yesterday . 45-year-old Minty Challis was at Britain’s biggest illegal travellers’ site likening the plight of its inhabitants to the suffering of the . Palestinians in Gaza. Her devotion to the cause is plain for all to see - indeed her zealous belief in trying to save the site from the bailiffs is so strong that it has brought her into conflict with her fellow activists. During meetings around the camp fire in the weeks before the final showdown, she would often interrupt a speaker to insist her point was heard. Darkness and flames: Riot police stand in front of the floodlit scaffold entrance to the illegal site A silhouetted image of Minty, who also calls herself Minty Hussein, against a backdrop of smoke and fire . ‘We love her desire to help the travellers, but sometimes we need a break from her because she can be a pain in the neck,’ said one protester. Miss Challis’s activism was borne out of a troubled childhood characterised not by idealism but by violence. Growing up on the streets of Notting Hill in West London in the 1970s, raised by a mother and stepfathers, she joined one of the capital’s first girl gangs, called The Wall. At 13, she was ‘locked up’ in a Government assessment centre for two years and then lived on the streets for another eight years. After moving to Catford in south-east London, she became an active member of the anarchist group Reclaim the Streets, which campaigns against globalisation by holding impromptu parties on major roads to cause disruption. A face of anger: Minty emerges from a tatty caravan waving her cross. She has also alienated fellow protesters with her outspoken and misguided views . Clashes: A traveller, and unlink Minty a full-time Dale Farm resident, turns on her heels as police enter the site yesterday. Right, one of Minty's crowd is pulled down from the scaffolding at the entrance to the site . Miss Challis, whose real name is believed to be Donna Berry, then turned her attention to trying to stop child abuse and gang culture. She regularly appears in her local paper trying to drum up support for her latest campaign and has spoken at numerous demonstrations. The activist’s three current campaign groups are the ‘Anti Child Abuse Liberation Front’, the ‘South London Ceasefire Crew’ and the ‘Stop the Killing Crew’. Her recent internet posts reveal the extent of her anti-capitalist and anarchist credentials. In one post she wrote: ‘Are you ready for the revolution’. And when she became aware of the issues surrounding Dale Farm, Miss Challis was quick to get on board. The professional activist, who also calls herself Minty Militant Charmer Challis, first started visiting Europe’s largest traveller site three years ago. She claims she is directly related to some of the travellers on Dale Farm. During interviews yesterday, Miss Challis was keen to describe the suffering of the travellers. ‘There is a lot of police brutality going on,’ she declared. She claimed a woman traveller’s back had been broken by the police when they stormed the compound. Officials said the woman had in fact been admitted to hospital with minor spinal discomfort.","Other Dale Farm protestors claim she is a 'pain in the neck'

"Jackson's private doctor criticised for lack of vital hospital equipment . Singer's mother Katherine Jackson seen shaking her head in public gallery . By . David Gardner . Last updated at 9:29 AM on 20th October 2011 . A simple medical technique could have prevented the death of Michael Jackson, a leading anaesthesiologist told jurors today. Doctor Steven Shafer said lifting the chin of a patient under anaesthetic  to clear the airwaves should be the first thing a doctor tries to revive someone who has stopped breathing. The jury in the trial of Dr Conrad Murray, Jackson's private doctor, was also shown a dramatic video . re-enacting how the singer stopped breathing after taking a deadly . cocktail of drugs to help him sleep. World expert: Anaesthesiologist Dr Steven Shafer demonstrates how the sedative Propofol is extracted with a syringe during Dr Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial in Los Angeles . Dr Shafer, an Ivy League professor, told . Los Angeles Superior Court that Murray didn't try the life-saving . technique after Jackson stopped breathing on June 25, 2009 at his home. Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Dr Shafer said: 'The most likely thing that happened was that his airways were obstructed. Michael Jackson was trying to breath but his tongue got stuck in the back of his throat. 'A simple chin lift or the use of an instrument to move the tongue may well have been all that was needed to save his life.' Prosecutors claimed that Murray returned to the singer's bedroom after going to the toilet for two minutes to find his famous patient had stopped breathing and immediately began CPR. The Columbia University professor listed a series of 'egregious' violations in the care of the singer,  including the failure to have a machine with an alarm to check Jackson's pulse. Professional opinion: Dr Shafer, an Ivy League professor, criticised Jackson's private doctor Dr Murray for the lack of equipment at the home of the singer and failure to use basic life-saving techniques . Dr Shafer, a world expert in Propofol, said he was giving evidence for free at the trial because he wanted to defend the reputation of other doctors . If Murray had the appropriate machine 'it would have saved Michael Jackson's life'. Dr . Shafer said: 'Michael Jackson died because he stopped breathing - that . is expected when you administer intravenous sedatives. You just have to . open the airways so oxygen can get through.' He also told the court there was no evidence that Jackson was advised not to eat or drink anything for eight or nine hours before being given the powerful sedative Propofol. Dr Shafer, a world expert on Propofol, added: 'He was not at average risk, he was at greatly increased risk of vomiting and having it go back into his lungs.' He criticised Murray for having no suction equipment in Jackson's bedroom, telling the jury that the smallest amount of vomit in the lungs could prove fatal. The lack of an infusion pump to control the administration of Propofol could have also have caused a lethal overdose. On trial: Dr Conrad Murray listens to Dr Shafer's comments at Los Angeles Superior Court . The jury was shown a re-enactment of how the singer stopped breathing after taking a cocktail of drugs. The . film showed an actor suffering a cardiac arrest after being . administered with Propofol, the powerful hospital anaesthetic blamed for . Jackson's death. Life-saving techniques were demonstrated including CPR . and attempts to ventilate the lungs. Some of the more shocking elements were cut from the film following complaints from Dr Murray's defence lawyers. Tragic: Michael Jackson died at his home on June 25, 2009 after taking a cocktail of drugs . The mock collapse in the video ends with the patient being saved by doctors. In the public gallery, Jackson's mother Katherine, could be seen shaking her head as she saw how efficiently the doctors in the video worked to revive their patient with the proper equipment and a team of staff. Prosecutors screened the video to show the jury how Propofol is administered in a hospital setting. Defence lawyer Ed Chernoff objected . to the screening, claiming it was a 'terrifying dramatisation of someone . suffering a cardiac arrest'. He said it was being shown to try to . inflame the jury. He . was overruled by Judge Michael Pastor, who nevertheless agreed to censor . some of the more powerful scenes, including some in slow motion, saying . they were irrelevant. The . silent video was taken inside an operating theatre. An anaesthesiologist is shown administering Propofol. Prosecutors have accused Murray, 58, . of being woefully unprepared when he administered Propofol to Jackson to . treat the 50-year-old performer's chronic insomnia. Experts . have accused Murray of delaying too long before calling for help after . discovering Jackson had stopped breathing and not having vital equipment . on standby. The video, 'An Overview of the Safe . Administration of Propofol', was shown during the testimony of the . prosecution's final witness, top anaesthesiologist Dr Steven Shafer. Dr Shafer made the video and gave a running commentary on how the patient should be treated in an appropriate hospital setting. He insisted all the steps and equipment should be used 'every time for every patient - no exception'. Dr Shafer added that he was giving evidence for free because he was worried that the reputation of other doctors and anaesthesiologists would be tarnished by the trial. He said: 'Every day I am asked, ''Are you going to give me the drug that killed Michael Jackson?''' 'Propofol is an outstanding drug. I want people to know that when people are given this drug by people who know what they are doing it is safe.' The trial continues.","Jackson's private doctor criticised for lack of vital hospital equipment .

A burglar freed from jail because his five children would suffer if he remained behind bars has been accused of assault within a month of his release. Wayne Bishop, of Clifton, Nottingham, hit the national headlines when he won his appeal against an eight-month prison sentence for burglary and dangerous driving in May. When he was released on May 27, after serving a month of his sentence, he told how he was overjoyed to be reunited with his children. Overjoyed: Wayne Bishop was pleased to be reunited with his children, pictured, after winning his appeal in May. His lawyers argued he needed to care for them . But Bishop is then alleged to have assaulted a man called David Parsons on June 19 in Broxtowe, Nottingham. Robert Wheelhouse, 39, of Clifton, Nottingham, is also accused of taking part in the alleged assault. They are charged with assault by beating, and are due to stand trial at Nottingham magistrates on Monday. The trial was adjourned to November 15 so that a witness could be contacted and asked to attend. Bishop and Wheelhouse both deny the offences. If found guilty they could be jailed for six months. Accused: Brandon Bishop, seven, hugs his father Wayne with his brothers and sisters earlier this year. Mr Bishop is now alleged to have assaulted a man . Both were bailed on the condition they did not contact Mr Parsons. As he left court Bishop, 33, declined to comment. After his release in May Bishop said: 'A prison officer came up to me and said 'pack your bags you're going home'. I was jumping up and down in my cell when I heard the news. 'I couldn't believe it, words can't describe how happy I am. I'm free and I'm overjoyed. I never thought they would accept my appeal.' Bishop said at the time he could understand his release being unpopular with most of the public, but people needed to recognise the stresses of being a single parent. 'I can understand what they are saying. But it was the first time I've committed a burglary. It was a commercial burglary, I've got sympathy for my victims, and I haven't denied it,' he said. Jailed: Mr Bishop's eight-month prison sentence handed down at Nottingham Crown Court, pictured, was for driving dangerously after a burglary at Mansfield Rugby Club . 'I can see how it's going to get a good and a bad reaction. But all those people giving it a bad reaction need to think about single parents. 'I hope this ruling goes some way to helping others who find themselves in my situation.' Bishop's legal team argued in the Court of Appeal in London that he needed to care for his children, aged five to 13, and not enough consideration had been given to this when he was originally sentenced. They said that Bishop's imprisonment went against Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention which enshrines the right to respect for family life. Judges decided his sentence should be suspended and he was tagged and given a 10pm curfew. His eight-month prison sentence was for driving a van dangerously after a burglary at Mansfield Rugby Club in which chocolate was stolen. While he was in jail the children were looked after by his former-partner, who has joint care of the children, and his sister. Appeal judge Mr Justice Maddison warned after Bishop was originally freed: 'It is important that criminals should not think that children can provide some sort of licence to commit criminal offences with impunity.'",Wayne Bishop was freed in May after serving a month of his eight-month sentence .

Two pensioners have come forward after police released a CCTV image of a man suspected of stealing but who is the spitting image of them. Bernard Place, 80, and Edmund Britton, 76, both did a double take after seeing the picture of the suspect wanted by North Yorkshire Police printed in their local newspaper. Both Mr Britton and Mr Place fear those who know them may think they are involved. And they want to make it clear that they are not responsible for the alleged crime. Mr Britton, 76, said that he was 'embarrassed' over the doppleganger image. He said: 'The first I saw of it was when I spotted my picture in the paper yesterday. 'It's embarrassing, everyone was telling me that they couldn't believe how similar the person in the paper is to me.' Their doppelganger is suspected to have bought items from B&Q in Northallerton on October 4 and then returned to the store later that day, taking the same items from the shelves and using the receipt from the first purchase to obtain a refund. Police issued a CCTV image to the press and appealed for information. But as soon as the photo was published the two local OAPs spotted the similarity. Mr Britton, of Darlington, County Durham, said: 'It looks identical to me. The clothes on the man look identical to what I would wear, the glasses look very much the same. It is me to a T.' He said he was concerned that people who knew him would believe he may have been involved in the crime. Mr Britton, who used to a run a family business, Heats Parts, in Darlington, now run by his daughter, added: 'If any of my customers see this in the newspaper they will think it is me. Double take: Bernard Place, 80, left, and Edmund Britton, . 76, right, both did a double take after seeing the picture of the suspect . wanted by North Yorkshire Police printed in their local newspaper . He added: 'I'm a well known face around the area because of my business, so a lot of customers know me. 'That was really concerning for me - not only could it have been so embarrassing, but I was worried about the business. 'I contacted the paper as soon as I saw it and the police. The police seemed slightly interested but nobody seems to have done anything about it as yet. 'I don't know what's going to happen with it now, but I'd like it sorting before more people start ringing me up about it.' The suspect is believed to have bought items from B&Q in .

Mr Place, also from Darlington, said: 'I did a double take when I saw it. It looks exactly like me. 'I showed the wife, and she said: 'It's you,' It's a bit worrying really.

It has survived two world wars, but anti-capitalist activists who have set up camp outside St Paul's Cathedral could force it to shuts its doors to the public for the first time in living memory. On the 379th anniversary of the birth of Sir Christopher Wren, . the cathedral's architect, church authorities . revealed the house of worship may have to close because of growing . concerns over the safety of worshippers and tourists. The cathedral did not even shut its doors during the Second World War and became a symbol of British resistance during the Blitz. The makeshift camp was inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York which led to other demonstrations all over the world. Demonstration: The Occupy London Stock Exchange protest is causing a 'risk to the life of the cathedral', cathedral officials have warned . Open on a reduced basis: The cathedral - one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions - has already had to close the restaurant and gift shop . Protest: Demonstrators have set up camp in the square outside St Paul's Cathedral, promising to occupy the site indefinitely . So unusual is the potential closure that . not even staff at St Paul's were able to confirm if or when it had happened before, when asked by MailOnline. Numbers of protestors who have set up camp as part of the Occupy London Stock Exchange demonstration have been growing since the makeshift protest camp was set up on Saturday. Church authorities have denied asking protestors to move on from the courtyard, but their ongoing presence has been described as causing a 'risk to the life of the cathedral', a spokesman said. The cathedral - one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions - has already had to close the restaurant and gift shop and the number of visitors has fallen since protesters' arrival on Saturday. St Paul's has been supportive of the Occupy movement, however in a statement released by the cathedral, a spokesman said: 'St Paul's Cathedral stated . on Monday that it was still trying to provide worship and welcome to all . in spite of the presence of the protest camp in the churchyard. 'St . Paul's asked everyone to respect this need and to acknowledge the risk . to the life of the cathedral posed by the current situation. The . cathedral has managed so far to remain open on a reduced basis. Iconic: This image of St Paul's during the Blitz has become a symbol of survival... but the house of worship could face temporary closure due to the growing number of protestors . 'The . increased scale and nature of the protest camp is such that to act . safely and responsibly the cathedral must now review the extent to which . it can remain open for the many thousands coming this week as . worshippers, visitors and in school parties. 'Is it now time for the protest camp to leave? The consequences of a decision to close St Paul's cannot be taken lightly.' A . few days ago Rev Dr Giles Fraser, Canon Chancellor of St Paul's .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:41 PM on 20th October 2011 . Planners who wrongly allowed a millionaire to build an enormous beach hut on Britain's World Heritage Coast have been officially rebuked. Council officials merely rubber-stamped businessman Simon Saunders' application to demolish a timber chalet he had bought for £235,000 on the Jurassic Coast and replace it. Blundering staff only realised that the new hut was twice the size of the original, dwarfing its neighbours, when it was half built and residents in West Bexington, Dorset, complained. 'Monstrosity': Bungling council planners gave millionaire Simon Saunders planning permission to build a beach hut that is twice the size of its neighbours on Dorset's Jurassic Coast . Even then nothing could be done about the 'monstrosity' because it had been given planning permission. Now the Local Government Ombudsman, Dr Jane Martin, has found West Dorset District Council guilty of maladministration causing injustice. The council will have to write letters of apology to all those who complained about its decision. It must also fork out £3,000 on 'countryside projects' in the area to make amends for the blunder. 'By the book': Simon Saunders said no objections were received when he applied for planning permission but that he found the council 'shambolic' The ombudsman said: 'The council failed to spot gross error in plans for a replacement beach chalet at West Bexington. 'Its failure to recognise the true extent of the proposed development at the planning stage has resulted in a building which is incongruous in its setting on the Heritage Coastline and within the designated area of outstanding natural beauty. 'The principal injustice for the complainants is a wider sense of public outrage at the building now permitted in this area.' Mr Saunders, who owns the Ariel Motor Company which makes the Atom sports car, bought the 1930s chalet in 2007 and submitted plans to demolish it and build a new hut. The new chalet is 26ft by 24ft and is made out of oak and red cedar wood. It has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, sitting room and storage cupboard, running water and drainage. John Aldred, 55, who lives in a bungalow nearby and complained about the chalet, feels the council has been let off lightly. He said: 'It just does not fit in and has completely destroyed the integrity of a lovely little row of chalets. 'I . have heard people visiting saying they have come to see this unusual . hut - it seems as if this once desolate piece of heritage coastline is . now viewed as a bit of a joke.' Mr Saunders said he was not surprised the council had been crticised by . the ombudsman as he found them 'shambolic' to deal with. Dwarfing its neighbours: Planners only realised Simon Saunders' chalet was twice the size of the original when it was half-built, and it was already too late . 'Gross Error': West Dorset Council has been officially rapped by Ombudsman Dr Jane Martin after Mr Saunders was wrongly allowed to go ahead and build the oversized chalet . He said he submitted his planning application for the chalet in good faith and it received no objections from anyone at the time. 'When we put the application in it was all done by the book,' he said. 'We even called the council to see if they wanted to discuss it but they weren't interested. It was approved with no objections locally. 'If people did have objections to it they should have raised them at the time. It was halfway through building the chalet that a guy started to complain and the council came out to measure it and they found it built to plan. 'It has been built 100 per cent to plan, if anything it is slightly undersized. 'We spend a lot of time down there and often pick up litter from the coastal path and the beach. Hopefully the council can spend the £3,000 on cleaning the area up.'","Ombudsman says officials failed to spot 'gross error' in application .

Disgraced former New York Mets baseball star Lenny Dykstra is facing up to four years in jail after pleading guilty to car theft charges. The one-time World Series hero, 48, . pleaded no contest in Los Angeles Superior Court yesterday following . what prosecutors describe as a scheme to lease cars using false business . and credit information. Dykstra had originally faced 25 charges, including three counts of possession of a controlled substance, but the remainder of the case is set to be dismissed at sentencing under a plea deal struck yesterday. Prosecutors said Dykstra and two associates ran a scheme to lease high-end cars from dealers using fraudulent information, while claiming credit using a false business called Home Free Systems. In addition to three counts of grand theft auto, he pleaded no contest to one count of filing false financial statements. Although Dykstra and his associates were rejected at two dealerships,  they drove off with three cars from another business. Long career: Dykstra spent more than a decade in the major leagues and helped the Mets win the World Series in 1986 . Dykstra's accountant, Robert Hymers, pleaded no contest earlier this year to a charge of identity theft in connection with his role in the scheme . Also, Dykstra's friend Christopher Gavanis pleaded no contest to a charge of filing a false financial statement. Hymers and Gavanis have not yet been sentenced. Dykstra originally faced 25 criminal counts, including three counts of possession of a controlled substance, due to the alleged discovery of cocaine, Ecstasy and a synthetic growth hormone during a police search of his Los Angeles home. Those charges were punishable by up to 12 years in prison. But Los Angeles prosecutors said on Wednesday the remainder of the case would be dismissed at sentencing under his plea deal. Dykstra still faces two additional, unrelated criminal prosecutions. An indictment returned by a federal grand jury in May accuses him of stealing or destroying some $400,000 in property that was part of his bankruptcy case. In August, he was charged in Los Angeles with exposing himself to a string of women who answered online employment advertisements he posted. Dykstra, who bought a Ventura County mansion once owned by hockey star Wayne Gretzky, filed for bankruptcy two years ago, claiming he owed more than $31 million and had only $50,000 in assets. Dykstra, pictured in a Californian court in June, also faced drug possession charges which are now set to be dismissed . In May, Mr Dykstra was investigated for lewd conduct by the LAPD after a woman complained that he allegedly invited her to his California mansion to apply for a housekeeper position, only to take all his clothes off and demand a massage. The unnamed 47 year old claimed she answered a Craigslist advert. She claims when she arrived at the house, thought to be his $18.5million Californian mansion, he told her she would be required to give him massages as well as clean. Glittering career: Lenny Dykstra famously scored a key lead-off home run against the Boston Red Sox in October 1986 . He then allegedly took all his . clothes off and told her he couldn't hire her until he had tried out her . massaging skills, a police source told TMZ. Nicknamed . 'Nails' during his baseball career, Dykstra spent more than a decade in . the Major Leagues, mostly as an outfielder for the Mets and . Philadelphia Phillies.

"By . David Derbyshire . Last updated at 4:16 PM on 17th October 2011 . Cleaning up: Gels first appeared in British bathrooms in the Seventies. Today some 200million bottles are sold in Britain every year . Whoever invented shower gel must lie awake at night — no doubt in a gold-plated, four-poster bed — chuckling at the audacity of it all. Here is a product that is expensive, packed full of man-made chemicals, difficult to use and wasteful. And yet, thanks to the persuasive power of marketing, bottles of it sit proudly in almost every bathroom in the land. Once, we cleaned ourselves with bars of long-lasting soap that cost the equivalent of a few pence a week. Today, more than eight out of ten people wash themselves with gels costing up to £4 a bottle. Not that shower gel manufacturers admit they are involved in the business of washing, of course. Instead, they sell their wares as revitalising foams, honey shower milks and rebalancing body experiences. Imperial Leather’s Japanese Spa Foam Burst is, it claims, designed to help you wake up in the morning. Palmolive’s Absolute Relax is supposed to send you to sleep. You will struggle to find a shower gel that admits what it is really intended for: as a way of removing dirt, sweat and grease. Long gone are the days of explicit adverts for Lifebuoy — the soap that said ‘No to BO’. But if Britain has gone crazy for shower gel, with an estimated 200 million bottles sold in the UK each year, there are signs of rebellion. Former Tory MP, television presenter and newspaper columnist Matthew Parris recently went on the offensive. In a passionate attack against pointless toiletries, he highlighted the design flaws of shower gels. Gels have come a long way since PZ Cussons, the makers of Imperial Leather for a long time regarded as the traditional hard soap for middle-class families . He pointed out that most of the bottles . don’t stand upright on curved soap dishes, or they leak when hanging . from their plastic hooks. They are difficult to open, easy to spill and . hard to apply (how do you use shower gel to wash your feet?) And most of the gel squirted into the user’s hands slides to the floor to be washed down the drain. Parris — who stopped using shampoo years ago and who claims his hair has never been cleaner — estimates that millions of gallons of gel are washed away unused every year. Despite these flaws, Britain’s love affair with shower gel is going strong. Tesco, at last count, had 94 brands on sale, each with its own name, ingredients and unique smell. Most sane people would struggle to come up with 94 different conventional fragrances for toiletries. But the clever people at Unilever and Cussons have got round that by persuading consumers that what they really want to smell like is food: thus we can wash ourselves with Chocolate and Mint shower gel, Milk and Honey shower creme, or Cranberry and Honey shower scrubs. Evidently, gels have come a long way since PZ Cussons, the makers of Imperial Leather — for a long time regarded as the traditional hard soap for middle-class families — introduced its first ‘Luxury Shower Gel’ in 1978. Former Tory MP Matthew Parris recently highlighted the design flaws of shower gels . Gels were, in part, a response to a change in bathroom habits that saw showers growing in popularity as our lives became busier and we all became more aware of the need to use water sparingly. But the rise of shower gels can’t be explained simply by the move from the twice-weekly bath to the daily shower. After all, showers had already become a staple of homes by the Seventies, and for at least a decade after that, most people were happy with soap — or occasionally the more exotic ‘soap on a rope’. The secret of their success lies in . the fact that while they are cheap to manufacture, they are easy to . brand as a luxury. By selling them as modern, convenient and indulgent, . cosmetic companies cleaned up. While . the secret of soap-making goes back to at least the Ancient Babylonians . in 2800 BC, when animal fat was mixed with the ashes of wood fires and . melted, the first liquid soap — the forerunner of today’s shower gels — . was patented in 1865. Modern gels are more complicated to make. But their basic ingredient, a detergent that sticks to grease and water, is similar to the detergent in hard soap bars. In order to remain thick, perfumed and coloured, a typical shower gel must contain around 20 chemicals, some man-made, others derived from plants. It will have a couple of plant-based detergents, an array of perfumes, salt to thicken it, glycerine — a clear, sticky liquid used in cough mixtures and icing on cakes — to make the gel silky, film-forming agents, lactic acid (found in sour milk to counteract the alkali and make it pH- neutral), preservatives, agents that reduce static in human hair and natural plant extracts. Most of these plant extracts have very little practical purpose and are just for marketing purposes so that the gels can have fancy names. And marketing is what it is all about. From the earliest days of industrially produced soap, manufacturers realised that to sell more soap, they needed to persuade Britons to become more ‘hygienic’: the more people washed, the bigger the profits. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that some of the earliest and most successful advertising campaigns were for soaps. Costly: Today, more than eight out of ten people wash themselves with gels costing up to £4 a bottle . The English company Lever Brothers created Lifebuoy in 1895 and sold it as an antiseptic soap. The company also invented the term BO for body odour. Pears devised a sophisticated transparent soap and launched the yearly search for Miss Pears. Yet no marketing campaign for soap was enough to fend off the advance of shower gels. Those who prefer gels say they are happy to put up with the extra expense for the sake of convenience: unlike soap, they don’t leave scum or mess around the shower, and small amounts go a long way. But for many, they are a victory of marketing over common sense. One of the UK’s top marketing gurus, who has worked with many gel manufacturers, said: ‘Most of the differences between brands are trivial in terms of what they do functionally — removing dirt and grease. ‘But the real difference — and this is the genius of marketing — is how those small differences, like the fragrance and the associations that come with that fragrance, can be used to create something more than the product. ‘That value to the brand is real. If a product has associations of being refreshing in the morning or relaxing in the evening, it can be a genuine bonus for the consumer; it might help people feel relaxed or refreshed. ‘Some of that association is intrinsic in the ingredients of gel, but much of it is created through advertising.’ So are we being taken for a ride by the marketing types? The answer is probably yes. But then, how many of us would really want to go back to using half a bar of soap in the shower when we could be reaching for a bottle of that oh-so fragrant Japanese Spa Foam Burst?","Eight out of ten people wash themselves with gels costing up to £4 a bottle .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 11:18 AM on 4th October 2011 . It had to end sometime and sadly, the record-breaking autumn heatwave is expected to finish abruptly today, with temperatures plummeting and strong winds ripping across northern regions. The mercury has already begun to drop across the UK and the weather will become even cooler and more unsettled as the week progresses, say forecasters. Yesterday Britain basked in temperatures as high as 28C - recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire - but by the end of the week it will be down to 14C - a normal autumn day. Blustery beach: The temperatures have already plummeted in Scotland, as this picture of Portobello Beach, Edinburgh shows . Goodbye sunshine: A stunning and colourful scene in Backley Plain in the New Forest as the sun sets on our Indian summer . Last of summer: The London Eye silhouetted against the setting sun on the last day of record-breaking weather . And meteorologists warn that it is time to put away the sun cream as we're not going to see the sort of sunshine we've experienced in the past week again until next year. The change in weather conditions has already reached the west coast of Scotland which has been hit by wind and rain. The end of the heatwave and this week's cooler weather will lead to an explosion across the UK of wild mushrooms. Experts are predicting a bumper crop because of the combination of the hot, dry spring, the cool, damp summer, the unexpected early autumn heat, and the coming rain. They have created ideal conditions and mushroom hunters are expected to descend on meadows and commons across the country. In Surrey's Mole Valley, fungi expert Ray Tantram is leading expeditions looking for edible mushrooms but she warned that 'beginners should beware' of poisonous varieties. Those conditions could escalate as Hurricane Ophelia heads across the Atlantic and towards the British Isles. The tail-end of the hurricane - currently affecting North America - is due to hit Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England by mid-week. Today the weather is likely to be comfortable but tomorrow rain will cover much of Scotland and Northern Ireland before moving south across the rest of the UK. Billy Payne, a forecaster with . MeteoGroup, said: 'It is looking cooler and more unsettled from today . with a lot of cloud over southern England and and a few spots of rain . especially in the west. 'The north will have some blustery showers and it will be quite windy with local gales in the northern isles. Temperatures in some places will drop by as much as 10C, but London could still see highs of 20C.' Hurricane Ophelia is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain by the end of the week . The trajectory of Ophelia shows that it could hit the UK some time on Thursday night . Much of the UK will see showers by Thursday, with longer spells of rain, continuing strong winds and some thunderstorms across western Scotland and north-west England. Parts of Scotland could even be hit by frost, with temperatures of just 3C or 4C expected on Friday night. Mr Payne added: 'It is now very unlikely that we will see the temperatures we have had over the past week until early summer next year.' The UK's hottest day of 2011 was June 27 when a temperature of 33.3C was recorded at the Olympic Park in London. All the leaves are brown: And the skies are soon to be grey as more seasonal weather moves in . Warmly remembered: These scenes on Bournemouth beach over the weekend won't be seen again until next summer . Despite the unseasonal sunshine, trees have begun to change colour and South West Trains has said it will operate a 'leaf fall' timetable until December 10 on some routes. Some services will depart a few minutes early, meaning they have a longer journey to take account of problems the train might encounter. Leaves on the rails are crushed by passing trains, forming a slippery film which makes it harder for trains to accelerate away from stations and meaning drivers have to approach station stops more slowly than normal. Network Rail runs special rail-cleaning trains but these can only reduce and not completely eliminate the problem, South West Trains said on its website.

The 49-year-old New Jersey Governor confirmed his decision at a press conference today, after weeks of speculation that he might reverse his long-held stance of staying out of the 2012 race. 'This is not the time to leave unfinished business,' Governor Christie said. 'The stakes are too high. New Jersey - whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me'. Not running: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie confirmed his decision at a press conference today, after weeks of speculation that he might reverse his long-held stance of staying out of the 2012 race . His decision will prompt a sigh of . relief from GOP presidential frontrunners Texas Governor Rick Perry and . former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, as well as President Barack . Obama. 'Over the last few weeks I've thought long and hard about this decision,' he said. 'I’ve explored the options and listened to so many people... but now is not my time.' Governor Christie said he is proud of all he has accomplished in New Jersey, but there is 'plenty more to do' and he is 'not prepared to walk away'. 'It just didn't feel right to me to leave,' he added. However he took the chance as the nation watched his speech to hit out at Barack Obama, saying the President has 'failed the leadership test' and that 'there's no substitute for knowing how to lead'. Many Republican donors, fans and luminaries are unhappy with the current crop of contenders to challenge President Obama and saw Governor Christie as the strongest challenge they had. But Governor Christie’s decision to stay out of the race means that three months before voting is set to begin, the Republican race remains focused on Mr Romney and Governor Perry. Popular: Many Republican donors, fans and luminaries are unhappy with the current crop of contenders to challenge President Obama and saw Governor Christie as the strongest challenge they had . Friends: Governor Christie enjoyed the support of former first lady Nancy Reagan and many other GOP figures . His decision was finally confirmed at . the New Jersey statehouse on Tuesday afternoon, but it was revealed . beforehand by sources who spoke anonymously to avoid pre-empting his . announcement. 'This is not the time to leave unfinished business. The stakes are too high. New Jersey - whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie . Governor . Christie, the famously blunt, budget-cutting governor in office not even . two years, had spent the past few days reconsidering his long-time . refusals to run for the presidential nomination. He stoked the speculation with a high-profile speech last week at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, California, where he reiterated that he wasn't running for president. He also held a tour to help raise money for Republicans in Missouri, California and Louisiana. Encouragement from high-profile figures such as Henry Kissinger, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush led him to reconsider a bid and he spent the weekend thinking over his options. Competitors: Governor Christie's decision will prompt a sigh of relief from GOP presidential frontrunners Texas Governor Rick Perry, right, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, left . Political Rivals: Many Republicans saw Governor Christie as their best chance of a defeat for President Obama . Governor Christie's announcement comes . as a new poll shows Governor Perry's support dropping and businessman . Herman Cain rising following a much-praised debate performance. The Washington Post-ABC survey shows Mr Romney regaining the lead, though his support remains in the same place it's been for months - the mid-20s. The push for new candidates and the quick rise and fall of others such as Donald Trump, who also flirted with a presidential bid, reflect continued discomfort in the GOP with Mr Romney. The former Massachusetts Governor has been steadily campaigning since he lost in the 2008 primary but hasn't been able to sway sceptical conservatives who make up the party base. 'With the field clarified and the two front-runners either frozen or sinking, Herman Cain has a unique opportunity that six months ago, no pundit, professional or politician would have given him.'Douglas Schoen, Fox News . 'Christie’s decision not to run for the Republican presidential nomination is hardly a surprise. That a few dreamers thought his candidacy a possibility at all says more about their dissatisfaction with the current field of candidates than anything else.'Konrad Yakabuski, Globe and Mail . 'Christie would have been a potent fundraiser with strong support on Wall Street. His potential candidacy had complicated the money-raising efforts of both Romney and Perry. Now that he’s decided, the other candidates will redouble their efforts.'Richard Dunham, Houston Chronicle .

Blackberry today announced it is offering free apps worth £63 to appease customers hit by its three-day global blackout. Research in Motion, the Canadian company behind the phones, attracted widespread anger after millions around the world were unable to access email, surf the web or use the BlackBerry Messenger service. Many vented their fury on Twitter and other social networking sites. The problems began last Monday and services were only fully restored by Thursday. RIM said the selection of . premium apps will be offered as 'an expression of . appreciation for their patience' during the disruptions. The apps will be available on the BlackBerry App World from Wednesday October 19 until December 31. The move to repair the damage to its reputation comes as a survey last week revealed that one in five BlackBerry users were considering switching to another supplier following the problems. Even BlackBerry's 'core' business - providing secure email and messaging to business - seems to be under threat. Financial institutions such as Morgan . Stanley and the Royal Bank of Scotland are reportedly trialling iPhones . and iPads within their management teams. BlackBerry has posted a partial list of the apps it is to offer. They include: .

Meanwhile, . 42 per cent said they would consider changing later and eight per cent . said they had already bought a new mobile phone. Research among another 3,000 people found that seven out of 10 who were . planning to get a BlackBerry in the future admitted they would need some . reassurance from the manufacturer as they would be put off by last week's problems.

"By . James Tozer . Last updated at 11:46 PM on 18th October 2011 . A judge had to leave court while his anger subsided before sentencing a teenage mother who repeatedly beat her baby son and left him severely disabled. Kayleigh Searle, 19, had slammed three-month-old Thomas against a door, dropped him into his Moses basket and was even thought to have stamped on his head. She initially blamed her sex offender boyfriend for the horrifying abuse which left her baby with brain damage, but later admitted she was responsible, blaming the ‘stresses’ of being a mother. Anger: Kayleigh Searle was jailed for eight years for the savage attack on her baby son by Judge Anthony Russell, right, who said the offence angered him so greatly he was forced to spend 15 minutes composing himself before sentencing . After the catalogue of assaults were . detailed to Judge Anthony Russell QC, he took the unusual step of . revealing he needed to take a short break to avoid sentencing her in . anger. Following a 15-minute adjournment, he returned to court to condemn the . teenager as ‘heartless and remorseless’ and reject her claim that she . had struggled to cope. ‘Thomas’s present plight is so distressing that I . felt it necessary to adjourn for some time after hearing the case to . make sure that I was not sentencing you in anger, for to do so would . have been wrong,’ he told her. Jailing her for eight years, he went on: ‘It is almost unimaginable that . a mother could have inflicted such injuries on her own child, and . furthermore shown no remorse at all. At Preston Crown Court, pictured, Judge Anthony Russell QC said Searle lacked 'basic humanity' Jailed: Reece Bourne, 19, was sent to a young offenders institution for three years after earlier pleading guilty to child cruelty . ‘Your conduct throughout the inquiry and the case have shown you to be . completely heartless. You appear to lack even the basic humanity.’ Searle inflicted a series of injuries on Thomas at their Blackpool home, . slamming his head against a door, shaking him and slapping him on the . back of the head when he began crying. The baby was taken to hospital last February with a fractured skull, bleeding to the brain and a broken collarbone. Now almost one year old and being cared for in a hospice, he has . irreparable brain damage, is blind and suffers considerable pain and . frequent severe spasms. College student Searle initially blamed the . injuries on ex-boyfriend Reece Bourne. As he had been convicted of . offences against two teenage girls, she had signed an agreement with . social services to keep the 18-year-old away from Thomas. But unbeknown to even her own parents, who lived next door, she let him . share responsibility for Thomas after deceiving him into believing he . was the father, the court heard. However he stood by and did nothing as . Searle repeatedly beat her child. After Thomas was taken to hospital last February, Searle claimed Bourne . had shaken and ‘belted’ the baby. Bourne was arrested and held in . custody for a day, but Searle later admitted she was to blame. Searle pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, child cruelty and perverting the course of justice. Defending, Paul Humphries told Preston Crown Court she had ‘tried her . best’ but was ‘young and inadequate’. But Judge Russell told Searle: ‘I . don’t think you cared for him at all.’ Bourne, now 19, of Warton,  Lancashire, was sent to a young offenders . institution for three  years after earlier pleading guilty to child . cruelty.","Kayleigh Searle slammed her son's head against a door and threw him into a Moses basket .

"By . Chris Johnson . Last updated at 10:15 AM on 20th October 2011 . A tearful Lindsay Lohan was led away from court in handcuffs and taken into custody today after a judge blasted her for violating probation. The troubled actress, 25, had her probation revoked pending a November 2 hearing after Judge Stephanie Sautner slammed her for failing to complete time at the Downtown Women's Centre. The Mean Girls star is now understood to have been released after posting $100,000 and will not spend time behind bars - for now, at least. Welling up: Lindsay Lohan appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom today where a judge revoked her probation and ordered her into custody . Cuffed: Lohan was led away in handcuffs and taken into custody after the hearing. It is likely she will post bail and be released by the end of the day . Booked: This photo was taken after she was taken into custody . The outcome is pending the November hearing, which was scheduled by the judge today, where the court will hear further testimonies before deciding on the course of action. Lindsay was formally arrested in court today and taken into custody after Sautner revoked her probation. On her booking sheet, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department accidentally listed her sex as male, and detailed how she weighed 116lbs. Sautner said Linsday should serve 16 . hours at the morgue on clean-up duty between now and her next court . hearing in an attempt to mitigate the current situation. The actress had been sentenced to 360 hours community service earlier this . year as part of her punishment for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery . store. During the hearing, Sautner asserted Lohan had managed to wilfully get herself kicked off the programme by cancelling . on the women's centre nine times. Faces of pain: Lindsay was her usually-animated self during today's hearing . Making an impression: Lohan arrived to court in an eggshell blue dress and gold peep-toe heels, teamed with a Chanel handbag, but was sporting rather heavy-handed make-up . Lohan welled up as her lawyer Shawn Holley Chapman fought her corner, pointing to the 'glowing report' by the Probation Service. But despite Lohan completing some . volunteer work this week at the Red Cross, the judge ruled it as void . because it was not part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier . hearing. She says Lohan should have gone to the . morgue for clean-up duty to complete some of the hours of community . service instead - which was the second part of the probation Sautner had . originally stipulated. 'Nobody has the power to change my sentence,' said an incredulous Sautner. Frenzy: . The actress was greeted by an army of photographers as she arrived at . the Los Angeles Superior Court West District Airport Courthouse . Fighting her corner: She was represented by her lawyer Shawn Holley Chapman . Packing punch after punch, an unimpressed Sautner told Lindsay: 'Probation is a gift as I see it. There is something called looking a gift horse in the mouth.' Sautner was also perplexed as to why the Probation Service had given Lohan such a positive report. She said her work this week at the . Red Cross would not count towards the 60 days of community service Lohan . has been ordered to complete. Sautner also estimated that Lindsay . has only managed to fulfil three days out of the 60 so far, also . taking into account the time taken to complete a shoplifters course. She noted that Lindsay had been a . no-show at the women's centre nine times and had only managed to do . around a day-and-a-half there. In the spotligh: Teams of paparazzi and TV camera crews were on hand to capture the actress's arrival and departure . Back home: Lindsay returns to her Venice Beach home in California after a dramatic day . Sautner suggested it was Lohan's . inability to keep to schedule and disruption of the programme that . eventually left women's centre with no option but to cancel her role there. The star pulled up to the courthouse at 9.55am for the 10am hearing at the Airport Branch Courthouse. Dressed in an eggshell blue dress and white scarf, the actress was also sporting rather heavy handed make-up. She had her hair tied back in a ponytail and stepped out of her black Cadillac Escalade to a barrage of flashbulbs. The Mean Girls actress has also served 35 days under house arrest this year as part of her sentence for the necklace theft. Pulling no punches: Judge Stephanie Sautner revoked Lohan's probation pending a hearing . Arrest: Lohan's sex is incorrectly listed as 'male' on her booking sheet processed today following her court appearance . The actress' once promising movie career has been derailed by multiple trips to jail and rehab since 2007. The judge dismissed Lohan's lawyer Holley's argument that the actress had to go abroad to work, where she has been seen partying over recent weeks in Europe. 'She is supposed to be an actress from what I hear,' Sautner said. Holley admitted that 'unfortunately' Lohan's career opportunity are not in America right now and that she has been to Europe to earn money to support herself and her family. But Sautner was more concerned about the logistics of how Lohan had attended weekly appointments with her U.S.-based shrink, which was part of the terms of her probation. While the psychological report said she had attended every week, Sautner was doubtful, pointing to the time frames of Lindsay's flights between various European destinations. Judge Sautner was sceptical about the glowing report written about Lindsay by the Probation Service.  In the . documents, the actress' probation officer says her psychotherapist . believes she is 'doing really well, she is making changes, and is trying . to become more disciplined in her actions' and that she is 'turning her . life around'.  The report also says she has been going to therapy every . week, which the judge disputed because of Lohan's travels overseas. The . report details how Lohan said the women's shelter community service was not 'fulfilling' - which was also slammed by the judge . Troubled: Lohan and her bail bondsman will now have to deal with the paperwork to get her released from custody . Familiar scene: An outside view of the Airport Courthouse in Los Angeles where Lohan attended today . Lindsay Lohan was given a leave of absence from her shoplifting course to have emergency dental work done. It came just two days after her red carpet appearance in Los Angeles where she displayed shockingly discoloured teeth. The actress's probation report detailed various dates of her excused absences from probation, including October 14 for a trip to the dentist. 'Ms. Lohan has not been absent to any regularly scheduled activities, . except the session scheduled for her on Friday, October 14, 2011 due to . her need to seek dental work,' the report stated. 'Client presented evidence of attending her dentist office. As a result her absence was excused.' Lohan now has her Hollywood smile back in place after having her teeth fixed.

Distraction: Halle Berry as she appears in Catwoman and the reason a passenger ferry captain's mind was not on his job, says a report . A British ferry crashed into a French fishing boat killing its skipper because the crew were discussing how 'sexy' Halle Berry looked in the movie Catwoman. The French fishing vessel was sliced in . two by the force of the collision in thick fog between St . Helier in Jersey and St Malo, France, on March 28 this year. A damning report into the crash has revealed that the 56-year-old French captain of the high-speed Condor Vitesse catamaran joked with colleagues about the Hollywood actress as the passenger vessel travelled across the channel at full speed in poor visibility. The investigation also disclosed that the captain and crew failed to spot the boat on two separate radar screens. And French marine accident investigators also discovered that the ferry's fog horn had been turned off because it was thought that the sound of the vessel's engines would be enough to warn craft in the surrounding area. A . transcript of the conversation on the bridge . of the Condor Vitesse showed that crew had no idea that danger was imminent. Minutes . before the fatal impact with the whelk fishing boat Les Marquises, the . ferry's unnamed master said to colleagues: 'Yesterday evening I watched . Catwoman on the TV. I'm an idiot because after that I slept very badly.' The first officer replied: 'Catwoman?' The master said: 'She was jumping from everywhere like a cat. She is very beautiful. She was wearing sexy outfit.' The conversation turned went on to talk about drug testing and how long various substances remained in the body. They only learned there was a problem when a leak alarm on the ferry went off. The . 30ft boat was broken in two in the collision, sending her three crew . into the water. Her captain Philippe Claude Lesaulnier, 42, was killed. The master then announced to the 194 passengers on board: 'Your attention please, this is an announcement from the bridge, we have collided a foreign body in the water, perhaps a little piece of wood or a pot buoy, we'll investigate and we'll inform you.' A passenger, however, had seen the collision from the deck and informed the crew that he thought they'd collided with a fishing boat. Ship wrecked: The French whelk fishing boat Les Marquises was torn in two as the Condor Vitesse travelled at top speed in thick fog between St Helier, Jersey, and . St Malo, France, earlier this year . Shattered: Skipper Philippe Claude Lesaulnier perished when his boat was rammed by the British based passenger ferry . The report by the French investigation body BEAmer, found the ferry was travelling at 37 knots, almost top speed for the vessel, and had not strengthened look-outs in the fog. The report stated: 'In the wheelhouse almost continuous talking without any link to the watch-keeping, maintained an atmosphere not compatible with the necessary concentration to conduct a high speed craft in the fog.' Poor visibility: The 40 mile stretch of sea between St. Helier, Jersey, and Saint Malo, France, was shrouded in thick fog the day of the collision . It added: 'This behaviour, as well as the visibility contributed to the accident. 'When Condor Vitesse approached the Minquiers waters, both officers did not detect two vessel echoes ahead on starboard, the first was a ship that would be passing a hundred metres on starboard, the second was Les Marquises.' In its findings the report also explained what happened in the final moments on the fishing boat before the collision. Out of the fog one of the deck hands 'suddenly heard an engine noise very close' and alerted his colleague who shouted at the skipper 'Full astern, full astern'. The same deckhand watched in horror as the massive ferry appeared quickly from the fog on a collision course with the wheelhouse of the smaller boat. Simon Edsell, managing director of Condor Ferries, based in Poole, Dorset, said: 'Condor Ferries welcomes the publication of the BEAmer report into this this tragic accident.' He said the master and first officer had been relieved of their duties following the crash and that other investigations were continuing. Collision: The Condor Vitesse sliced through the small whelk fishing boat in thick fog during a crossing between St. Helier in Jersey and St Malo in France last March, killing its skipper.","Captain said Hollywood star was 'jumping everywhere like a cat' in a 'sexy outfit' moments before the fatal collision in thick fog off Jersey .

Iran's intelligence chief said on Thursday there are holes in the U.S. allegations that Iranian agents plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and dismissed the American claims as a 'foolish plot' nobody will believe. Two men, including an alleged member of Iran's special foreign actions unit known as the Quds Force, have been charged in New York federal court with conspiring to kill the Saudi diplomat, Adel Al-Jubeir. Tehran has strongly denied any link to the alleged plot, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has accused Washington of using the case to divert attention from its economic woes and the Occupy Wall Street protest movement. Plot: Manssor Arbabsiar (left) is accused of a terror plot to murder Saudi ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir (right) On Thursday, Iran's intelligence . minister, Heidar Moslehi, dismissed the American allegations, saying no . professional intelligence agency would issue orders to an agent in a . foreign country over the phone or transfer money to drug cartels through . a New York bank. 'When you probe the allegations from . an intelligence perspective, you find major contradictions and . shortcomings and you can't believe a government like the U.S.... has . ended up in a situation where it designs a foolish plot,' he said on . state TV. The Iranian government has denied any . connection to Manssor Arbabsiar, the man arrested in the alleged plot, . and derided the claims, saying U.S. officials have offered no proof. 'Which court of law can accept such absurd claims as evidence?' Moslehi asked. Detained: Arbabsiar appearing before Judge Michael Dolinger and United States Assistant US Attorney Glen Kopp during his arraignment in New York . Appearance: These court sketches show Magistrate . Judge Michael Dolinger (left) presiding over the arraignment of Manssor . Arbabsiar (right) at Manhattan federal court . Arbabsiar is a 56-year-old naturalized . U.S. citizen who also had an Iranian passport. In May 2011, the . criminal complaint says, he approached someone he believed to be a . member of the vicious Mexican narco-terror group, Los Zetas, for help . with an attack on Al-Jubeir. The man he approached turned out to be an . informant for U.S. drug agents, it says. The U.S. government charges that . Arbabsiar had been told by his cousin Abdul Reza Shahlai, a high-ranking . member of the Quds Force, to recruit a drug trafficker because drug . gangs have a reputation for assassinations. Moslehi said Arbabsiar, based on the . U.S. judge's bill, made a telephone call to the alleged Quds force . member from an FBI office after his arrest and the Americans' claim they . eavesdropped the conversation. Suspect: Alleged terror plotter Manssor Arbabsiar's home in Round Rock, Texas . Accused: The home of terror plot suspect Manssor Arbabsiar in Round Rock, Texas . 'What intelligence agency or officer . will direct an agent stationed in a rival's territory by telephone? Or . orders an assassination on the phone? Or assigns the restaurant - the . venue of the planned assassination - and bargains over the price on the . phone?' he asked. Moslehi said even the weakest . intelligence agencies in the world wouldn't hire a man with Arbabsiar . background let alone assign him to an operation on U.S. soil. The intelligence minister alleged . instead that Arbabsiar, who acquired U.S. citizenship eight months ago, . likely agreed to cooperate with American intelligence agencies in return . for his residency permit. Moslehi said Iran doesn't need to resort to such terror plots and that Tehran would not benefit from killing a Saudi diplomat. Target: The plot would have also attacked the Israel embassy, pictured here, in Washington D.C. Watched: The terror plot involved bombing the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C., seen here, after assassinating the ambassador . Moslehi claimed that Iran's security . services have notched successes in an ongoing intelligence battle with . the U.S., and said Washington now wants to tarnish Iran's image by . attributing a 'clumsy' plot to Tehran. He cited Iran's success in the arrest . last year of Abdulmalik Rigi, leader of the Sunni militant group . Jundallah. Jundallah, which has claimed responsibility for bombings that . have killed dozens in recent years, was behind an insurgency in Iran's . southeast near the border with Pakistan. Rigi was arrested alive by Iran's . intelligence agents when he was flying over the Persian Gulf en route . from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan. He was later tried and executed. May 24: Arbabsiar first meets someone posing as an associate of a drug trafficking cartel in Mexico, who was actually a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant codenamed CS-1. Arbabsiar asked about the informant's knowledge of explosives and explained he was interested in attacking a Saudi embassy. June 2: Arbabsiar returned to Mexico and held more meetings with the informant in late June and early July. He allegedly said his associates in Iran had discussed a number of 'violent missions' including the murder of the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Adel Al-Jubeir. July 14: Arbabsiar meets CS-1 again, they discuss plot details - how four men and a payment of $1.5 million are needed. July 17: The pair meet again in Mexico.

A former Colorado school board member who was arrested last month for sexting a young boy has been arrested again for carrying on a sexual relationship with another teen. Authorities reportedly learned of a 2008 sexual affair between Stefanie Dickinson, 37, and the victim, who said he used to babysit her kids. The arrests have stunned parents at the school district where she serves . as school board treasurer in the Ellicott District in . Colorado Springs. New charge: Stefanie Dickinson posed for a new mugshot yesterday, left, after she her arrest a month ago for allegedly sending sexually explicit texts, right . The victim came forward to police last week. An affidavit obtained by TheDenverChannel.com said the victim told deputies that he had sexual contact with Dickinson at least five times when he was 17 years old. Charges: An affidavit said the male victim told deputies he had sexual contact with Dickinson five times when he was 17 . Now 20, the victim also reportedly told authorities that the two would have sex in her children’s ‘clubhouse’ and in her car. The victim also accused Ms Dickinson of sending him sexually charged texts and photos. The married mother of two was charged with sexual assault of a minor. Mrs Dickinson was arrested last month after she allegedly 'sexted' one of her teenage son's friends. She allegedly sent the sexually explicit messages to the 14-year-old boy after he joined her family on a weekend camping trip. She is alleged to have offered to have sex with the teen telling him in one text: 'Baby, I will rock your f****** world!' Police . said Dickinson asked for the teen's cell number so she could send him . photographs from their weekend trip to Lake Meredith.

An arrest warrant revealed that she sent the boy a message saying she wanted to sneak out of the house to meet him. Twice charged: Stefanie Dickinson stood before a Colorado judge for the second time in a month after another young victim came forward . A deputy later found a text message on the boy’s phone from Dickinson that read 'I just want u,' the warrant said. Another text message sent from Dickinson talked about having sex, followed by 'Baby I will rock ur effing world!! Haha.' The text messages were discovered by . the boy’s sister, who became suspicious about the relationship after she . saw Dickinson talking to her brother and repeatedly hugging him . The arrest report said Dickinson would hug the boy after football practice and was heard telling him:'I'll text you later.'

Perhaps they’re listening to Jamie Foxx's ‘Blame It (On the Alcohol)’, ‘Pass the Courvoisier’ by Busta Rhymes, or a bit of J-Kwon’s ‘Tipsy’. U.S. teenagers are hearing about 34 references to alcohol brand names in music daily - and a study says it’s mostly down to rap, R&B and hip-hop. This could be increasing youth alcohol addiction by encouraging young people to start drinking as children and carrying on as they get older. Drink references: Researchers claim youth alcohol addiction is being encouraged because of the lyrics of rappers such as Jamie Foxx, left, and Busta Rhymes . Researchers have slammed the ‘luxury lifestyle characterised by degrading sexual activity, wealth, partying, violence and the use of drugs’. An Addiction journal study said alcohol companies ‘retroactively reward’ artists with sponsorships when songs featuring their brands perform well. Many brands in lyrics are those favoured by underage female drinkers, the study by Pittsburgh and Dartmouth universities said, reported ABC. Alcohol is often referred to positively, with the brands associated with wealth 63 per cent of the time and sex 59 per cent.

It wasn't just the bespectacled director's legendary humour that first attracted the Oscar-winning actress, but his 'great body'. While Allen has never been known for his athletic prowess, Keaton, 65, describes him in her upcoming memoir as 'physically very graceful'. 'Great body': Diane Keaton, pictured with then-lover Woody Allen on the set of 1977's Annie Hall, has revealed that it was his physical build that attracted her . She writes in Then Again: 'It was his manner that got me, . his way of gesturing, his hands, his coughing and looking down in a . self-deprecating way while he told jokes. 'He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful.' The couple met in 1968 while working together on Allen's stage comedy Play It Again, . Sam - roles they re-enacted for the 1972 film version. They were together for a decade before splitting up in the late 1970s after building a body of work including the classics Sleeper, Love And Death, Annie Hall and Manhattan. Keaton said that she began to fall in love with Allen, now 75, during rehearsals for Play It Again, Sam when she realised that his real-life persona was the same as the divorced neurotic he was playing. She writes: 'How could I not? I was in love with . him before I knew him. 'He was Woody Allen. Our entire family used to . gather around the TV set and watch him on Johnny Carson. He was so hip, . with his thick glasses and cool suits.' Keaton and Allen were together for a decade before splitting up in the late 1970s after building a body of work including the classics Sleeper, Love And Death, Annie Hall and Manhattan . Friends forever: Keaton and Allen watch a basketball game with his then-girlfriend, now his wife, Soon Yi Previn in 1994 . Unsurprisingly, she reveals that it was her neurotic tendencies that attracted Allen to her. She writes: 'Woody got used to me. He couldn't help himself; he loved neurotic girls. 'We shared a love of torturing each . other with our failures. His insights into my character were dead-on and . hilarious. This bond remains the core of our friendship and, for me, . love.' She even describes herself as 'his endearing oaf [while] I had him pegged as a cross between a White Thing and the cockroach you couldn't kill.' And, like scenes out of Annie Hall, . Manhattan and so many other Allen comedies, the couple watched art-house . films such as Ingmar Bergman's Persona, checked out German . Expressionist art on Madison Avenue and visited a Diane Arbus exhibit at . the Museum of Modern Art. Autobiography: Then Again is published next month by Random House . In what for Allen must have been a sign of true love, he even recommended an analyst. Much of Keaton's book centres on her close relationship with her mother, Dorothy Hall, and Then Again includes excerpts from family journals and letters. In one journal entry, Keaton's mother remembers seeing a screening in 1977 of Annie Hall, which was based in part on Allen's relationship with Keaton, whose birth name is Diane Hall. 'Annie's camera in hand, her gum chewing, her lack of confidence; pure Diane. The story was tender, funny, and sad. It ended in separation, just like real life,' writes Dorothy Hall, who died in 2008. Keaton's previous boyfriends have included Al Pacino and Warren Beatty. Then Again is published next month and is excerpted in the November issue of Vogue.",Oscar-winning actress talks about her relationship with Allen in new autobiography .
"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 2:35 PM on 20th October 2011 . Illegal immigrants in the U.S. are being sent home in record numbers, with those who pose a public safety risk or national security threat being deported first, the homeland security secretary said last night. Janet Napolitano defended the Obama administration's new policy of deciding which illegal immigrants to remove from the country first. The government is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants, she said. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the Obama administration's new policy of deciding which illegal immigrants to remove first . The new priority system is a shift from the Bush administration's enforcement strategy, Mrs Napolitano said in a speech at American University in Washington, D.C. Republicans say making it a priority to deport those immigrants amounts to a back-door way of granting amnesty to other people who are living in the U.S. illegally but haven't committed crimes. Yet to immigration advocates, the administration is still deporting such illegal immigrants. Mrs Napolitano said policies inherited from the Bush administration 'allowed as many resources, if not more, to be spent tracking down and deporting the college student as were spent on apprehending criminal aliens and gang members.' Authorities would conduct large raids at companies without consistently punishing the employer or targeting individuals who posed a threat. 'Public safety wasn't enhanced by . these raids, and they sometimes required hundreds of agents and . thousands of hours to complete,' she said. Now, . she said, the Department of Homeland Security is using fingerprints . collected from those held in local jails to identify and deport . criminals and repeat immigration violators. On the move: Mexicans are the largest group of . illegal immigrants in the US and numbered 6.5million, or 58 per cent of . the total across the nation, in 2010 . Advocates for an immigration overhaul say this program, known as Secure Communities, has resulted in the deportation of people accused of traffic violations or other similarly low-level offences. Several states have said they don't want to participate, arguing that immigration is a federal, not state, responsibility. Mrs Napolitano denied that the program had led to more annual deportations and didn't give police immigration authority. She did acknowledge missteps. For example, participation at first was thought to be voluntary, but department officials later made it mandatory. Under fire: Republicans have criticised the Obama administration's overall approach to enforcement . She said: 'But as flawed as the beginnings of this program were, it has already helped accomplish a great deal toward ensuring that we use our enforcement resources where they do the most good.' She also said the administration was committed to comprehensive immigration changes. Congressional Republicans have said the government must first secure the border before discussions can turn to an overhaul and have criticised the Obama administration's overall approach to enforcement. Neither side was satisfied with yesterday's speech. Republican Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the administration's immigration policies don't make sense. 'There is nothing smart about it - seven million illegal immigrants work in the U.S. while 14million Americans are unemployed,' he said in a statement. 'Work site enforcement activities are down 70 per cent. The Obama administration has abandoned work site enforcement, allowing illegal workers to take jobs that should go to American workers.' Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-immigrant National Immigration Forum, said the government needs to move faster in fulfilling promises to target criminals and others who pose a safety threat. He said: 'Fast, sound implementation of the department's deportation prioritisation is needed now. In this time of scarce dollars and budget crisis, our government should not waste billions on haphazard and unfocused enforcement.' Homeland Security officials have been promoting the criminal targeting effort since Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials announced the arrests of nearly 3,000 criminal illegal immigrants in week-long, nationwide sweep last week. Those people will now face deportation proceedings.","Government is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said ."
"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 10:17 AM on 21st October 2011 . Film 'star': Marilyn Mantle, 64, was approached in a charity shop to play the role of a corpse alongside A-list actors . A retired woman was handed a part in a Hollywood film alongside A-list stars - playing a drowned corpse. Marilyn Mantle, 64, was in a charity shop in Portmadoc, Wales, when a man approached her and told her she would be perfect for the role. Her enthusiasm was not dampened when she discovered she would be playing a dead body washed up in a rock pool. She played the corpse in Retreat alongside Mission Impossible II's Cillian Murphy, actress Thandie Newton and Billy Elliott's Jamie Bell. A few days after being approached, the retired civil servant was taken to lunch by film director Carl Tibbetts. Ms Mantle said: 'I wasn't sure how to react to being told you would make an ideal dead body. 'It was all very surreal - and I have to admit assumed the whole thing was a practical joke. 'But . I went with it and had the most amazing time. I've not seen the film . yet, but it will be interesting to see what it looks like. 'I . suspect my role will largely be a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment but . it's not every day this happens so you've just got to go with it when . these opportunities come along. 'My role largely involved lying completely still and half-submerged in a rock pool while I was covered in a plastic sheet.' The scene was filmed on Tudweiliog beach, north-west Wales in October last year. Although not the most glamourous of roles, Marilyn was whisked away for a shopping spree with the film's designer, who has worked with top stars like Kylie Minogue. Film debut: Marilyn, a retried civil servant, plays dead in new film Retreat which was out last week . Before filming, Marilyn even shared Thandie Newton's trailer, where she was given a pre-performance hair and make-up session. The tense thriller sees Cillian Murphy and Thandie Newton play a couple making a return to a secluded island to heal emotional wounds. Their CB radio, which is their only means of contacting the mainland goes dead, and then they encounter a sinister stranger played by Jamie Bell, who has a terrifying story to tell. The film was released in British cinemas last week and is available on DVD today. Marilyn, who lives alone in north Wales, added: 'It was filmed in this little cove which was just covered with film crew. 'That's when I realised I had to get it right. It was not quite a joke like I thought it was. Co-stars: Cillian Murphy and Thandie Newton appear in retreat. Marilyn Mantle was approached in a charity shop in Portmadoc, Wales, to play the role . 'It's so hard to lie completely still when you have to. Every muscle in my body wanted to twitch and wriggle.' Marilyn admits she had never heard of the A-list Hollywood actors before her filming experience. Her only instructions were to lie completely still, covered from her hips down in tarpaulin, in a rock pool of water. But she was thrilled to find out her on-screen husband was Jimmy Yuill, who played Doug Kersey in the British television show Wycliffe. It was her near-perfect match with Jimmy Yuill which she believes got her the part. She said: 'When you saw us together, we looked like a married couple. Well that's what I thought anyway. 'And I think they picked me because I look a bit like a fisherman's wife. 'I was a bit on the plump side, my height was right and also my colouring. I was what they had in mind.'",Marilyn Mantle says: 'My role largely involved lying completely still and half-submerged in a rock pool'

Lisa Simeone, of Baltimore, Maryland, lost her job hosting Soundprint, which is aired on National Public Radio affiliates around the U.S. She is working with about 50 people on a committee for the Washington D.C. protest, which she said has similar values to Occupy Wall Street. Fired: Lisa Simeone, of Baltimore, Maryland, lost her job presenting Soundprint, which is aired on National Public Radio affiliates around the U.S. Freelance Ms Simeone was fired on Wednesday by Soundprint Media Center, which produces Soundprint. She also hosts ‘World of Opera’. That show is distributed by NPR but produced by music and arts station WDAV in Davidson, North Carolina. That station is supporting her so far. ‘I don't cover news. In none of the shows that I do, do I cover the news,’ Ms Simeone said. ‘What is NPR afraid I'll do?

A WDAV spokesman said: ‘WDAV and NPR have different missions. WDAV respects NPR's mission to serve as a leading news provider. ‘WDAV on the other hand, exists to serve as a leading provider of arts and cultural programming nationally and internationally.’ NPR has come under scrutiny in the past year for its firing of news analyst Juan Williams. He said on Fox News that he was uncomfortable being on a plane with someone wearing clothing that identifies them as Muslim. NPR said he violated its ethics code by participating in media encouraging ‘punditry and speculation rather than fact-based analysis’.

"By . Luke Salkeld and Michael Seamark . Last updated at 11:48 AM on 21st October 2011 . Vincent Tabak apologised yesterday for killing Joanna Yeates and putting her parents through ‘hell’. Speaking at his murder trial for the first time, the 33-year-old insisted he had not meant to harm her and said the crime would haunt him for ever. He claimed he tried to kiss Miss Yeates after she was ‘flirty’ with him, and strangled her in panic when she screamed. Vincent Tabak, who is in the witness stand today, admits strangling his neighbour Jo Yeates but denies her murder. He broke down in the witness box while describing how he killed her . But his version of events was . dismissed by the prosecution at Bristol Crown Court, who said he was a . calculating, dishonest and manipulative man who wanted to have sex with . the landscape architect and killed her when she resisted his advances. His voice faltering, Tabak said Miss . Yeates, his next-door neighbour in Clifton, Bristol, had waved and . invited him in when she saw him walking past her kitchen window on . December 17. He said they talked about how neither of their partners was at home that evening. He added: ‘We talked about her cat . that had come into our flat once. She made some flirty comment that the . cat “went into places he shouldn’t go – a bit like [her]”.’ Killer: Vincent Tabak sits just feet away from the parents of Jo Yeates yesterday where he demonstrated how he killed their daughter . Joanna Yeates' parents, David and Teresa, centre, and brother . Chris, right, with Jo's boyfriend Greg Reardon, left, arrive at . Bristol Crown Court today . Killer: Dutchman Tabak arrives at Bristol Crown Court in a prison van where he is on trial . At this, Tabak decided to ‘make a pass’ at 25-year-old Miss Yeates and said he ‘got the impression she wanted to kiss me’. He continued: ‘I leaned forward and I . think I put one of my hands on her back and tried to kiss her. She . started to scream quite loudly. I panicked and put one of my hands over . her mouth. I said something like, “I’m sorry, it’s ok, please stop”.’ Taking deep breaths and gripping the . sides of the witness stand, Tabak said he pulled his hand away from her . mouth, and Miss Yeates let out another piercing scream. Dumped her body: Tabak drove towards Bristol Airport before stopping in a Somerset lane to hide Miss Yeates' corpse . Vincent Tabak considered throwing himself off a bridge after strangling Joanna Yeates, he told jurors. Tabak, 33, broke down in tears as he said he thought twice about killing himself. The 6ft 4in defendant told Bristol Crown Court: . 'The first time was when I was in Cambridge and I think that was that day or the day after Joanna's body was found and it put me in a state of total despair and I didn't know what to do...' After pausing and composing himself, he added: 'But I just clung on and decided not to do anything.' His suicidal thoughts continued, the court heard. Tabak added: 'After we were back in Bristol, now staying with a friend of Tanja's (Tanja Morson) I remember reading in one of the newspapers that they (the police) had found DNA, a sample of the DNA found on Joanna's body, and I thought ""that's it"".' Recalling his feelings before his arrest, he said: 'I remember drinking serious amounts of alcohol... and (thinking of) jumping off the bridge.' The Dutchman put one hand back over her mouth and the other hand around her neck. Asked by his lawyer, William Clegg QC, . to close his eyes and relive the incident, he estimated that he had . Miss Yeates in his grip for 15 seconds before her body ‘went limp’ and . she fell to the floor. Mr Clegg asked if he had meant to kill her or . cause her serious harm. ‘No, definitely not,’ replied Tabak, claiming he wanted to calm her down and stop the screaming. Miss Yeates’s parents, brother and . boyfriend Greg Reardon listened intently as Tabak said: ‘I am really . sorry for being responsible for her death and I am sorry for putting her . parents and Greg through a week of hell, not knowing where she was.’ Removing his glasses and wiping a tear . from his eye, he went on: ‘I still can’t believe that I am capable of . such an act – it will haunt me for the rest of my life, no matter what . sentence I get.’ Tabak also told the court: ‘I should . have called the police the moment she was dead. I had ample opportunity . to call the police and I didn’t do it.’ He said he twice felt suicidal . in the weeks after the killing and tried to carry on as normal despite . expecting to be arrested ‘any day, any moment’. But prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC said . Tabak was a ‘calculating, dishonest, and manipulative’ person, before, . during and after the killing. He accused Tabak of driving to an Asda . supermarket so that he would appear on its CCTV cameras around the time . of Miss Yeates’s death, and said he texted his girlfriend from there as . another way of placing him at a distance from Miss Yeates’s flat. Visit: Jurors and legal teams were taken to Clifton in Bristol and the flat that Jo Yeates lived in . Mr Lickley also suggested Tabak found his neighbour attractive and wanted to have sex with her. He asked: ‘Had you pulled her top up? Had you touched her breast? Is that what made her scream?’ Tabak shook his head and said: ‘Definitely not.’ Referring to the ‘panic’ the defendant . said he felt when he moved to stop Miss Yeates from screaming out, Mr . Lickley told him: ‘You were thinking perfectly straight, Vincent Tabak. That woman was in pain as a result of what you were doing to her throat . and you knew it. She was struggling to breathe. You just concentrated on . maintaining your grip on her throat. ‘That young woman was resisting you, Vincent Tabak, but you were not going to let her get away.’ Tabak admits the manslaughter of Miss Yeates but denies murder. The trial continues. Mr Lickley said: 'We heard for the first time yesterday that this case had a sexual element to it. 'We heard yesterday that you went to kiss Miss Yeates. That is sexual contact.' Tabak replied: 'I don't agree.' Mr Lickley said: 'You were, in fact, thinking of more... having kisses and kisses and kisses... thinking of having sex with Joanna Yeates.' Tabak replied: 'No, I wasn't.' He said he made a pass at Miss Yeates after she offered him a drink, which he declined. 'Then we chatted a bit more and then I made the pass at her,' Tabak told jurors. 'We were standing quite close and I leaned forward. 'I leaned forward and tried to put my hand behind her back. She started to scream.' Mr Lickley interjected: 'That must have been quite a surprise. 'So your reaction to that is placing your hand over her mouth... to stop her screaming.' Tabak said: 'Yes, and trying to calm her down. I was trying to prevent her from screaming, saying I was sorry, ""Stop, I am sorry"".' Mr Lickley asked Tabak a series of questions about what he did next and Tabak kept replying 'Can't remember'. 'Did you see in her eyes that she was frightened?' Mr Lickley asked. 'I can't remember,' Tabak replied. The prosecutor asked: 'All you had to do, Vincent Tabak, was walk out of the flat?' Tabak replied, after a pause: ""Yes... I didn't.' Mr Lickley went on to ask Tabak about what happened when he began to strangle Miss Yeates. 'She was fighting, was she not? She was fighting, she was struggling. 'Grabbing her arms, causing those bruises, pushing her hard against a rough surface, causing those injuries we will look at in a moment. 'But you were not going to let her get away, correct? 'You were not going to let her get away, so you carried on squeezing her throat.' Tabak replied: 'I was not considering her getting away. I was not thinking straight... I was panicking.'","Killer was 'cold, calculating and manipulative' and 'wanted sex' with victim .

Mike Newman has pledged to make it a triple crown - by breaking the world blind land speed record on the road and in the water . The bank manager carried out the first of 26 consecutive loops before his co-pilot Myles Garland took over the controls. Plane crazy: Mike Newman gets into the plane and is prepared for take-off before his world record bid in Northamptonshire yesterday . Their Blades aircraft was joined by three others flying in formation with them as they broke the record at Sywell Aerodrome in Northamptonshire yesterday. The four EA-300 LPs reached a height of 2,000ft at the top of the loops and the pilots experienced 3.5g during the manoeuvres. Mr Newman, a married father-of-two- said: 'It was brilliant, I could have happily stayed up there until tea time. 'We usually do our records on the ground but this was such a different experience and a wonderful experience. Formation flyers: The four Blades planes fly 26 consecutive loops to break a world record. Blind Mike Newman did the first one before his co-pilot took over the controls . Record-breakers: Mike with his co-pilot Myles Garland (right). The blind man is hoping to break world land and sea speed records in the next year . 'It was great to fly with this prestigious group of pilots who are raising money for a very worthy cause. 'I'm hoping to do a water speed and land speed record next year so that I can get the triple record.' The Blades Aerobatic Team are a civilian . aerobatic team made up of former Red Arrows pilots. The team works . closely with the RAF Association Wings Appeal, which supports RAF . service personnel. After notching up the air title, Mr Newman is hoping to complete a triple crown of world records on land, sea and in the air. He is hoping to wrestle back his blind land speed record by driving a supercar at over 200mph next year. His record was taken away from him last year by Turkish driver Metin Senturk who drove a Ferrari F430 unaccompanied at 182mph. He is also planning to try and beat the current Blind Water Speed Record of 99.19mph using a Silverline F1 Powerboat. Both attempts, planned for the next . 12 months, would see Mr Newman become the first blind person to hold . world speed records for air, land, and water. However, yesterday he was toasting his blind flying world record. James Cliff, Blades spokesman, said: . 'It feels fantastic for the team to have set this unique record and to . have Mike Newman alongside has made it even more special. 'Maybe we could for 50 loops in the New Year - let's see.' The record will go to the Guinness Book of Records after being ratified by the Federation Aeronatuique Internationale (FAI). Record bid: Mike is strapped in moments before take-off. The daredevil, a married father-of-two, is a former blind land speed record holder . Jubiliant: Mike Newman smiles after breaking the blind land speed record in 2003 by driving at 141mph near York.

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 11:10 PM on 18th October 2011 . As a 19-year-old woman was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the . brutal murder of a teenager, who was lured by text message to a fatal ambush, his mother confronted her in court telling her she could have saved her son's life. Seath Tyler Jackson, 15, from Florida, was beaten, shot and burned and his body parts disposed of in paint cans in April by a gang of five, simply because one of the boys had a grudge against him over a girl. One of the gang, Charlie Kay Ely, was found guilty in . September of first-degree murder and sentenced yesterday as Seath's mother told her: 'I have no sympathy for the tears you shed.' Life without parole: Charlie Ely, right, with her attorney Jonathan Bull, was sentenced yesterday for the death of Seath Jackson . Disturbing: Seath Tyler Jackson was brutally murdered and his body burned in a pit. His remains were then shovelled into paint cans and thrown in a dumpster . Murder victim Seath Jackson's mother: Sonia Jackson, second from right, attends the sentencing hearing on Monday when she told Ely she had 'no sympathy for her tears' Sonia Jackson addressed the court - and Ely - yesterday, telling her without ever looking in her direction: 'Some . say your life is over. (But) You will still see and talk to your . family. You will still get letters and birthday cards. You will still . laugh and cry. Tragic: The prolonged and grisly murder of Seath Jackson shocked the Ocala community . 'I . have no sympathy for the tears you shed. They have not been for Seath, . but rather for what's happened to you. You could have been a . hero and saved many lives.' The hearing took less than ten minutes, according to the Gainsville Sun. Outside the courtroom, Ely’s family was devastated by the sentence. 'What they have done to her, it’s not fair. She was prosecuted, but she was not defended,' said Wanda McIntyre, Ely’s grand-aunt. 'I’m sorry. I am so sorry that Sonia Jackson ended up with her child in a situation like this. But he and they did it. Charlie didn’t,' McIntyre said. 'She didn’t do this. Someone else did.' Four other defendants, who ranged in age from . 15 to 20 at the time of their arrests, remain in jail awaiting trial on . first-degree murder charges, prosecutors in Ocala said. They are . Michael Bargo, 19, Justin Soto, 20, Kyle Hooper, 17 and Amber Wright, . 15. It was Amber Wright who was said to have been an ex-girlfriend of Seath's and the reason why Bargo - who then dated her - held a grudge against him. Suspects: 'Ring leader' Michael Bargo, 18, left, and Charlie Kay Ely have both been charged with murder . Suspects: Justin Soto, 20, left, has been charged with murder and James Young Havens III, 37, charged with conspiracy to murder as police allege he knew about the plot and helped dispose of the body . Ex-girlfriend: Amber Wright, 15, allegedly lured Seath to the house with the pretence that she wanted to get back together with him. Her step-brother Kyle Hooper, right, confessed to his mother about his part in the crime . Justice: Sonia Jackson said her son can never be brought back no matter what the sentence passed down . Ely and Wright used a cell phone to . text Seath and persuade him to come to Ely's home where three young men were . waiting, according to the arrest affidavit. Once inside the home, Seath was hit in the head with a wooden object and was shot multiple times with a .22 calibre , according to detectives. When he tried to escape, he was tackled, held down and shot again. His body was then placed in a bath tub and his knee caps were broken. According to the report, when he was in the bathtub he started showing signs of life and was shot again. He was then tied up, placed in a sleeping bag and burned in a fire pit. Later, Jackson's remains were shovelled into five-gallon paint cans, . authorities said. The only motive for the killing noted in the . arrest affidavit was that the alleged shooter, 19-year-old Michael Bargo, hated . Jackson because of Wright. A very public feud between the three involved in the love triangle was played out on Facebook. It began on April 8 when Wright wrote on Seath's page: 'I got so tired of you treating me like I was nothing. If you're so perfect, why don't you get over your jealousy and get a new girl you can hurt. ... You know I cared deeply about you. I stuck with you through a lot of stuff. ... It takes a real man to accept the fact he got broken up with.' He responded: 'We both need to just let all of this go. Yeah we split, yeah it hurt, but I'm over it. I'm just not going to let Mike (Bargo) have his cake and eat it too.' Bargo's lawyer, Charles Holloman,said his client 'had affection' for Amber that sparked fury at Jackson. 'He was concerned about the way she was being treated. He wasn't the only one who was concerned,' the lawyer told ABC. He admitted that his client had a record but added that Seath Jackson was 'no angel'. However he acknowledges that 'killing someone, chopping them up and putting them in a bag (is) pretty damned depraved'.

According to the Star Banner, prosecutors have said that . they will seek the death penalty against Bargo, who is alleged to have . been the mastermind of the murder plot. Speaking in a jail house interview . shortly after Seath's death in April, Ely said she felt sorry for the . victim's family but claims she only participated out of fear.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 9:14 PM on 21st October 2011 . It is an argument that many would think is long forgotten now that the two countries have one of the strongest international alliances in the world. But that has not stopped a team of lawyers from the UK challenging the Declaration of Independence that released the United States from their colonial masters. A debate took place this week in Philadelphia - the city where discussions began in 1776 and concluded in the separation on July 4 - between the two countries testing the validity of the document. Michael Beloff (left), former president of Trinity College, Oxford, headed the UK team while David Levi, Dean of Duke University Law, spoke for the U.S. side . Treason? The British team argued, during a tongue-in-cheek discussion, that the Declaration of Independence wasn't worth the paper on which it was written . Michael Beloff, former president of Trinity College, Oxford, . headed the UK team while David Levi, Dean of Duke University Law, spoke . for the U.S. side. They questioned various aspects of the declaration that founded America and led to the American Revolutionary War that ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783. It was claimed by the British that the declaration signed seven years earlier was in fact illegal. The UK half of the discussion, which took place in the Ben Franklin Hall, said it was totally illegitimate and amounted to treason. During the tongue-in-cheek argument, one of the British team said: 'There really is no need for you Yanks to keep picking at this ancient scab two centuries or so later.' They argued that just because you want to start a new law, it doesn't mean you can just do such a thing. In their brief, they said: 'What if Texas decided today it wanted to secede from the Union? Lincoln made the case against secession and he was right', the BBC reports. Making history: Signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 . In response, the Americans said: 'The English had used their own Declaration of Rights to depose James II and these acts were deemed completely lawful and justified.' When it comes to taxing people without giving them representation, the British lawyers said that that was simply a wish of colonists. They argued that they should be grateful that Britain protected them at great expense from the French during a seven-year war. The Americans, however, said the Declaration of Independence was formed through 'Natural law', which the British said is an undefined concept. They also said that the document was legal because there had been other movements of independence across the world that had been recognised in the UN charter. At the end, a vote was held and it was decided that the U.S. would survive for another day and maintain its independence. The Declaration, which helped establish the guiding principles of modern democracy, was written mainly by U.S. Founding Father Thomas Jefferson and is described by historians as 'America's birth certificate'. It includes the then extraordinary assertion: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,' which paved the way for the French Revolution 13 years later. It was signed by 56 delegates from the 13 American colonies that were at war with Britain. The 200 first copies were made by printer John Dunlap that night and distributed throughout the colonies the following morning to be read aloud to the colonists and their militia. Writing the Declaration of Independence, 1776: From left, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson . The American revolution was the . political upheaval during the latter half of the 18th century. Thirteen colonies in North . America joined forces to break free from the British Empire - giving rise to . the United States of America. Rejecting the authority of Britain's . Parliament to govern them from overseas, by 1774, each colony had set up a . provisional Congress... January 10, 1776: Thomas Paine . published a booklet entitled Common Sense. It outlined his vision of a . government in which the people, through their elected representatives, would . have supreme power. Paine was the first to openly . suggest independence from Britain. Common Sense was read by many, . including George Washington. The work was to have a massive . influence on Thomas Jefferson in his writing of the Declaration of . Independence. May: Congress, meeting in . Philadelphia, receives Richard Henry Lee's resolution urging the colonies to . become free and independent states. June 11: Thomas Jefferson, John . Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston are appointed to . a committee to draft a declaration of independence.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 5:53 PM on 21st October 2011 . The BBC was forced to defend its 'ludicrous' staffing levels at Dale Farm after it was accused of outnumbering travellers and activists on the site towards the end of the protest. As the resistance at the travellers site, near Basildon in Essex, ended with a mass exodus yesterday, the Corporation was criticised for having more journalists and technical crews on site than there were remaining protesters. Travellers escorted their extremist . supporters to the exit gates before themselves leaving the illegal site . in a convoy of vans and caravans. The BBC was accused of having about . 30 staff on site - including television crews, local correspondents and . documentary makers - despite the numbers of travellers and demonstrators . dwindling, it was reported. A caravan being rented by the BBC at the Dale Farm site. After first denying the Corporation had hired the vehicle, a spokesman confirmed it was being used as a toilet . Part of the letter posted in the window of the caravan. A BBC spokesman said it was there because there were no toilet facilities on site . There . were also comments from the BBC's rivals on Twitter, with ITV News . reporter Damon Green tweeting: 'We have a tent, the BBC has a caravan at . Dale Farm. Delivering quality first.' Earlier today a spokesman for the BBC denied the Corporation rented a caravan for the eviction coverage, . stating the only vehicles used were two satellite trucks and two radio trucks for broadcasts and a power supply. However, photographs have since . emerged of a caravan with a sign in the window reading: 'This was rented . by BBC News for coverage of the Dale Farm eviction. It should not be . removed from the site.' It was signed by the news producer. When . told about the picture, the BBC spokesman then said there had been a . 'misunderstanding' and admitted the caravan had been rented for toilet . facilities because 'there weren't any on site'. He added: 'Or it could have been there for power supply.' The Corporation said the actual number of staff on site - 24 . - had been justified and added its news . gathering team included technical . crews and security. BBC Look East's Gareth George reporting live from the scene. He was part of a 21-strong news gathering team from the Corporation based on site during the eviction . Another report live from the eviction scene - footage which also appeared in the same news bulletin for BBC Look East . Broadcast: BBC's Radio 5 Live's Aasmah Mir also reported from the scene . A spokesman also said another three BBC employees were part of . non-news documentary team which had been on site for weeks making a . programme about the Dale Farm eviction. The BBC has refused to specify exactly which of their news gathering teams were reporting from the scene. However, broadcasts of the eviction have appeared on regional bulletin Look East, . current affairs programme Newsnight and Radio 5 Live, as well as other reports on localised bulletins. Liberal Democrat spokesman Don Foster said the staffing . levels were 'ludicrous'  and could affect public sympathy for the BBC's . proposed 20 per cent budget cuts, the Telegraph reported. A spokesman said: 'The eviction at Dale Farm has been a . major rolling news story and we had 21 people there including . reporters, producers, technical staff and security, covering the story . locally and nationally for numerous outlets for TV, radio and online. 'A small non-news documentary team has separately been on-site for some weeks.' Today, . Basildon Council officers - escorted by police and bailiffs - toured . the site serving 48-hour eviction notices to those travellers who stayed . at the camp overnight and pinning them to plots. The . notices inform residents what will be removed and includes . demolishing fences and walls to allow access, although these will be . reinstated. The BBC said the staff included television and radio news gathering teams along with their technical crews and security. It also said two satellite trucks and two radio cars were on site were for . the power supply and to enable reports to be broadcast. On the scene: Newsnight's Tim Whewell had also reported from the site of the Dale Farm eviction . The spokesman added: 'There were 21 . people there as part of the news gathering team. This included . television camera and radio crews and all their technical staff, sound . engineers and security. '(Local correspondents) would have been part of the overall news gathering team. 'There were also people from a documentary team . there, but this would have been no more than three members of staff, . bringing the total number of BBC staff up to 24. 'We also had two trucks on site which . wasn't for accommodation but for the power supply to put the TV reports . out. We did not have any accommodation on site.' And so it begins: A council official staples a notice to a fence on a plot. The notices inform residents what will be removed . The last remaining few: A little girl peers out of a window which now has an eviction notice stuck to it. Between 20 and 30 residents remained inside the site overnight - despite a mass walk-out . Dismantle: Bailiffs and council officials enter the Dale Farm travellers' site to serve 48-hour eviction notices on plots and to a few families that have remained . Eviction completed: Travellers and their supporters walk out of Dale Farm near Basildon after being driven off the land by police and bailiffs at the end of a two-day stand off .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 2:05 PM on 22nd October 2011 . As an Ohio community returns to normalcy after a potentially deadly exotic animal crisis, questions are being raised about the man who released them before killing himself. The Muskingum County Sheriff said a coroner has ruled that Terry Thompson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and then was bitten by one of the animals he freed shortly before dying. But Sheriff Matt Lutz says chicken pieces were strategically spread near Terry Thompson's remains. Scroll down for video . Sadness: A stuffed animal with a sympathy card hangs from the locked gate of Terry Thompson's exotic animal ranch in Zanesville, Ohio . Survivors: These two leopards were among the six creatures alive after Terry Thompson released 56 animals from their confines at his Ohio ranch before killing himself . Alive: One grizzly bear and two macaques also managed to survive the Ohio ordeal . Investigators agree they were put there to attract the animals, but no one knows why. According to the coroner, Thompson, 62, had a bite wound on his head that appeared to have come from a large cat, such as a Bengal tiger. Sheriff Lutz said it appears the bite happened quickly after Thompson shot himself. More revelations about the eccentric animal preserve owner have come to light today. Thompson owed tens of thousands in unpaid taxes, and a fellow big-cat enthusiast said that he had taken in so many creatures he was 'in over his head.' Court records show that he and his wife owed at least $68,000 in unpaid taxes to the IRS and the county, and he had two federal tax liens filed against him last year. He had just gotten out of federal prison last month for possessing unregistered weapons. Dead: Owner of the animals Terry Thompson was found dead by police at . the Muskingum County Animal Farm. He had previous gun charges and was . separated from his wife . Kenny Hetrick, who has six tigers and . other animals on his property outside Toledo, said Thursday he used to . see Thompson at exotic-animal auctions a few times a year in Ohio. Mr . Hetrick said many of Thompson's tigers had been donated to him by . people who bought baby animals that they no longer wanted once they . started to grow. 'He really had more there than what he could do,' Hetrick said. 'I don't know what his deal was, but he was in over his head.' Thompson . released 56 of his wild animals before taking his own life. Forty-eight . of them were shot and killed by law officers, including 18 endangered . Bengal tigers. Authorities . believe all of the escaped animals have now been accounted for, . including the two remaining animals that were on the loose as of . Wednesday night. Six of the animals were captured alive and were taken to the Columbus Zoo. The one animal that remained missing, a monkey infected with the deadly Herpes B virus, is believed to have been eaten by one of the other animals, possibly one of the big cats. While some criticize the sheriff's department for acting heavy-handed, neighbour Sam Kopchak says deputies did the right thing by destroying the animals before someone was hurt or killed. Schools have reopened in Zanesville and authorities have urged the community to get back to its routine. Tragic: Sheriff's deputies shot nearly 50 wild animals - including 18 rare Bengal tigers and 17 lions - across the state's countryside on Wednesday . Meanwhile, Thompson’s wife, whom he had separated from before his suicide, is pleading for the return of the surviving animals, calling them her 'her children.' Tom Stalf, a Columbus Zoo official who helped transport the surviving animals there, said: ""This is a person that's very bonded to the animals.' He added: 'She wanted to see them and make sure that they were doing OK, and she missed them.' Though she wants the surviving animals to be returned to her, zoo officials said they will continue to care for the animals, and leave it up to the sheriff's department to decide if the animals will go home, to another facility, or remain at the zoo. Owner or... mother? Marian Thompson covered herself to avoid reporters as she went to visit the surviving animals, which she calls her 'babies' Released: This graphic shows the number of animals released by Terry Thompson before he killed himself on Wednesday. The remaining macaque monkey is now believed to have been eaten by one of the big cats . Marian Thompson, who shielded herself from reporters, told Mr Stalf that she is especially bonded with the surviving pair of primates. She revealed to him that when she was still living at the farm the surviving female Macaque would sleep with her, ABC News reported. Caged and alone, the sad survivors of the exotic animal bloodbath in Ohio are now in the care of the Columbus Zoo. Six animals - three leopards, a grizzly bear and two monkeys - were captured and taken to the zoo after they were freed by Thompson before he killed himself. 'We are happy to report they all seem to be doing very well,' zoo spokeswoman Patti Peters said in a statement on Thursday.

Republicans condemned President Obama's announcement that remaining U.S. troops will withdraw from Iraq by the end of the year. Senator John McCain said the President's decision is a 'harmful' setback for U.S. interests in the Middle East. Senator McCain said: 'I respectfully disagree with the President. This decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our enemies in the Middle East, especially the Iranian regime, which has worked relentlessly to ensure a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.' Scroll down for video . Coming home: President Obama today said that all U.S. troops will leave Iraq by the end of the year . Several candidates hoping to be picked for the Republican presidential nomination also offered their opinions. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said: 'President Obama's astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women.' Concerns: Senator John McCain criticised Obama's decision to withdraw troops by the end of the year . Herman Cain said: 'Whether or not it’s the right thing to do, I would consult with the commanders. 'The thing I wouldn't do that the president is doing is telling the enemy how many troops you're going to bring out and when you are going to bring them out. I don't think that's a good strategy.' Democrats largely praised the decision as a promise Obama has kept from his pledges made while campaigning for the presidency. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the move honours 'the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and the wishes of the American people to bring all our troops home by the end this year'. President Barack Obama made the announcement marking the end of one of the longest and most divisive conflicts in U.S. history. 'As promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America's war in Iraq will be over,' the President said. 'The tide of war is receding.' 'The U.S. is moving forward from a position of strength,' he added. Around 4,000 to 5,000 security contractors will remain in Iraq, the White House said. End of war: The announcement marks a major milestone after nine years of war . Obama's . statement put an end to months of wrangling over whether the U.S. would . maintain a force in Iraq beyond 2011. The President spoke following a . video conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the White . House said in a statement. Mr Obama said the announcement marked a 'move into a new phase.' He vowed to work with the Iraqi government and said the two countries were 'in full agreement about how to move forward'. 'As of January 1 it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations,' he said. 'This will be a strong and enduring partnership... that will unleash the potential of the Iraqi people.' But . immediately following the announcement there were claims that the . troops were bring withdrawn because the Iraqi government had refused to . let them stay. The National . Journal reported that as recently as last week, the White House was . trying to persuade the Iraqis to allow between 2,000 and 3,000 stay . beyond the end of the year. Only about 150 soldiers will be stationed in Iraq from next year who will protect the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and assist in arms sales. 'We can say troops will definitely be home for the holidays,' Mr Obama said. Obama, an opponent of the war from the start, took office and accelerated the end of the conflict. In August 2010, he declared the U.S. combat mission over. 'Over the next two months our troops in Iraq, tens of thousands of them, will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home,' Obama said. 'The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their heads held high, proud of their success and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops.' Mr Obama said that he wanted to 'join Americans in paying tribute to those who have served... and given their lives.' Coming home for Christmas: Mr Obama said that all soldiers would be returning by the holidays . The withdrawal of American troops . marks a major milestone in the war that started in 2003 and resulted in . the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. The two countries have been . negotiating over whether the United States would leave behind up to . several thousand military trainers after year-end, or if all remaining . troops would depart as planned by December 31. The main sticking point . has been legal immunity for any U.S. forces that remain. After ending combat operations in . 2010, the last 44,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by the end . of the year under the terms of a bilateral security pact. In recent months, Washington had been . discussing with Iraqi leaders the possibility of several thousand . American troops remaining to continue training Iraqi security forces. Throughout the discussions, Iraqi . leaders refused to give U.S. troops immunity from prosecution in Iraqi . courts, and the Americans refused to stay without that guarantee. Reunited: After ending combat operations in 2010, the last 44,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by the end of the year . Partnership: The withdrawal of American troops marks a major milestone in the war that started in 2003 . Moreover, Iraq's leadership has been split on whether it wanted American forces to stay. When the 2008 agreement requiring all . U.S. forces to leave Iraq was passed, many U.S. officials assumed it . would inevitably be renegotiated so that Americans could stay longer. The U.S. said repeatedly this year it . would entertain an offer from the Iraqis to have a small force stay . behind, and the Iraqis said they would like American military help. But . as the year wore on and the number of American troops that Washington . was suggesting could stay behind dropped, it became increasingly clear . that a U.S. troop presence was not a sure thing. The issue of legal protection for the Americans was the deal-breaker. Pulling troops out by the end of this year allows both al-Maliki and Obama to claim victory. Promise: When the 2008 agreement requiring all U.S. forces to leave Iraq was passed, many officials assumed it would inevitably be renegotiated . Serving: More than 4,400 American military members have been killed since the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 . Obama kept a campaign promise to end . the war, and al-Maliki will have ended the American presence and . restored Iraqi sovereignty. The President used the war statement . to once again turn attention back to the economy, the domestic concern . that is expected to determine whether he wins re-election next year. 'After a decade of war the nation . that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own, an . America that sees its economic strength restored just as we've restored . our leadership around the globe.' More than 4,400 American military members have been killed since the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003.

"By . Claire Bates and Sophie Borland . Last updated at 10:32 AM on 28th September 2011 . A lottery game that starts next week gives too little to charity, it was claimed last night. The Health Lottery has been set up as a rival to the National Lottery with cash also going to good causes. Tickets will cost £1, of which 20.3p will go toward projects that tackle health inequalities. It will operate as a series of 51 . lotteries, each representing a local authority area. Each will take it . in turn to be the beneficiary of the draw. Launch: Left to right, Melinda Messanger, Kate Lawlor, Gail Porter, Eamonn Holmes, Donna Air and Joanna Louise Page . However, the National Lottery donates . 40 per cent more – 28p from every £1 ticket. Local raffles typically . give away more than half their profits. Richard Desmond, who is worth an . estimated £950million and owns X-rated TV channels as well as Channel 5 . and several newspapers, is behind the venture. The lottery’s organisers . say they will not disclose which good causes will benefit until next . month but around £50million will go to charity in the first year. Projects are likely to include . funding for specialist dementia nurses and counselling for young carers. Critics accuse Mr Desmond of profiteering on the back of charities and . undermining more generous lotteries. Acevo chief executive Sir Stephen Bubb, branded Mr Desmond a 'disgrace', saying: 'He is only giving 20p out of a pound to charity - not 28p as the National Lottery does. 'So if people switch to Desmond from the National Lottery charities will lose out. 'I call on him to raise it to 28p if he actually cares about health charities.' Tickets for The Health Lottery go on sale this Thursday and it offers a top prize of £100,000 for matching five numbers. There is no cap on how many people can claim this prize. People who match four numbers will win £500, while three numbers will be awarded £50. The draw will be shown during adverts on ITV and on Channel 5 each Saturday and will be hosted by Eamonn Holmes. Sir Stephen Bubb: Calls on Richard Desmond to raise amount given to charity to 28% . Mr Desmond has signed up more than 40,000 retailers to sell tickets for his Health Lottery - 12,000 more than the number of shops selling tickets for the National Lottery. Sir Stephen told Mail Online: 'If he (Mr Desmond) is setting the health lottery up as a direct competitor - and it looks like he is - charities will lose out. 'It will be robbing charity Peter to pay charity Paul.' He also criticised Mr Desmond for setting up a separate new administrative machine for the new health lottery. 'It's wasting money that could be going to good causes,' he said. 'The Big Lottery Fund already does this effectively and has a strong track record in grant making. 'It also supports charities across the sector, from health to the arts to sports.' Garth Caswell, of the Hospice Lotteries Association, which runs weekly lotteries to raise money for 115 hospices, warned the venture posed a major threat to local charities. He added: 'It's potentially diverting huge amounts of money away from local hospice care at a time when charities are already losing revenue as a result of the economic downturn. The new health lottery will be licensed by the Gambling Commission. Because it is a' society lottery' it will not have to pay 12 per cent lottery duty to the Government, which Camelot must pay. Under its rules, the health lottery must give at least 20 per cent of the revenue from ticket sales to good causes. The rest can be used for prizes and the operator's expenses. Health Lottery chief executive Martin Hall, defended the decision to give the minimum amount, saying: 'The National Lottery gives less money in prizes, we give more. So if we give more in prizes there is less to give away.' He added: 'The Health Lottery game is a fresh new alternative which has one single good cause at its heart - health. 'We will be offering people the opportunity to win a life-changing amount of money while at the same time contributing to tackling real health issues in their own communities.' Mr Desmond's firm, Northern Shell, owns newspapers including the Daily Express and Daily Star.","It will be robbing charity Peter to pay charity Paul, warns Sir Stephen Bubb ."
"By . James White . Last updated at 5:42 PM on 21st October 2011 . An overweight benefit cheat who was too fat to fit in a court will not be forced to wear an electronic tag because it will not fit round her ankle. Clinically obese Beverley Douglas, 44, had jobs as a CCTV operator and a bus driver which earned her a salary of around £16,000 but she carried on raking in handouts for five years. The former businesswoman also faked tenancy agreements to pocket rent on two properties she never lived in. Douglas, a mother of four, collected £34,000 in benefits, the court heard. Big problem: Beverley Douglas narrowly avoided a jail sentence today . when a judge found she was too ill to be sent to prison for benefits . fraud . Hot wheels: The defendant, pictured leaving court in an expensive Dodge car, will not have to wear a tag because it will not fit, a judge heard . The judge, Mr Recorder Humfrey Malins gave her six months jail term suspended for two years after hearing she has been suffering from serious heart problems. He tried to impose an electronically monitored curfew but changed that to doorstep police checks after hearing the tag could not be attached around her ankle because she is so overweight. Sporting orange-rimmed sunglasses which the fraudster claimed were because of diabetes, wheezing Douglas was allowed to sit on a chair in the well of the court because her size also made it difficult for her to get into the dock. Judge Malins said: 'I'm permitting you to stay where you are.' On her first appearance at Inner London Crown Court in May, she refused to enter the old-fashioned Court One. She told officials she could not climb the stairs to the narrow secure doorway leading to the dock of the Edwardian oak-panelled courtroom. Today, after parking her red Dodge Avenger outside, she walked with a frame to a more modern courtroom without stairs. The car costs up to £18,000 but it is not clear how she obtained the vehicle. Jobs: Douglas worked as a bus driver and a CCTV operator while claiming almost £35,000 in benefits . Eileen Sproson, prosecuting, said Douglas claimed £17,071.85 of Income Support from the Department of Work and Pensions, and from Croydon Council £15,930.38 Housing Benefit and £1,787.99 Council Tax Benefit. She started claiming Income Support in 2002 but in March 2004 failed to declare she had got a job. 'She was working as a CCTV operator,' said the barrister. 'She failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions that she was working and this would have affected her entitlement. 'She also failed to notify them that between 24 January 2005 and 11 October 2007 she was working full-time as a bus driver.' She made a claim for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit to Croydon Council on March 29 2006 and between April 10 2006 and October 14 2007 she received an overpayment of £8,896.39. The prosecutor said on July 4 2008 Douglas submitted a bogus tenancy agreement to claim Housing Benefit for 38 Dunbar Avenue, Norbury. She faked the landlord's signature on that document and did the same in relation to a second, the neighbouring property at number 40. The benefit was paid direct to her bank account regularly but she was not living at either address. Between then and February 26, 2009 she received another £8,821.98. 'The total overpayment being £34,790.22,' said the prosecutor.A routine tax audit flagged up the discrepancy and she was charged last year. Abigail Penny, defending, said Douglas' actions were motivated by desperation and the need to provide for her children who were all under 16 at the time. 'Motivated by desperation': A defence barrister for Douglas said she committed her crimes for her children's sake . She said she had suffered years of domestic abuse at the hands of her now estranged husband, who she left in 2000. 'He repeatedly cheated on her,' said the barrister. 'She left him, taking the children elsewhere. 'They had a business together in computer sales and she worked there. 'She effectively became a silent partner and went to work in admin. 'She was working in the day and evenings in call centres to make sure she had enough money to support herself and her children. 'She developed a new relationship with a new man. 'When her daughter was 10 days old her husband returned and tried to get access. 'It culminated in the baby being thrown on the floor. 'She reported his behaviour to police, she having been a victim of domestic violence over the years.' Douglas was moved to a council flat, but claimed she was forced to find private accommodation after her daughter was threatened. Ms Penny said: 'She started to work as a bus driver. 'There was no way that her income of £15,000 to £16,000 could cover the rent.' The barrister said Douglas had viewed two properties in Dunbar road and was planning to move in, and the landlord gave her a blank tenancy agreement. Previous appearance: Douglas at the earlier hearing when she said she could not fit in the court . But then she was admitted to hospital and lost the property to another tenant. 'Effectively she was a desperate woman,' she added. The barrister said she would have been entitled to around £15,000 working tax credits had she taken the legal option. She still has two children, aged eight and 15, who she cares for alone. Judge Malins said: 'The bad thing about these offences apart from the substantial amount you wrongly and dishonestly claimed, is that they took place over a period of some years. 'I have read a long medical report. It is apparent to me that you are not well. 'I see the struggles you have with regard to mobility.There is constant reference to continuing and serious heart and chest problems. 'You have had the extreme stress of this case hanging over you for a long time. 'A custodial sentence is justified and necessary and I have decided to pass one but suspend it. 'That is because of the personal circumstances of your case.' Douglas, from Thornton Heath, south London, admitted nine counts of making a false representation and two of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances between March 15, 2004 and February 26, 2009. She denied two charges of making a false representation and she was cleared by the judge, after the prosecution offered no evidence.","Claimant worked as bus driver while receiving £34,000 in benefits .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:16 PM on 22nd October 2011 . Death: Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud died in New York today . The heir to the Saudi throne Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz has died today. His death has caused a constitutional crisis as questions are asked about who should succeed to the throne. The 85-year-old crown prince, who was the half brother of the ailing Saudi King Abdullah died at a hospital in New York City. Aziz, who was the oil-rich kingdom's deputy prime minister, had been defence minister and minister of aviation for about four decades. With Prince Sultan's death, his brother Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz, the . longtime minister of interior, becomes the most likely candidate . to be next in line to rule after King Abdullah. A statement carried on state news agency SPA and state television said: 'With deep sorrow and sadness the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz mourns the death of his brother and his Crown Prince Sultan... who died at dawn this morning Saturday outside the kingdom following an illness.' Scroll down for the video . Saudi television broke its schedules early on Saturday to broadcast Koranic verses accompanied by footage of the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest site. Likely candidate: Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud is favourite to be successor to the throne . Sultan underwent surgery in New York in February 2009 for an undisclosed illness and spent nearly a year abroad recuperating in the United States and at a palace in Agadir, Morocco. He had an intestinal cyst removed in 2005 and had spent several months abroad for treatment and recreation. Aljazeera reports analysts believed he had been suffering from a form of dementia, and a March 2009 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks said he was 'for all intents and purposes incapacitated'. Tributes: Prince of Wales and Foreign Secretary William Hague have sent letters of condolence . Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was sad to hear of the Crown Prince's death: 'He served the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for many years with great dignity and dedication. 'His contribution to the prosperity and development of the Kingdom will long be remembered.'I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the Kingdom and its people at this sad time.' The Prince of Wales was said to have sent a personal letter of condolence to the King of Saudi Arabia. A Clarence House spokesman said: 'The Prince of Wales sent a personal letter of condolence to the King of Saudi Arabia expressing his deep sadness at the news.' Unlike a traditional monarchy the succession of Saudi kingship goes from brother to brother, rather than father to son. The ruling royal family and the successor will always come from the House of Saud, which is one of the wealthiest and most powerful dynasties in the world, comprising of 7,000 members. Currently the throne goes from brother to brother of the children of King Abdul-Aziz. The House of Saud is composed of the descendants of Muhammad ibn Saud and his brothers, though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of Abdulaziz ibn Abdul Rahman Al Saud. The order of succession to the throne of . Saudi Arabia is determined by, and within, the House of Saud. It . strictly follows agnatic seniority, but a prince may be surpassed, or . another elevated. The Allegiance Council was created in 2006 to . facilitate the royal transfer of power. At least two brothers, Bandar and Musaid, are older than King Abdullah and Mishaal is older than Sultan. But each has stepped aside due to health reasons, family consensus, or unwillingness to participate in governing. He received a diagnosis of colon cancer in 2004. While Saudi Arabia insisted he was fully cured, diplomats in Riyadh said he had slowly retreated from participating in decision-making and often worked only for one or two hours a day. Many of his duties had been informally shifted to other princes, most notably to his son Khaled who led Saudi and Arab forces during the 1991 war to remove Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army from Kuwait. Prince Khaled, who is assistant defense minister, is also the owner of influential pan-Arab daily al-Hayat. While he was defense minister, Sultan spent hundreds of billions to modernize the forces of the country where Islam was born 1400 years ago, doubling the regular armed forces to more than 100,000 men and buying advanced weapons from all over the world. Born in Riyadh, Sultan was educated by private tutors and spoke some English. He was keen to maintain close ties with the West, especially the United States, though like the rest of the royal family he distanced himself from the U.S.-led attack on Iraq in 2003. The most likely candidate for the throne after Sultan is Prince Nayef, the powerful interior minister in charge of internal security forces. After Sultan fell ill, the king gave Nayef an implicit nod in 2009 by naming him second deputy prime minister, traditionally the post of the third in line. Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef is seen as being close to ultra-conservative clerics. Anyone who rises to the throne is likely to maintain the kingdom's close alliance with the United States. But there could be internal differences. Abdullah has been seen as a reformer, making incremental changes to improve the position of women, for example, and to modernize the kingdom despite some backlash from the ultra-conservative Wahhabi clerics who give the royal family the religious legitimacy needed to rule. Nayef, for example, is often seen as closer to the clerics.",Tributes paid by Prince of Wales and Foreign Secretary .
"Last updated at 11:35 PM on 5th October 2011 . TV pitchman Don Lapre died from a self-inflicted razor blade wound to the neck, according to new reports. The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed Lapre, the self-proclaimed 'King of Infomercials,' was found dead in an apparent suicide while in federal custody on Sunday - days before he was due to stand trial for massive fraud. Sources tell TMZ.com piles of . blood-soaked clothing were found in Lapre's Arizona jail cell. Officials . believe Lapre used the clothes to conceal his wound and prevent guards . from attempting to save his life, according to the website. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Don Lapre, 47, was found dead in his Arizona jail cell on Sunday . The autopsy was completed yesterday. Lapre's mother claimed yesterday prison official's had taken her son's anti-depressant medication away. Shirley Cleveland said her . 47-year-old son, who was found dead in his prison cell in Florence, . Arizona, was being treated for severe depression before he . was arrested for allegedly defrauding 220,000 people of $52million. Lapre had attempted suicide in the past, Ms Cleveland told TMZ. When she learned prison guards in . Florence, Arizona, had taken his medication away she called his lawyer . and pleaded for her to intervene, Ms Cleveland told the site. Lapre's mother said the jail gave him another medicine, but it did not treat his depression. Infomercial king: Lapre's death came just two days before he was due to stand trial for fraud . Needed medication: Lapre's mother said her jail officials took her son's anti-depressants off him . TMZ also reported that Ms Cleveland insisted her son, a father of two, was innocent of all charges. Lapre . was awaiting a trial after being indicted on 41 charges stemming from a . nationwide scheme to sell what was billed as 'The Greatest Vitamin in . the World.' Federal . prosecutors alleged that 226,794 people were promised lucrative . commission checks for selling vitamins and recruiting others to the . business, but said it was a worthless venture for most who signed up. The federal grand jury indictment, made public in June, revealed that that the internet-based businesses had lost investors an estimated $51.8million. The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed he . died in an apparent suicide while in federal custody but the death . remains under investigation. However there was a 'large amount of . blood' in the cell where he was found and so it appears he cut himself, . law enforcement sources told TMZ. Jokes: David Spade's impression of Don Lapre on Saturday Night Live . A grand jury had indicted him on counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and promotional money laundering. When Lapre failed to arrive for his . arraignment that month a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was discovered less than 24 hours later. Authorities . found him in a gym with a cut in his groin and they believed at the . time he had attempted suicide by trying to slice his femoral artery. Last week, Lapre's attorney filed a . motion at U.S. District Court in Phoenix seeking to get him released . from jail pending his trial, scheduled for next year, the Arizona . Republic reported. The . motion said that Lapre was no longer a flight risk and would have access . to a psychologist to monitor his medication and mental status. 'I . can't tell you what his state of mind was,' Patricia Gitre, Lapre's . attorney, told the Arizona Republic 'It was a difficult time for him, . obviously.' The charges carried potential fines of . between $250,000 and $500,000 per count and federal prison terms of . between five and 25 years. The company said it would support the . hundreds of thousands of people it recruited to start up online . businesses selling vitamins. But investors were allegedly misled as the company tried to get them to purchase additional advertising and other services. Lapre was known for his emphatic . salesman style but the company was shut down in 2007 after customers . filed hundreds of complaints. Meanwhile he was personally paid more than $2.2million from the business between 2004 and 2007, the indictment said. Lapre was known for his television appearances on shows such as 'Making Money From A Tiny One Bedroom Apartment'. The pitchman, who referred to himself . on his website as 'The King of Infomercials', would recount his . hard-luck life story to viewers. He encouraged them to turn their lives . around like he had and is notorious for claiming he made $50,000 a week . from his one bedroom apartment. It was widely parodied - notably by David Spade on Saturday Night Live. In a rambling note on his website, Lapre said he did nothing wrong.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 8:18 AM on 20th October 2011 . Bernie Madoff’s widowed daughter-in-law today launched an explosive attack on how the disgraced financier ruined her family and told her mother-in-law she will never see her grandchildren again. Stephanie Madoff Mack - whose husband Mark Madoff committed suicide last year, 18 months after his father was jailed for life - said their two children Audrey, 4, and Nicholas, 2, still miss their dad. She said her late husband relentlessly followed news coverage about his father and failed in a 2009 suicide attempt, leaving a note saying his life was 'destroyed' and telling his dad: ‘F**k you’. Scroll down for video . Family: Stephanie Madoff Mack's (left picture, right) husband Mark Madoff (left picture, centre) committed suicide after his father Bernie Madoff (right) was jailed - leaving two kids including Nicholas (left picture,  left) Stephanie, 37, of New York, told People magazine she feels ‘betrayed’ and has not forgiven her mother-in-law Ruth Madoff, or her husband’s brother Andrew, for allegedly abandoning Mark. Earlier this week she became the first member of the family to grant an interview, telling ABC News she holds her father-in-law 'fully responsible for killing my husband’ and she would ‘spit in his face’. She said her daughter Audrey sometimes shouts ‘I love you, daddy!’ in the sky and recently asked her: ‘Why didn’t daddy take his cell phone with him when he died?’, reported People magazine. The couple wed in 2004 after meeting on a blind date when Stephanie worked in fashion and Mark worked in finance. But she said his ‘handsome face aged overnight’ when Bernie was jailed.

Tragic death: Medical staff, right, use a stretcher remove the body of Mark Madoff, left, from the apartment building in which he lived in the Soho neighbourhood of New York on December 11 last year . ‘The smile that made me fall in love with him disappeared altogether,’ she wrote in her new book, adding that Mark would obsessively follow news reports in fear of being implicated in the scandal. ‘The smile that made me fall in love with him disappeared altogether' Stephanie Madoff Mack . She said her husband was ‘in pure shock’ about his father’s lies. ‘He was enraged as well,’ Stephanie told ABC. 'Furious . that his father could've done this - destroyed so many lives and destroyed his.’ Stephanie said her husband physically . changed as the charges against his father unravelled and he even grew a . beard to disguise himself. Mark described himself as ‘beyond devastated’ when he emailed her an article entitled ‘Madoff’s kin eyed as probe grinds on’, reported People magazine. She replied: ‘I cannot take this anymore!’ Before tragedy struck: Stephanie Madoff Mack, right, became the first member of the family to grant an interview, telling ABC she holds her father-in-law Bernie Madoff, left, 'fully responsible for killing my husband' Mark hanged himself just hours later - and Stephanie, who is now studying childhood development at graduate school, said her daughter Audrey cried when she told her about his death. Book: Stephanie is promoting her autobiography . Mark was found . dead in his New York loft apartment on the second anniversary of his . father's arrest last year - as their young son Nicholas slept in the . next room. Her mother-in-law Ruth was banned from . Mark’s funeral by a furious Stephanie after flying from Florida to . Connecticut to attend the service following his death last December. She told ABC that she wrote Bernie a letter when he arrived in prison, describing his life without his two grandchildren - but he wrote back saying he was being treated like a celebrity in jail. Stephanie has now made clear in interviews that her husband was tormented by the prospect of being locked up like his father, who is serving a 150-year sentence for masterminding a $60billion scam. She changed her surname to distance herself from . the scandal. ‘(Bernie) stood there in the corner at my wedding watching . everyone dance, and he knew that everyone in that room was going to get screwed,’ she told ABC in an interview to be broadcast on Friday at 10pm Eastern Time. After her husband's Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, Ruth was warned by her sons Mark and Andrew to leave him or lose contact with them. At the time she chose her sons. But after Bernie was attacked in prison in 2009 she returned to his side and her furious sons severed all ties with her. But Ruth has now stopped visiting in a bid to salvage a relationship with Andrew. Stephanie is promoting her autobiography . ‘The End Of Normal: A Wife’s Anguish, A Widow’s New Life’, which is . coming out this week and is serialised in the latest issue of People magazine. She told ABC she is determined to live the rest of her life . without ‘deceit, lies, betrayal and sorrow’. An astonishing home video has been released of Stephanie and Mark Madoff’s wedding in 2004. It shows Bernie showing his wife Ruth to her seat, then a smiling Stephanie walking down the aisle with her father. She is seen wearing a beautiful white dress and holding orange flowers. She is accompanied by gospel choristers wearing purple, who enter singing: 'How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)' by Marvin Gaye. Stephanie is then seen saying her wedding vows with Mark in front of a floral arch. They are later videoed walking back down the aisle together and the wedding continues the Marvin Gaye theme with 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'. The video then shows their first dance to Love's Divine by Seal, before Stephanie is seen dancing with Bernie as guests cheer them on to disco music.

Her ex-partner, a former police detective, has been charged with her murder . This is the pretty policewoman and mother-of-two who was found brutally murdered and dumped in secluded woodland. Detective Constable Heather Cooper, 33, was . battered around the head with a baseball bat and stabbed in the throat . before her body was dumped in Blackdown Forest, Sussex, and covered with leaves. Her former partner Peter Foster was remanded in custody today, having been charged with murdering her at their £700,000 home on October 16. Ms Cooper, who had recently given birth, was found in . the early hours of Monday morning by colleagues after concerns were . raised about her safety over the weekend. The picture, believed to have been taken several years ago, shows the mother-of-two in happier times. Mr Foster, a former detective who worked for Surrey Police until he was made redundant, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address at the brief two-minute hearing at Worthing Magistrates' Court. He wore jeans and a T-shirt and showed no emotion as the murder charge against him was read out to the packed courtroom. After being remanded in custody he thanked the magistrate. He is due appear before a Judge at Lewes Crown Court tomorrow for a preliminary hearing. Police said a knife and a baseball bat had been discovered at the family home where they believe the murder took place. A post-mortem examination showed Ms Cooper had sustained 'blunt force trauma to the head and an incised wound to the throat.' Her . shocked family said in an emotional statement: 'As a family we are . devastated by the loss of Heather in such tragic circumstances. Ms Cooper's ex-partner, former detective Peter Foster, has been charged with her murder . Police were called to the family's home in West Street, Haslemere on . Sunday.

Surrey and Sussex Assistant Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said: 'Heather's death has had a profound effect on all who knew her and we are doing everything we can to support her family at this difficult time. 'She was an exceptional officer and much loved among her police colleagues, many of whom were also her friends. 'The police service is in many ways like a family. The death of any officer is always a time of sadness but to lose Heather under such circumstances has been particularly hard to bear.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson and Richard Shears . Last updated at 11:10 PM on 21st October 2011 . Few people manage to overshadow the Queen. But all Elizabeth Cambage had to do today was stand next to her. At 6ft 8in in her bare feet and 7ft in her heels, the basketball player towered over the 5ft 4in monarch who had to look skywards to say hello. The Queen met British-born Miss Cambage after a civic reception during her Australian tour and immediately saw the funny side. At 6ft 8in, basketball player Elizabeth Cambage towered over the Queen (and most other guests) Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard bows to Queen Elizabeth II before a reception in the Government Building in the Australian capital of Canberra . The Queen enjoyed meeting someone as tall as Miss Cambage and introduced her to Prince Philip . Bow or shake? In this picture Julia Gillard appears undecided between accepting the Queen's hand and bowing . It was in stark contrast to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who the day before had greeted the Queen as she arrived in the country with a handshake and a bow instead of following protocol with a curtsey. And despite the row that ensued, Miss Gillard still refused to curtsey when she met the Queen today. Instead she performed two shallow . bows of her head, once as she entered a room at Parliament House, . Canberra, and a second time as she approached the Queen whose hand was . outstretched. She quickly put her hand out to the monarch and shook it. She also stood with lips sealed as the British anthem was played at the start of the reception in the Monarch’s honour. She did, however, sing the Australian anthem. The Queen later met Miss Cambage who, without her shoes, is 6ft 8in tall. There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms. For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way. On presentation to The Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'. For male members of the Royal Family the same rules apply, with the title used in the first instance being 'Your Royal Highness' and subsequently 'Sir'. For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is conventionally 'Your Royal Highness' followed by 'Ma'am' in later conversation. www.royal.gov.uk . 'Oh,' exclaimed the Queen when she . came across Elizabeth in the foyer of the Australian Parliament building . after a civic reception, 'you must be a basketball player.' 'Yes, I . am,' replied Elizabeth as, having no other choice, she made a very deep . curtsey. Then the younger woman asked the . Queen, with a cheeky grin: 'What gave it away?' 'You are very tall,' said the Queen, looking up to make the comment. 'That must be an advantage.' 'It is a bit,' said Elizabeth. Clearly amazed by Elizabeth's height, . the Queen turned to Prince Philip, who was standing a short distance . away 'This is an Australian basketball player,' she said, gesturing . towards the sportswoman. The Duke peered upwards. 'Yes,' he . said,' that would be right.' Dressed in a very long pink Carla Zampatti . gown that reached down to her ankles, Elizabeth the sportswoman, who was . born in Guys Hospital, London said later: 'The Queen is very sweet and . Prince Philip seems like a lot of fun. 'He was grinning when he made his . comment about the Queen being right when she guessed I played . basketball' Elizabeth's Nigerian father stands at 6ft 4in and her mother . is 6ft. 'I don't have any brothers and sisters so I expect I've inherited all the tall genes,' said the lanky basketballer. Co-ordinated: The Queen and Prime Minister Julia Gillard stand next to one another in similar coloured clothes . Her . parents met in a London nightclub but three months after Elizabeth was . born her parents separated and her Caucasian mother moved to Melbourne . with her. It was there, . after proving herself in her school's basketball team, Elizabeth became . a professional member of Melbourne's Bulleen Boomers and also played . for the Australian Opals. She also played for the Tulsa Shock in the US. She doesn't have a boyfriend at present, she said, but it was obvious to everyone standing nearby after the Queen had been toasted at the civic reception that to avoid any awkwardness any suitor would need to have some high standing in the community. And travelling around in cars? 'Not a problem,' she said. 'I just have to move the seat back a bit.' Then, the sportswoman who without shoes still stands a soaring 6ft 8in in her bare feet, made her way for the door, a head and shoulders above all the other guests. Earlier, British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard added to the controversy already surrounding her following her decision not to curtsey before the Queen, when she stood with lips sealed as the British anthem was played at the start of the reception in the Monarch's honour. She did, however, sing the Australian anthem. Eventually the pair sat to discuss Australia's political situation and the precarious nature of a minority government . The Queen and Miss Gillard seemed to be getting along well as they chatted at a reception at Parliament House . One is amused: The Queen and Miss Gillard laugh together during a speech by the leader of the opposition . Miss Gillard, in a veiled reference . to the possibility of Australia becoming a republic one day, told the . Queen in her speech that 'we do not know where Australia's path of . nationhood may lead in the times to come.' But she added that she knew for a certain that the Queen's journey of service would continue. Earlier in the day when the pair first . met at Parliament House, the Queen offered a hand to the Australian . premier who then reciprocated and shook it and performed a shallow bow. Ms Gillard has faced criticism for . deciding not to curtsey to the Queen when she greeted the monarch as she . touched down in the country with Prince Philip. As the pair shook hands the republican said: 'Good morning your majesty, its lovely to see you again.' Referring . to the bright sunshine blazing down on the grounds, conditions Canberra . has enjoyed since the monarch arrived with the Duke of Edinburgh on . Wednesday, the Queen replied: 'It's beautiful again.' Ms Gillard said: 'It is a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'm glad the weather was so good for you yesterday.' Young girls offer flowers to the monarch as she makes her way through the building in Australia's capital . Ahead of the reception the Queen walked among people in the Marble Foyer . While . there she also met with Tony Abbott, the leader of the country's . opposition Liberal Party, where they discussed the problems of forming . minority governments. She . was referring to the experiences of Miss Gillard who had weeks of . political wrangling before she formed a government after elections that . produced no overall winner. The Queen rarely speaks about . her personal views in public and her words were recorded by the waiting . media who were given access to the first few moments of the audience. But . her comments were also formed by recent experiences as there were a . number of anxious days before David Cameron was able to form a coalition . government with the Liberal Democrats last year. Mr . Abbott met the monarch for an audience in the morning room of . Canberra's Government House after the sovereign had held discussions . with Ms Gillard. The Queen wasted no time raising the issue of the precarious state of Australian politics saying: 'It is an interesting time.' Australia's . minority government is the first in decades and commentators have said . it could easily be threatened by a ministerial misdemeanour or . by-election. The Queen shakes hands with guests ahead of the reception at the Australian seat of power in Canberra . A toast is raised to the Queen as she sits next to Prince Philip at Parliament House . Mr Abbott replied to the Queen's . opening statement saying: 'It is never dull, we play our politics tough . in this country and give no quarter, Australian society is always . dynamic.' He made the Queen laugh when he added: 'We like to think we're the happening place your majesty.' The . monarch replied 'a minority government is always a difficult thing to . organise', before the talks continued behind closed doors for almost 20 . minutes, half the time the sovereign spent with the Prime Minister. The . Queen and the Prime Minister chatted about the previous day's events, . when the royal couple toured Lake Burley Griffin in a VIP motor launch . and attended the flower festival. The . Queen said: 'It was very popular, there were lots of people there to . see the boat go past', and Ms Gillard replied: 'I suspect there were . more people because you were there.' The monarch added: 'It was very nice to be able to do that and see the flowers. I had no idea that they do that every year.'","Gillard appears unable to decide whether to bow or shake hands .

Most holidaymakers bring back tacky t-shirts, sticks of rock and trashy trinkets from their travels abroad - but not these tourists. They picked up butterfly knives, police batons and even a stun gun disguised as a torch as their holiday mementos. The fearsome weapons were rounded up by customs officials at the UK's borders from tourists who thought they could bring them back into country and some were on display at Birmingham Airport today. From 1 April 2010 until 31 March 2011, 2,477 offensive weapons were seized from people travelling through UK ports. Haul: UK Border Agency Assistant Director for the Midlands Alex Lawther with weapons seized at Birmingham airport . UK Border Agency officers said if Britons try to bring back dangerous souvenirs they risk prosecution by doing so. Even if the items are brought in to the country innocently, passengers could fall foul of strict laws governing weapons possession. Many holidaymakers are caught out because the weapons are freely available to buy in foreign countries. Items from Bulgaria and Turkey accounted for a large percentage of the 230 weapons seized at Birmingham Airport since June. Dangerous: Items from Bulgaria and Turkey accounted for a large percentage of the 230 weapons seized since June . And weapons purchased as souvenirs from market stalls in Eastern Mediterranean countries also featured in the bumper crop of offensive items. But items from further afield, such as a lethal-looking pair of machetes, had also been seized. Alex Lawther, assistant director for the UK Border Agency in the Midlands, said: 'Most of these items are freely available on sale at the market in Bulgaria, Turkey, Cyprus and parts of the Eastern Mediterranean. 'Many people mistakenly think they can bring one home as a souvenir. 'Those caught trying to smuggle these dangerous weapons into the country or simply unaware of the controls in place should be warned that these weapons will be found and taken off them and they could face prosecution.' Memento: UK Border Agency officers seized over 200 potentially lethal and offensive weapons brought back as souvenirs by passengers arriving in Birmingham . Even if there is no criminal intent, Mr Lawther said that the deadly weapons could fall in to the wrong hands. He said: 'The weapons get more and more sophisticated, some of them are really vicious and could have terrible consequences.' Mr Lawther said that weapons are often brought in by young people, unbeknownst to their parents. He said: 'A lot of the time when you find one it's in an adolescent's suitcase. 'They're often surprised when we find it, but there has been the occasional argument with a parent who claims it's just a souvenir.' Confiscated weapons are either sent to a special warehouse to be disposed of, while some are put on display at the UKBA's 'Seized' museum in Liverpool.","Last year 2,477 dangerous weapons were seized from UK ports .

"By . Becky Barrow and Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 8:50 AM on 19th October 2011 . A record rise in inflation could cost taxpayers billions of pounds through huge increases in payments to pensioners, retired state workers and benefit claimants. As most workers face meagre wage rises or pay freezes, those on state support can expect their income to soar by 5.2 per cent. Official figures published yesterday show the consumer price index – a key measure of inflation – rocketed last month from 4.5 per cent to its highest rate since records began. Bank of England: Inflation has risen after the Bank re-started its programme of quantitative easing . As the Government uses September’s . inflation rate to determine the annual increase to benefits and pensions . introduced the following April, this paves the way for huge hikes worth . almost £3.4billion. Under the established rule, the State . pension – currently worth £102.15 a week for those entitled to the full . amount – would rise by £5.31 a week next year. However, the Prime Minister’s . official spokesman yesterday said that al-though the September inflation . figure and April increase were ‘usually’ linked, the ‘actual decision’ will not be made until November or December – fuelling fears that . ministers are looking for a get-out clause. One possibility is that the State pension will be increased in line with expectations, but benefits will not. Welcome relief: The state pension will rise by £8.49 a week for couples . Gross Domestic Product 0.1% . Average earnings up 1.8% . Consumer Price Index 5.2% . Retail Price Index 5.6% . Household expenses up 8.6% . Restaurant and hotel bills up 4.7% . Clothing prices up 4.4% . Communication costs up 0.9% . Unemployment rate 8.1% . But Whitehall sources have cast doubt . on the likelihood of this scenario, as it would hit the most . vulnerable, such as the disabled. One insider insisted it could not . happen, adding: ‘There would be uproar.’ Brendan Barber, general secretary of . the Trades Union Congress, said the possibility of scrapping an April . rise was ‘very alarming’. The cost of the increase would be an unwelcome . burden to a government already battling to control its chaotic accounts . inherited from Labour. The respected Institute for Fiscal . Studies think-tank  put the bill for an across-the-board 5.2 per cent . rise at around  £3.4billion, according to account- ants KPMG. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The . Government reconfirmed its policy to change the index used to increase . many benefits from RPI to CPI in the Budget in March, and the forecasts . for the public finances are based on this assumption. Energy companies are the new banks. They are the objects of enormous public mistrust for very simple reasons. Household bills are soaring at a time when family incomes are under unprecedented pressure, and despite their protests, the Big Six energy firms appear to be making fat profits out of it. Even relatively well-off people are reeling at the size of their bills, and shivering in a thick sweater rather than risk turning up the heating a notch, says RUTH SUTHERLAND . Read more here . ‘Benefit rates for April in cash . terms are set in the Social Security Benefits Up-Rating Order, due to be . published in December. This is exactly the same legislative process as . has been followed in previous years.’ The Office for National Statistics . had published a grim set of figures, with the retail price index hitting . 5.6 per cent, its highest level since 1991. RPI tends to be higher than CPI, because it includes mortgage interest payments and council tax – variables not included by CPI. The statistics show that the cost of . living is rising faster  in Britain than in any other  country in the . European Union, excluding Estonia. And in a further blow, a former . member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee, Andrew . Sentance, said inflation is likely to rise even higher as the effects of . energy price rises filter through the economy. The ONS already blames . power giants’ double-digit hikes for the considerable increase in . inflation. It said nearly 70 per cent of last . month’s increase in CPI was due to their increases, which have raised . the average family’s annual dual fuel bill to a record high of £1,345. Over the last three years, official . figures show inflation has jumped by almost 10 per cent – but private . sector pay has risen by just 4.2 per cent, while the public sector has . seen increases of 8.3 per cent. State workers earning more than £21,000 are currently under a pay-freeze. Many pensioners have been big losers too, due to the crippling effect of high inflation on their fixed incomes. Yesterday a report from insurance . firm Standard Life said a 90-year-old man who retired at 60 in 1981 with . a flat-rate pension of £10,000 a year had the ‘purchasing power’ of . just £3,207 a year today. His petrol, for example, would now cost about £1.34 a litre, compared with 35p a litre 30 years ago. Rising life expectancy means that . retirements last longer than  ever before – but sadly millions do not . have enough money to enjoy their longer lives. The director-general of Saga, Dr Ros . Altmann, yesterday warned that rampant inflation was ‘silently stealing . older people’s assets’.","Price rise will BENEFIT pensioners as state pension goes up .

They were trying to boost Union's morale with the Haka as the players left the field, reported the Deseret News and Salt Lake Tribune.

"Comes after such deals attacked by the Office of Fair Trading for repeatedly misleading shoppers . By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Last updated at 8:27 AM on 20th October 2011 . Cash-strapped shoppers are turning away from supermarket bulk-buy offers in a bid to cut costs and food waste, according to a Bank of England report. It said retailers were increasingly finding multi-buy deals such as ‘buy-one-get-one-free’ less effective. The findings come after such offers were criticised for offering ‘bogus’ bargains, luring customers into buying more than they need and not always saving them money. Shelving multi-buys: Shoppers have become increasingly suspicious of supermarket deals . The Bank’s report, published today, said families remain ‘focused on value for money’, with discount shops and cheap online options enjoying a booming trade. It said: ‘Some retailers suggest that multi-buy promotions were becoming less effective. ‘[This is] perhaps because consumers had become more focused on containing spending, or reducing waste.’ It comes after such deals were attacked by the Office of Fair Trading for repeatedly misleading shoppers. One of the scams involves supermarkets regularly abusing the fact that people believe buying in bulk saves money, which is not always correct. For example, a ‘bigger value’ three-tin pack of Princes tuna for £5.68 was found to be nearly £1 more expensive than buying three individual tins. Shoppers are penalised for not bothering to do the arithmetic to work out what is cheapest. Tempting? Shoppers are bombarded with deals in supermarkets . And in April, the Local Government Association said multi-buy deals are partly responsible for a £13.7billion-a-year mountain of wasted fresh produce. The Association complained that deals on products with a short shelf life mean a lot of food is thrown away. The Bank’s report, called Agents’ Summary of Business Conditions, highlighted a number of other ways that families are trying to cut back.These included ‘shorter’ holidays ‘spent closer to home’. It said higher prices for essentials had ‘squeezed the amount of income left for more discretionary services, causing a decline in spending on a range of leisure activities’.","Study finds families remain ‘focused on value for money’, with discount shops and cheap online options enjoying a booming trade .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:06 PM on 19th October 2011 . Revelations: Chris Skidmore, MP for Kingswood, discovered foreign nationals who are treated medically in the UK but do not pay their NHS bills have cost the service more than £40 million . Foreign nationals who are treated medically in the UK but do not pay their NHS bills have cost the service more than £40 million, a Tory MP claimed today. Chris Skidmore discovered 118 trusts had written off a staggering £42 million - and believes the total figure could be more than £50 million as he is still due responses from another 66 trusts. The MP for Kingswood, Bristol, made the revelation in the Commons as senior Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said all foreign nationals should sign an agreement when entering the country not to claim free treatment on the NHS. Health Minister Simon Burns said the Government was aware of the problem and was looking at banning foreign nationals from re-entering the UK if they had an unpaid bill for treatment on the NHS. According to figures collated by Mr Skidmore's office, Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust in London is the worst offender. It has written off £6.2 million since 2004 and has another £1.8 million of outstanding debt it is still hoping to collect. Croydon Health Services has written off £1.6 million but elsewhere in the country the figures are much lower. Speaking outside the Commons, Mr Skidmore said: 'In terms of the NHS, services are going to be stretched over the next few years and it is worth looking at who is using those services. 'It's a worrying trend that has increased over the last couple of years and it is one that my constituents get very angry about. It's unnecessary and shouldn't happen.' Mr Skidmore said a scheme in Slough, where foreign nationals not entitled to free health care are offered the minimum amount of treatment they need following an accident before being asked to leave hospital, should be rolled out elsewhere in the country. Worst: Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust in London has written off £6.2 million since 2004 and has another £1.8 million of outstanding debt it is still hoping to collect . He added: 'This would not be a big saving but it's the principle of knowing who is using the NHS. 'If you are not paying British taxes and you are not a British citizen, then there is no reason why you should have free health services. 'It's a national health service, not an international one.' Under current rules, foreign nationals residing in the UK and paying taxes are entitled to free treatment on the NHS while the bill for European Union citizens is sent to their home country. But visitors from outside the EU are expected to either have health insurance or they are sent the bill. Many leave the UK after receiving treatment without paying it. Mr Vaz said the problem could be easily solved. He told the Commons: 'There is a relatively painless way of dealing with this. At the time the visa is applied for, the person coming should sign an undertaking that they will pay the costs of their treatment.' Mr Burns said the Government was already looking at solving the problem of foreign nationals not paying for the NHS for treatment they receive. He said the practice was an 'important issue' for the NHS and the Government was looking at a 'whole range of options'. Mr Burns told the Commons: 'We have updated and simplified regulations and guidance on identifying and charging visitors who must pay. Immigration rules which are now before parliament will allow the UK Borders Agency to refuse entry to visitors with an unpaid debt to the NHS. 'We are now reviewing this area more fundamentally to identify further improvements.' Mr Skidmore made his discovery after submitting Freedom of Information requests to primary care trusts (PCTs) and foundation trusts up and down the country.","Total figure could be more than £50 million .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 10:34 PM on 14th October 2011 . Rising . profits: The dark yellow net margin line on this graph spikes from August . this year upwards, with Ofgem predicting that suppliers' margins will . level out more next year if fuel bills and prices remain the same . Profit margins at the ‘big six’ energy firms have leapt more than 700 per cent as millions worry about keeping warm this winter. The average amount of profit per  customer has risen from £15 a year to £125 in just a few months, according  to the industry regulator Ofgem. The increase is a result of inflation- busting price rises that have pushed up the average annual dual fuel bill by 15 per cent, or £175, to a record high of £1,345. Most of this rise, £110, has gone straight into the profits of British Gas, Scottish & Southern Energy (SSE), E.ON, npower, EDF and Scottish Power. The increase – challenged by the power firms – will infuriate families and pensioners struggling to cope with the biggest cost of living squeeze for at least 60 years. Charities and consumer groups fear an increasing number will have to make a nightmare choice this winter between heating and eating. Some 4.5million households are in fuel poverty, which means they  may have to ration their heating  this winter. However, bills are predicted to rise another 25 per cent over the next four years, taking one in  four households – 7.25million – into fuel poverty. Customers will be hit by a ‘double whammy’ of having to pay for expensive imported gas and a £200billion programme to switch to wind, wave, solar and nuclear power to meet EU green targets. Families can protect themselves and make savings of as much as £300 a year by switching energy suppliers. However, many have been deterred because they do not understand tariffs or trust the energy firms. Yesterday Ofgem announced a radical shake-up designed to simplify the complex array of 400 tariffs that make it virtually impossible to find the cheapest deal. Energy firms blamed the price increases on increased dependance on importand and rising wholesale costs . Figures from Ofgem show the rise in suppliers' profit margins, as well as the corresponding price hike in fuel bills to over £1300 for customers . In future there will be a uniform standing charge and simple unit costs for electricity and gas to help people make comparisons. Mike O’Connor, chief executive of the . official customer body Consumer Focus, said news of the increased . profits would ‘deepen the mistrust that consumers feel toward their . suppliers’. With around 400 tariffs available, Ofgem said most consumers view the energy market as overly complex and hard to navigate.It hopes that by forcing suppliers to provide a standard no-frills tariff, consumers will be able to make more informed choices about their energy bills.Here is a breakdown of its tariff reform proposals, which the regulator hopes could be implemented by next winter:● Each supplier can only have one standard tariff per payment method, per fuel. The three payment methods are direct debit, pre-payment meter and standard credit, such as credit cards and cheques.● Consumers will get a simple unit price and a fixed standing charge set by Ofgem - enabling them to choose the cheapest standard tariff more easily. The regulator hopes this will enable households to tell at a glance whether they can save money by switching supplier or moving to a new deal.● All other tariffs must have a specified end date and fixed terms and conditions. With these ""innovative"" tariffs, there will be no restrictions on the number, type, structure or duration of fixed term contracts, including exit penalties.● Automatic rollover at the end of the contract will be banned. Customers who do not sign up to a new deal when their fixed term contract ends will default to the standard tariff. They will also be free to switch.● Ofgem wants all energy prices to be displayed in pounds and pence, for example '£/month' as well as 'p/kWh'. Its research shows that consumers can relate better to information presented this way. It will be the equivalent of an 'APR' comparison for gas and electricity.● Suppliers will have to publish the price of all their tariffs in the same way so consumers can compare between standard and fixed term tariffs. This will ensure greater transparency. Energy firm profit margins fluctuate . depending on the price they pay for wholesale gas and electricity, . coupled with other business costs, versus the retail price charged to . customers. Generally, the retail price is high enough to guarantee a . profit. Occasionally, wholesale prices  rise so high that, for a short . time,  the energy firms make a loss  per customer. However, overall the wholesale cost of . gas and electricity has risen by around 20 per cent since 2008, but the . price charged to customers has leapt by 60 per cent. Profits at British Gas, the UK’s . biggest supplier, soared by around a quarter in 2010 to a record . £742million. The firm claims the figure will be down this year. Its managing director, Phil Bentley, insisted Ofgem’s numbers  were wrong. ‘We are working hard to keep bills as . low as possible for all our  customers,’ he said. ‘Ofgem’s report is . misleading. The methodology  is flawed.’ Christine McGourty, of Energy UK, which speaks for the big suppliers, also dismissed Ofgem’s profit margin figures. ‘A snapshot of profits every few months does not provide a realistic picture of the average profits over a year,’ she said. ‘Energy companies do need to make a profit as they are investing billions each year.’ Energy Secretary Chris Huhne has . called a summit of industry leaders, consumer groups and regulators for . Monday to find ways to help customers this winter. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'We . think a simple format should be applied across all tariffs, so that . people can compare the full range of energy deals at a glance.' Rising . utility bills helped push consumer price inflation up to 4.5% in August . and are forecast to send it close to, or even above, 5% as all of the . recently-announced increases come into effect. Scottish . Power was the first of the major groups to raise prices when it put gas . tariffs up by 19% and its electricity charges by 10% from August 1. Market . leader British Gas increased gas bills by 18% and electricity by 16% in . August, while in September Scottish and Southern Energy raised . electricity by 11% and gas by 18%, along with E.ON, which increased its . electricity prices by 11.4% and gas by 18.1%. Npower . raised gas prices by 15.7% and electricity by 7.2% from October 1, . while price rises of 15.4% for gas and 4.5% for electricity come into . effect for EDF customers on November 10. An undercover investigation by . consumer group Which? recently revealed that even staff at energy firms . are confused by the dizzying amount of tariffs offered by suppliers. Energy . firms were found to be providing customers with incorrect information . about the number of tariffs available and are being kept in the dark . about the best deals, undercover research has found. Suppliers have already started to move to address some of Ofgem's concerns. Earlier . this week, Scottish & Southern Electricity announced plans to sell . all of the electricity it generates on the open market, compared with . the regulator's proposals that 20% of all supplies must be auctioned by . 2013.","Ofgem say suppliers need to 'restore confidence' in industry .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 4:26 PM on 17th October 2011 . The average house price in the South is now more than twice as high as in the North, a study has revealed. It is thought to be the first time that the North/South gap has widened to this extent. Despite widespread economic gloom, experts say that asking prices across London, the South-East, South-West and East Anglia rose by 4.7 per cent last month. House Prices . However, prices in the North and North-West, the West and East Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and Wales fell by 0.7 per cent. The typical property in the South now costs £336,743, compared with £164,347 in the North. The £172,396 gap is the largest recorded in the nine-year history of property firm Rightmove’s pricing index. Property prices had been predicted to . fall by as much as ten per cent by 2013 due to the challenging financial . climate, but Rightmove said the South, and London in particular, . continues to exceed expectations. In the four years since the start of the credit crunch, asking prices have fallen by 9.6 per cent in the North - but jumped 5.4 per cent in the South. Rising house prices in the South are pricing many would-be buyers out of the market . Rightmove spokesman Miles Shipside said: ‘Wider access to mortgages and rising asking prices are early signs of increasing demand, giving homeowners some grounds for hope of a market recovery.’ However, he added that the reality was a ‘two-tier’ market with a ‘growing price gap’. The firm’s report suggested high unemployment in the North had driven prices down. ■ A mansion put on sale for £70million six years ago is reported to have finally come under offer - for less than half the original asking price. Surrey’s Updown Court - also known as Bling Towers – boasts five swimming pools, a heated marble driveway, a bowling alley and escape tunnels.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:18 PM on 22nd October 2011 . Death: Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud died in New York today . Prince Charles and Foreign Secretary William Hague have led tributes to Saudi heir Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz who died today. Foreign Secretary William Hague said . he was sad to hear of the Crown Prince's death: 'He served the Kingdom . of Saudi Arabia for many years with great dignity and dedication. 'His contribution to the prosperity and development of the Kingdom will long be remembered.'I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the Kingdom and its people at this sad time.' The Prince of Wales was said to have sent a personal letter of condolence to the King of Saudi Arabia. A . Clarence House spokesman said: 'The Prince of Wales sent a personal . letter of condolence to the King of Saudi Arabia expressing his deep . sadness at the news.' His death has caused a constitutional crisis as questions are asked about who should succeed to the throne. The 85-year-old crown prince, who was the half brother of the ailing Saudi King Abdullah died at a hospital in New York City. Tributes: Prince of Wales and Foreign Secretary William Hague have sent letters of condolence . Aziz, who was the oil-rich kingdom's deputy prime minister, had been defence minister and minister of aviation for about four decades. With Prince Sultan's death, his brother Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz, the . longtime minister of interior, becomes the most likely candidate . to be next in line to rule after King Abdullah. A statement carried on state news agency SPA and state television said: 'With deep sorrow and sadness the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz mourns the death of his brother and his Crown Prince Sultan... who died at dawn this morning Saturday outside the kingdom following an illness.' Saudi television broke its schedules early on Saturday to broadcast Koranic verses accompanied by footage of the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's holiest site. Likely candidate: Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud is favourite to be successor to the throne . Sultan underwent surgery in New York in February 2009 for an undisclosed illness and spent nearly a year abroad recuperating in the United States and at a palace in Agadir, Morocco. He had an intestinal cyst removed in 2005 and had spent several months abroad for treatment and recreation. Aljazeera reports analysts believed he had been suffering from a form of dementia, and a March 2009 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks said he was 'for all intents and purposes incapacitated'. Unlike a traditional monarchy the succession of Saudi kingship goes from brother to brother, rather than father to son. The ruling royal family and the successor will always come from the House of Saud, which is one of the wealthiest and most powerful dynasties in the world, comprising of 7,000 members. Currently the throne goes from brother to brother of the children of King Abdul-Aziz. The House of Saud is composed of the descendants of Muhammad ibn Saud and his brothers, though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of Abdulaziz ibn Abdul Rahman Al Saud. The order of succession to the throne of . Saudi Arabia is determined by, and within, the House of Saud. It . strictly follows agnatic seniority, but a prince may be surpassed, or . another elevated. The Allegiance Council was created in 2006 to . facilitate the royal transfer of power. At least two brothers, Bandar and Musaid, are older than King Abdullah and Mishaal is older than Sultan. But each has stepped aside due to health reasons, family consensus, or unwillingness to participate in governing. He received a diagnosis of colon cancer in 2004. While Saudi Arabia insisted he was fully cured, diplomats in Riyadh said he had slowly retreated from participating in decision-making and often worked only for one or two hours a day. Many of his duties had been informally shifted to other princes, most notably to his son Khaled who led Saudi and Arab forces during the 1991 war to remove Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army from Kuwait. Prince Khaled, who is assistant defense minister, is also the owner of influential pan-Arab daily al-Hayat. While he was defense minister, Sultan spent hundreds of billions to modernize the forces of the country where Islam was born 1400 years ago, doubling the regular armed forces to more than 100,000 men and buying advanced weapons from all over the world. Born in Riyadh, Sultan was educated by private tutors and spoke some English. He was keen to maintain close ties with the West, especially the United States, though like the rest of the royal family he distanced himself from the U.S.-led attack on Iraq in 2003. The most likely candidate for the throne after Sultan is Prince Nayef, the powerful interior minister in charge of internal security forces. After Sultan fell ill, the king gave Nayef an implicit nod in 2009 by naming him second deputy prime minister, traditionally the post of the third in line. Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef is seen as being close to ultra-conservative clerics. Anyone who rises to the throne is likely to maintain the kingdom's close alliance with the United States. But there could be internal differences. Abdullah has been seen as a reformer, making incremental changes to improve the position of women, for example, and to modernize the kingdom despite some backlash from the ultra-conservative Wahhabi clerics who give the royal family the religious legitimacy needed to rule. Nayef, for example, is often seen as closer to the clerics.",Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz died today in New York City .
"By . Simon Walters and Glen Owen . Created 9:21 PM on 8th October 2011 . Iain Duncan Smith has ordered a crackdown on thousands of families with youngsters diagnosed with ‘naughty child syndrome’ who get new cars paid for by the state. The Work and Pensions Secretary has been shocked to learn that the families of more than 3,000 people suffering Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are believed to have been given vehicles under the £1.5 billion-a-year Motability scheme. Mr Duncan Smith is determined to stop what he regards as abuse of free cars for the disabled as part of his campaign to curb the UK’s annual £192billion benefits bill. Luxury: The £35,000 BMW X3, which claimants can get through Motability with a top-up payment of £9,000 . The number of people with cars paid for by the Government-funded Motability scheme has soared to 575,000 – up by 200,000 in just over ten years. The number of claimants receiving disability benefit for ADHD – or hyperkinetic disorder, as it is categorised by welfare officials – has rocketed from 800 a decade ago to 43,100 last year. An additional 55,900 claimants are given handouts for ‘behavioural disorders’, taking the total for ADHD-related conditions to 99,000. It has led to claims that a lack of proper checks has led to widespread abuse. Mr Duncan Smith was enraged to be told initially by his department that there were no precise numbers on how many people with the condition received free cars. Determined: Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith . However, after persistent enquiries by The Mail on Sunday, officials finally revealed that 3,200 such claimants qualified. Motability was launched in 1978 with a handful of specially modified cars, such as motorised blue three-wheel trikes and Mini Clubman Estates with a ramp at the back for a wheelchair. But now it is the biggest fleet- . management outfit in the UK. Mike Betts, its chief executive, earns £1.17 million a year. Its website openly advises claimants how to use the benefit to get luxury cars such as a £30,000 Audi A6, a £35,000 BMW X3 or a £37,000 Toyota Land Cruiser. Some doctors believe the big rise in the number of children said to have ADHD is a direct result of their parents’ right to claim disability benefit of up to £10,000 a year. While critics believe ADHD is just a label to describe restless or naughty children, psychologists insist it is a real condition which applies when a child is persistently restless, to the point where it has a detrimental effect on their development. Some adults are also affected. The Government says that about a third of a million children aged between six and 16 suffer with the disorder. Original: The blue three-wheeler Motability first offered disabled people . ADHD was almost unheard of 20 years ago, but the number of prescriptions for Ritalin – the controversial drug which suppresses symptoms – has rocketed from 2,000 in 1991 to close to 350,000. Motability claims are processed by the . Work and Pensions Department as part of the £12 billion-a-year . Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Successful claimants are handed over . to Motability, which supplies the cars. In more than seven out of ten cases people who get DLA receive it for life, with no more questions asked. DLA is divided into two elements – . ‘care’, worth up to £294 a month, and ‘mobility’, worth an additional . handout of up to £205 a month. Spoiled for choice: Motability's website has a number of cars on offer . To get the mobility element, families of sufferers must prove they need ‘guidance or supervision most of the time from another person when walking out of doors in unfamiliar places’. They can either spend it themselves on transport, or have it paid direct to Motability to provide a lease car. The £205 benefit is enough to cover the full monthly cost of cars such as a Vauxhall Astra or a Ford Focus on a three-year lease. However, it is not means-tested. If better-off claimants want a bigger or more luxurious car, they can supplement the grant with their own cash. For example, they can get a £35,000 BMW by handing over a top-up payment of £9,000. After three years, they get another new car. A claimant whose child has been diagnosed with ADHD can download a claim form which they can either post or submit online. They must set out the reasons why they . should receive Disability Living Allowance – for instance, because they . have trouble dressing themselves or using the lavatory. They should also explain why they . qualify for the ‘mobility’ element. According to advice on a Government . website, this would include ‘physical problems when walking out of . doors’ and ‘needing someone with them when out of doors in unfamiliar . places. You may, for example, need help to cross the road or avoid . obstacles.’ The claim should be backed up by a doctor’s reference. More than half of claims are approved without further checks. Once accepted, the claimant completes an online application at a car showroom. Motability confirms with the . Department for Work and Pensions that the claim has been approved before . providing a car which suits the claimant’s needs. More than 11,000 of the cars obtained via Motability are high-end models such as BMWs and Mercedes. In the past year, when many . people have been forced to sell their cars or buy second-hand because of . the recession, the number of Motability cars on the road has risen by . 35,000. Some car dealers have promoted the Motability scheme to claimants’ relatives by assuring them that they can keep the car at a separate address and use it for personal commuting and family trips without Government investigators finding out. A total of 200,000 of the cars are used by the disabled person’s friends or relatives. Motability’s website features reviews by What Car? magazine. The £35,000 BMW X3 is described as ‘striking a fine balance between comfort and agility .  .  . the cabin is classy and spacious’; the £30,000 Audi A6 is ‘refined and has a luxurious, spacious interior’. Last night a senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are determined to crack down on the spiralling disability benefit bill, stamp out abuses and increase the transparency of the system.’ A Motability spokeswoman said: ‘The objective of the Motability scheme is to offer mobility and independence to all customers. ‘This requires a wide range of cars, adaptations and wheelchair-accessible vehicles, so that customers have access to vehicles and adaptations that suit their individual circumstances, taking account of their conditions.’","Lack of checks means programme set up to help the disabled is open to abuse .

Last Sunday we said some 3,200 families of children with AttentionDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder were believed to have been given cars under the Motability scheme. In fact that total is the combined figure for two categories of recipients of the Higher Mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance and includes other behavioural disorders. Recipients choose whether or not to spend their allowance on a Motability car; generally about 30 per cent do so. Also, we described the qualification for the Lower Mobility component, rather than the Higher Mobility component required to claim a car, for which individuals must be declared virtually unable to walk."

Rules surrounding a cars-for-disabled service are to be tightened after it emerged that high-end models could be being used by able-bodied friends and family of debilitated drivers. State-funded charity Motability - which offers concessions on new cars for disabled motorists - says the number of people using the service has shot up from 200,000 to 575,000 also said it would no longer offer . The service, which costs £1.5billion a year, offers modified cars to those who qualify for government help with a disability. However the Government is concerned that not enough checks are being made on those registered for the scheme and believe vehicles are being routinely passed on to claimants' friends and family. As well as amending its qualifying rules, Motability also said it would no longer be offering top-of-the-range cars. The move comes after allegations emerged that models such as BMWs and Mercedes were actually being used able-bodied drivers. Lord Sterling, Motability chairman, said today that there were a 'small amount of customers who will try to abuse the scheme'. He added that during Motability's last financial year, the charity had taken enforcement action in 2,139 cases, including 829 customers who had had their agreements terminated and their cars withdrawn. The announcement will mean that the number of car models offered in the charity's price guide will be slashed by more than half. Motability is tightening the rules over nominated drivers and pushing forward plans to increase its ability to investigate and act on allegations of abuse.

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 5:25 PM on 18th October 2011 . Patients are being banned by their GPs simply for making minor complaints. Entire families are being unfairly removed from practice lists and barred from making appointments following trivial disagreements with  doctors or staff. One complaint concerned a woman who had merely replaced a flat battery in a device administering anti-sickness medicine to her terminally-ill mother. Shocking: Entire families are being unfairly removed from practice lists and barred from making appointments following trivial disagreements with doctors or staff (picture posed by models) The woman - who is a trained nurse - said she did not want her mother to suffer while they waited for the practice nurse to arrive for a home visit. Do NHS GPs have too much power? But the surgery claimed her actions had undermined the  doctor-patient relationship and the woman and her dying mother were told they would no longer be treated by the practice. A report by Health Service Ombudsman Ann Abraham warns that increasing numbers of patients are being removed from doctors' lists 'without fair warning or proper explanation'. Once a patient has been taken off a surgery's list they are not allowed to make any other appointments, forcing them to find another doctor. Last year 2,581 complaints about GPs were made to the Ombudsman, an average of seven a day. Of the 48 complaints deemed serious enough for the Ombudsman to investigate fully, ten - or 21 per cent - concerned patients who felt they had been unfairly removed. This is more than three times higher than the proportion recorded last year when only 6 per cent of the complaints properly investigated concerned patients being taken off surgery lists. Warning: A report by the Health Service Ombudsman said increasing numbers of patients were being removed from doctors' lists 'without fair warning or proper explanation' In one case, an elderly woman and her husband were removed after she wrote to the practice manager to complain that receptionists did not answer the phone while she was trying to book an appointment for their seasonal flu jabs. In a telephone call the practice manager warned them he would ‘get you struck off for this’. In my work as an addiction specialist, I received - and still do receive - complaints all the time. One man believes that I, together with the KGB, was involved in the murder of his sister and his aunt. Another man, whom I saw twice, believes that I was responsible for his divorce - and the distress caused to his child - when I did not take his side against his wife, whom I had never met. That's just the way it is in my line of work and I would offer them my help again if they asked for it. But all these patients must have GPs somewhere and I would not blame those doctors at all if they said that enough is enough, says DR ROBERT LEFEVER . Read more here . Shortly afterwards they were removed from the surgery’s list. And a mother was barred by her GP after complaining to receptionists who had failed to find her an appointment to get her baby vaccinated before the family went on holiday. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of campaigning charity the Patients  Association, said: ‘Far too often patients tell us that they have been removed  from their GP list without warning or explanation. ‘Now the Ombudsman says that over a fifth of complaints in the last year were about patients being removed from GP lists, which is more than three times  higher than previous years.’ The report also warned that hospitals, GP surgeries and other NHS services were failing properly deal with complaints. The Ombudsman added that the NHS was ‘still not dealing adequately with the most straightforward matters’. Last night Health Minister Simon Burns said: ‘Our ambition is for a modern NHS, which is more accountable for the quality of care it provides and gives patients a stronger voice. ‘That’s why we need a culture of learning and listening in the NHS, so that mistakes are not repeated.’","Patients removed from doctors' lists 'without fair warning or proper explanation'

Scotland could be given the option to secure greater powers over their own government while remaining in the UK, according to SNP leader Alex Salmond. During a party conference, Mr Salmond introduced the notion of 'Devolution Max' as a possible third option for Scots who will decide whether to stay as part of the UK. The politician also warned Westminister to stay out of the issue and pledged that only Scottish voters had the right to vote on the issue. In a unprecedented concession Mr . Salmond acknowledged Devolution Max as attractive as it would leave . Scotland with powers over its government and economy while remaining in . the UK. According to the Independent newspaper he described the move as 'all good, . all necessary, but not good enough' – as it would leave Trident missiles . on the river Clyde, and exclude Scotland from 'the councils of Europe . and the world'. He said only complete independence would resolve these issues, 'which is why this party will campaign four-square for [it] in the . coming referendum.' The first minister also told the conference held in Inverness that he would fight claims that Westminster was planning to take control of referendum preparations. According to the newspaper he quoted the Irish nationalist Charles Stewart Parnell saying: 'No politician, certainly no London politician, will determine the future of the Scottish nation. 'The Prime Minister should hear this . loud and clear: the people of Scotland are now in the driving seat. The . days of Westminster politicians telling Scotland what to do and what to . think are over.' An independence referendum will be held at the end of the current five-year parliament. The first minister warned Westminister to stay out of the debate and pledged that only Scottish voters had the right to vote on the issue . Mr Salmond also accused coalition ministers in Westminster of trying to prevent Scottish independence, and slashing £16billion from the Scottish budget to reduce the deficit while benefiting from North Sea oil. He told the conference that London had already gained £300m from Scottish waters and vowed that independence would reclaim profits for Scotland.","Alex Salmond introduced the notion of .

Two young boys have died and two were badly hurt after getting trapped in a steel trunk at church, police in South Africa said today. The surviving two spent seven hours in the box and were only saved from suffocation when an adult found them. They emerged gasping for air having being imprisoned as their friends died. Tragedy: Homes in shanty town area of Soweto near Johannesburg . It is believed all four had been playing when they climbed into the trunk in a toilet at the church  in Soweto near Johannesburg. But when the trunk's heavy lid slammed down, trapping them inside, the children were left helpless. Police spokesman Kay Makhubela said it was believed the youngest two boys, aged three and six, had died. He said: 'This was tragic and very frightening for the children. The boys were playing around a church when they climbed into an old metal trunk in the toilet. 'The box was built from steel and had a heavy wooden lid which closed on them. 'The children were unable to open it and spent around seven hours trapped inside. 'When an adult finally found them two of the boys were dead and the other two had been stuck inside with their bodies.' The two surviving boys, both aged seven, were rushed to hospital after the incident on Friday. Medics treated them for the effects of oxygen deprivation and their condition was today described as stable. Warrant Officer Makhubela said post mortem examinations would be conducted to confirm what caused the two deaths. He added that police did not suspect foul play and had opened inquests into the tragedy. He said: 'The investigation continues but this appears to have been a tragic accident. 'It was especially frightening for the parents of the children who spent many hours searching for the boys. 'The children had been playing when they got trapped at around 2pm on Friday. 'It wasn't until after 9pm that they were discovered when an adult entered the toilet and heard some sort of movement coming from inside the trunk. 'She opened it and found the terrible scene inside. 'The families are obviously shocked by what happened but it seems it was a terrible accident.'","Two friends survived after being entombed in steel trunk near church in Soweto .

"By . Gareth Finighan . Last updated at 2:37 PM on 24th October 2011 . The full brutality of former Libyan tyrant Muammar Gaddafi's regime has been revealed in chilling video footage of prison torture sessions. And the fallen dictatorship's former foreign minister, Musa Kusa - who was released by the British authorities six months ago after he defected to the UK in March - is facing fresh allegations that he was directly involved in the beating of political prisoners. The footage - obtained by the BBC's Panorama programme - was reportedly shot at the notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli. It shows crouching inmates, blindfolded and wearing blue uniforms, being repeatedly whipped and kicked by interrogators. Brutal: A still from footage of a prisoner being whipped inside the Abu Salim prison during Gaddafi's rule . Last month the remains of more than 1,200 prisoners were found in a mass grave outside the prison's walls. The Panorama team tracked down Kusa to a luxury resort in Qatar during its investigation into his role in alleged war crimes. He declined to be interviewed for the programme. Kusa was head of Gaddafi's intelligence agency from 1994 and a senior intelligence agent when PanAm flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie. Inhumane: An inmate is kicked in the head by one official as a prison guard looks on . Back in the spotlight: Torture suspect Musa Kusa defected to Britain in April but moved to Qatar just weeks later . The Boeing 747 jumbo jet was en route from London to New York when it exploded over the Dumfriesshire town, killing 243 passengers, 16 crew and 11 residents. There have also been calls for Kusa to be quizzed in relation to the murder of PC Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot during a protest outside London's Libyan Embassy in 1984. Kusa made a high-profile defection to Britain in March and was interviewed by police and Scottish prosecutors investigating the Lockerbie attack. But within weeks he was allowed to leave the UK following an EU decision to lift sanctions against him, meaning he no longer faces travel restrictions or an asset freeze. No comment: Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon is blocked by a bodyguard while attempting to question Kusa . The Foreign Office said Kusa was a 'private individual' who had been interviewed voluntarily. But the ruling was condemned by one Tory MP who said Britain had become 'a transit lounge for alleged war criminals'. And Britain is now under fresh pressure to interview Kusa in relation to the allegations. Dr Jim Swire, whose 23-year-old daughter Flora died in the Lockerbie bombing, said that if anyone could offer any insight into the 'huge questions still unanswered' on Libya's role in Lockerbie, it would be Mr Kusa. High profile: Kusa was less reluctant about speaking to the press following his defection to London earlier this year . He said: 'When I met Musa Kusa in Libya in 1991 it was clear to me he was the guy who was central to the Gaddafi administration. 'He could tell us just as much as Gaddafi about Lockerbie as he was at the core of the regime. 'He was a very, very key figure and we need answers as to why he was allowed to fly back. Any probing over his crimes should be done by the International Criminal Court.' Pamela Dix, who lost her 35-year-old brother Peter in the atrocity, said she was 'incensed' after Mr Kusa was allowed to leave Britain in the first place. She said: 'We cannot turn a politically pragmatic blind eye. 'I do not know what Musa Kusa knows or does not know about Lockerbie but he needs to come back to answer those questions. 'I condemn the attitude of the UK Government in the strongest possible terms. A political hands-off attitude is inappropriate.'","Musa Kusa found in Qatar .

Fans were also spotted huddled near the track sobbing over the rider's death. He had only moved up to MotoGP level last year. The fatal accident comes just a week after British IndyCar racing driver Dan Wheldon died after crashing in Las Vegas. Organisers cancelled the race soon after Simoncelli's accident and said in a bulletin reported on website Autosport: 'Race cancelled as the medical . centre staff is focusing on treating Marco Simoncelli and track action . cannot be resumed in the current circumstances.'

"By . Rebecca Evans . Last updated at 12:42 PM on 24th October 2011 . Winner: Jo Wheatley, who won the Great British Bake Off, told producers of the show that her husband was in jail . The programme was billed as a  celebration of all things homely. But the truth about the life of this year’s Great British Bake Off winner is a far cry from the cosy domestic bliss viewers of the BBC2 series might expect. While mother-of-three Jo Wheatley’s wholesome cooking won her first place, it has now emerged that the 42-year-old Essex housewife is married to a professional gambler who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for his part in a £60million money-laundering racket. The Great British Bake Off was the surprise hit of the BBC’s autumn schedule, with its cookery book going straight to number one in the non-fiction chart. However, what the BBC did not tell either the show’s two judges or its  four million viewers was that Mrs Wheatley’s husband was jailed for seven years for conspiracy with others to conceal, convert and transfer the proceeds of crime. Richard Wheatley, 44, who is known as ‘The Bear’ on the international gambling circuit, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in April last year after £60million – allegedly the proceeds from drug trafficking – was laundered through a money exchange. The couple’s sons – Billy, 24, Jesse, 21, and Dylan, 16 – were interviewed for the programme at home, playing cricket in the garden and enjoying a happy tea party to celebrate their mother’s win. Yet there was no mention of their father, who will be eligible for release in two years. Even the show’s judges, cooks Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, did not know about Wheatley’s prison sentence until after the end of the series, in which they were won over by Mrs Wheatley’s ‘sublime’ cupcakes and ‘outstandingly delicious’ limoncello and white chocolate croquembouche. In one of the only interviews given since the show’s final on October 4, Mrs Wheatley admitted that her husband had a conviction for ‘fraud’ and added: ‘I was honest with the producers from the start but I didn’t want it to define me. ‘I didn’t want to use it as some  X Factor-style sob story.’ Criminal: Richard Wheatley, husband of bake off winner Jo Wheatley, is a poker player known as 'The Bear' . He is now in jail over a £60m money laundering racket . Kept in the dark: Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry was not told about Richard Wheatley's conviction until after the final . Asked if she would stand by her husband, she said: ‘Of course. I’ve known him since I was 15 and I love him.’ She said she ‘just wanted to do . something for myself’ and now hopes to set up a cookery school as a . means of supporting her family. Mrs Wheatley, who lives in a £500,000 . farmhouse in Ongar, Essex, already has a popular blog – Jo’s Blue Aga – . and has set up a series of cookery workshops. A book deal is said to be . in the offing. Her husband, meanwhile, lists his hobbies as urban art . and golf on his professional poker profile and boasts on Twitter of . dining at The Ivy and taking gambling holidays in Monaco. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Joanne Wheatley’s husband’s background bears no relevance to the programme. ‘She does not have a criminal conviction and was selected in the same way as the other contributors who appeared. ‘She is a talented baker and those talents have been recognised.’ Successful: Presenters of the Great British Bake Off Sue Perkins, left, and Mel Giedroyc .

Parts of Britain were today blasted with 60mph winds and lashed with heavy rain yet homeowners in other areas have been warned that a hosepipe ban could be on the way. As the storm hit Devon and Cornwall, the Met Office said other parts of the country have been as dry as northern Africa in the first half of the autumn. Just a quarter of an inch of rain - . 0.6mm - fell in some areas which is the same as Marrakesh up until October 19. There was . four times as much in Algiers. Take cover: A huge wave crashes over the seafront at Penzance, Cornwall this morning as heavy weather moves across the region . Stormy weather: Spray shoots off in all directions as a car makes its way through rainwater near Trerulefoot, Cornwall today . Weather warning: This Met Office map issued for today shows the areas where the rain is expected to fall. Those living in the yellow area need to 'be aware' and in the orange area - where it is expected to be heaviest - need to 'be prepared' The divisions in the United Kingdon are such that, over the same period, the Highlands have been hit with 810mm of rainfall compared with 22mm on the Isle of Wight. It has been so dry this year that . Severn Trent in Staffordshire has warned that it cannot rule out a . hosepipe ban next year - with reservoirs at just 50 per cent capacity. A warm start to the month - with temperatures hitting 30C on October 1 - has been a disaster for farmers. Water resource manager Marcus O'Kane . said: 'Unless we get sufficient rainfall over the autumn and winter, we . will not be able to rule out the possibility of usage restrictions next . year.' After weeks of dry weather, . firefighters faced a wall of flames as they tackled a huge gorse blaze . on the Cumbrian island of Walney. 10,000 square metres of grassland were . burnt in the fire. But with the winter months beginning to move in, a severe weather warning was issued for Devon, Cornwall and west Wales. Just as millions of children begin their half-term holiday, the storm was slowly spreading across the country with four inches expected to hit in west Wales. The cause of the sudden change is a . low-pressure system that is heading north from near Spain. Gusts . exceeding 60mph will add to the misery. Huge blaze: Frefighters tackle a huge gorse fire in Walney, Cumbria, last night after weeks of dry weather. Police are investigating the cause of the fire . Today heavy rain was threatening to cause . localised flooding in parts of Devon and Cornwall. Torbay seafront . in south Devon was closed and drivers were being warned about tricky . conditions after a long period of dry weather. Four teenage boys had to be rescued in . choppy conditions after their rigid inflatable boat capsized at the . mouth of the River Exe in Exmouth, Devon. A spokesman for the coastguard . said: 'The force seven winds and rough seas meant that it was a . difficult rescue for the inshore lifeboat, and so it was inadvisable . conditions to take a boat out for people of any boating capability.' Cornwall and Devon will be worst affected . with up to four inches of rain in a day, around the amount they . normally receive for the whole of October. Downpour: Devon and Cornwall was hit by up to four inches of rain overnight. Here, headlights on, cars drive through heavy rain this morning . Low pressure: A weather system heading from Spain will cause more strong winds and heavy seas, like these in Lyme Regis yesterday . Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan . said: ‘It’s going to be pretty unsettled over the next couple of days. Even if you escape rain on Monday you probably won’t escape it on . Tuesday. ‘The other thing is the wind will be . pretty strong in all places on Monday with a risk of gales towards the . south and west, particularly on the coasts.’ A severe weather warning has been . issued for most of the West Country and Wales, meaning there is the . chance of localised flooding and disruption to public transport. The West Midlands, London and the . South-East are also being urged to prepare for the possibility of severe . weather. Almost an inch of rain is expected in the South-East. A warning on the Met Office website said: 'Periods of heavy rain, . accompanied at times by strong winds, will affect parts of western . Britain during Monday. 'The public should be aware that . quantities of rain may be sufficient in a few places to disrupt travel . and give rise to localised flooding. In Northern Ireland the heaviest . rain is expected to arrive later in the day.' The rainy weather is expected to move . further north tomorrow, and warnings are in place for people in . southern Scotland to be aware of the conditions.

Weston, her boyfriend Gregory Thomas, . 47, and Eddie Wright, 50, will make their first court appearances in . Philadelphia on Monday on charges of kidnapping, assault and false . imprisonment. Wright is expected to plead not . guilty, but it is unclear how Weston and Thomas will plead.

She is slated to appear in . court on Wednesday and it is not yet known how she will plead. A landlord discovered the victims in a . dank boiler room. Police said the disabled adults, who have the mental . capacity of 10-year-olds, were malnourished and one was chained to a . boiler.

Vile: Makeshift beds and dirty blankets filled the sub-basement which was home to four vulnerable individuals . The rescue of four starving, . mentally handicapped people held captive in the filthy basement of the . building began with a landlord's suspicions about a pair of dog bowls. 'I knocked on the doors and said: ""Is . anyone feeding a pet?''' Turgut Gozleveli, landlord . Turgut Gozleveli, a retired electrical . contractor who cares for the building, said how on a routine . inspection, he noticed missing light bulbs in the basement and dog bowls . under a workbench. His discoveries ultimately led to the . arrest of four people and the rescue of three men and a woman from the . cramped basement dungeon in the working class Tacony neighbourhood. Mr Gozleveli, 71, who speaks with a . Turkish accent, said he assumed a tenant had stolen the bulbs but was . mystified by the bowls in the no-pets-allowed apartment building. 'I knocked on the doors and said: ""Is . anyone feeding a pet?''’ he recalled. All of the tenants he spoke to in . the seven-unit building, once a small neighbourhood cinema, said no. Suspicious: Landlord Turgut Gozleveli, left, became suspicious when he saw dog bowls and missing light bulbs . On Friday, he looked again and the . bowls were still there. Then he ventured down steps leading to a . sub-basement housing water heaters and another smaller room holding an . out-of-use furnace. 'We're going to prepare to prosecute . this here or, without hyperbole, wherever the prisons are going to be . the worst. Federal prisons might be too nice' Police spokesman Ray . Evers . He unwrapped a chain wrapped around . the handle of the metal door to the room and opened the door to find two . small barking dogs and piles of blankets on wooden platforms on the . dirt floor. He pulled back the edge of a dirty . quilt to find a man and a woman huddled underneath. There seemed to be . little else in the room except a urine-filled bucket that served as a . toilet.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 6:08 PM on 23rd October 2011 . Condoleezza Rice has revealed she once threatened to resign and often argued with Dick Cheney over how to deal with captured terror suspects. The former secretary of state has revealed George W. Bush’s presidential team often seriously fell out over how to protect the U.S. after 9/11. A new book reveals she was against ex-vice president Mr Cheney’s forceful approach and told him terror suspects could not be ‘disappeared’. Revelations: Ex-secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, right, once threatened to resign and regularly argued with former vice president Dick Cheney, she says . Her resignation threat came in November 2001 - when she found out Mr Bush had signed off military commands without her knowing, she wrote. But the order had been written by White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. She said it was not Mr Bush’s fault - and the president apologised to her. The revelations come in her new book ‘No Higher Honor’, which has been viewed by the New York Times ahead of its publication next month. Her book features flashbacks on how the U.S. tried to revolutionise its security after 9/11 and the terror fears that followed those attacks. Together: Ms Rice, left, has revealed the presidential team of George W. Bush, right, often seriously fell out over how to protect the U.S. after 9/11 . Ms Rice writes about scares soon after 9/11 over potential smallpox and radioactive attacks on Washington - which were not revealed back then. 'So what’s your plan, Condi? We’ll just let them kill each other, and we’ll stand by and . try to pick up the pieces?' George W. Bush to Condi Rice, as documented in her book . She clashed with Mr Bush five years ago . over his idea of sending more troops to Iraq because she wanted to . remove U.S. forces from the country, reported the New York Times. ‘So what’s your plan, Condi?’ she said he asked him. ‘We’ll just let them kill each other, and we’ll stand by and try to pick up the pieces?’ Months earlier they clashed over moving alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to Guantanamo Bay, reported the New York Times. Claims: Ex-secretary of state Colin Powell, left, said 'one of us needs to go' in reference to Donald Rumsfeld, right, before he left himself, she wrote . Book: No Higher Honor by Condoleezza Rice is due for release next month . Mr Bush eventually agreed with Ms Rice . that Mohammed should be moved there along with other terror suspects. She wrote ex-secretary of state Colin Powell said ‘one of us needs to go’ in reference to ex-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, before he left himself. Ms Rice claimed Mr Rumsfeld once told her ‘I don’t do detainees’ and said that his relationship with her ‘just doesn’t work’. In addition she writes about last-minute nuclear negotiations with India and almost reaching a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, . reported the New York Times. She added Colonel Gaddafi had an ‘eerie fascination’ with her and bizarrely made a video with pictures of her and a song called ‘Black Flower in the White House’. She also claims Lebanon President Emile Lahoud needed a shower.","Ex-secretary of state reveals post-9/11 Bush fallouts .

The mother and her two young children who were killed in their New York home as part of a murder-suicide have been laid to rest by distraught family and friends. More than 300 mourners gathered in Trevose, Pennsylvania, for the funerals of 46-year-old Amy Friedlander, and her children Molly, 10, and Gregory, eight, as the rabbi conducting the service spoke of the 'anger' and 'unspeakable grief that we are feeling'. Police say Sam Friedlander, 50, bludgeoned his banker wife to death with a chair leg last Tuesday, then shot his children in their beds before killing himself in the basement of their Westchester home.

Laid to rest: The funerals of Amy Friedlander and her two young children, Molly and Gregory, took place in Pennsylvania on Saturday, before a memorial yesterday . Remembered: Amy, left, was a generous and adoring mother, mourners said, while her children Gregory, eight, and Molly, 10, right, were athletic and fun-loving . Community: More than 300 mourners attended the service . At the Joseph Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel on Saturday, near where Amy grew up, her husband's face was noticeably missing from the photo collages in the lobby, while throughout the ceremony, his name was never mentioned. 'How could this have happened? It can't be real,' said a tearful Gary Perez, Amy's father, according to the New York Post. Mr Perez was reportedly too upset to say the final kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. 'There is a hole in the world where Amy, Molly and Gregory are supposed to be,' said Rabbi Craig Axler, who conducted the service. 'There are simply no words to prepare anyone for the unspeakable grief that we are feeling here today,' he said, according to the New York Daily News. 'There are no words to describe the anger or lack of justice we are experiencing here today. We come here as a family and community that is torn.' Killer: Sam Friedlander, 50, shot his two young children while they slept before bludgeoning his wife to death and then turning the gun on himself at his suburban home . On the market: The couple were reportedly going through a messy divorce and their $800,000 Cross River home, where the murders took place, had been put up for sale . When Mr Axler was a new rabbi almost eight years ago, he did a baby naming for Gregory, the Journal News reported. Amy was remembered as a loving mother and generous friend, Gregory a promising athlete with an infectious laugh and Molly a good friend, who was always inclusive. A cousin laid a 'best friends' necklace and a ladybug Pillow Pet on Molly's coffin, the New York Daily News reported. The three caskets were positioned side-by-side, with large fall floral arrangements on top. 'My sister, my best friend, Amy, you were taken away from me too soon,' said a tearful Jill Gobora, according to the New York Daily News. 'I wish in your lifetime you could have truly appreciated how funny, pretty, kind, and intelligent you really were.' 'You were such a loving, caring, and devoted mother,' she continued. 'Molly and Gregory were such wonderful children because of you and only you. 'My heart will ache for you every day.' The three were then buried in Montefiore Cemetery in Rockledge, before a memorial service yesterday at Jewish Family Congregation in South Salem, where the family were members. At yesterday's memorial service, a video in the Levine chapel lobby showed the mother and children during happy times — touring Hollywood, picking out Halloween pumpkins and celebrating birthdays, The Journal News reported. Amy and Sam Friedlander were going through a divorce and had encountered financial difficulties. Their four-bedroom $800,000 Cross River house was on the market.

She is the Kate Middleton lookalike who is said to have been caught canoodling with Prince Harry in San Diego. But as this photograph shows, cocktail waitress Jessica Donaldson, 26, isn't quite do similar to the regal duchess. The gorgeous brunette was snapped on a night out in a revealing white bikini top - showing off a huge tattoo covering the side of her midriff. While the rumours about the two persist, Jessica broke her silence to say: ‘He is a real-life Prince Charming.’ She added that she is ‘way flattered’ at suggestions that she resembles the Duchess of Cambridge – and called Harry ‘a total English gentleman’ - but denied reports of an affair. Jessica, who met Harry in the VIP area of the San Diego nightclub where she works as a ‘bottle girl’, said: ‘I am speaking out now because I want people to know the truth. 'I am not sleeping with Prince Harry and he has never been anything other than a total gentleman to me. ‘I am very upset that all this has blown up. He is just a regular guy who enjoys a few beers with his buddies. 'He’s . really cool and down-to-earth and that’s what I liked about him. I’m . flattered he showed me attention but there is nothing more to it than . that.’ Yet despite her protestations – and . with her burly boyfriend in the room with her – she becomes upset when . asked to explain photos on an American gossip website last week that . appear to show the pair kissing. Shaking . her head, she bursts into tears and runs from the room. Later, after . being comforted by her boyfriend, she says: ‘This is so hard and . difficult. I didn’t want any of this.’ Jessica, . known as ‘Jes’, said Harry entered the Ivy nightclub at the five-star . Andaz hotel in downtown San Diego on Friday, October 7. ‘His people called ahead and said . there was a VIP person coming with about 20 friends and could we secure . an area of the club for him. ‘I . had no idea the VIP was Prince Harry until he walked in. We are used to . seeing celebrities here like local sports stars and Johnny Knoxville . [star of MTV’s Jackass] but when Harry walked in, it was, “Wow!” ’ Jessica’s job as a bottle girl is to sell bottles of Belvedere and Absolut vodka with mixers for £350 a table. She said: ‘You buy a table and for that you get a bottle of vodka, some . mixers and soft drinks. You also get to stand in the VIP area. Our job . is to bring in rich guys who want to meet hot girls. The more bottles . you sell, the more you earn on commission. ‘Harry was with a big group, mostly . guys. There were quite a few security men with him. I waited on his . table and he was charming and chatty but he was charming to all the . girls. 'He paid for two of the bottles and his friend paid for a third. Harry started off drinking Stella but went on to vodka.’ The Prince’s group moved to a poolside cabana where they watched a Rugby World Cup match. At the end of the night, a man she believed was one of the Prince’s bodyguards, called Mark, asked for her number. ‘He said Harry would like to invite me and another girl, my friend Christie, for brunch the next day.’ Party boy: Prince Harry leaving the Andaz hotel in San Diego where he met Jessica . The girls met the Prince and four friends at a beachside cafe called Pipes the following day. ‘We hung out, had breakfast, talked, and I thought how cool it was to be with an English Prince. Harry had scrambled eggs. ‘Then we went to a Mexican restaurant and drank cocktails in the sun. Harry drank fruity cocktails and ate chips and salsa. He was joking about the weather and how much better it was than in England.’ Harry, who is on an Apache helicopter training course in El Centro, a two-hour drive from San Diego, had his friend text Jessica again last Saturday to invite her to the VIP area of the Belly Up Tavern in Solano Beach, a 20-minute drive along the coast from San Diego. Happier times: Jessica poses with a friend at the Ivy Nightclub at Andaz. She was upset at pictures which appeared to show her and Prince Harry kissing . The pair listened to a live band and danced. It was during this evening that photographers snapped the couple allegedly embracing. The Mail on Sunday has independently learned that Harry spent the night in Suite 202 at the nearby £70-a-night Marriott Courtyard in Solano Beach. Together: Jessica with her boyfriend of three years Brandon Thomason. Sales manager Cassie Smith said: ‘We had no idea he was coming. He arrived with his friends and checked in at the front desk like anyone else. We have now renamed his room the Royal Suite.’ Multiple sources at the hotel claimed to have seen a brunette fitting Jessica’s description arrive alone by taxi in the early hours. The woman was seen leaving around 6am. A night manager at the hotel yesterday looked at a photo of Jessica and said: ‘Yes, that is definitely her.’ But Jessica, who lives with her boyfriend of three years, nightclub promoter Brandon Thomason, 28, said yesterday: ‘No, no, that wasn’t me. It must have been another girl. I am sure Harry has lots of girls.’ Mr Thomason said: ‘When I first saw the pictures of Jes with Harry I talked to her and she assured me that nothing went on. She told me they didn’t kiss and I believe her. 'She said he leaned in to talk to her and it was just the angle of the camera that made it look like a kiss. ‘Jes wants to set the record straight. Harry might have been with a girl but it wasn’t Jes. If I didn’t believe her, I wouldn’t be here now.’ Jessica added: ‘Harry is so sweet. He was kind of goofy with me. I really like him but I have a boyfriend. I just want all this to go away.’ Top gun: Prince Harry stands in front of an Apache helicopter during his training in the US .","Jessica describes Harry as a 'sweet' and 'regular guy'

A witness told Capital news radio that a man asked to be let in to the bar shortly after 3am, hurled a grenade and fled the scene. 'It was a grenade attack. There are no deaths', central Nairobi police chief Eric Mugambi said. Wreckage: Police inspect the scene following a grenade attack on Mwaura's bar in Nairobi today . Blood stains can be seen on the floorboards inside the club following the attack . The blast came a week after Kenya . launched a cross-border operation against Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab . militants in southern Somalia following a wave of kidnappings of foreigners . on Kenyan soil. Al Shabaab had threatened major reprisals if Kenyan troops did not withdraw, prompting the U.S. embassy in Kenya to warn of an ‘imminent threat’ of a terrorist attack in the East African country. No one has claimed responsibility for the bar blast. A police officer keeps watch outside the club, which has been cordoned off . A police officer walking into the club to survey the damage . Witnesses reported blood and beer bottles splattered on the ground of Mwaura’s bar, which is frequented by blue-collar labourers attracted by its cheap beer and spirits. Blood stained a sink and overturned seats and debris littered the floor. Police cordoned off the area as an officer examined damage on the walls from the force of the explosion. Jacob Musembi, a vendor at the scene said: 'The guys came out running covered in blood. We helped them wash the blood off and they were carried away by ambulances. 'I’m very scared for my life because I don’t know who they’ll target next', he said. A victim of the explosion is attended to by a nurse in the emergency wing of Kenyatta National Hospital in the capital . Medics assist one of 14 victims injured in the grenade attack . A doctor at Kenyatta National Hospital said he had treated 13 people so far, some with serious wounds, but mostly with light head injuries. Al Shabaab has denied responsibility for the Kenyan kidnappings, saying Nairobi was using them as a pretext for its military campaign. Kenya has in the past initiated brief cross-border incursions, but the latest operation is on a much larger scale, raising fears the country could be dragged into the anarchic Horn of Africa’s two-decade-long civil war. An officer secures the scene outside the club with police tape. The ground can be seen littered with debris . The Islamist militants have proven capable of launching large-scale suicide attacks within Somalia and outside. Earlier this month, a suicide truck bombing claimed by the militants killed more than 70 people when it exploded outside a compound housing government ministries in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu. The militants have also claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, which killed 79 people last year. That strike, the militants’ first on foreign soil, was in revenge for Uganda’s contribution to the 9,000-strong AU peacekeeping force.","Fourteen people injured .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:09 PM on 24th October 2011 . Two men, from Manchester, were arrested on June 13 this year close to Joss Stone's home . A man appeared in court today to deny conspiring to murder the soul singer Joss Stone. It was the first time the new charge of conspiracy to murder the 24-year-old singer had been revealed. Kevin Liverpool, 34, appeared in the dock at Exeter Crown Court to plead not guilty to  conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to commit GBH and conspiracy to commit robbery. He is accused with Junior Bradshaw, 31, of targeting Stone, whose hits include Fell In Love With A Boy, between January and June this year. Bradshaw also appeared in court today but was not asked to enter pleas to any charges pending the result of psychiatric tests. The two men, from Manchester, were arrested on June 13 this year, close to the Devon home of Stone, who has an estimated £9million fortune. Stone is a friend of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and attended their wedding. The singer’s mother, Wendy Joseph, was in the public gallery during the short hearing. Both men were remanded in custody ahead of a trial scheduled for August 6 next year. Liverpool, who previously lived in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, appeared in the dock wearing a hooped jumper. Bradshaw, who wears his hair in braids, wore a plain grey t-shirt. The pair were arrested on the St Andrews Estate in Cullompton after being seen acting suspiciously in the area around the village of Langford in a Fiat Punto, several miles from the singer’s home near Ashill. At a previous hearing, a court was told items including a samurai sword and notes mentioning Stone’s name were found in the car. Police pictured outside the singer's Devon home at the time of the arrests . The singer released a statement at the time of the arrests saying she was 'absolutely fine' and 'getting on with life as normal' following the arrest of the two men . The singer released a statement at the time of the arrests saying she was ‘absolutely fine’ and ‘getting on with life as normal’ following the arrest of the two men. She said at the time: ‘I’d like to thank everyone for their concern but I’m absolutely fine and getting on with life as normal while the police continue with their inquiries.’ Born Jocelyn Eve Stoker, Stone shot to fame in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, The Soul Sessions. She has since sold more than 11 million copies of her five albums.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 12:11 PM on 24th October 2011 . A defunct German research satellite plummeted to earth at speeds of up to 280mph last night and crashed somewhere in Southeast Asia, a scientist said, but its exact whereabouts remain a mystery. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said two Chinese cities with millions of inhabitants each, Chongqing and Chengdu, had been in the minivan-sized satellite's projected path during its re-entry time. 'But if it had come down over a populated area there probably would be reports by now,' the astrophysicist, who tracks man-made space objects, said in a telephone interview. Artist's impression: Scientists are trying to establish how and where the German research satellite landed on Saturday night, after warning that some parts might survive re-entry and crash at high speeds . Most parts of the satellite were . expected to burn up as they hit the atmosphere, but up to 30 fragments . weighing a total of 1.87 tonnes may have survived the re-entry, the . German Aerospace Centre said. Calculations based on U.S. military . data indicate that debris of the ROSAT scientific research satellite . must have crashed somewhere east of Sri Lanka over the Indian Ocean, or . over the Andaman Sea off the coast of Myanmar, or further inland in . Myanmar or as far inland as China, he said. The satellite entered the atmosphere . between 9:45pm to 10:15pm Saturday EDT and would have taken 15 minutes . or less to hit the ground, the centre said. Hours before the re-entry, the center said the satellite was not expected to land in Europe, Africa or Australia. There were no immediate reports from . Asian governments or space agencies about the fallen satellite, but an . exact determination could take days. ‘I don't think that we'll have a confirmation of any sort today,’ the GAC spokesman said on Sunday, pointing out it also took NASA several days to establish where one of its satellites had hit last month. Bus-sized: Nasa's six-ton Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite made its final fiery plunge into the Earth's atmosphere last month . The 2.69-ton satellite was launched in 1990 and retired in 1999 after researching black holes and neutron stars and performing the first all-sky survey of x-ray sources with an imaging telescope. A dead NASA satellite fell into the . southern Pacific Ocean last month, causing no damage, despite fears it . would hit a populated area and cause damage or kill people. Experts believe about two dozen metal pieces from the bus-sized satellite fell over a 500-mile span. The largest single fragment that could hit into the earth is the telescope's heat-resistant mirror. During its mission, the satellite orbited about 370 miles above the Earth's surface, but after its decommissioning it lost altitude, circling at a distance of only 205 miles above ground in June for example, the agency said. Even in the last days, the satellite still circled the planet every 90 minutes, making it hard to predict where on Earth it would eventually come down. The German space agency put the odds of somebody somewhere on Earth being hurt by its satellite at one in 2,000 - a slightly higher level of risk than was calculated for the NASA satellite (see box). But any one individual's odds of being struck were one in 14 trillion, given there are 7 billion people on the planet.","Scientist says two heavily populated Chinese cities were in defunct satellite's path .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 24th October 2011 . A teenage care home worker killed an elderly resident after deliberately setting fire to the pensioner's room so she could 'act as the heroine', a court heard today. Irene Herring, 85, was rescued by firefighters from her top-floor, single-occupancy room at Ancaster Court in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, on February 1 2009. She was treated by paramedics and taken to the Conquest Hospital in Hastings, but died of pneumonia brought on by smoke inhalation the following day. Accused: Rebecca Reasbeck, left, pictured in March, faces a charge of manslaughter after allegedly starting a care home fire which killed resident Irene Herring, 85, right . Rebecca Reasbeck, 20, denies the manslaughter of dementia sufferer Mrs Herring, who was bedridden and unable to communicate verbally after a series of strokes. Opening the Crown's case at Lewes Crown Court, prosecutor Anthony Haycroft said: 'In summary, we allege that the defendant deliberately set fire to Irene's bedroom in two separate places. 'The defendant then, we say, pretended she could smell smoke and shortly after that a fire alarm sounded. 'We say this was because she did it - set the fire - to get attention and act as the heroine. 'Unfortunately, the fire got out of control. It generated so much smoke, no-one could get to Irene and she died as a result.' He said Reasbeck, who worked in the Bupa-run care home's laundry room at weekends and was a kitchen assistant during the week, was aged 17 at the time of the incident, which took place on a Sunday. Arson attack: A police officer stands outside Ancaster Court in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, following the fire that claimed Mrs Herring's life . Mr Haycroft said that by 9am Mrs Herring had been cleaned, dressed and made comfortable by staff ahead of the arrival of her husband, David, who usually came to visit her every day at around 11am. Reasbeck had been working in the laundry room on the ground floor while Mrs Herring's room was on the top floor of the three-storey building and diagonally opposite from it, he added. At around 9.45am, nurse Sindhu George and care assistant Jimmy Fyffe passed Reasbeck coming towards them from the direction of Mrs Herring's room, the court heard. She told them she had smelled a plastic burning smell from down in the laundry room and had come to investigate. Mr Haycroft said that they both sniffed the air with Ms George saying she could 'smell something, but only very faintly,' while Mr Fyffe smelt nothing. Rebecca Reasbeck's case at Lewes Crown Court is a re-trial, after she was originally accused of murder . Moments later, the fire alarms sounded, which meant that all the doors to the 12 residents' rooms on the floor, which were usually kept open in the day, automatically closed. The court heard that as the building was evacuated, Maria Chatto, the nurse in charge that day, investigated what had set the alarms off and then saw that smoke was seeping out from around the door of Mrs Herring's room. All the remaining residents were then evacuated and the fire service was called, arriving minutes later at 9.58am. Mr Haycroft said that in the meantime Steven Walter, another care assistant who had returned upstairs, noticed Reasbeck outside Mrs Herring's room. She was heard saying 'oh my God' and seemed 'panicked'. The court heard that just three days earlier, staff at the home - including Reasbeck - had undergone fire safety training, but she was seen by Mr Walter to put the palm of her hand on Mrs Herring's door, contradicting the advice they had been given to only put the back of their hand on a door to check for heat. She also went directly against the advice given by opening the door despite Mr Walter telling her not to. Mr Haycroft said she told him they had to get Mrs Herring out, but they were met with a wall of thick black smoke and could not enter the room. Firefighters then arrived and rescued Mrs Herring from the room and she was rushed to hospital where she died at 6.45am the next day with her husband by her side. Mr Haycroft said that fire crews then used their hoses to dampen the flames without disturbing the scene, and it was found that the fire had been set in two places. A cushion from a commode chair in the room was found under the spare bed and burn marks on it were found to correspond to those on the commode seat. The second fire was found to have started on an electric reclining chair in the room, the court heard. The court heard a post-mortem examination on non-smoker Mrs Herring found she had no drugs or alcohol in her system, so there was no suggestion she had been drugged. Mr Haycroft told jurors the case was a re-trial and Reasbeck, of London Road, St Leonards, had originally been charged with murder. The case continues.","Care home worker 'set room on fire', then 'pretended she could smell smoke to get attention'

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 7:09 AM on 21st October 2011 . At first glance, you could be forgiven for thinking that a group of painters and decorators had left behind a pile of their paint-spattered dust-sheets. In fact this collection of crumpled paper, suspended plastic bags and scattered chalk is the work of one of the four finalists in this year's annual Turner Prize competition. The other artists' work includes enamel paintings of mundane scenes including a dog dirt bin and a rundown pub, shaky split-screen videos of tower blocks and a piece titled 'Do Words Have Voices' which features a battered and scratched wooden table. What do you think of it so far? Martin Boyce's rubbish bin vying for a £25,000 prize . Controversial choice? Karla Black's 'More of Today' features plastic bags suspended from the ceiling of the impressive Newcastle art centre . Very contemporary: Visitors are able to wander around and under Karla Black's work on display at Newcastle's Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art . The exhibition for the world's most controversial prize for modern art launches in Newcastle's Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art tomorrow. This is the first time the  Turner Prize has been held at a non-Tate venue in its 27-year history. But the displays are certain to generate the same amount of criticism about whether they deserve to be defined as art. The prize is notorious for rows over the artistic merit of its exhibits - which have included an unmade bed, balls of elephant dung and a room with a light turning on and off. This year's finalists are only slightly less controversial. Karla Black's innovative approach to sculpture sees her suspending plastic bags from the ceilings of galleries and using small scrunched up balls of dough in her pieces. Multiple angles: Black's works, on display at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Arts in Newcastle, can also be observed through sheets of glass splattered with paint . She selects things she 'cannot help . but use' which include powder-paint, plaster, crushed chalk, Vaseline, . lipstick, topsoil, sugar paper, balsa wood, eye shadow, nail varnish and . moisturiser. Another . Scot, Martin Boyce, has created atmospheric, angular sculptural . installations which have philosophical names like 'Do The Words Have . Voices.' Hilary Lloyd uses still and moving images as well as sound to portray abstract urban environments. She makes her technical equipment a part of her sculptures, clearly displaying the audio-visual tools. Fellow nominee: Martin Boyce's philosophically named 'Do The Words Have Voices' is an atmospheric, angular sculpture and is on show in Newcastle . Impressive and imposing: A gallery worker looks at the piece from a different angle . George . Shaw's . naturalistic paintings of urban landscapes, council estates and . abandoned houses are small in scale but give out a strong message. He . paints the landscape of his adolescent life. Each scene exists . within a half-mile radius of George's childhood home on the Tile Hill . estate in Coventry. The . Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, located on the south bank of the . River Tyne in Gateshead, has a world class modern art collection of its . own - as well as offering almost unparalleled views over the city of . Newcastle. It is the UK's largest display space for . contemporary art outside London, and was created from a derelict . 1940s grain warehouse as part of a drive - spearheaded by Gateshead . council in the 1990s - for transformation through culture. Room with a view: Turner Prize finalist Hilary Lloyd's installations come with an impressive backdrop of the city of Newcastle . Screen work: Lloyd's screens are suspended on metal poles and use still and moving images as well as sound to portray . abstract urban scenes . The Angel . of the North, the Sage Gateshead Music Centre and the Gateshead . Millennium Bridge were all products of the same vision. Baltic's role was to be an 'art . factory' of international stature, with a constantly changing schedule . of exhibitions and no permanent collection. Opened in July 2002, it has received four million visitors and now has 400,000 annually. Chief curator Sir Laurence Sillars . said he expected to be inundated with visitors to the gallery, housed in . a former grain warehouse on the south bank of the River Tyne. He . said: 'It is a great achievement for Gateshead and Baltic to be the . first ones to present the Turner Prize outside the boundaries of the . Tate in its history. 'There is a huge appetite for contemporary art here in the North East. 'Baltic itself gets about half a million visitors a year but this is a fantastic opportunity to see what is probably the most prestigious prize for contemporary art in the world.' The Turner Prize has only once been held outside London, at the Tate in Liverpool in 2007. Hosting the event would boost Baltic's profile and help engage the wider public, Sir Sillars said. 'It will mean an enormous amount to the area,' he added. 'The Turner Prize has become almost a household name and what a great celebration of some of the best art being produced in Britain. 'I think we will be inundated with visitors and I look forward to everybody entering the debate that surrounds the prize.' Cameras at the ready: There is already a lot of interest in Turner Prize finalist George Shaw's naturalistic paintings of the urban landscape where he grew up . Urban scenes: George Shaw's 'Shut Up' (left) and some local garages, these are a few of the images on show at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle . He said the north east's rough and ready reputation was undeserved and that the area was a hotbed for contemporary art. He said: 'There are many artists living and working here and there are three strong art schools here. 'Baltic and a number of fellow organisations have been instrumental in keeping artists here. 'New art is being made here all the time.' The exhibition opens to the public tomorrow. The £25,000 winner will be announced live on Channel 4 on December 5.","Other exhibits include a painting of a dog dirt bin and a pub .

Archaeologists have discovered two pieces of astonishing art dating back around 2,600 years depicting a woman giving birth - the oldest such image ever found in the western world. The artefacts were at the heart of an ancient Etruscan settlement in Italy’s Mugello Valley, near Florence. The incredible images were on a small fragment from a ceramic vessel dating back to around 600 BC, and show the head and shoulders of a baby emerging from a mother, believed to be a goddess. Ancient: The small image of a woman in childbirth is the oldest ever found in the western world . And incredibly it was discovered by William Nutt, a graduate student at the University of Texas in Arlington who is legally . blind and was on his first ever dig. 'I found the artefact at the beginning of my second week there,' he said. 'It was . quite dirty, and we weren’t sure what it was until it was cleaned at the . on-site lab and identified. 'It was thrilling to find out . that it was so significant. To make a discovery like that, which . provides important new information about a culture we know so little . about, is exactly what makes archaeology and anthropology so appealing.” This goddess is shown with her knees raised and her face shown in profile, one arm raised, and a long ponytail running down her back . The excavation of the area is a project of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, in collaboration with The Open University in the UK. Cultural: The site is in a Tuscan valley close to Florence, pictured, an area full of historically important artefacts . The identification of the scene was made by Dr. Phil Perkins, an expert from The Open University. 'We were astounded to see this intimate scene; it must be the earliest representation of childbirth in western art,' he said. 'Etruscan women are usually represented feasting or participating in rituals, or they are goddesses. Now we have to solve the mystery of who she is and who her child is.' The Etruscan civilisation were from ancient Italy in the area corresponding roughly to Tuscany. They came to prominence in 700 BC before being absorbed into the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. Experts believe there is considerable evidence that early Rome was dominated by Etruscans. They were particularly famous for their art, particularly sculpture and pottery, like the wine jug pictured above, cast metal idols, wall-painting and bronze work. Thematically its art was strongly connected to religion and gods, as well as the afterlife. The ceramic fragment is less than 4 x 3 cm from a . vessel made of bucchero. Bucchero is a fine, black ceramic material, . embellished with stamped and incised decorations, used as eating . and drinking vessels for the Etruscan elite. Typically, stamped designs . range from abstract geometric motifs to exotic and mythical animals. There are no known Greek or Roman representations of the moment of birth . shown as clearly as this example until more than 500 years . later. The image also gives clues about the role of women in that society. Scholars are certain that for some part of its history it was a sacred spot and the abundance of weaving tools and a stunning deposit of gold jewellery  suggests that a women god is what the people there may have worshipped. 'This is a most exciting discovery,” said Dr. Larissa Bonfante, professor emerita of classics at New York University and a world-renowned expert on the ancient Etruscans. 'It shows an image of a type so far unknown in Etruscan context, and gives us plenty to think about as we try to understand its religious significance.' A paper about the find will be presented at the annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in Philadelphia in January.","The ceramic image is thought to be 2,600 years old and was found in Tuscany .

Now Henry VIII’s ‘lost’ palace can be seen for the first time in more than 300 years – in a scale model based on 50 years of research. The replica of Nonsuch Palace – so named because there was no other like it – took 1,250 hours to make. Majestic: Nonsuch can be seen in all its glory for the first time in more than 300 years after a model maker recreated it thanks to an Oxford University professor's research . Intricate: Ben Taggart spent 1,250 hours building the detailed 3D replica and worked from Professor Martin Biddle's extensive research and plans . Visitors to site of Henry VIII's 'lost' palace today would have little clue of its majestic past. The remains of Nonsuch Palace consists mainly of 700 acres of green open space, located between Ewell and Cheam in Surrey. Henry began building the elaborate royal pad set in vast hunting grounds in 1538 in celebration of the birth of his longed-for male heir Edward – and as a glittering demonstration of Tudor power. The height of extravagance, the palace had cost over £24,000 by the time Henry died in 1547 – and was still incomplete. Sadly, little of it remains save a few foundations - bizarrely, Charles II gave it to his mistress the Duchess Of Cleveland in 1670, then allowed her to demolish it and sell off the parts to pay for gambling debts in 1682. It measures 7.2ft by 4ft (2.2m by . 1.2m) and is made of wood, with intricate architectural detail added in . plastics, fibre-glass resin and brass. The courtyards are decorated with 700 . stucco plaster panels depicting Roman emperors, gods and goddesses and . tiny paintings attached to the walls. Nonsuch was commissioned in 1538 by . Henry VIII to celebrate the birth of his son, the future Edward VI, and . outshine his rival, King Francois I of France. The building was so grand that it . inspired a foreign visitor to comment: ‘This which no equal has in art . or fame, Britons deservedly do Nonsuch name.’ But by 1690 it had been completely . dismantled by Charles II’s mistress, who sold its raw materials to pay . off her gambling debts. The model of Nonsuch was based on the . research of Oxford University Professor Martin Biddle, who co-ordinated . the first excavation on the Surrey palace’s site as an undergraduate in . 1959. Rare: Just four pictures were ever painted of Nonsuch Palace, such as this 1752 watercolour by Joris Hoefnagel. It stood for 150 years before it was torn down . Palace from the past: Model maker Ben Taggart with the replica of Henry VIII's 'lost' Nonsuch . Painstaking: Ben with the model. The courtyards are decorated with an incredible 700 stucco plaster panels depicting Roman emperors, gods and goddesses . Fit for a king: Nonsuch was built for Henry VIII, costing £24,000 - a fortune in those days . He then spent years poring over . illustrations, archaeological evidence, written sources, and artefacts . from Nonsuch, including thousands of original stuccos and statues. Modeller Ben Taggart used this . research as the basis for his 1:75 scale replica, now on display at the . Friends of Nonsuch Museum, near Cheam, Surrey. Professor Biddle, 74, said the model . was ‘astonishing’, adding: ‘It has revolutionised the understanding of . the nature of Nonsuch and leads us to know why it really was regarded by . contemporaries as “that which has no equal”.’ Mr Taggart, who runs modelhouses.co.uk, said: ‘I hope [the model] will bring it to life for people today.’ Professor Biddle added: 'Of course we do not know everything about the building, so there has been a good deal of properly deployed imagination, but is absolutely as accurate as we could possibly make it. 'I have been involved in researching Nonsuch for my entire adult life and I am absolutely delighted with the model. 'It is the first time since it was destroyed that people will be able to see the palace and I hope it will lead to some very valuable discussion and further discoveries about Nonsuch.' Gerald Smith, chairman of the charity Friends of Nonsuch, said: 'It was a truly magnificent palace - it was an enormous work of art. 'But from around 1680 onwards it was destroyed and the materials were sold for whatever they could get. 'This is the very first time anything like this model has been attempted. We can now see what the palace would have looked like at the time.' The Friends of Nonsuch raised £20,000 which helped pay for the model. Detailed: The model maker said he wanted to recreate the sense of theatre in the piece . 'Educational and ostentatious': Nonsuch was designed to teach Henry's son Edward about antiquity and ancient mythology through his surroundings as he grew up . Meticulous: The original Nonsuch Palace was designed in 1538 and was intended as a hunting lodge . Star of the small screen: A depiction of Nonsuch also appeared in the television series The Tudors, starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (pictured)","Palace considered to be one of the finest architectural wonders of the world .

"By . Tom Kelly and Steve Doughty and NICHOLA JONES . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 22nd October 2011 . Surrounded by smoke and flames from Luftwaffe bombs, the image of St Paul’s rising above the scarred London skyline became a symbol of the nation’s Blitz Spirit. But on Friday a rag-tag group of anti-capitalist protesters camping on its doorstep achieved what even Hitler’s bombers only once managed to achieve – and forced the cathedral to shut. Dean Rev Graeme Knowles said the decision to close until further notice was made with ‘heavy hearts’ after the makeshift camp on its steps doubled in size during the past week. Disruption: Anti-capitalists continue to camp outside St Paul's despite the cathedral announcing it will have to close for the first time in 72 years due to the protest . Rows of multi coloured tents surround the Cathedral which closed indefinitely at 5pm on Friday . Protesters gather for a meeting in front of St Paul's Cathedral on Friday alongside the media following the closure announcement . Closing: Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, The Right Reverend Graham Knowles announces he is concerned about fire hazards . The protesters couldn't stop a wedding taking place at St Paul's today. Natasha Ighodaro arrived at the cathedral to marry Nick Cunningham - against a backdrop of dozens of tents and a banner reading 'capitalism is crisis'. The bride, a University of York graduate, appeared to put on a brave face and smiled at onlookers as she walked in through a side entrance as police stood by. Just yards away, the front steps of St Paul's were teaming with protesters who have vowed to stay put for the immediate future. Earlier, bride and groom were forced to reassure their guests that the ceremony would go ahead despite the action. In a message posted on Facebook, they wrote: 'We're looking forward to seeing friends and family at the wedding today, and are pleased that it is going ahead as planned. love Nick Cunningham and Natasha Ighodaro xxx'. This followed an upbeat message last night which stated: 'For anyone who is worried about tomorrow - don't be. The recent announcement doesn't affect us; it just means that we have run of the house :) xxxx.' Ahead of the service, ushers insisted Miss Ighodaro, an account manager for a PR company, was not concerned by disruption. 'She just wants to enjoy her day - if she ever gets here,' one joked. He blamed ‘health and safety’ concerns . caused by the Occupy London Stock Exchange movement, which has been . located in Paternoster Square since Saturday after being barred from the . Stock Exchange. And he begged the activists – who include teachers, social workers, . mothers with  children and an extra from Downton Abbey – to leave what . has become known as ‘Camp Crusty’. The continuing disruption has seen the cathedral’s earlier act of . charity backfire. On Sunday, defending the rights of the protesters, . Canon Chancellor the Rev Giles Fraser had asked police to leave and even . invited the demonstrators in to worship. On Friday night religious leaders described the decision to close the cathedral as a ‘tragedy’. But as the doors were locked after Friday's 3.30pm service, . protesters remained defiant – and thousands more are expected to descend . on the site on Saturday. St Paul’s was shut for just four days during the Blitz while Royal . Engineers defused a time-delayed bomb that had hit the cathedral. Mr Knowles, who has been forced to cancel a visit to America, said the decision to close it again was ‘unprecedented’. He said: ‘I have written an open letter to the protesters this afternoon . advising them that we have no lawful alternative but to close St Paul’s . Cathedral until further notice. 'Health, safety and fire officers have . pointed out that access to the cathedral is seriously limited. 'With so . many stoves and fires and lots of different types of fuel around, there . is a very clear fire hazard. ‘Then there is the public health aspect which indeed speaks for itself. The dangers relate not just to cathedral staff and to visitors but are a . potential hazard to those encamped themselves. ‘We have done this with a very heavy heart, but it is simply not . possible to fulfil our day-to-day obligations to worshippers, visitors . and pilgrims in current circumstances. ‘I am asking the protesters to recognise the huge issues facing us at . this time and asking them to leave the vicinity of the building so that . the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible. ‘I hope that the protesters will understand the issues we are facing, . recognise that their voice has been legitimately heard, and withdraw . peacefully.’ He said the cathedral defended the right to protest but would like to use the building for its intended use. The cathedral is one of London’s best loved tourist attractions and draws up to 3,000 worshippers each Sunday. Canon Peter Bruinvels, a member of the Church of England’s . parliament, the General Synod, said: ‘This is a tragedy. Clearly now the . demonstrators should pack up their tents and go. St Paul’s is a greater . cause then theirs and they should acknowledge that. ‘The cathedral is losing £20,000 for every day it is shut. It gets no state support. It cannot afford to be shut.’ Clergy at the cathedral have insisted that no welcome was given to the . demonstrators and that their aim when the Occupy London Stock Exchange . movement arrived – targeting the nearby Stock Exchange rather than the . cathedral – was to avoid confrontation and violence. People listen to an economics talk held at the so-called 'Star Books Occupation Library' setup by Occupy London Stock Exchange protesters directly outside a branch of the Starbucks coffee chain . Activists' tents fill the area in front of St Paul's and more are expected to join at the weekend . Protesters play music on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral ahead of the Cathedral closing its doors for the first time in living memory . An activist eats in his tent at the Occupy London camp next to St Paul's Cathedral. Right Reverend Graeme Knowles said the decision to close the Cathedral was made with a 'heavy heart' The St Paul’s protest is already bearing the hallmarks of a more . permanent set-up and is now home to a mobile library, a meditation . centre and even solar panels. A delivery of portable toilets is expected . in the next 24 hours. Protester George Barda said: ‘I think this is an appallingly unchristian . decision and I personally think it would be a big mistake for us to . leave here. 'This is completely unnecessary and I believe a commercially . driven decision.’ Demonstrators camp seen from the steps outside St Paul's Cathedral which has asked protesters to withdraw peacefully . The Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, issued the following statement today . Thank you for coming today. It seems a very long time since the protestors arrived around the Cathedral last weekend and I want to stress at the outset that we have listened to them and indeed developed a conversation with them. We are delighted that the London protests have been peaceful and indeed there has been a good atmosphere generally between Cathedral staff and those dwelling in the tents around St Paul’s. There is something profound about protest being made and heard in front of this most holy place: a gathering together of those concerned about poverty and inequality facing the great Dome of this Cathedral Church. You actually have to be here to witness it for yourself because the extent of feeling and protest is not easily translated via media in that sense. But it is about the practical and safety issues which this peaceful protest has raised which I need to address with you today. It should be obvious to anyone approaching the Cathedral that the size of the camp and the consequent compliance issues which it inevitably raises, has increasingly put us in a difficult position. Last night, I met with members of the Chapter to discuss some of these key issues. As the week has gone on, and in a statement we issued earlier this week, we intimated how difficult the situation was becoming. As a result of that meeting, and reports received today from our independent Health, Safety and Fire officers, I have written an open letter to the protestors this afternoon advising them that we have no lawful alternative but to close St Paul’s Cathedral until further notice. I have here copies of the letter clearly outlining the reasons we have had to take this dramatic course of action which I will ask my colleagues to distribute. The Health, Safety and Fire officers have pointed out that access to and from the Cathedral is seriously limited. With so many stoves and fires and lots of different types of fuel around, there is a clear fire hazard. Then there is the public health aspect which speaks for itself. The dangers relate not just to Cathedral staff and visitors but are a potential hazard to those encamped themselves. The decision to close St Paul’s Cathedral  is unprecedented in modern times and I have asked the Registrar to implement emergency procedures whereby the building remains closed but fit for purpose until such a time that we can open safely. Our 200 staff and 100 volunteers are also being informed of this decision this afternoon. I want to say two simple things at this point. 1)    We have done this with a very heavy heart, but it is simply not possible to fulfil our day to day obligations to worshippers, visitors and pilgrims in current circumstances.2)    That all of the Chapter are at one on this and recognise the complexities of the issues facing us at this time. As you can see in the open letter, I am asking the protestors to recognise the huge issues facing us at this time and asking them to leave the vicinity of the building so that the Cathedral can re-open as soon as possible. So many people who visit this great Cathedral come here, of course, because they love the Gospel of justice, peace and reconciliation [which some of the protestors are embracing for a whole host of reasons] , but also because they want to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of a place of prayer and pilgrimage. Some will rightly say that the Church should be alongside those seeking equality and financial probity. We are. The debate about a more just society is at the heart of much of our work at St Paul’s and indeed we hope to contribute to the wider debate in the very near future through a Report from the St Paul’s Institute. But today is about our ability, practically, to carry on our mission with free and open access to this public space and treasured place and I hope that the protestors will understand the issues we are facing, recognise that their voice has been legitimately heard, and withdraw peacefully.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 12:32 PM on 22nd October 2011 . Rupert Murdoch was jostled by protesters and criticised by disgruntled shareholders who demanded the mogul and his sons resign from his scandal-hit newspaper empire. The 80-year-old chairman and CEO of News Corp was condemned for his  handling of the phone hacking scandal. At the company's annual meeting in Los Angles some of his biggest investors voted against his re-election and that of his sons, James and Lachlan as directors. Making a mockery: A protester wears a puppet head of Rupert Murdoch during a demonstration at Fox Studios in LA during the annual stockholder meeting . More than 100 protesters, one of whom wore a Murdoch mask, gathered . outside the 20th Century Fox studio lot where the tycoon robustly defended himself. Inside, . seated in the front row with his sons, he warded . off allegations that he had poor oversight of the company, sometimes . cutting off speakers to dispute a fact. He insisted News Corp's history was the 'stuff of legend,' but shareholders were critical of his £21 million salary ($33million). Votes from the shareholders were still being counted but the company said a proposal from the Christian Brothers Investment Services to force the company's chairman to be an independent director had failed. James Murdoch was likely to receive the biggest vote of no confidence. If the votes go against him, it will cast further doubts on his future at the company. Smiling through: Rupert Murdoch faced tough questioning from shareholders at the AGM in California . Driving force: British MP Tom Watson, who has lead the campaign into the phone hacking scandal, talks to reporters during a protest in front of 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles . The youngest Murdoch son is already . facing questions about evidence he gave to a parliamentary inquiry into . the News of the World hacking scandal and shareholders at . Murdoch-controlled BSkyB have called for his resignation. Those attending included Edward Mason, secretary of the ethical investment advisory group of the Church of England, which owns about $6m worth of News Corp shares. He said: 'There needs to be decisive action in terms of holding people to account.' Julie Tanner, assistant director of Christian Brothers Investment Services which represents more than 1,000 Catholic institutions worldwide, was the first at the meeting to question Murdoch's track record. She said that the 'extraordinary scandals' in the UK required corporate overhaul. Few held out any hope they could . overcome Murdoch's control of 40 percent of voting shares through a . family trust, or the seven per cent stake Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal . has almost certainly cast in support of him. Stephen Mayne, an Australian shareholder and long-time critic of Murdoch, said it was an 'extraordinarily paranoid"" meeting. 'I think he's losing it, he comes across as a paranoid control freak,' he added. Something to shout about: Protesters have been a common sight an News Corp functions since the phone hacking scandal broke in July . There has been global outrage over . the discovery that a private investigator hired by the newspaper had . hacked into the mobile phone voicemail of 13-year-old murder victim . Milly Dowler, potentially impeding a police investigation and giving . false hope to her family. The phone hacking scandal has forced . the resignation of two of London's top police officers and ousted top . executives such as Dow Jones & Co. CEO Les Hinton and former Sun . Editor Rebekah Brooks. Under fire: A protestor outside 20th Century Fox with a placard denouncing Murdoch and his son James .

The . company also announced on Friday that it had agreed to pay £2 million . ($3.2 million) to the family of Milly Dowler and £1 million ($1.6 . million) to charities of their choice. Friday marked the first time Murdoch faced shareholders with small stakes in the company since the scandal broke in July. Outside the studio lot, some demonstrators carried anti-Murdoch signs, including one that stated 'Fire the Murdoch Mafia'. Another read, 'Rich media equals poor democracy'. Some of the demonstrators were from an organisation that has been staging rallies recently to demand good jobs. Tom Watson, a Labour MP in Britain, flew to Los Angeles to make a new allegation about covert surveillance techniques by company employees. Watson asked Murdoch if he was aware that a person who had left prison was hired by News Corp's British newspaper unit and hacked into the computer of a former army intelligence officer. He later said the incident happened around 2005 and that evidence of the computer hacking is with London's Metropolitan Police. He said it could lead to the discovery of further victims of computer hacking. He warned News Corp investors that they were facing 'Mulcaire 2' in the UK as victims of alleged computer hacking took action against its subsidiary News International. He added: 'You haven't told any of your investors what is to come. Murdoch said he wasn't aware of the allegation, and board director Viet Dinh said the company would look into it. Mr Murdoch said: 'I promise you absolutely that we will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this and put it right.'",MP warns mogul he faces 'Mulcaire 2' threat .

A barman beaten and set on fire in an alleged homophobic attack may have been sexually assaulted before he was killed, police said last night. The body of 28-year-old Stuart Walker was found in an empty industrial estate in the early hours of Saturday morning. The openly gay barman was the victim of a ‘violent and sustained’ attack as he walked back from a house party. In the hours after his death, his small community of Cumnock, Ayrshire, was rife with rumours he was targeted because of his sexuality. Strathclyde Police have refused to confirm or deny this but Divisional Commander John Thomson said the  victim’s lifestyle was the ‘main focus’ of his inquiries. As it was reported that Mr Walker’s body was found partially undressed, Mr Thomson said a sexual element to the crime had not been ruled out. But Initial reports that he was tied to a lamp post were incorrect, officers said. At a press conference at Kilmarnock police office, he confirmed Mr Walker – a former assistant manager at the Royal Hotel in Cumnock – had almost certainly known those who killed him at Caponacre industrial estate. Mr Thomson said: ‘I don’t think it was a random attack by someone who will strike again. I suspect Stuart may have known this individual or met this individual shortly before his death.’ Mr Thomson, who described the murder as a ‘vicious attack’, said there was a  ‘possibility of a sexual assault’. In loving memory: Flowers left at the scene in Cumnock, Ayrshire, where Stuart Walker was found dead . Crime scene: The murder scene at Caponacre Industrial Estate, Cumnock, Ayrshire where the body of Stuart Walker was found . The post-mortem examination will reveal whether that was the case. Mr Walker’s charred remains were discovered at 4.50am by party-goers, after being last seen by a friend alive at 2:30am. The sociable music fan had been at a number of friends’ house parties on the nearby Netherthird housing estate until the early hours. He then took the route back to the house he shared with parents David, 63, and Isabel, 56, and 24-year-old sister Julie in Hearth Place, Cumnock. He was last seen alive and alone close to the town fire station in Glazier Street by a family friend. But Mr Walker, a former gym supervisor, changed route and bypassed his house to go to the industrial estate. Police are unsure if he was taken there or went of his own accord, and whether he removed his own clothing. His family first became worried when Mr Walker did not turn up at his grandmother Margaret McMeekin’s 80th birthday party on Saturday. He also failed to appear for his fourth shift at a new job behind the bar of the First Edition pub in nearby Kilmarnock. Tributes: Flowers were left at the scene where Mr Walker's charred body was discovered on Saturday . It was not until his family raised the alarm that police were able to identify Mr Walker. Officers have interviewed dozens of potential witnesses, conducted door-to-door inquiries and studied CCTV footage. Mr Thomson said: ‘I am  optimistic we will bring this person or persons to book sooner rather than later.’ Detective Inspector John Hogg of Ayr police added: 'We are still working towards identifying a motive for this murder. 'I am aware of all the speculation in the media regarding Mr Walker and his death. At this time,we have nothing to indicate that this is a homophobic crime. Until we know the exact circumstances . surrounding this murder, we will not rule anything out and will keep an . open mind on any possible motive for his terrible crime.' Members of the gay community in Ayrshire are among more than 4,000 people who have visited a Facebook page set up in memory of Mr Walker. A spokesperson for the bar Stuart had just started working at, told The Guardian: 'We are all shocked at the death of Stuart and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.' And the director of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender support group Stonewall Scotland, Colin Macfarlane, told the newspaper: 'Stonewall Scotland are deeply worried that the police feel there may be a possibility that his death was a hate crime.'","Police say Stuart Walker may have been sexually assaulted in the attack .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 2:03 PM on 21st October 2011 . Killer: Gary Sampson, a drifter who confessed to killing three people during a week-long crime spree, will get a new trial to decide whether he should face the death penalty . A judge has thrown out a death penalty sentence against a man convicted of killing three people during a week-long crime spree in America ten years ago. Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled that Gary Sampson was denied his constitutional right to have his sentence decided by an impartial jury and that he is 'entitled to a new trial to determine whether the death penalty is justified in his case.' Sampson, a drifter who was raised in Abington, pleaded guilty to carjacking two Massachusetts men after each picked him up hitchhiking. He said he forced both men to drive to secluded spots, assured them he only wanted to steal their cars, then stabbed them repeatedly and slit their throats. He then fled to New Hampshire, broke into a house in Meredith and strangled a third man. The judge's decision was angrily denounced by the father of Jonathan Rizzo, one of Sampson's victims. 'I wish I could say I was surprised,' Mike Rizzo said. 'I'm not surprised, I'm extremely disappointed and phenomenally outraged at the fact that one man  tried to overturn the good work done by so many people in coming to the right decision many years ago.' In a motion for a new trial, Sampson's lawyers argued that three jurors had given inaccurate answers to questions they were asked during the jury selection process. Wolf found that one of the jurors had intentionally and repeatedly answered questions dishonestly in an attempt to avoid talking about subjects that were painful to her. She never disclosed, for example, that allegedly her husband had a rifle and had threatened to shoot her, that she had ended her marriage because of her husband's substance abuse and that her daughter had served time in prison because of a drug problem. Victims: Philip McCloskey, left, Jonathan Rizzo and Robert Whitney . Wolf said in his ruling that if the . woman had disclosed those things during the jury selection process, the . court would have found that there was a 'high risk' that after listening to the evidence at . Sampson's trial, her decision on whether to sentence Sampson to death . could have been influenced by her life experiences. Wolf said the woman would likely have been excused from serving on the jury. 'In essence, despite dedicated efforts by the parties and the court to assure that the trial would be fair and the verdict final, it has now been proven that perjury by a juror resulted in a violation of Sampson's constitutional right to have the issue of whether he should live or die decided by twelve women and men who were each capable of deciding that most consequential question impartially,' wrote Wolf, who presided at Sampson's trial. But Mr Rizzo disagreed with the reasoning, saying that he does not believe Wolf's decision was based on a desire to get it right. Controversial decision: Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled that Gary Sampson was denied his constitutional right to have his sentence decided by an impartial jury . 'I believe Judge Wolf is trying what he thinks is good for his image and himself, he doesn't care about anybody else,' he said. 'It's clear it's been on his agenda for six years based on his action since the trial ended to do everything he could to ensure this is overturned and did not happen on his watch. 'I've heard and seen so many things from the judge over the years to be surprised at this, but, again, unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in the outcome. 'I feel terribly for the jurors who found themselves in this position through, I don't think, any willful deceit on their part.' Sampson was the first person sentenced to death in Massachusetts under the federal death penalty law. Massachusetts, which does not have a state law permitting the death penalty, has not executed anyone in more than half a century. Sampson pleaded guilty to federal charges in the carjacking and killing of Jonathan Rizzo, a 19-year-old college student from Kingston, and Philip McCloskey, 69, of Taunton, in July 2001. A federal jury in Boston recommended the death penalty after hearing weeks of gruesome testimony about the killings. Separately, Sampson pleaded guilty in state court in New Hampshire in the killing of Robert Whitney, 58, of Concord, a former city councilor. Sampson received a life sentence in Whitney's death. 'Gary Lee Sampson has admitted to the cold-blooded murders of Philip McCloskey, Jonathan Rizzo and Robert Whitney. Today's order does not change that fact,' U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a statement. Ortiz said prosecutors will meet with the . victims' families to discuss the ruling and plan to 'examine all of our . legal options.' New trial: Sampson's lawyers argued that three jurors had given inaccurate answers to questions they were asked during the jury selection process . Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for Ortiz, said: 'We are strongly considering an appeal as one of the options.' But Mr Rizzo said he was not sure whether he could go through a trial again. 'I don't know how I'd do that, how to do that at the moment,' he said. 'I can't imagine dragging all that drama and all of those things, how that'd feel - to drag all that stuff to the surface again and have to deal with it for what would be the fourth or fifth time for us, given all the hearings we've been through.' During the trial's sentencing, Sampson's lawyers said he was abused as a child and suffered from bipolar disorder, damage to the frontal lobe of his brain, and drug and alcohol addiction. Former U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan, who brought the case against Sampson, said he is disappointed that Sampson will get a new death penalty hearing. 'I feel horrible for the victims' families,' Mr Sullivan said. 'Sampson is an admitted cold-blooded killer and he deserves the death sentence that the jury imposed,' he said. Wolf had ordered that the execution be carried out in New Hampshire - the closest state with a death penalty - to make it more accessible to Sampson's victims. New Hampshire has a death penalty, although it hasn't executed anyone since 1939.","Judge rules that juror in previous hearing had repeatedly lied about herself .

BP's CEO Bob Dudley (right), who replaced Tony Hayward (left) after the disaster, said he expected the company's cashflow to grow even further . Oil giant BP today reported profits of $5.1billion (£3.2billion) in the three months to September, showing its recovery from last year’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company’s third quarter profits show massive growth compared to their $1.8billion (£1.3billion) made for the same period last year. BP’s CEO Bob Dudley said he expected the company’s cashflow to grow by around 50 per cent by 2014 – meaning even greater returns for shareholders. The American, brought in to replace Tony Hayward in the wake of the 2010 disaster, said the extra cash would enable it to double its spending on new exploration and to increase its investment in its deep water operations, its giant fields and building its gas operations. The group's payments into the Gulf of Mexico Trust Fund will end in 2012 and will provide half of the increase in cashflow, he added, while 17 new projects are due to come on-stream over the next three years. The group has restarted operations in the Gulf and last week received approval for an exploration plan for the Kaskida field in the region. Gulf of Mexico disaster: The Deepwater Horizon oil rig burning in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 . Massive spill: The Q4000 drilling rig operating in the Gulf of Mexico at the site of the Deepwater Horizon disaster . Devastation to wildlife: A dolphin lies dead on a beach on Horn Island, in the Gulf of Mexico . The cashflow forecast assumes oil prices of $100 per barrel, compared with an average of $112 so far this year, though lower production and higher maintenance activity and costs offset the benefit of higher prices in the latest quarter. For the nine months to September, BP posted profits of $15.9billion (£9.9billion). ""The company has steadied, turned round and now, this month, with high-margin assets returning on stream, we have reached a clear turning point,"" Mr Dudley said. He added that BP had lived up to its commitments in the Gulf and was putting ""safety and risk management at the absolute heart of our business"". Shares rose three per cent after the update. The oil firm also said it will also use any additional cash for higher dividends and more share buybacks, though the group held its latest third-quarter payment at seven cents despite City expectations of an increase. The group will review its future dividend plans in February, it said today. BP has had endured a torrid time since the Deepwater Horizon accident, which saw 11 oil rig workers killed and caused the biggest oil spillage in US history. Mr Dudley has struggled to restore BP's reputation and ran into fierce criticism himself following the failure of the share swap and exploration deal with Rosneft in May. The share price is still almost one third below the level before the Gulf tragedy, though some analysts said today's figures suggested hope for the future. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ""The real possibility that BP is at an inflection point has bolstered the shares in early trade."" The Gulf of Mexico disaster stemmed from a sea-floor oil gusher that resulted from the April 20, 2010, explosion of Deepwater Horizon. Around 4.9 million barrels of crude oil spilled into the ocean.","BP's profits for the same time last year were £1.3 billion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:53 PM on 25th October 2011 . Professional gardener Joe Hashman (pictured outside the tribunal in Southampton) claims he was sacked from a Dorset garden centre because of his anti-fox hunting beliefs . A professional gardener was sacked from running a demonstration vegetable patch at a garden centre because of his anti-fox hunting beliefs, he told an employment tribunal today. Joe Hashman, who has written two books on gardening, was employed by the Orchard Park Garden Centre in Gillingham, Dorset, in March 2009 to set up and maintain the vegetable display plots. But in September that year, Mr Hashman was dismissed after he was involved as a witness in two hunting prosecutions and following the accidental death of a local pro-hunting figure. The 43-year-old from Shaftesbury told the Southampton hearing that he had a good relationship with the garden centre managing director Richard Cumming and believed he had been employed on a long-term basis. But he said he felt that his position became less secure when Mr Cumming informed him that the majority owners of the garden centre were neighbouring farmers Sheila and Ron Clarke. He explained that the Clarkes’ farm manager was Andrew Prater, whom he had clashed with during hunting protests. Mr Hashman said: ‘I told him that our relationship was not a friendly one because he was a passionate hunt supporter and I was an equally passionate opponent. ‘I told Mr Cumming that I had been assaulted by Mr Prater in the past at hunting events.’ He added that he felt that he had been reassured by Mr Cumming and said: ‘Mr Cumming and I agreed that our common ground in respect of gardening rose above the hunting issue.’ But in July 2009, Mr Hashman was a . witness at Scarborough Magistrates’ Court for a prosecution of two . landowners charged under the Hunting Act 2004 having covertly filmed . their activities for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. He . went on to write about this on his internet blog as well as criticisms . of the Gillingham and Shaftesbury Agricultural Show for its ‘hunting . influences’. Mr Hashman claimed he felt less secure in his job after learning that the owners of Orchard Park Garden Centre (pictured) had a pro-hunting farm manager . It was at this show that Mr Prater died in an accident and it was on the day of the funeral (September 3, 2009) that he was asked not to return to work, Mr Hashman told the tribunal. Two days previously, he had been a witness for another court case in Scarborough involving the celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson-Wright. Mr Hashman said: ‘I wrote a personal blog about this on September 2 and also on that day appeared on the Radio 2 Jeremy Vine Show which was discussing the convictions.’ He added: ‘I believe that those connected with Orchard Park knew, or came to know, of some or all of these matters dating from July 2009 at some point leading up to my dismissal. ‘I believe now that my involvement in relation to hunting issues and ultimately my philosophical belief was the reason for my dismissal.’ He said that he was later told that his vegetable patches were axed for financial reasons, but he said: ‘I believe this was a justification that was thought up after the event and was not the real reason my contract was terminated.’ The hearing continues.","Joe Hashman claims he was axed after being a witness in two hunting prosecutions .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:18 PM on 24th October 2011 . Heroic: Inspector Bill Elliott was shot dead while investigating a bank robbery in Belfast in 1974. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal after his death . A murder investigation has been re-launched into the death of a police officer shot in a bank raid in Northern Ireland nearly 40 years ago. Inspector Bill Elliott was driving on his own when he heard news that a robbery was under way at the Ulster Bank in Belfast in September 1974. The 48-year-old, who was married with a son, raced to the scene and died after a shoot-out with republicans from the Official IRA who detectives said were armed with two submachine guns and a pistol. Inspector Elliott was posthumously awarded the Queen's Police Medal. The Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) Serious Crime Branch revealed it has now reopened the case after a review of the killing by the police Historical Enquiries Team (HET) found potential new leads. The HET is re-examining killings from the Troubles, and in many cases provides bereaved families with reports on the murders, but it also alerts detectives to any new lines of investigation. Detective Superintendent Jonathan Roberts said: 'Certainly there are new lines of inquiry opening up to us and developing. It's an overall reassessment of the case.' The scene: Insp Elliott died in a shoot-out with republican members of the Official IRA at the Ulster Bank (pictured) in the Rathcoole area of the city . Clue: Police have released this picture of the getaway car used in the robbery, but say they no longer have the vehicle . As a Catholic schoolboy, Ronan Bennett, right, was convicted with two other teenagers of murdering Inspector Bill Elliott during the Ulster Bank robbery in 1974. However, the conviction was quashed on appeal a year later after the story of a witness change a number of times. Afterwards, Bennett was said to have shown a sympathy towards the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), which killed Airey Neave, Margaret Thatcher's Northern Ireland advisor, in 1979. He later moved to London, where he was arrested in 1978 on spurious charges of conspiracy to cause explosions. Police found a copy of the Anarchist's Cookbook in his flat, a text containing instructions on how to manufacture explosives. He spent 16 months on remand, but was released after successfully defending himself. Afterwards, he retreated into academia, gaining a first-class honours degree in History at King's College London and went on to complete a PhD there in 1987. Bennett has published several novels, most notably The Catastrophist, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Novel Award. It is the story of a doomed love affair between novelist James Gillespie and a fiery idealistic journalist, Inès, set in the Belgian Congo just before independence. He also wrote the screenplay of The Hamburg Cell, a film about the 9/11 hijackers. He lives in London and is married to guardian.co.uk editor Georgina Henry. He added: 'I don't wish to discuss . specific new lines of inquiry because they are active lines of inquiry . and to disclose them prematurely might compromise the case.' Two teenagers were jailed in the aftermath of the robbery at the Diamond shopping centre in the Rathcoole area of the city. But the original investigation became . the focus of controversy when 18-year-old student Ronan Bennett - who is . now a high profile author and screenwriter - was convicted in . connection with the killing, despite maintaining his innocence. He has recounted that the evidence . against him, that of a witness who gave a description of one of the . gang, changed a number of times. His conviction was quickly quashed by the Northern Ireland Appeal Court, which cleared his name within a year of the trial. The senior officer now reopening the hunt . for Inspector Elliott's killers said it was possible to solve the case, . despite the passage of time. DS Roberts added: 'We are in possession of witness statements that were taken at the time and we have a number of lines of inquiry to follow in respect of people who we believe may be able to give us information. 'We are well aware of what exhibits were taken at the time and what we are in possession of. I am very hopeful that there will be new opportunities identified.' Investigators said that Inspector Elliott was driving his own car at the time of the robbery. But officers believe he may have been travelling between stations when he heard news of the bank raid on his police radio. DS Roberts said: 'It was a very gallant act, given that he was on his own, he was in his own car, he responded immediately and engaged in exchange of gunshots with three or more suspects.' The police have released pictures of the scene of the bank shooting, as well as of the gang's getaway car, though investigators said they no longer have the vehicle. Detectives have asked anyone with information to call 02890 700303. Focus of probe: The Diamond shopping centre, where the bank was located.

Action: Violinist Martin Stone started legal proceedings against Young Concert Artists after it rejected him from entering a competition for 19 to 26 years olds . A musician who is suing an arts management company for placing age restrictions on a competition has officially complained about the judge handling his case - because he says he is too old. Violinist Martin Stone, 60, launched legal action against not-for-profit Young Concert Artists after it rejected him from entering a competition as it set the limit for musicians aged between 19 to 26. But in a bizarre twist, Stone is now opening himself up for ridicule - and being labelled a hypocrite - by describing 88-year-old Manhattan Federal Judge Robert Patterson as 'slow-witted and unable to function'. He wrote in a judicial complaint, obtained by the New York Daily News: 'Judge Patterson could barely see unless he put his face almost on top of a document. 'Judge Patterson should be removed from the bench, both because of his mental and physical limitations. With all due respect, he may have been a very learned jurist in his day.' Mr Stoner admitted he sounded like a hypocrite, but added that his fight against ageism was too important to allow the judge, who wears a hearing aid, to mess up. He filed his complaint after Judge Patterson threw out his legal case after finding several mistakes in Mr Stoner's court papers. In re-filing the case, he asked for a new judge. Mr Stoner added: 'I know it sounds kind of like hypocrisy. I asked the judge to recuse himself on the grounds that he's too old. Isn't that ironic?' The musician, who lost his job with the New York City Ballet Orchestra last year after more than 25 years, filed a suit against YCA in March. His complaint stemmed from being rejected from taking part in a competition which was only open to musicians a third of his age. Legal action: Young Concert Artists is a not-for-profit organisation that was holding a competition for musicians aged 19 to 26 - with the prize of $75,000 worth of career support and management to several winners . After losing his job, he decided to take part in the competition - which offers $75,000 worth of career support and management to several winners. He was allowed to perform with 277 others in the preliminary auditions only after he threatened to sue and filed age-discrimination complaints with the National Endowment for the Arts and the state Office of Civil Rights. Despite the Young Concert Artists competition's focus on budding musicians, director Susan Wadsworth said she allowed Stoner to play in the first round, thinking she might recommend him to another agency. But she added that his performance was 'less than stellar' Judge Patterson, who graduated from Columbia Law School a year before Mr Stoner was born, declined to comment on the complaint. But his supporters say he is as 'sharp as a tack', despite wearing a hearing aid and ordering lawyers to speak up as he cups a hand to his ear. In 2009 he stepped in mid-trial when a judge fell ill. He ripped through a 2,282-page legal transcript in a single weekend and handled the case with aplomb, Manhattan Federal Court Chief Judge Loretta Preska told the New York Law Journal.","Martin Stoner played violin for New York City Ballet Orchestra for 25 years .

"By . Neil Sears and Jack Doyle . Last updated at 8:07 AM on 25th October 2011 . Jailed: Conrad Luis De Souza was sentenced to two years and three months . A married man who pretended to be a doctor faked a paternity test after his lover became pregnant so that he could deny he was the father. Conrad De Souza seduced scientist and committed Christian Silke Luetzelschwab in December 2007. He began an affair with her after claiming he was a single doctor when he met her at a conference. De Souza told her that he had been educated at £9,000-a-term Dulwich  College, followed by Cambridge, before working as a GP and then as a heart specialist. But after Miss Luetzelschwab became pregnant with their daughter, his account soon began to unravel. De Souza refused to acknowledge fathering the child and Miss Luetzelschwab, 34, was forced to contact the Child Support Agency. Although a DNA test apparently proved his claim that he was not the father, Miss Luetzelschwab was suspicious and at her insistence enquiries by the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission continued. The investigation found he had used his medical connections to send a DNA sample from his unwitting father Faustino, rather than himself. Deceitful De Souza was later proved to be the father of Miss Luetzelschwab’s daughter, who was born in December 2009, after which the investigation began. It was also revealed that he was in fact married. And, even more astonishingly, it was discovered that he was not a qualified doctor  – despite being paid by the NHS to work in a clinical role for a decade, receiving a sum believed to exceed £500,000. He had been to neither Dulwich College nor Cambridge, they discovered. In fact, the British citizen of Asian descent had dropped out of a medical course after little more than a year and is believed to have been schooled in Tanzania, where he was born. Pushed for investigation: Silke Luetzelschwab and their daughter . Last night De Souza, 53, of Beckenham, south east London, began a 27-month jail term after admitting three counts of fraud. He also said his wife Roopina Coutinho, 41, left him because of the affair. The father of Conrad de Souza, leaves Croydon Crown Court this evening . Miss Luetzelschwab would have been due to receive £800 a month from De Souza towards their child’s upkeep. But her former lover now has no income at all, and faces having hundreds of thousands seized to repay the money he defrauded from the NHS. Meanwhile, his former employers face awkward questions about how he was given the jobs in the first place. Officials insisted there was no evidence he had ever touched a patient – any instance of which would amount to assault – but De Souza himself claimed to have worked as a GP for years.  Judge Simon Pratt yesterday told De Souza, as he jailed him at Croydon Crown Court: ‘You are an articulate, driven, and deeply dishonest man, without any apparent conscience about what you were doing. ‘Your behaviour in respect of the paternity of your child was deeply dishonest and wilfully manipulative.’ Prosecutor Robert O’Sullivan told the court: ‘For almost a decade, Mr De Souza held himself out as a fully qualified and appropriately registered GP with a busy London practice. ‘In truth Mr De Souza was not medically qualified – so obtained and kept his job as a result of fraud. He enrolled in 1980 as a medical student at the University of London – but did not graduate.’ Instead of gaining the status of a doctor he and his family craved, the court heard that De Souza worked in an administrative role for a company dealing with doctors. Croydon Crown Court, pictured, heard how De Souza faked the DNA test by using a swab taken from his father, to avoid being found out about an extramarital affair . He then switched to an office role with the NHS Lewisham Primary Care Group, which required no medical qualifications. But when a job came up in 2001 as a clinical adviser to the Lewisham NHS trust, De Souza falsely claimed to have the ‘clinical expertise and qualifications’ required to get it. In a CV now revealed to be a ‘work of fiction’ he boasted of ‘three years’ of experience in a busy GP practice. It helped secure him an important role on a ‘coronary heart disease and stroke clinical support panel’. And in 2005 he was promoted to become assistant clinical director of the South East London Managed Clinical Cardiac network. De Souza’s barrister Sangita Modgil said: ‘He simply couldn’t cope with the concept that he had not managed to become a doctor. ‘On the paternity issue, he could not cope with the concept of his wife discovering he’s had an affair.’ An NHS Lewisham spokesman said it had ‘learnt lessons’ from the case.","Conrad Luis De Souza was sentenced to two years and three months .

The suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a Navy sailor in Illinois has left his anguished family in a desperate search for answers. The body of Kyle Antonacci, of Hicksville, New York, was found in February of 2010 in the closet of his bunk, hanging by a belt around his neck. His death at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois was ruled a hanging, but some circumstances have led his family to launch their own investigation. Mystery: With so many key pieces of evidence missing, a conclusive cause of death is nearly impossible to determine . 'It's been hell,' said Lisa Antonacci, the sailor's mother. 'We feel like we are being completely ignored by the Navy. She added: 'They took my son, put him in a box and that was that.' At the time of his death, he was secretly aiding in an NCIS probe to clear Michael Pineda, a friend and fellow sailor who was accused of rape. Covert ops: Kyle was secretly aiding in an investigation to clear his friend and fellow sailor of rape charges . Patch.com reported that the female sailor who claimed to have been raped pushed Antonacci to testify a certain way, and he was threatened by her friends who were Marines. Lisa Antonacci told ABC News: 'He said they carved an X on his door like a marked man.' Pineda, who was ultimately cleared of the rape charges, told ABC News: 'They could have moved him off base. They could have moved him somewhere else. ‘We share the barracks with the Marines. But no one did anything to help him.' However, Kyle continued to go along with the NCIS investigation, agreeing to record phone calls with the alleged rape victim. Two hours after the last call was recorded, he was dead. 'They could have moved him off base. They could have moved him somewhere else. We share the barracks with the Marines. But no one did anything to help him.' Also suspicious to the Antonacci family was the Navy’s handling of their son’s death. Antonacci’s family said a Navy representative came to their Long Island home saying the 22-year-old had died in a car wreck. Later, the Navy reportedly told them he had suffered a massive aneurysm. The family also claimed to ABC News that the Navy failed to mention that Kyle’s nose and been broken, as well as other signs he had been beaten. ‘He looked like he was tortured,’ his mother said. Unconvinced by the initial autopsy, Kyle's family had his body exhumed and hired famed forensic pathologist Dr Michael Baden to examine him. Questions: The body of sailor Kyle Antonacci was found in this closet in February 2010, hanging by a belt around his neck . Dr Baden found that the hyoid bone - the only bone located in the throat which critical in investigations like these - was gone. In addition, photographs and x-rays of Kyle’s body had also disappeared. With those key pieces of evidence missing, a conclusive cause of death is nearly impossible to determine. The news came as a shock to Kyle’s family whose grief is overshadowed only by determination, and a promise to find the real story of his death. His mother said: 'I think he was either killed or bullied to death. 'The Navy didn't help him or protect him. He would have been safer in Iraq than he was in Illinois.'","Family of Kyle Antonacci skeptical of son's suicide .

A 76-year-old man is believed to have shot his 85-year-old sister in the head before turning the gun on himself outside the church where they were long-serving members of the congregation. Police arrived at the First Baptist Church of Grayson in Gwinnett County, Georgia, to find Clarence Porter and his sibling Avis M. Whitley dead in a white 1996 Mercury Villager van parked in the lot. They were discovered by their elderly brother Raleigh Porter, who also lived next door to the pair, as Sunday morning service was about the begin. Desperate measure: Clarence Porter, 76, (left) is believed to have shot his 85-year-old sister Avis M. Whitley before turning the gun on himself outside their church in Georgia . He told 11 Alive: 'We had no idea that this was coming.' Investigators said that Ms Whitley had suffered a severe stroke a few weeks ago and had been in bad health. The siblings lived together at a house in Loganville and police say they have not yet determined a motive for the murder-suicide. Church members told My Fox Atlanta that Mr Porter had a key to the church had shown up at about 8.30am, two hours before the congregation, to drop some money into the offering. The elderly man had been a long time deacon, head usher and worked with the church's food pantry. Place of worship: Clarence Porter, 76, shot his 85-year-old sister, Avis M. Whitley, 85, outisde the First Baptist Church of Grayson in Georgia on Sunday morning before service . He apparently unlocked . the church, left their offerings and his church keys inside, and then . went back to the van to shoot his sister in the head and then himself. Investigators found a silver handgun in the driver side floorboard. The niece of the elderly pair Karen . Boykin said: 'They were both very involved in their church and community . to give back and they gave back to their family. 'They were always available.

'They had come in this morning just . before Sunday school,' Reverend Tim Brogan told the AJC. 'I'm still kind . of processing everything.' Reverend Brogan told the paper that . the siblings had attended the 140-member church for 'a long time,' well . before he began as a pastor four years ago. Close knit: The siblings belonged to a family of 13 and shared a home together . Long-time members: The pair had been part of the congregation for many years and the murder-suicide has left the community shaken . 'We tried to find a way to comfort them,' Reverend Brogan told the AJC after breaking the news to the bereaved family. The service went ahead and the pastor preached a sermon about hope but admitted the loss would be difficult to cope with. 'Obviously, the mood was kind of down,' Brogan told the AJC.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:53 PM on 25th October 2011 . A British holidaymaker has been slapped with a £4,000 bill for internet roaming charges after returning from a trip to America. Robin Baynes, 30, was charged £4,180.83 despite buying a £6 internet bundle deal prior to his two-week trip to the States. Mr Baynes said Orange had assured him the bundle would cover roaming charges and enable him to access the internet while abroad. But when he returned home after the trip he found the company had billed him 80 times his usual £50 monthly tariff. Shocked: Robin Bayne on holiday in America. He returned home to a mobile phone bill of more than £4,000 despite being assured by Orange that his £6 bundle would cover him for roaming charges . Extortionate: The £4,182 bill that Orange sent Mr Bayne. The company has offered to reduce the bill to £500, which he has reluctantly agreed to pay . Mr Baynes, from  Chester-Le Street, County Durham, thought that the £6 fee would cover his charges for the duration of his trip. He said: 'I was sold this £6 deal under the impression that I . wouldn't be charged extortionate prices for using my phone abroad. 'I specifically phoned Orange and told . them that I wanted to use the internet abroad and they told me that . this ""bundle"" deal, as they call it, would be my best bet. 'When I saw the bill for more than four grand, I was gobsmacked. I am so angry.' Mr Baynes, a coordinator at a private care company, set out to the U.S. on September 24 with his friend Martin Sheridon, 31. They spent four nights in San . Francisco, four nights in LA and six nights in Las Vegas, using the . internet regularly but making only one mobile phone call to the UK. After listening to the recording of his call to the company, Orange has now admitted that he has been falsely sold the deal. The telecoms giant originally offered Mr Baynes £100 towards the bill as a goodwill gesture while insisting he must . pay the remainder of the charges and settle his account. Post-holiday blues: Mr Bayne, left, travelled to the U.S. with friend Martin Sheridan, and visited San Francisco, LA and Las Vegas. He used the internet regularly while abroad but made only one call to the UK . Mr Baynes refused the £100 off offer and Orange increased the reduction in the bill by £1400. After he refused to pay the reduced bill of £2,980.83 Orange finally conceded that he must pay £500, which he reluctantly accepted. He said: 'I feel forced to accept their offer because I have no other choice really. It is absolutely ridiculous. 'The fact that Orange offered me £100 to begin with, and expected me to be grateful, is beyond a joke. 'I shouldn't have to pay out that kind of money when I was led to believe that purchasing a £6 internet bundle deal would cover me against these ridiculous charges.' A spokesman for Orange said: 'We advise customers to call customer services before travelling abroad to find out about the charges and services available. 'In the case of Mr Baynes, we discussed the customer's expected data usage in advance of his travel and provided bundle advice. 'Orange is committed to giving customers transparency when it comes to our roaming rates to ensure they are aware of the different charges when they go abroad. 'We have a number of initiatives in place to help customers control their costs and we hope that these, as well as the customer's own individual responsibility, will ensure customers can manage their roaming costs appropriately. 'We look at all customer complaints on a case-by-case basis and can confirm we have offered Mr Bayne a resolution which he is happy with.'","He thought £6 would cover two weeks internet and mobile use while Stateside .

"By . Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 5:57 PM on 25th October 2011 . A civil servant who downloaded more than 28,000 indecent images of children from the internet said his sordid habit was no different to 'stamp collecting'. Steven Hawkins, of Hilperton, near Trowbridge, Wiltshire,  catalogued and stored the vile pictures and films on CDs and DVDs, many of which he then protected with ten layers of encryption. But the married 53-year-old told the police he got no sexual gratification and that he hoarded the vile images in the same way people collect stamps or coins. Police found more than 28,000 child porn images on Hawkins' computer, which he had amassed over a 12-year period (posed by model) Now MoD civilian worker Hawkins, who the court heard held a 'responsible job with the Navy', has been jailed for a year. And Judge Euan Ambrose, sitting at Swindon Crown Court, told him: 'It is very far from stamp collecting. 'The interest in these images and the market that this interest creates is what drives the production of the images and the production involves the abuse of children, and very young ones at that.' George Threlfall, prosecuting, told how police raided his home in July 2009 after receiving information that he had been downloading child pornography. And when they took away his computer and storage media they found 28,114 indecent pictures and a further 199 movies of children. Among the more serious images, he said, two-thirds were of children under the age of thirteen and a sample of the less serious all fell into the younger category. The last images had been created the day before the police raid and the first in October 1997, almost twelve years earlier. Many of the more serious images involved the abuse of children under 10 and some as young as five. He had also been typing entries for 'pre-teen hardcore' pornography and similar terms into search engines. When they examined the storage media they found more than 3,000 encrypted files, none of which could be accessed without unlocking. Jailed: Swindon Crown Court (pictured) heard Steven Hawkins held a 'responsible job with the Navy' Hawkins pleaded guilty to one count of possession and thirteen of making indecent images of children.Mike Jeary, defending, said since his arrest his client has been on a course run by charity The Lucy Faithful Foundation to address his offending. He said the reason for encrypting the files was to stop anyone else, such as his wife, finding them and he gave the passwords to the police when they asked. The judge said: 'You have in due course entered guilty plea to all charges having initially denied them in interview and having maintained for a long time that this was innocent possession, nothing to do with you. ‘Then possession came on the back of adult pornography, then possession in the form of some urge to collect images rather than getting any sexual gratification from it relating it to stamp collecting. It is very far from stamp collecting.' As well as jailing him, the judge also banned him from working with children and told him he must register as a sex offender for ten years. A spokesman for the MoD said: 'It would be inappropriate for the Ministry of Defence to comment further on what is a civil matter.'","Steven Hawkins worked for the MoD .

"By . James White . Last updated at 2:26 PM on 25th October 2011 . Allegations: Ireland's former Taoiseach Brian Cowen was said to have made important decisions while socialising with other politicians in the Irish Parliament bar . The former Irish Prime Minister made critical decisions about the country's collapsing economy 'on the hoof' while drinking in a Dublin bar, a controversial new book claims. Taoiseach Brian Cowen is accused of hampering the late Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan's attempts to prevent the collapse of Ireland's finances. The book also contains graphic . descriptions of how the 'bar lobby' and a party of what is described as . 'drinking buddies' would fetch pints for Mr Cowen and 'fill him up' while he made key decisions about the Irish economy. When the Irish economy finally collapsed last November Europe and the IMF came to its aid with an €85billion rescue deal. Britain contributed £7.5billion to rescue the so-called Celtic Tiger, costing every family £288. One source quoted in the book said of Cowen 'Jesus... he certainly drank an awful lot. Everybody thought that when he became Taoiseach he’d stop, but he actually didn’t.' However, some ministers who worked alongside him have rejected the claim, that was one of a number leaked over the weekend ahead of the book's release. It is claimed that Mr Lenihan's career . was stalled because he was not part of the Irish leadership's infamous . drinking circle, leading to mutual distrust at key times. Among the most wild allegations apparently made in the book, it is claimed Mr Cowen and drinking pals would retreat to a cottage on the Farmleigh Estate - the country's state guest house for foreign dignitaries - to carry on drinking. 'Bar lobby': Former Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen is accused of making decisions while in the bar, while excluding late Finance Minister Brian Lenihan (pictured) The book, written by award-winning . political columnist Bruce Arnold and journalist Jason O'Toole, is the . first account of the simultaneous collapses of Ireland's former leading . party and its economy. It says that the relationship  between Mr Cowen and Mr Lenihan turned into an 'unholy . union' of two politicians who were 'distrustful of each other' that only got worse under the pressure of economic collapse. The . title reveals the astonishing way in which a culture of hard drinking . at the Irish Parliament bar took over the party to such an extent that . Mr Lenihan's non-membership of the infamous 'bar lobby' damaged his . relationship with Mr Cowen. In the book, Mary O'Rourke notes that . she didn't think 'Cowen went on benders, I just think he drank steadily . -- not during the day... no, no, no, in the evening time when he'd be . finished in the Dail'. It . is also revealed that Mr Lenihan - who was battling pancreatic cancer . throughout the critical period and died of the disease in June - went to . Mr Cowen in September 2010 and pleaded with him to call an early election because he feared Ireland was going to be bullied into accepting a bail-out. Fianna Fail suffered humiliation at the polls in February when they lost the country's general election. The . authors state that Mr Lenihan fought hard against Mr Cowen's addiction . to 'social partnership' and that his attempts to rescue the economy were . stymied by what he increasingly perceived to be 'a Taoiseach who was a . bit of a softie when it came to tough decisions'. Drinking culture: Brian Cowen would drink at the Dail bar inside the Irish Parliament in Dubli, the book claims . It also paints a series of poignant portraits of Mr Lenihan as a man alone who even mistrusted his civil servants and reveals that his battle with cancer played a critical role in his decision not to engage with Mr Cowen. Sources close to the former finance minister have revealed for the first time that he was 'devastated' by having just two hours to tell his children he had pancreatic cancer before Irish television channel TV3 made the news public, it was reported in the Irish Independent. 'He said he only had two hours to tell the kids -- he was devastated by that. He never let the outside world know it, but it hurt him very badly,' one source told the Irish Independent. Claims: The allegations are made in this new book to be published next week . During his treatment, it has emerged that Mr Lenihan regularly returned to work in his department and the Dail minutes after concluding his chemotherapy, rather than returning home to rest. In some of the most revealing testimony to date about his struggle with cancer, friends and political allies of Mr Lenihan have told how he fought  chronic pain and extreme tiredness while tackling the country's financial woes. Cowen, who was previously the nation's Finance Minister, was earlier this year accused of doing nothing to avert the impending financial crisis in the 18 months before he was made Prime Minister. Britain was forced to step in to help save the Irish economy from collapse in November last year because state-backed banks were exposed to more than £100billion in terms of debt and Irish sovereign bond purchases. It was argued at the time that as well as the damaging levels of bank exposure, Ireland, as Britain's fifth-biggest trading partner, could not be allowed to sink into financial catastrophe. Current Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he believed Cowen avoided taking necessary action because it could have damaged his career. Mr Noonan said: 'I would think the calculation was that if he had acted when he knew how bad it was, he wouldn’t have become Taoiseach. 'He would have lost his support base within the party. So I blame him for that. Because he’s a very intelligent guy, Cowen is.'","Taoiseach Brian Cowen 'would drink all evening in Irish Parliament pub'

While Madonna flits between fabulous homes with the African children she rescued from poverty, her own eldest brother is destitute and sleeping rough. Anthony Ciccone, 55, says he has been living under a river bridge in Michigan for 18 months, his only shelter a sleeping bag and his sole companion another street dweller named Michael. Mr Ciccone said he had been among the homeless in the ski resort of Traverse City since losing a job at his father’s vineyard and winery six miles away. ‘My family turned their back on me, . basically, when I was having a hard time,’ he said. ‘You think I haven’t . answered this question a bazillion times – why my sister is a . multi-bazillionaire and I’m homeless on the street? Never say never. This could happen to anybody.’ Mr . Ciccone said it made him angry when some thought it funny that the . brother of such a famous star should end up living under a bridge. But . while providing him with financial help would barely scratch . 53-year-old Madonna’s £400million-plus fortune, he is adamant that he . wants none of her money – whether it is offered or not. ‘I’m . not looking to get a free handout because of my sister,’ he said. ‘I’m . not looking for any publicity.’ He instead relies on the generosity of . soup kitchens run by local churches for food.

Another brother, Martin, has suffered from alcoholism. Although the star reportedly paid for . some of his rehab treatment, she did not invite him to her 2000 wedding . to Guy Ritchie, supposedly worried that he would sell his story to the . media.

When Dr William Magee III, medical director of international programmes in the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery, heard about the baby who was born with two mouths, both of which included an upper and lower jaw, he found a way to help.

He said: 'We spent a lot of time planning the surgery, but we made some final decisions on how to go about it while in the operating room. 'The face is made of multiple pieces, so it's like pieces of a puzzle. The cool thing is that we were able to use all those extra pieces in Rokaya's face.

"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 1:34 PM on 24th October 2011 . Argentina's fiery president Cristina Fernandez has scored a record election win after her government spread the wealth of a booming economy. Ms Fernandez won 53 per cent of the vote after 58 per cent of the polling stations reported nationwide. Her nearest challenger got just 17 per cent. It was the widest margin of victory in the country's history. Re-elected: Cristina Fernandez waves to supporters at her victory rally in Buenos Aires . Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo predicted the president's share would rise as polls reported from her party's stronghold of densely populated Buenos Aires province. 'Count on me to continue pursuing the project,' Ms Fernandez vowed in her victory speech. 'All I want is to keep collaborating ... to keep Argentina growing. I want to keep changing history.' Ms Fernandez is Latin America's first woman to be re-elected as president, but the victory was personally bitter sweet - the first without her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, who died of a heart attack last October 27. 'This is a strange night for me,' she said, describing her mix of emotions. 'This man who transformed Argentina led us all and gave everything he had and more ... Without him, without his valour and courage, it would have been impossible to get to this point.' Thousands of jubilant, flag-waving people crowded into the capital's historic Plaza de Mayo to watch on a huge TV screen as Ms Fernandez  spoke from a hotel. President Fernandez delivers a speech after winning a second four-year term by a huge margin over her closest rival, according to partial results . Emotional: President Fernandez is greeted by her son Maximo next to her daughter Florencia . Her supporters interrupted so frequently with their chants that she lectured them as a mother would her children: 'The worst that people can be is small. In history, you always must be bigger still - more generous, more thoughtful, more thankful.' Then, she showed her teeth, vowing to protect Argentina from outside threats or special interests. 'This woman isn't moved by any interest. The only thing that moves her is profound love for the country. Of that I'm responsible,' Ms Fernandez said. Cristina Fernandez has made no secret of her contempt for Britain's presence in the Falklands Islands. In June, she called Britain a 'crude colonial power' after David Cameron declared the Falkland Islands should remain British territory. President Fernandez had taken issue with remarks made by Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions. The leader had praised the British troops who retook the Falklands from the Argentines during the 1982 war over the islands. But Ms Fernandez insisted Argentina and Britain should negotiate over the islands, as the U.N. General Assembly has urged. She said Argentina intends to keep raising its demands in international forums for negotiations with the British. 'We're going to say that in the 21st century they continue to be a crude colonial power in decline,' she said. Referring to Mr Cameron's statements, Ms Fernandez said that Argentina's foreign minister considered it an 'expression of arrogance.' The South Atlantic islands are claimed by Argentina, which refers to them as Las Malvinas. Later, she appeared in the plaza as well, giving a rousing, second victory speech, her amplified voice echoing through the capital as she called on Argentina's youth to dedicate themselves to social projects nationwide. Ms Fernandez was on track to win a larger share of votes than any president since Argentina's democracy was restored in 1983, when Raul Alfonsin was elected with 52 per cent. Her margin over Governor Hermes Binner and five other candidates was wider even than the 1973 victory margin of her strongman hero, Juan Domingo Peron. Her political coalition also hoped to regain enough seats in Congress to form new alliances and regain the control it lost in 2009. At play were 130 seats in the lower house and 24 in the Senate. Ms Fernandez suffered high negative ratings early in her presidency, but soared in popularity as a widow by softening her usually combative tone and proving her ability to command loyalty or respect from an unruly political elite. Most voters polled beforehand said they wanted government stability to keep their financial situations improving in what has been one of Argentina's longest spells of economic growth in history. Ms Fernandez, 58, chose her youthful, guitar-playing, long-haired economy minister, Amado Boudou, as her running mate. Together, the pair championed Argentina's approach to the global financial crisis: nationalise private pensions and use central bank reserves to increase government spending rather than impose austerity measures, and force investors in foreign debt to suffer before ordinary citizens. Argentina's world-record debt default in 2001 closed off most international lending, but it has kept the country booming ever since, with its economy expanding at twice the rate of Brazil's, economist Mark Weisbrot said.

Flying the flag: Crowds gather to show their support for their re-elected president . The country faces tough challenges in 2012: Its commodities exports are vulnerable to a global recession, and economic growth is forecast to slow sharply in the coming year. Declining revenues will make it harder to raise incomes to keep up with inflation. Argentina's central bank is under pressure to spend reserves to maintain the peso's value against the dollar, while also guarding against currency shocks that could threaten Argentina's all-important trade with Brazil. Victory: Fernandez speaks to supporters after winning the general election . Mr Boudou, 48, could now win attention as a potential successor to Ms Fernandez, but navigating these storms will require much skill and good fortune. Opposition candidates blamed MS Fernandez for rising inflation and increasing crime and accused her of politically manipulating economic data and trying to use government power to quell media criticism. Former President Eduardo Duhalde, who fell from front-running rival to near-last in the polls, said in a dour closing speech that 'the country is dancing on the Titanic', failing to prepare Argentina for another global economic crisis.","Economy growing twice as fast as Brazil .

A former leader of the U.S. Hare Krishna movement - forced to flee to India in disgrace after being convicted of racketeering and his implication in the killing of two devotees - has died of kidney failure. Swami Bhaktipada, who built a golden palace in the hills of Appalachia for his followers - died aged 74 on Monday in a hospital near Mumbai, India. He was released from prison in 2004 after serving eights years of a 12-year sentence and moved to India in 2008. Convict: Swami Bhaktipada, who built a golden palace in the hills of Appalachia for his followers - died aged 74 on Monday in a hospital near Mumbai, India . Mr Bhaktipada, born in 1937 as Keith Ham in Peekskill, New York, and the son of a Baptist preacher, was one of the first Hare Krishna disciples in the U.S. He converted in 1966 and immediately made an impression on the movement. Without the permission of his leader in India at the time, early on in his spiritual journey, he set out to 'westernise' the religion by eliminating some traditional elements and chanting prayers in English at a New York City temple. He was evicted from the temple and left New York in 1967, but was later forgiven. Elaborate: New Vrindaban became the Hare Krishna movement's largest community in the U.S. In 1968 he founded, alongside his lifelong partner Howard Morton Wheeler,  New Vrindaban - which would become the movement's largest community in the country . The centre-piece of the 4,000 acre 'Spiritual Disneyland' in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia, was a Palace of Gold - which is now a major tourist attraction. Membership quickly grew and it became the nation's largest Hare Krishna community. But in 1987, the FBI raided the area, seizing records and computers. Bhaktipada and New Vrindaban were excommunicated from the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and members began to leave as Bhaktipada formed a new League of Devotees. Prosecutors later accused Bhaktipada of ordering the killings of two devotees who had threatened his control of New Vrindaban. Centre-piece: New Vrindaban is a 4,000 acre 'Spiritual Disneyland' in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia . Bhaktipada denied any involvement in the killings, although another man was convicted of the murders and testified that he had ordered him to commit them. Prosecutors also alleged that Bhaktipada had amassed more than $10 million through illegal fundraising schemes, including the sale of caps and bumper stickers bearing copyrighted and trademarked logos. He appealed his 1991 racketeering conviction, then pleaded guilty at a second trial in August 1996 and was sentenced to 20 years. A judge reduced the sentence to 12 years in 1997, citing Bhaktipada's poor health. He had suffered with severe asthma and complications from childhood polio. Created: Swami Bhaktipada founded New Vrindaban with lifelong partner Howard Morton Wheeler in 1968 . Bhaktipada was freed four years early from a prison in 2004, but he was barred from returning to New Vrindaban and eventually moved to India in 2008. Community spokesman Anuttama Dasa said: 'Although he played a positive role in the Krishna movement's earliest years, he later severely violated the strict standards expected of a Krishna devotee, especially a leader.' Today, New Vrindaban has about 200 members living on or next to the property. It remains a destination for pilgrims, drawing crowds for festivals, major holy days, and weekend or weeklong retreats. About 25,000 people visit annually, enjoying the ornate palace, a rose garden with more than 100 varieties, and an organic farm and dairy.",Swami Bhaktipada 'implicated in killing of two devotees'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:53 PM on 24th October 2011 . The discovery of a room-dividing screen decorated by Charles Dickens with 800 images of the great and the good of the day has stunned historians. It is believed to have been created in 1850 by Victorian novelist Dickens and his actor friend William Macready to educate the thespian's children and is a Who's Who of famous people from the 19th century. It includes images of the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon, Isaac Newton, Admiral Nelson, William Blake, Mozart, George III, Byron, John Swift, Samuel Butler, William Hogarth and George Washington. Scenes from Shakespeare plays like Henry VIII were also stuck onto the screen by the two friends who spent hours gluing etchings and prints to the 7ft tall divider at the actor's home . A burn hole caused by a candle shows how someone in the past had been closely looking at it during the night. The screen includes images of the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon, Isaac Newton, Admiral Nelson, William Blake, Mozart, George III, Byron, John Swift, Samuel Butler, William Hogarth and George Washington . Conservator Rebecca Donnan at work as she attempt to restore the screen after it was donated to Sherborne house in Dorset . Charles Dickens came into contact with several of society's most prominent figures during a career that saw him undertake several roles. The Great Expectations author once worked as a reporter, covering Parliamentary proceeding, where he interacted with several politicians. He later took up a post as editor of The Daily News in 1846. Dickens used that platform to encourage social transformation. Philanthropist Dickens, together with friend Charles West helped Great Ormond Street Hospital survive financial struggle. Dickens also held ties with several well known figures in America, Ralph Waldo Emerson who led the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century, and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Rebecca Donnan, the expert who is restoring the artefact, said: 'It really is a lovely thing and it is remarkable the difference when the surface grime is removed. 'It is a very complicated object with multiple layers. It has a timber frame with textile stretched across it with etchings and engravings on that. 'They have been stuck on with an animal or wheat starch glue and then varnished over. There have also been running repairs and it has aged and deteriorated and the wood has created acidity. 'The varnish has discloured and it has been in a room with coal fire and people smoking. 'I'm cleaning it with a special gel and also saliva. Saliva is viscous and has a special enzyme that helps remove dirt. 'It only works for a short time because it has to be at body temperature, but it lifts the dirt.' The descendents of Macready recently . gave the screen to the Friends of Sherborne House - Macready's old home . in Dorset. John Sutherland-Smith, chairman of the Friends of Sherborne House, said: ""The screen was put together in the 1850s. 'Charles Dickens and William Macready were very close friends; Nicholas Nickleby was dedicated to Mcready. 'The family story is that Dickens would visit Macready and together they made the screen, probably to educate the children. A close up of images on the screen show The Duke of Wellington (left) who served as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army until his death and Lord Nelson (right) who died during the Battle of Trafalgar . On closer investigation, playwright William Shakespeare (left) is also seen as well as a portrait believed to be that of Henry VIII (right) who became King of England in 1509 . 'It is canvas on a wood frame and the pictures are probably from periodicals and have been stuck on with glue in a large collage. 'The pictures include the names of the day as well as Shakespeare and classical history - things Macready would want his children to know.' The 10ft wide screen was found among the possessions of Sir Neville Macready's late mother and was bequeathed to the Friends of Sherborne House. Sherborne House, was built in 1740, and is currently being sold by Dorset County Council which used to run it as a school. The screen is being restored having been left to gather dirt for a reported 160 years .

Despite increased costs and family budgets under pressure with rising fuel and food prices, the survey of 2,000 parents also revealed that families are still willing to splash out on ghoulish parties. The poll found that a family spends an average £73 on food, decorations and other items for each party that they throw throughout the year. But at Halloween they are happy to go further, spending an extra £42 on ghoulish items such as sweets for 'trick or treaters', fancy dress costumes, accessories and decorations. The survey found that Halloween came . in ahead of other traditional family occasions including Easter, . Eurovision, Bonfire Night and even beat childrens' birthday parties. However, . Christmas remains the top family occasion with 62 per cent of families . saying they will be celebrating with a festive party this year. More than one in three families will celebrate the spooky season by throwing a party this year, according to the survey. The rise in the popularity of Halloween in Britain is reflected in the colossal growth on the amount of money spent which has soared by 2,300 per cent over the last 10 years to be now worth £280million.

"By . Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 3:39 AM on 26th October 2011 . The conspiracy theories are as old as the plays themselves. Was Shakespeare responsible for the greatest love - and revenge - stories ever told? Or was he merely the ‘barely literate frontman’ dreamt up to conceal the author’s true identity? Whatever the truth, members of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust have taken the newest threat to the Bard’s reputation very seriously. Scroll down to watch a trailer of the film Anonymous . Shakespeare's name is being temporarily removed from pub and street signs to support a campaign against Hollywood film Anonymous, which claims the Bard did not write the material attributed to him . Yesterday, they removed and covered up his name from street and pub signs in a campaign against a new film seeking to portray the Bard as a cover for the Earl of Oxford. Activists from the charity covered nine road signs, 16 pub signs and a large memorial in the playwright’s hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, in a bid to show what the country would be like without its greatest literary export. The ‘guerrilla protest’ coincided with the premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster ‘Anonymous’, which campaigners said was an attempt to ‘rewrite English culture’. A portrait of William Shakespeare - but did the Earl of Oxford really write his plays for him? The film, by Independence Day director Roland Emmerich, claims Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford - not William Shakespeare - wrote the plays. Featuring a glittering cast including Rafe Spall as the Bard, Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I, the film carries the tagline ‘Was Shakespeare a fraud?’ But the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust said it wanted to highlight the damaging impact of the ‘conspiracy theory’ in claiming Shakespeare was the ‘barely literate frontman for the Earl of Oxford’. Protesters at the Gower Shakespeare Memorial in Stratford town centre yesterday used a cherry picker to drape a massive 98ft by 98ft (30m) white sheet over a  statue of the playwright. They also covered street and pub signs displaying the writer’s name with black tape. Amy O’Toole, who organised the protests, said: ‘We really want to highlight the issue that William Shakespeare was the true author of his work. ‘Hundreds of people are getting behind us and we have Shakespeare pubs up and down the country from Brighton to Edinburgh getting involved. Mark Hesher of the Shakespeare Inn, Welford on Avon, temporarily removes the Bard's name from pub and street signs . Rafe Spall plays William Shakespeare in Anonymous (left) while Rhys Ifans portrays the Earl of Oxford (right) ‘It’s great to create a talking point around the Bard but ultimately we want to dispel these myths.’ Dr Paul Edmondson, head of knowledge . and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, said: ‘This film flies . in the face of a mass of historical fact. ‘There is a risk that people who have never questioned the authorship of Shakespeare’s works could be hoodwinked. ‘Shakespeare is at the core of England’s cultural and historical DNA, and he is certainly our most famous export. Stephen Fry believes that William Shakespeare, a countryman, was the true author and has rubbished the film's claims . ‘Today’s activity barely scratches . the surface, but we hope it will remind people of the enormous legacy we . owe to William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.’ However, Roland Emmerich, who also . directed disaster movie ‘2012’, said: ‘To me there are many reasons to . doubt the traditional attribution of the works of William Shakespeare to . the man from Stratford. ‘The points that strike me most are his signatures - all poorly executed and hardly a sign of true penmanship. ‘His detailed will that famously . mentioned his second ‘best bed’ but failed to mention that the man from . Stratford had a literary career . ‘And why did nobody notice the great . poet’s death in 1616, which was followed by complete silence? Also his . two daughters were illiterate.’ Scholars and celebrities, including . the Prince of Wales and Stephen Fry, have also got behind the Trust’s . campaign to prove Shakespeare’s authenticity. The Prince of Wales claimed Shakespeare must have been of significant standing to know so much about his royal characters. He said: ‘Shakespeare’s company . performed before Queen Elizabeth three or four times a year and at least . three times as often for King James. ‘It seems certain that Shakespeare and his king must have known each other well.’ Stephen Fry said: ‘There seems to be . absolutely no doubt to anybody who reads Shakespeare and is familiar . with the text that these are the works of a countryman. ‘This is a man who knows about kites . and fields and is certainly not the work of an aristocrat. It just . doesn’t ring true in any sense’","Playwright's hometown targeted by protesters to show his influence on culture and society .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 6:47 PM on 25th October 2011 . The father of a severely disabled 22-year-old woman is fighting a legal battle to keep her in school after a council insisted she was no longer entitled to publicly-funded education. Anthony Williams wants his daughter Maria, who suffers from Down's syndrome, to continue studying at Columbus College, Chelmsford, until she is 25. But Essex County Council say she was no longer entitled to publicly-funded education once she reached the age of 19. Appeal hearing: The Royal Courts of Justice in London where Anthony Williams is fighting a legal battle to keep his disabled daughter in school . The battle has been taken to the Court of Appeal where senior judges will decide on the woman's future. It is seen as a vital test case which could see thousands of adults with learning difficulties continuing into state-funded education and sharing classrooms with children, costing local councils millions. The court heard that Miss Williams, who is from Chelmsford, entered mainstream education when she was five but was always one year behind her peers and was transferred to the specialist Columbus College in 2006. She has a reading age of nine, cannot tell the time and has no concept of money, but she loves drama, dance and the expressive arts. She continues to study at the college, which, with the approval of her father, is happy for her to stay on until she is 25, the court heard. But, since 2008, the council has insisted her Statement of Special Education Needs only ran until she was 19, after which she would not be entitled to publicly-funded education. Following a long-running legal wrangle with her father, the council has now brought the case before the Court of Appeal, asking three senior judges to rule on the issue. Decision to make: Lord Justice Maurice Kay is one of the Court of Appeal judges who will make a decision on Maria Williams' future in education . David Wolfe, for Mr Williams, told the court a 'flexible approach' should be taken, which would prevent those who need continuing education 'falling off a cliff when they hit 19'. He said: 'Although a statement can only be made in the first place for someone who is at the time ""a child"", statements do not automatically lapse, for example simply because the person ceases to be ""a child"".' Fiona Scolding, for the council, warned judges that allowing students with special educational needs to continue in schools past 19 would have a massive impact on local authorities around the country. She said: 'There are approximately 223,000 children and young people in  England and Wales with statements of special educational needs. 'This case is about Maria Williams and its facts, but it is applicable to the other young people approaching or having reached 19, who may well wish to stay in school until their late twenties.' 'It is a point of real importance, as it raises a significant issue of principle as to when a local authority's responsibility ceases for those with statements of special educational needs. 'Local authorities have, to date, considered that their responsibilities end, in line with the code of practice, the year that a child becomes 19.'This also raises questions about the designation of schools and how they would manage to accommodate these individuals, and also practical questions about safeguarding younger children if there are a cohort of adults being taught with them.' Recognising the widespread importance of the case, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Moses and Mrs Justice Baron, reserved their judgement, which will be given at an unspecified date in the future.","Legal fight seen as test case which could see adults with learning difficulties sharing classes with children .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 3:47 PM on 25th October 2011 . A hotelier is suing TripAdvisor over claims she has lost thousands of pounds in revenue after the travel website accused her of posting fake positive reviews. Deborah Sinclair is taking legal action after a 'red flag' was placed on the review page of the Riverside hotel which she owns in Evesham, Worcestershire. The business was ranked No 1 in the area, but Mrs Sinclair claims takings have . fallen 75 per cent after suffering a 'catastrophic collapse in bookings' since the message appeared in August. Personal mission: Deborah Sinclair, pictured promoting the hotel's special dog suites, says business at the Riverside hotel has slumped massively after TripAdvisor accused her of writing bogus reviews . She said: 'I've had to reduce my rates from between £80 to £125 to between £40 to £60,' she told The Times. 'This is a personal thing - me against a big company from America and I want to seek amends.' TripAdvisor gets around 45million unique visitors every month and positive reviews can attract a considerable amount of extra business. As a result, the firm has started scanning for suspicious behaviour in an attempt to identify those who manipulate the system. The message, which was posted on . Riverside's page in August, said TripAdvisor believed the hotel had been . posting suspicious reviews. It . reads: 'TripAdvisor has reasonable cause to believe that individuals or . entities associated with or having an interest in this property may . have interfered with traveller reviews and/ or the popularity index for . this property.' Red-flagged: The Riverside hotel and restaurant's review page, which has been marked with a warning message (top right and below) due to concerns about the authenticity of its reviews . Accused: The message suggests it may not be an isolated incident, but Mrs Sinclair says it has not happened at all . Mrs Sinclair believes it was one particular review which prompted the action, but claimed it was posted by a customer using the hotel's Wi-fi connection which would have given the impression it was written on an internal computer. She is being represented by online reputation management company KwikChex, which has asked TripAdvisor to produce evidence to support its claims. A spokesman for TripAdvisor said the 'red flag' had not been applied as a result of an isolated incident. She told The Times: 'We have . reasonable cause to believe that the owner and/ or individuals . associated with the owner fraudulently posted positive reviews on the . Riverside Hotel and Restaurant and negative reviews on a competitor's . property.' Mrs Sinclair says she '100 per cent denies' both of those assertions. Shunned: The Riverside hotel, in Evesham, Worcestershire, was ranked No 1 in the area, but now takings have dried up apparently as a result of the allegations . Chris Emmins, co-founder of KwikChex, said: 'These are very damaging allegations against a small business. 'I think TripAdvisor is trying to justify its fight against the overwhelming number of fake reviews by imposing a system that is not working. We will see if they have got the evidence. 'Mrs Sinclair knows the consequences of pursuing this case if she had written fake reviews, but she is determined to pursue this.' Her case is believed to be first of its kind in the UK and may lead to dozens of other hoteliers take legal action. Last month, the Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation after claims that a large proportion of TripAdvisor's 50million reviews are fake. The formal complaint was lodged by KwikChex, which stated that the level of reviews which are fake and misleading has now reached ‘epidemic levels’.","Case believed to be first of its kind in UK .

"By . James White . Last updated at 8:51 AM on 26th October 2011 . Vincent Tabak could have let Joanna Yeates live if he had wanted to, a court heard today. Instead he held her by the throat until she fell limp in his hands, jurors at Bristol Crown Court were told. In a closing speech to jurors, prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC said the 33-year-old could have just walked away. Closing speeches: Jurors will hear the final prosecution and defence cases in the murder trial of Vincent Tabak, right, who has already admitted killing Joanna Yeates inside her flat . He insisted that when Tabak went to Miss Yeates's flat in Clifton, Bristol, he had sex on his mind. Mr Lickley told jurors that, once inside her home, there was a struggle - denied by Tabak - as Miss Yeates fought for her life. 'To accept it, it means he had to . overcome her, he had to be stronger and maintain his purpose to ensure . she did not escape,' Mr Lickley said. 'He knew what he was doing. He was in . control and he knew she would die and he held her neck long enough, and . coupled with a smothering second hand, to be sure that she would. 'It goes to his intent and his intention to kill or cause really serious bodily harm.' Family: Joanna Yeates, mother Teresa, father David, left, boyfriend Greg Reardon, second left, and brother Chris arrive at court today . Killer: A prison van carrying defendant Tabak arrives at Bristol Crown Court today . Mr Lickley went on: 'He knew she was . struggling and fighting, he knew she was in pain, he knew she was . frightened, he knew she couldn't breathe. 'Instead of letting go and releasing . his grip and letting her live, he carried on and on and on until she . went dead in his hands, her life extinguished.' During Mr Lickley's speech, Tabak did not look up from the dock, instead staring at the floor and keeping his head in his hands. Miss Yeates's parents, David and Teresa, her brother David and boyfriend Greg Reardon sat quietly in the front row of the public gallery, as they have done throughout the trial. On occasions Mrs Yeates looked tearful. Vincent Tabak, 33, denies Miss Yeates's murder but has admitted her manslaughter. During the trial at Bristol Crown . Court the Dutch engineer described his actions as 'horrendous' as he . showed jurors with his own hand how he strangled his next-door . neighbour. Tabak said he had been attracted to . 25-year-old Miss Yeates and 'made a pass at her' when she invited him in . to her flat in Clifton, Bristol. The prosecution maintain Tabak's assault was sexually motivated - an accusation rejected by the defence. Mr Lickley said today that Tabak had intended to kill the landscape architect or cause her really serious harm because he gripped her throat for long enough and hard enough to end her life. 'Twenty seconds is a long time,' Mr Lickley said. Girlfriend: Tabak pictured with his girlfriend Tanja Morson at . Stonehenge . 'Whatever, in fact, the period of time was - it might have been less, it might have been more, perhaps 15 seconds, 20 seconds or 30 seconds - but it is a long time when you have your hands around the throat of another person. 'It is when someone has their hands around your throat and they are squeezing and squeezing to such an extent that you cannot breathe. 'Vincent Tabak knows how long he held her throat, you may think. 'Every second means a continued determination to kill. It is not a few seconds but a significant period of time. 'It is long enough and hard enough, a sustained, continuous period of pressure of sufficient force to cause the body to react as it does. 'It is a long time to imagine the holding of a neck, the sounds, the fight, the fear in the eyes of the victim - all directed at Vincent Tabak. 'Because he was facing Joanna Yeates all until the person goes limp. 'It is a long time to hold anyone forcefully, yet alone around the neck. 'It takes no time to realise what consequences are from what the person holding your neck is intent on doing.' Mr Lickley said strangulation was not something done on the 'spur of the moment'. 'There is no use of a weapon, a knife or a blunt instrument but a hand,' he told jurors. 'It brings a unique connection between the attacker and the victim. The two people are joined in the moments leading up to death. 'The hand of the attacker feeling the neck of his victim. 'The other hand smothering her mouth - the distance perhaps the length of Vincent Tabak's arm. 'It is a method of killing that takes time and it isn't done in the spur of the moment. 'It is not instantaneous, unlike the insertion of a knife. 'It is protracted and it is persistent and it requires quite deliberate acts and a determination to carry on and carry on despite the reaction and the actions of the victim. 'It involves a deliberate choice to rule out the decision to stop and release the grip. 'You carry on until the person presumably in your hand, after the person has stopped, you let them fall to the ground.' Together: Joanna Yeates and her boyfriend Greg Reardon. Miss Yeates' father David and Mr Reardon watched intently earlier in the trial as Tabak told a jury he had not been sexually aroused as he killed her . Mr Lickley described Tabak as 'shrewd' and accused him of making 'careful decisions'. 'Vincent Tabak is very clever, he is intelligent,' he told jurors. 'There is another side to Vincent Tabak. He is dishonest, deceitful and he is a liar.' Mr Lickley also accused Tabak of making up his recollections of the night of December 17 last year to match his account. He told jurors that when Tabak gave evidence, he answered 'Can't remember' to more than 80 questions from him. Jurors have been told Miss Yeates suffered 43 separate injuries when she was attacked. Defence QC William Clegg closed his case yesterday and addressed the jury today after prosecutor Mr Lickley had spoken. He said he was not going to excuse the defendant's actions and appealed to the jury . to reach a verdict based on the evidence alone. 'I am not going to ask you to excuse his conduct after the killing, there can be no excuse,' Mr Clegg said. 'If either of us set out to win a popularity contest, I would lose and rightly so. Mr Clegg called Tabak's behaviour 'dreadful' and added: 'But it does not alter what was in his mind at the time it happened. 'There is only one thing that I can . ask and that is a verdict based on the evidence heard in this court, . nothing more, nothing less.' Mr Clegg said jurors should reject the . prosecution assertion that Miss Yeates's death was 'planned, . premeditated and sexually motivated' as the evidence did not support it. He said the prosecution case could not explain how Tabak had got inside . Miss Yeates's flat and suggested the defendant's evidence of being . invited in was correct. Mr Clegg said prosecution claims that Tabak had picked up Miss Yeates's . cat and taken it back to her flat were not supported by the evidence. 'That goes a long way to destroy the suggestion that this killing was planned,' Mr Clegg said. The barrister also asked the jury to accept Tabak's view that Miss . Yeates's death happened after 9.35pm and not shortly after she arrived . home at 8.45pm. He said the witness reports of screams coming from Canynge Road were . more likely to be students celebrating the end of term than Miss . Yeates's desperate fight for life. 'These noises had nothing to do with this case at all. They are certainly a red herring,' he said. Mr Clegg said the attack on Miss Yeates was very short and the jury . should not hold it against Tabak that he could not recall every detail . when giving evidence. 'I am going to invite you to conclude this was a very short, fast-moving . incident which would have been over in less than 30 seconds,' Mr Clegg . said. 'That is what this case is about - whether or not Vincent Tabak had . formed an intention to kill or cause serious harm to Joanna Yeates. 'There was a few seconds of madness. 'We would invite you to say the fact he cannot provide a . second-by-second account in what happened in that fast-moving, dynamic . situation is really not surprising. Could you really expect it of . anyone?' Mr Clegg concluded: 'We invite you to reject the prosecution's . suggestion this was planned, to reject their suggestion it was . premeditated, to reject their suggestion it was sexually motivated, and . to reject their suggestion she was killed at about 8.40pm. 'We invite you to come to the conclusion that the evidence points to it . being unplanned, unpremeditated, without sexual motivation and with . death occurring after 9.35pm.' The trial was adjourned until tomorrow when the judge, Mr Justice Field, will begin summing up. Landscape architect Miss Yeates was last alive on the evening of December 17 last year. She was reported missing two days later when her boyfriend Greg Reardon returned to their ground floor flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, Bristol, after a weekend away. Police launched a massive hunt for the university graduate but her body was found by dog walkers on Christmas morning in a country lane in Failand, North Somerset - just three miles from her home. The net closed in on Tabak and he was arrested on January 20 when police matched his DNA to samples found on Miss Yeates's body and clothing.","Strangulation 'is a method of killing that takes time and it isn't done in the spur of the moment' says prosecutor in closing speech .

"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 8:35 PM on 24th October 2011 . Spyhunters in Germany have arrested a middle-aged Russian couple it says were espionage agents for Moscow who operated under the radar of the intelligence services for two decades. The married spooks - identified in Germany as Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag - allegedly sent back their reports to their handlers via a radio code. German media reports said the arrest of Heidrun Anschlag was like a scene from a cold war movie - she was tapping out a message back to Russia in her home in Balingen when an armed task force broke in and arrested her mid-transmission. Caught red-handed: Heidrun Anschlag was arrested by police in her home in Balingen, Germany, while typing out a coded message to her masters . The arrests come at a time of heightening tensions with the SWR - the spy agency which replaced the Soviet-era KGB - in the world. In the UK Katia Zatuliveter, 26, is accused of seducing Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock into a four-year affair in order to gain intelligence secrets and the FBI is still investigationg a ten-strong 'deep cover' spy ring in suburban America it busted last year. It was also revealed the pair, both aged 51, had contact to agent OOX - sexy spy Anna Chapman who was among the sleeper cell that the FBI broke up. Contact: The middle-aged couple were said to have had contact with Anna Chapman, the sexy spy charged with espionage after a sleeper cell was broken up by the FBI . Investigators said it was due to information gleaned from the interrogations in America that led to the arrests of the spy duo in Germany. Andreas and Heidrun were reportedly throwbacks from the Soviet era who stayed on in reunited Germany to serve new masters after the same old secrets - industrial, technological and military. Both were arrested on Tuesday last week, Andreas while he was on an alleged business trip in the university city of Marburg. Two Austrian passports, both said to . be forgeries made by the counterfeiters of the SWR, were seized when . they were taken into custody. GS9-G commandos - the elite of the German police trained by former officers of Britain's SAS regiment - made the arrests. The . bogus passports stated that Andreas was born in Argentina and Heidrun . in Peru. Checks with authorities in both nations proved them to be . fakes. 'The accused are . suspected of having worked in Germany over a long period of time for a . foreign intelligence agency,' the federal prosecutor said in a . statement. 'The Federal Crime Office (BKA) is investigating.' The BKA is Germany's equivalent of the FBI. We're watching you: An East German Stasi officer listens in on a couple in a scene from the Oscar-winning film The Lives Of Others . The news of the arrests brought back a little flavour of the cold war to the country that for 40 years was in the front line had it ever turned hot. Thousands of spies from communist East Germany - itself a puppet of Moscow - infiltrated West Germany, working in government offices, the . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was a former KGB spy who was stationed in Dresden in the socialist east from 1985 to 1990. The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution says the SWR has 13,000 overseas agents active. Russia and China are named by it as the busiest spies at large in the west. Satellite, sensor and communications technology are the three most sought-after prizes although it remains unclear what sort of espionage the married couple were precisely enaged in.","Middle-aged couple had sent messages back to Russia for two decades .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 2:13 PM on 24th October 2011 . The Queen received a rapturous welcome in Brisbane today as she praised the 'resilience and courage' of Australians who endured devastating floods earlier this year. Tens of thousands of well-wishers lined the banks of the Brisbane River as the monarch and Duke of Edinburgh - aboard a . catamaran - travelled up the waterway that wreaked havoc on the city. It broke its banks in January and forced thousands to flee their homes during the natural disaster which saw the worst floods in the region for almost 40 years. Furry friends: Queensland Premier Anna Bligh introduces the Queen to two koalas - Nivea and Sprite - held by wildlife officers during a tour of Brisbane today. The animals were rescued from January's devastating floods . Moving on: After meeting the koalas, the Queen was given a first-hand account of January's floods when she met rescue workers, survivors and those who lost their homes . But today an estimated 45,000 . spectators lined wharves, jetties and riverside roads to catch a glimpse . of the royal couple as they sailed by in the catamaran Pure Adrenalin to see for themselves where the waters devastated . homes and livelihoods. Their . destination was the South Bank district of Brisbane, a mix of . apartments, offices, shops, galleries and a feature rainforest area, . that suffered £7.8million (AUS$12million) worth of damage in the January floods. Among the survivors they met met were two little koala evacuees. The tale of Nivea and Sprite was a little light relief to the stories of . the loss of lives, homes and businesses. When the floodwaters struck, the marsupials were removed from the Lone Pine . Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane where they were born in captivity. They were introduced to the Queen when she toured the Rainforest Park area of the South Bank. Nivea, nine, and Sprite, eight, were held by sanctuary staff . Karen Nilsson, a senior wildlife officer, and wildlife manager Jacqui . Brumm. Warm welcome: The Queen smiles as she meets hundreds of people gathered at Brisbane's South Bank . Cruise: The Queen and Prince Philip climbed aboard a boat for a tour along the Brisbane River to see the areas hit by January's flooding . Because the animals were bred in captivity, they are accustomed to being . around people and are often brought out to meet VIP guests. The Queen asked about the flooding and if it affected the animals, and was told by Ms Brumm: 'They had to be evacuated to higher ground . behind their home, Lone Pine was inundated (with water).' As the two women chatted, one of the koalas munched away on eucalyptus leaves, oblivious to the royal presence. During . a speech to launch a new water storage facility in the city that will . provide irrigation water for the rainforest, the Queen praised . Australians and the reception she had received. She . said: 'Today Prince Philip and I have been greeted with great warmth . and good humour in the true Australian spirit and I have seen the . fortitude, ingenuity and determination of Brisbane to overcome the . setbacks of last January.' In January, the rising tide of brown . murky water swamped suburbs deluging homes and businesses in Brisbane . and forcing people to seek refuge in sports stadiums. At . the height of the flooding three-quarters of the state of Queensland . was declared a disaster area, 36 people were dead and damage . across the region was estimated at hundreds of millions of . Australian dollars. Meeting survivors: The Queen greets Dan Matthews during a chat with some of those affected by the Queensland floods . All ears: The monarch listens as Mrs Bligh points towards the areas affected by the floods . The Queen added: 'We are here to pay tribute to the resilience and . courage of Queenslanders who bravely picked up their lives and rebuilt . them after a period of great adversity. 'This . morning we travelled along the Brisbane River listening to the stories . of when the river broke its banks, and seeing the vast impact of the . natural disaster.' The Queen was given a first-hand . account of the floods when she met rescue workers, . survivors and those who lost their homes. During a reception at an arts . centre in Brisbane, the Queen met Danny McGuire, who lost his wife, 12-year-old . son and five-year-old daughter when a flash flood hit the town of Grantham, . Queensland. Mr McGuire . described how his wife and children tried to shelter in a fire engine . but drowned when the cabin filled up with water. The father, who was with his only surviving child Zac, seven, said: 'She mainly asked me how did I lose my family. 'I . said in the fire truck. She asked did we have any warning and I said we . did try to evacuate Grantham the night before and we got told to stand . down.' The Queen recycled an outfit from her wardrobe yesterday when she stepped out into the sunshine in the . primrose yellow dress she wore to the wedding of the Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge. She had chosen the single crepe wool . dress and matching coat and hat, designed by her personal assistant . Angela Kelly, when she attended her grandson’s wedding in April. The only difference was that, with temperatures close to 30c, the coat was missing. Matching: During a visit to a church in Canberra yesterday (left), the Queen wore the . same primrose yellow dress she wore at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April (right) Appropriately, the dress features hand-sewn beading at the neck in the shape of sunrays. The famously thrifty Queen is known for recycling her outfits - she has often asked Angela Kelly and her team of seamstresses to . change the decorations on gowns in accordance to latest fashion trends. Or perhaps to keep costs down. Scores of well-wishers greeted the Queen on Sunday when she attended a service in Canberra at the historic St John’s Church. Close to 1,000 people had gathered . around crash barriers erected close to St John the Baptist church, and . when the royal couple arrived they cheered . and clapped. The service was held behind closed . doors with more than 100 people attending, including former . Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd. If a Sunday falls within an overseas . tour members of the royal family regularly attend an Anglican service in . whichever city they may be visiting. Mr McGuire, a member of the fire service, said meeting the royal couple was a rare happy moment. He said: 'It was really good for Zac, when the Queen came around to shake his hand, he hid behind me. My spirits were lifted for Zac, it's going to be something he is going to remember.' The Queen and Prince Philip also met . Sarah Norman, whose parents drowned when floodwater gushed through the . Lockyer Valley in south Queensland. Carrying . her three-month-old baby, Eleanor, she told the Queen how her mother . and father - Steve and Sandy Matthews - were overwhelmed by flash . flooding. She said afterwards: 'Our property got hit by five different bodies of water, we were the first to get struck.' Ms Norman said the Queen expressed her sorrow and asked how old the baby was. Widespread destruction: An aerial view of flood waters submerging Forest Hill, Queensland, on 11 January . A passenger in a car waves for assistance as a flash flood sweeps across Toowoomba, 65miles west of Brisbane, on 10 January . During the reception, the Queen listened closely to people's recollections and told one guest how she was shocked when she saw the floods on television. 'They were alarming pictures,' she said. Gwen Braga, who badly injured her leg in the floods, was forced to take a seat shortly before meeting the Queen. She said: 'She was so gracious and so understanding and I thanked her for coming because it meant a lot to our community.' British migrant Jill Ashmore, who comes from Woking, said the hidden tragedy of the disaster was the number of people who had committed suicide since the floods. She said: 'I know eleven people within my Brisbane suburb who have killed themselves. 'People lost not only their houses but their business and many didn't have insurance - they just could not see hope, that was the problem.'","The Queen talks to survivors of January disaster during Brisbane reception .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 10:27 AM on 25th October 2011 . Passenger planes of the future could be able to take people directly to their front door, a report suggests today. Commercial jets could also be made that fly five times the speed of sound - meaning they could fly from London to New York in . less than an hour. Such aircraft could come into construction by the end of the century and would be part of efforts to place the UK at the forefront of future aerospace innovation,  a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers says. The passenger drop-off idea would use what has been called 'a sort of Ark Royal for the skies'. Scramjet planes like this one designed by NASA are among the speediest of aircraft . Looking towards 2075 and beyond, the . report talked of advances that could be made in aircraft design. It talks of passenger scramjet planes able to . fly at around 4,000mph - five times the speed of sound - and commercial . aircraft flying in a V-shaped formation that could to save power by . making use of airflow generated by the plane in front, similar to the . way migrating birds support one another in the air. Scramjets - short for supersonic . combustion ramjet - contain a 'air-breathing' jet engine, that allows . them to combust fuel and decelerate the incoming air to produce speed . and thrust. The fastest current 'air-breathing aircraft' is a scramjet designed by NASA, which reached a velocity of Mach 9.8 - or 7,000mph. So far, though, these hi-tech aircraft are unable to carry passengers. NASA's record-breaking X-43A aircraft looks more like a missile than a plane. Passenger jets would necessarily be a little hair-raising - and travel at a more 'moderate' speed of 4,000mph. New York to Sydney21 hours down to 2.5 hours . London to New York7 hours down to 55 minutes . London to Singapore13 hours down to 1hr 40mins . NASA's hypersonic jets are designed to . fly through the Earth’s atmosphere and slash flight times around the . world to a few hours at most. Travelling at such speed would reduce . the flight time from New York to Sydney to around two-and-a-half hours, . from the 21 hours it is now. The report also discusses looking at . ways to create an 'aircraft carrier' system in which a large aircraft . carries individual units that can be released over a destination to . float down to the designated area where a passenger needs to go - as if dropping passengers 'at their door'. Other ideas are a 'flying wing' design, where the plane's main body, wings and engine blended together . and a 'flying fuel station' so future planes do not have to take off . with full tanks. A graphic of the airflow over a Nasa scramjet . Scramjet engine 'combusts' fuel and decelerates the incoming air to produce speed and thrust .

He said: 'Now is the time for industry and government to focus on sectors that can help lift the country's economy. 'The UK aerospace sector already . employs over 100,000 people around the country and is worth over £29 . billion a year to our economy, but we need to take action now to ensure . this sector can continue to thrive and grow.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:55 PM on 17th August 2011 . America has been told to stop flooding its economy with cheap credit - by China. Chinese commentators preparing for Vice President Joseph Biden's visit to their country have warned the U.S. against the quantitative easing policy being used by its Federal Reserve. They fear that a massive injection of money into the economy will not push down interest rates. Official: U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in China with his granddaughter Naomi for a five-day official visit . Arrival: Vice President Joseph Biden and his granddaughter Naomi are in China to talk about its relationship with the U.S. Instead they fear it will boost the prices of commodities traded in dollars, fuel inflation and erode the value of the $1.2 trillion China owns in U.S. Treasury debt. Xiao Gang, chairman of state-owned Bank of China, wrote in China Daily: 'The U.S. should refrain from launching QE3 (a third round of bond-buying by the Federal Reserve) and tighten its monetary policy to raise the world's confidence in the dollar.' The official Xinhua News Agency added: 'China has much at stake over U.S. economic policy changes and a stable U.S. dollar.' And economist Xia Bin, who advises China's cabinet and central bank, wrote on his blog: 'The United States has entered a long period of decline.' Parade: Vice President Joe Biden arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport to try to revive his country's image after a historic debt downgrade . Game time: Vice President Joseph Biden (third left) was invited to a friendly men's basketball game between China's Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons and the United States' Georgetown University Hoyas, as part of his trip . Biden arrived in Beijing today to talk about, amongst other things, cutting government budget deficits and fighting poverty. He will also talk to Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to take over as Communist Party chief in 2012 and will visit Washington later this year. And his aides expect him to have to answer questions on Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims and which Washington provides arms to. But the sub-text for the five-day visit is Chinese worries about the U.S. economy. Slam dunk: Joseph Biden looked on as the ball was slam dunked during the match . While the advice being handed out by Chinese economists is similar to that from Western analysts, it has been remarked that they are being unusually pointed. This is because, in China, communist leaders frequently say governments should stay out of each others' affairs. They have also said that resolving economic problems in a 'responsible manner' would improve U.S.- Chinese relations. China's own government debt is low compared with those of the U.S., Japan and European countries. This is even after a huge stimulus that helped it rebound quickly from the 2008 global crisis. The press campaign might also help Beijing diffuse criticism it faces on its decision to invest so much of its $3.2 trillion in foreign reserves in Treasury debt. Treasurys are seen as one of the lowest-risk assets but the recent debate in Washington over raising the government debt limit and downgrade of the U.S. credit rating caused alarm in China. Capital Economics analyst Mark Williams said: 'By focusing concern on the failures of U.S. policy making, as China sees it, Chinese officials are able to deflect attention from their own part in creating some of the global imbalances and the decision that lay entirely in their hands to invest so much in U.S. Treasurys.'","U.S. Vice President warned against quantative easing .

"By . Mark Duell and John Stevens . Last updated at 8:56 PM on 26th October 2011 . A prosecutor says the Utah neighbours of a dead teenage girl who mysteriously vanished six weeks ago while babysitting are now 'persons of interest' in the case and charges could come next month. North Ogden police say 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen vanished on September 10 after babysitting for neighbourhood couple Eric and Dea Millerberg, who are both currently behind bars on other charges. Authorities found Miss Rasmussen's body in a shallow grave on October 18 near Interstate 84 east of Ogden. Weber County Attorney Dee Smith is now . calling the couple 'persons of interest' after 36-year-old Eric . Millerberg was sent back to prison on Tuesday for violating his . probation in a 2010 fraud case. Millerberg's wife remains jailed after . being charged on October 7 with two prescription fraud felonies. Tragedy: Alexis Rasmussen went missing in North Ogden, Utah on September 10 and was found last week . Questioned: Miss Rasmussen vanished on September 10 after babysitting for neighbourhood couple Eric and Dea Millerberg, now 'persons of interest' in the case, according to police . A telephone message for Eric Millerberg's attorney was not immediately returned. He was repeatedly in prison from 1997 to 2006 for burglary, discharge of a firearm and failure to stop at the command of police, according to Department of Corrections records. The Salt Lake Tribune also reported he was affiliated with Silent Aryan Warrios, a white supremacist prison gang group. He was originally convicted of forgery . and credit card fraud when he was arrested for having drugs. He did not . reference the disappearance of Miss Rasmussen during his court . appearance. He claimed to have a prescription for . oxycodone, which police found in his possession. 'I have pains. I have a . metal plate in my neck and six screws,' he told the judge. Millerberg was ordered to return to prison, where he is expected to serve up to a five year sentence. Discovery: The body was found at a rural site north of Salt Lake City on Tuesday and was identified on Saturday . Search: Police had been looking for the 16-year-old since she vanished while babysitting on September 10 . Earlier this week Smith said the public should not be fearing a killer at-large. 'I am confident police do know who is . responsible for her death,’ he told the Salt Lake Tribune. ‘I don’t . think (the suspects) are in a position where the general public needs to . be worried about them.'

Authorities are waiting for the . results of an autopsy to decide on what the suspects will be charged . with - and this could take at least a month, so the investigation will . probably stretch into December. 'The body's disposal suggests foul . play, but I can’t say to what degree,’ Mr Smith told the Tribune, adding . investigators believe she died soon after she disappeared and this is a . 'homicide'. Students at Weber High School were . distraught at their classmate’s death and many went home as they were so . upset on Monday. 'Everyone is crying,' Juliette Swenson, 16, told the . Tribune. The family of the girl last week said: . 'Our beautiful Alexis is sadly gone' and they paid tribute to her on a . Facebook page set up during the search to find her, saying they had . 'endured a catastrophe.' Memories: Fellow students at Weber High School said that they were shocked and devastated . '(It) has changed each of us in ways . that are far beyond words,' they said. 'Alexis touched so many people in . the past 50 days, just as she did in the time she was here. ‘Life will never be the same.

"By . Rupert Steiner . Last updated at 1:56 AM on 27th October 2011 . It is no faster or bigger than existing jumbo jets. But, as it took off on its maiden flight yesterday, Boeing’s Dreamliner was hailed as the most revolutionary step in air passenger travel since Concorde. And that is not just because it is effectively made of plastic, making it lighter and more fuel-efficient than other planes. Its major advance is on the inside, where it offers new levels of passenger comfort. The bigger windows are obvious, the wider seats and aisles less so. Flight of fancy: Passengers pose before boarding All Nippon Airways' Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft at Narita airport, Tokyo . New era: The 787 Dreamliner aircraft takes off . The cabin hosts specially modified . levels of air pressure and humidity to help avoid the headaches and . nausea that can accompany a long-haul flight. The 787 also boasts 60 per cent lower . noise levels and comes with anti-turbulence systems and even an advanced . air-filtration system to eliminate unwanted odours. Yesterday the new 264-seat aircraft . taxied on to Runway A of Tokyo’s Narita Airport, with Japanese carrier . Air Nippon Airways inviting the Mail and more than 200 aviation experts . and enthusiasts for the first flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong. The 787 looks wider than a conventional aircraft but is no bigger in either height or length. Inside, it is a different story. As I walked up the gantry, the most notable difference is the eight-foot vaulted ceiling. Roaringly good aircraft: A lion dance welcomes the first passengers off the Dreamliner in Hong Kong . State of the art: The high-tech cockpit is a dream for the 787's pilots . Flying into the future: The 787 is sprayed with water to celebrate its arrival at Hong Kong International Airport . The 17ft-wide cabins are supposed to . give a more spacious environment than similar-sized planes but look just . the same as other aircraft. In economy class, the 787’s aisles are . typically 55cm wide – 6cm wider than in most twin-aisle airplanes. In business class, the 65cm aisles are large enough to move past serving trolleys. Seats: 210 to 250. Range: 8,800 to 9,400 miles. Wingspan: 197 feet. Length: 186 feet. Height: 56 feet. Cruise speed: Mach 0.85, about 650 mph. Cargo volume: 4,400 cubic feet. Maximum takeoff weight: 502,500 pounds. List price: $193.5 million (£120million), although airlines often negotiate discounts. Planes ordered: 797. Components: 50 per cent carbon fiber, 20 per cent aluminum, 15 per cent titanium, 10 per cent steel, 5 per cent other. Engines: Rolls Royce or General Electric. The overhead compartments are 30 per . cent bigger than those on the Boeing 777, and comfortably take a . suitcase. Boeing’s plan was to wow passengers with a series of . groundbreaking innovations made possible by ditching the conventional . aluminium shell for more modern carbon fibre. The same light and robust material . used on Formula One cars is the key to helping airlines shave 20 per . cent off their fuel bills while freeing up cabin space. The Dreamliner might not be as big as . Airbus’s monster A380, but that’s because the 787 is pitched as a . medium-sized workhorse for long-haul travel. It is being hailed as a . green passenger jet because it is less fuel-thirsty than its peers. Boeing claims its Rolls-Royce and . General Electric engines will emit 20 per cent less carbon dioxide than . similar-sized planes. Scott Fancher, general manager of the 787 project, . said: ‘Everything from the shape and size of the wings to the design of . the nacelle [the casing around the engine] make the plane more . aerodynamic and reduce drag.’ UK passengers will have to wait for . the Dreamliner’s benefits. Thomson Holidays will take delivery of 12 . next year. British Airways has ordered 24, with the first due to arrive . in 2013, while Virgin Atlantic takes delivery of its first 15 . Dreamliners in the spring of 2014. There was one thing Boeing didn’t . improve. As you might expect on a plastic plane, we received a plastic . meal of unrecognisable meat in an indistinguishable sauce. For passengers, the changes start with boarding. They enter into a wide-open area with sweeping arches. Eyes instinctively move up. There's an impression of more space. Claustrophobia is reduced just a bit, even if seats are as cramped as ever. Another physiological trick: lights gradually change colour during long flights to reduce jet lag. But the biggest changes come thanks to the stronger composite shell, which is less susceptible to corrosion than aluminium. Air won't be as dry, with humidity doubled to 16 per cent. Trendy: The new Dreamliner features a swish bar area . Inside track: The Boeing 787 Dreamliner's interiors feature sweeping arches, wide aisles, larger lavatories, and dynamic lighting .

He’s the property tycoon and fixer for oligarchs who went bankrupt, claiming he had lost his £2 billion fortune. She is the wife who insists he has hidden it to avoid paying her a divorce settlement. Now, while Scot Young, 49, and his estranged wife Michelle prepare for the next bitter battle at the High Court over their £400 million divorce, their younger daughter, Sasha, is putting pen to paper to record her feelings on the break-up that has destroyed her once luxurious family life. Sasha, 17, no longer at school because her father hasn’t paid the fees — she left £14,400–a-year girls’ day school Francis Holland in the summer — is looking for a publisher for what she describes as a ‘self-help children’s novel’. ‘I wouldn’t want anyone to go through what my sister and I have been through,’ says Sasha, who has eight GCSEs and would ideally be studying for her  A-levels now. ‘I am still hoping something good will happen out of the  next hearing and that I can go back to studying. ‘I know my situation is not the norm, but I still think I have something to say to help others.’ Former model Michelle, 47 — who in happier days was given £1 million worth of Graff jewellery for her 40th birthday by Scot — believes the court hearing on January 16 will be crucial. She insists she has hard evidence — retrieved from two laptops given to her daughters by her husband — that Scot has salted away his fortune in overseas bank accounts. She tells me: ‘I am proud of  my daughters. Scarlet has had to leave school, too, and she is working as a model. Sasha’s book is brilliant.’ Sasha adds: ‘I have learned a lot. I think I can help others. I am aiming the book at eight to 13-year-olds. ‘I don’t want to write a boring book of bullet points on how to deal with your parents’ marriage break-up and divorce. I don’t think anyone would read that. ‘So I am writing it in the form of a children’s novel with two main characters, who will be the children in a story based on all my real-life experiences.’ Battle: Tycoon Scot Young is going head-to-head with estranged wife Michelle .","Scot and Michelle Young prepare for the next High Court battle over £400m divorce .

"By . Daniel Miller . Last updated at 1:38 AM on 27th October 2011 . Women will have the right to check if a current or potential boyfriend has a history of violence under a new scheme being considered in Parliament. The plans have been dubbed ‘Clare’s Law’, after the horrific killing of 36-year-old mother Clare Wood by George Appleton a man she met on Facebook who had a long record of violent behaviour against women. Clare's Law is modelled on Sarah’s Law’ - . the successful campaign to give parents the right to check on . paedophiles in their area after the murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. Tragedy: Clare Wood, 36, was brutally murdered in 2009 by George Appleton, a man she had met on Facebook who had a history of violence against women . The Mail on Sunday reported in July that . former Labour Cabinet Minister Hazel Blears was leading a campaign to . introduce changes to current legislation. Yesterday Home Secretary Teresa May launched a 12-week consultation period to discuss how such a scheme would work and to decide whether it should go ahead. She said: 'I have been clear that ending violence against women and girls is a personal priority for me and this government. 'Domestic violence is a particularly dreadful form of abuse and I want us to constantly look at new ways of protecting victims and preventing tragic incidents from happening.' Pledge: Home Secretary Theresa May said ending violence against women is a priority for the government . With more and more women meeting men, who they know little about, on the internet many believe such a law is necessary to protect their safety. However, critics say the well-intentioned plan could jeopardise civil liberties. Ms Wood was initially charmed by Appleton’s persona after meeting him online, but his violent side soon surfaced and he subjected her to a string of sexual assaults. After they split he strangled her and set on fire in Salford in February 2009. When he went on the run he was quickly dubbed the ‘Facebook Fugitive’. Six days after Ms Wood’s body was found, Appleton was discovered hanged in a derelict pub. Ms Wood had first called police in October 2008 after he damaged her front door, threatened her with an iron and threatened to kill her. The Independent Police Complaints Commission later ruled she had been badly let down by police. Friends and family were shocked to discover that the killer had a history of violence against women, including repeated harassment, threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his other ex-girlfriends. After the inquest into Ms Wood’s death, coroner Jennifer Leeming wrote to the Home Office to recommend a system of checks which has become the basis of Clare’s Law. There are currently two options being discussed. A 'right to know' scheme would give police the power to proactively disclose information about violent men to women or even alert the family members of vulnerable women. A second 'right to ask' scheme would give women the right to ask police is a man had a history of violent behaviour. Under the current law Police can disclose previous convictions or charges to the public if they believe there is a pressing need to do so to prevent future crime. Mrs May added: 'This scheme would be based on recognised and consistent processes that could enable new partners of previously violent suspects to know more about their partner's history of abuse. 'They could then make informed choices about how and whether they take that relationship forward.' Clare's Law is modelled on Sarah's Law - the successful campaign to . give parents the right to check on paedophiles in their area after the . murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. Home Secretary May added: 'This scheme would be based on recognised and consistent processes that could enable new partners of previously violent suspects to know more about their partner's history of abuse. 'They could then make informed choices about how and whether they take that relationship forward.' Ms Wood’s father, Michael Brown said he was 'absolutely delighted' with the announcement. He told the BBC: 'Anyone who's being threatened by their partner should be able to find out if he's done anything similar in the past. 'My daughter didn't know and I don't want any other family to go through what we've had to. 'It should make a big difference to those ladies who are in a vulnerable position - it'll mean they can make informed decisions about what to do next.' In a previous interview with the Mail on Sunday he said: 'My daughter wasn’t stupid. If she had known about that man’s past, she would have taken herself out of there in a heartbeat.’ However Tory MP Robert Buckland, a member of the Commons Justice Committee, warned any such scheme would need to be carefully controlled to avoid abuse. He said: ‘We’re all in favour of curbing violence against women but we have to be certain this will not lead to fishing expeditions by women demanding confidential information about potential boyfriends without proper justification. ‘You cannot have a carte blanche system where people can simply turn up at a police station, give the name of a boyfriend or potential boyfriend, and expect the police to open up all the files on him. 'There will have to be strict controls on any proposal of this nature.’","Fears that growth of internet dating is putting thousands of women at risk .

Amateur footage purporting to be of Colonel Gaddafi, his son Mutassim and his defence minister Abu Bakr Yunis moments before they were taken away to be buried at a secret location in the Libyan desert has emerged. The grainy video, shot on a mobile phone, shows three open wooden coffins each containing a body wrapped in a white sheet. Dubai-based television network Al Alaan claims the footage is of a funeral ceremony near Misrata yesterday. Scroll down for video . Grainy: Video shot on a mobile phone shows what is claimed to be the funeral ceremony before Colonel Gaddafi, his son Mutassim and his defence minister Abu Bakr Yunis were buried at a secret location in the Libyan desert on Tuesday . Capturing the moment: One man, to the left of the cleric in the centre, can be seen filming events on a professional-looking video camera . A cleric performs what appears to be the ritual Islamic funeral prayer of Salat al-Janazah. He is believed to be Khaled Tantoush, Gaddafi's personal cleric who was captured with him last week. The ceremony is witnessed by a crowd of onlookers, thought to include two of the despot's cousins, Mansour Dhao Ibrahim and Ahmed Ibrahim. One man can be seen filming events on a professional-looking video camera. Two members of Libya’s National . Transitional Council then accompanied the bodies to their final resting . place. The men swore on the Koran never to reveal its location. Libya’s . new leaders fear the site could otherwise be vandalised or turned into a . shrine for the former dictator’s supporters, but they say access will . be granted to ‘international organisations’ asking to see it. On display: The rotting corpse of Gaddafi was on display in Misrata for four days before being taken away for burial . In other developments, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council (NTC) today claimed that chemical weapons have been found in Libya and have been secured. Speaking at a meeting between the council and Nato representatives in Qatar, he said: 'They are from the Gaddafi era and are under guard, until they can be handed over.' Nato, meanwhile, has postponed until . later this week a meeting expected  to formalise a decision . to end the Libya mission at the end of the month. Dead and buried: Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, pictured in 2009 . The postponement comes after . Libya's interim leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil today said that Nato should stay involved in Libya until the end of this year to help prevent Gaddafi loyalists from leaving the country. Nato has said it does not intend to keep forces in the Libyan region after concluding its mission and has repeatedly stated that its UN mandate is to protect civilians, not to pursue individuals - although Gaddafi himself was captured after his convoy was hit in a Nato air strike. Nato . ambassadors had been expected to meet today to formalise a preliminary . decision taken last week to end the mission on October 31. Nato spokeswoman Carmen Romero said this meeting had now been postponed. She said: 'The North Atlantic Council will meet with partners on Friday to discuss our Libya mission and take a formal decision. 'As agreed, Nato continues to monitor the situation on the ground, and retains the capability to respond to any threats to civilians. The situation remains calm as the NTC continues to establish its authority.' Gone but not forgotten: A Libyan revolutionary fighter shows reporters the empty freezer where the body of Gaddafi was displayed in Misrata . Romero said Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was in consultations with the UN and Libya's National Transitional Council about plans to conclude the mission. Nato states took their decision last week based on military recommendations. The commander of the Libya mission, Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard, said on Monday that he saw virtually no risk of forces loyal to Gaddafi mounting successful attacks to regain power and Nato believed NTC forces were able to handle security threats. Nato states have been keen to see a quick conclusion to a costly effort that has involved more than 26,000 air sorties and round-the-clock naval patrols at a time when defence budgets are under severe strain due to the global economic crisis.","Gaddafi chemical weapons have been 'found' in Libya .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:58 AM on 26th October 2011 . A federal court is being asked to grant constitutional rights to five killer whales who perform at marine parks in an unprecedented and perhaps quixotic legal action. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is accusing the SeaWorld parks of keeping five star-performer whales in conditions that violate the 13th Amendment ban on slavery. SeaWorld depicted the suit as baseless. The chances of the suit succeeding are slim, according to legal experts not involved in the case; any judge who hews to the original intent of the authors of the amendment is unlikely to find that they wanted to protect animals. But PETA relishes engaging in the court of public opinion, as evidenced by its provocative anti-fur and pro-vegan campaigns. Caged in: Killer whale Tilikum - one of the plaintiffs - watches as SeaWorld Orlando trainers take a break during a training session at the theme park's Shamu Stadium in Orlando, Florida on March 7 . The suit, which PETA says it will . file on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Diego, hinges on the fact . that the 13th Amendment, while prohibiting slavery and involuntary . servitude, does not specify that only humans can be victims. Jeff Kerr, PETA's general counsel, . says his five-member legal team - which spent 18 months preparing the . case - believes it's the first federal court suit seeking constitutional . rights for members of an animal species. The plaintiffs are the five orcas, . Tilikum and Katina based at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, and Corky, . Kasatka and Ulises at SeaWorld San Diego. Tilikum, a six-ton male, made . national news in February 2010 when he grabbed a trainer at the close of . a performance and dragged her underwater until she drowned. Captured nearly 30 years ago off . Iceland, Tilikum has enormous value as a stud and has fathered many of . the calves born at SeaWorld parks. The lawsuit asks the court to order . the orcas released to the custody of a legal guardian who would find a . 'suitable habitat' for them. 'By any definition, these orcas are . slaves - kidnapped from their homes, kept confined, denied everything . that's natural to them and forced to perform tricks for SeaWorld's . profit,' said Mr Kerr. 'The males have their sperm collected, the females . are artificially inseminated and forced to bear young which are . sometimes shipped away.' SeaWorld said any effort to extend the 13th Amendment's protections beyond humans 'is baseless and in many ways offensive.' 'SeaWorld is among the world's most . respected zoological institutions,' the company said. 'There is no . higher priority than the welfare of the animals entrusted to our care . and no facility sets higher standards in husbandry, veterinary care and . enrichment.' Eye in the sky: An aerial view of SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida shows an orca named Tilikum (circled in red) inside of his tank, his nose and tail almost touching either end . The statement outlined the many laws . and regulations SeaWorld is obliged to follow, touted the company's . global efforts to promote conservation of marine mammals, and said the . orcas' performances help give the public a better appreciation and . understanding of these animals. SeaWorld and other U.S. marine parks . are governed by the Marine Mammals Protection Act, which allows public . displays of the creatures if permits are obtained and the facility . offers and education/conservation programs for the public. Overall, under prevailing U.S. legal . doctrine, animals under human control are considered property, not . entities with legal standing of their own. They are afforded some . protections through animal-cruelty laws, endangered-species regulations . and the federal Animal Welfare Act, but are not endowed with a distinct . set of rights. However, the field of animal law has . evolved steadily, with courses taught at scores of law schools. Many . prominent lawyers and academics have joined in serious discussion about . expanding animal rights. Rutgers University law professor Gary . Francione, for example, contends that animals deserve the fundamental . right to not be treated as property. Law professor David Favre of . Michigan State University has proposed a new legal category called . 'living property' as a step toward providing rights for some animals. Mr Favre was sceptical that litigation seeking to apply the 13th Amendment to animals would prevail. 'The court will most likely not even . get to the merits of the case, and find that the plaintiffs do not have . standing to file the lawsuit at all,' he said by email. 'I also think a . court would not be predisposed to open up that box with fully unknown . consequences.' Creul? Killer whale Kasatka - another plaintiff - leaps out of the water while an unidentified trainer gives signals during SeaWorld's Shamu show in San Diego in 2006 . Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, . who in past writings has proposed extending legal standing to . chimpanzees, also expressed doubt that the courts were ready to apply . the 13th Amendment to animals. But he welcomed the PETA lawsuit as a . potentially valuable catalyst for 'national reflection and deliberation' about humans' treatment of animals. 'People may well look back at this . lawsuit and see in it a perceptive glimpse into a future of greater . compassion for species other than our own,' Tribe wrote in an email. Tribe noted that some Americans might . find it bizarre or insulting to equate any treatment of animals to the . sufferings of human slavery. But he argued that the 13th Amendment was . written broadly, to address unforeseen circumstances, and could . legitimately be applied to animals. An African-American constitutional . expert, Nicholas Johnson of Fordham University School of Law, said he . could understand why some blacks might be insulted by the lawsuit, but . didn't share that reaction: 'I'm more entertained by it in the legal . context than I am offended by it.' PETA addressed this issue in the . suit, noting that repeated Supreme Court rulings have applied the 13th . Amendment to many forms of involuntary servitude beyond the type of . slavery that existed during the Civil War. 'The historical context is . undeniable,' said Jeff Kerr, the PETA lawyer. 'But that's not what this . case is about. It's about the orcas in their own right, not whether they . are or aren't similar to humans.' The five orcas are represented in the . case by PETA and four individuals: Ric O'Barry, a longtime orca and . dolphin trainer; Ingrid Visser, a New Zealand marine biologist who has . studied orcas extensively; Howard Garrett, founder of the Orca Network, . an advocacy group in Washington State; and Samantha Berg, a former orca . trainer at SeaWorld Orlando. In the wild: A pod of killer whales are seen in Carroll Inlet, Alaska in June 2009 . The lawsuit details the distinctive . traits of orcas, the largest species within the dolphin family, . including their sophisticated problem-solving and communicative . abilities and their formation of complex communities. The suit alleges that captivity in . the 'barren tanks' of a marine park suppresses the orcas' abilities and . relationships, and subjects them to stress. This sometimes leads to . instances where the orcas injure themselves, other orcas or humans that . interact with them, according to the suit. Naomi Rose, the Humane Society's . marine mammal biologist, said there's a growing body of research . suggesting that whales, dolphins and porpoises have the cognitive . sophistication of three-to-four-year-old human children. As for the orcas at SeaWorld, she said, 'They don't seem to adapt to captivity. I would say they're miserable.' At SeaWorld San Diego, visitors are . shown a film touting the park's rescue efforts that have saved thousands . of sea creatures. During the main performance, trainers point out how . much the orcas are similar to humans: The babies cry before moving on to . babbling and finally imitating the crackling sounds of the adults' voices. Jenny Raymond, 47, who was visiting . from Switzerland, said she was delighted by the show and does not buy . the argument that the orcas are slave labourers. 'I think they are in better conditions here than in the wild,' she said.","PETA, three marine-mammal experts, and two former orca trainers file suit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:23 PM on 26th October 2011 . Hundreds of Yemeni women have set fire to a pile of female face and body veils on a main street in the capital Sanaa to protest the government's brutal crackdown against the country's popular uprising. The women spread a black cloth across a main street and threw their full-body veils, known as makrama, onto a pile, sprayed it with oil and set it ablaze. As the flames rose, they chanted: 'Who protects Yemeni women from the crimes of the thugs?' The women in Yemen have taken a key role in the uprising against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's authoritarian rule that erupted in March, inspired by other Arab revolutions. Protesting: Yemeni women burn their veils during a demonstration demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Sanaa . Open dissent: The brutal Yemeni regime has fired into crowds of protesters so this rebellion is a dangerous one for the women involved . Symbolic burning: The protest is a Bedouin tradition which call for help from the tribesmen as violence rages all around them . Their role came into the limelight . earlier in October, when Yemeni woman activist Tawakkul Karman was . awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with two Liberian women, for their . struggle for women's rights. The protest, however, was not related . to women's rights or issues surrounding the Islamic veils - rather, the . act of women burning their clothing is a symbolic Bedouin tribal . gesture signifying an appeal for help to tribesmen, in this case to stop . the attacks on the protesters. The women who burned clothing in the capital were wearing traditional veils at the time, many covered in black from head to toe. The . protest today comes as clashes intensify between forces loyal to . President Ali Abdullah Saleh and renegade fighters who have sided with . the opposition in demands that the president step down. The most recent clashes in Sanaa and elsewhere claimed 25 lives, officials said. Medical and local officials say up to 25 civilians, tribal fighters and government soldiers died overnight in Sanaa and the city of Taiz despite Saleh's ceasefire announcement late on Tuesday. Making a fist of it: An anti-government protester displays paintings on her hand of flags of other countries involved in the Arab Spring . Massed protest: Anti-government protesters march through the streets of Sanaa bearing banners calling for the resignation of the president . Saleh has clung to power in the face . of more than nine months of massive protests against his rule but there . are signs that he may be ready to cede power. Yesterday . the president called in the U.S. ambassador, Gerald Feierstein, and . told him he would sign a deal to step down, a U.S. official said. The . embattled leader has made that pledge several times before, without . resolution, and the worsening violence on the streets makes it less . likely that he will follow through on that pledge now. It . was the first meeting between Saleh and a U.S. ambassador since Saleh . returned from Saudi Arabia last month, said U.S. State Department . spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Saleh left Yemen after an attack on his compound in early June left him badly wounded. Evacuation: Pro-reform protesters drag wounded comrades from from the streets to a makeshift hospital near Sanaa's landmark Change Sqaure . Hoping for victory: A young girl holding a Yemeni flag makes a peace sign during a protest rally in Sanaa . Nine months of mass protests calling for his resignation have moved his powerful Arab neighbors, with U.S. backing, to propose a plan allowing Saleh to step down in exchange for immunity from prosecution. That reflected a reversal for the U.S., which up to then had backed Saleh as an ally in its fight against Al Qaeda in Yemen. Nuland said Saleh confirmed he would sign the Gulf Cooperation Council plan for him to step down - a claim he has made several times this year but which he has them backed down from at the last minute, infuriating both opponents and former allies. Conditional: President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he will stand down if he is given immunity from prosecution . She also said that Saleh confirmed that a cease-fire had been arranged with the opposition demonstrators, as announced on Yemen's state news agency's website. On a statement on the website, Yemeni Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi said that a cease-fire agreement was reached with the aim to 'lift checkpoints, barricades and open schools... to return normal life to the capital.' But late on Tuesday evening, troops were still firing into crowds of protesting civilians. 'It's not clear that that has been completely enforced on either side since then, but we do consider it a good step,' said Nuland. 'There is still some fighting going on.' The protesters marched through the streets surrounding Change Square, a central crossroads where the uprising against Saleh first began in February. 'The people want to prosecute the butcher,' the protesters chanted, and some held posters saying that after the death of Libya's Moammar Gaddafi, it was time for Saleh to 'listen to your people.' The shooting broke out between Saleh's forces and renegade troops loyal to Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who defected to the opposition and whose forces protect the protesters. There have been concerns that the intensified fighting could undermine U.S. and Saudi efforts to fight Yemen's Al Qaeda branch, considered by the U.S. to be the most dangerous of the terror network's affiliates after it plotted two failed attacks on American soil in recent years. Meanwhile, yesterday also saw a military plane crash before landing at the al-Ammad air base near the southern city of Aden. Four people on board were killed and 11 injured, according to a security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. The official said a technical problem might have caused the crash. He said there were eight Syrians and seven Yemenis on board.

The endorsement has come because the technology industry wants to remind voters that Mayor Lee has backed their growth and job creation in San Francisco, Mr McLear said. He added that voters are more likely to be reached by this sort of YouTube viral advertisement, rather than through the post or on television. In addition, the video cost the group just $18,000 to make – compared to a television advert that might cost around $200,000 a week to air – because all the stars involved did it for free.

The English language teacher, Gozde Bahar, was freed from the rubble with several injuries. It was reported that her heart stopped at a field hospital, but doctors managed to resuscitate her. Rescued: Gozde Bahar, 27, was pulled out of the wreckage of a building in Ercis this morning - 67 hours after the earthquake struck eastern Turkey . Race against time: Rescue workers battle to find survivors under the debris in Ercis, Turkey, after a powerful earthquake on Sunday. A 27-year-old woman was pulled out alive 67 hours after the quake this morning . Devastating: At least 459 people have so far been confirmed dead after the 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Turkey . The dramatic rescue follows that of an . 18-year-old university student, Eyup Erdem, who was pulled from the . wreckage of a collapsed multi-storey building earlier this morning. Rescuers . are desperately working against clock to find survivors in the rubble, . with powerful aftershocks still shaking the area. At least 459 people are confirmed to have been killed in the quake, which struck on Sunday afternoon. The student's father, Salih Erdem, said his son had moved to the town of Ercis last month to study mechanics at a university. Eyup had been sharing an apartment with other students. Shattered: Survivors stand in front of badly damaged buildings in Ercis as rescuers continue to look for survivors . Survival: People huddle round a fire in Guvecli, 20 miles from the town of Van, after the quake destroyed their home . Health Ministry official Seraceddin Com said around 40 people were pulled out alive from collapsed buildings yesterday. They included a two-week-old baby girl brought out half-naked, but alive, from the wreckage of an apartment building. Azra, whose name means 'help' in Hebrew, survived despite the freezing conditions and her mother and grandmother were later rescued from the same building. Television footage showed emergency workers applauding as they pulled the tiny baby from a hulk of crushed concrete and metal. The baby was said to be in good health, but was flown along with her mother to a hospital in Ankara for checks. Workers were unable to find the baby's father and there was no other signs of life in the shattered building. Miracle: A rescuer carries Azra Karaduman, a two-week-old baby, who was pulled from the rubble along with her mother and grandmother in Ercis yesterday . Care: The little girl and her mother Semiha are treated by medics in an ambulance plane as they were flown to a hospital in Ankara . Safe: Little Azra sleeps in an incubator after arriving at the hospital in the Turkish capital . Prisoners set fire to a jail in the earthquake-hit city of Van yesterday and gunshots were heard as inmates fought guards following aftershocks. A soldier said the prisoners had attacked the guards with scissors and knives, two days after 200 people were reported to have escaped in the chaos after the quake. Flames and white smoke were visible from the building after a 5.4-magnitude aftershock sparked rioting among panicked prisoners. Soldiers were ferried to the prison compound in mini-buses as they tried to put down the unrest. One said: 'These shameless people. They threw scissors. They have everything inside, knives, daggers, everything. There's a whole gang of them.' Some 200 prisones are thought to have escaped after the quake collapsed a perimeter wall, but 50 returned after visiting relatives to check on their safety. Desperate survivors fought over aid and blocked aid shipments to the disaster-hit region. Turkey has said it will need prefabricated homes to house survivors during the winter and will accept international aid offers. Israel has offered assistance despite a rift between the two countries over last year's raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla that killed nine Turkish activists. Around 2,000 buildings collapsed and 1,350 people have been injured in the quake. The fact the earthquake struck in the daytime, when many people were out, averted an even worse disaster. Close to 500 aftershocks have rattled the area, with a temblor of 5.7 magnitude sparking panic in the streets. Gerald Rockenshaub, disaster response . manager at the World Health Organisation, said the first 48 to 72 hours . are crucial for rescues and the chances of finding survivors decrease . significantly after that. People . can survive without food for a week or so, but having access to water . is critical, especially for the elderly and infants, he said. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active seismic zones and is crossed by numerous fault lines. In 1999, two earthquakes with a magnitude of more than seven struck north-western Turkey, killing 18,000 people. Istanbul, . the country's largest city home to more than 12 million people, lies in . north-western Turkey near a major fault line and experts say tens of . thousands could be killed if a major earthquake struck there. Quake prone: Turkey is particularly susceptible to seismic activity, with four tectonic plates within its borders. Sunday's quake occurred along the North Anatolian fault, which runs along the top of the country .","Gozde Bahar pulled out with several injuries and doctors had to resuscitate her .

A Frenchman is suing Facebook under human rights laws for deleting his account after he posted a famous painting of nude woman as his profile picture. The father-of-three used an image of an explicit 19th century oil by Gustave Coubet called The Origin Of The World on the social networking site. But he claims he missed messages and 'social contact' from his 800 Facebook friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on February 27. Legal action: A Frenchman is suing Facebook under human rights laws for deleting his account after he posted a famous painting of nude woman as his profile picture . He has now launched legal action in a Paris court demanding the site pay him £18,000 in damages for barring his access. The unnamed man's lawyer Stephane Cottineau said repeated emails to the California based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered. He added: 'This blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally. 'Deleting his account is a breach of his human rights, which guarantees my client's freedom of expression. Explicit: Gustave Coubet's The Origin of the World, which has here been censored, hangs in the Musee D'Orsay in Paris . 'It is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under French law.' Facebook's rules state users 'will not post content that is hateful, threatening, or pornographic, or that incites violence, or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' The company has so far refused to comment on the legal action. In February, Danish artist Frode Steinicke had his Facebook account deactivated for posting a copy of the same 1886 painting, which hangs in the prestigious Musee d'Orsay in Paris. Facebook later reactivated his account on condition he only used pictures of clothed people on his page. But a search on the site reveals several other accounts still feature the same Courbet painting. Meanwhile, critics have now set up a Facebook group with 350 members condemning censorship of the painting 'and of art in general'.","Father-of-three now suing site under human rights laws .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 6:39 PM on 26th October 2011 . Former Libyan foreign minister Musa Kusa today denied having any 'involvement of any kind or knowledge' of the Lockerbie bombing and the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Kusa issued a statement through legal representatives in London following allegations made on the BBC's Panorama programme. The programme, which was broadcast on Monday, claimed he personally tortured prisoners and was involved in the 1996 massacre of more than 1,200 inmates at the country's notorious Abu Salim prison. Former Libyan foreign minister Musa Kusa, pictured in March (left), today denied having any 'involvement of any kind or knowledge' of the Lockerbie bombing and the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher (right) Kusa, who made a high-profile defection to Britain in March as Colonel Gaddafi's regime crumbled, accused programme-makers of making 'false allegations'. He said: 'I have never tortured anyone nor been involved in torture. Neither was I present at the massacre at Abu Salim prison.' He added: 'I also had no involvement of any kind or knowledge of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 or the murder of WPC Fletcher in 1984. 'I have voluntarily assisted the relevant investigatory authorities with their inquiries in relation to these matters.' Kusa left Britain following an EU decision to lift sanctions against him, meaning he no longer faces travel restrictions or an asset freeze. He was head of Col Gaddafi's intelligence agency from 1994 and was reported to be a senior intelligence agent when PanAm flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in 1988, killing 270 people.

The programme - . called Britain, Gaddafi And The Torture Trail - described Kusa as one of . the former Libyan leader's 'most ruthless henchmen'. It confronted him with the claims at a luxury resort in Qatar where he is living but he declined to comment on them. In his statement today, Kusa said: 'When the reporter confronted me, I was taken by surprise and had no idea who he was. 'Far . from being ""tracked down"" in Doha by the BBC and ""on the run"", I have . made no secret of my whereabouts in Qatar since I left the UK in April . earlier this year.
