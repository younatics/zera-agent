"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Negotiations between the United States and Libya that could result in compensation for past acts of state-sponsored terrorism by Libya are under way, a senior State Department official said Friday. The wreckage of Pan Am 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland; the bombing killed 270 people in 1989. U.S. and Libyan officials met Wednesday and Thursday, the official said. The nations hope to hammer out a deal in which Libya would ""resolve all outstanding claims in good faith"" and offer ""fair compensation"" to victims and their families, he said. ""We are just at the beginning of this process. The goal is to get something that is fair and comprehensive,"" the official said. The official said that any agreement would cover about eight acts, including the 1989 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 259 passengers and 11 people on the ground; and the 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco in Berlin, Germany, that killed two people and injured at least 120, including 40 Americans. Outstanding terrorism claims have been a problem for Libya in its attempts to normalize relations with the United States and to begin development of its oil resources. Libya has expressed disappointment that it has failed to reap any political and economic benefits promised by the U.S. government and others after Libya renounced terrorism and stopped development of weapons of mass destruction. And some of the largest U.S. oil companies are eager to begin exploration and development of Libya oil fields, among the 10 largest in the world. The new negotiations and development of an agreement would ideally fulfill all outstanding lawsuits against Libya and allow investment to move forward. A joint U.S.-Libyan statement said, ""Both parties affirm their desire to work together to resolve all outstanding claims in good faith and expeditiously in the establishment of a fair compensation mechanism.""","Nations hoping for deal in which Libya would compensate terrorism victims .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Every weekend for more than four years, Fred Murray has walked the road where his daughter, Maura, vanished. Family, friends and volunteers help him look in the woods and mountains near Haverhill, New Hampshire, for clues to what happened to her. Maura Murray, 21, disappeared while driving in the New Hampshire woods on a snowy night in 2004. Maura Murray, a 21-year-old nursing student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, disappeared on a cold and snowy night in February 2004. She was last known to be driving from Massachusetts through New Hampshire. It is still unclear where she was heading in her black 1996 Saturn. The car was found abandoned, its front end crashed against a tree. It apparently had skidded off a road at a sharp curve. Shortly after the accident, a passing bus driver stopped and asked Murray if she needed help. She said no. Ten minutes later, police arrived. Inside the crumpled Saturn, they found some of Murray's belongings -- school books, running gear, snack foods and alcohol -- police won't say what kind. But Murray was gone, along with her car keys and a backpack she always carried. There was nothing to hint she'd be motivated to run away, according to her fiancé, William Rausch, and her father, Fred Murray.  Watch why this cold case is a true mystery » . Maura Murray had just gotten engaged to Rausch, her college sweetheart and an Army lieutenant stationed in Oklahoma. They planned to marry after she graduated from nursing school in June 2005. She'd found a summer nursing job in Oklahoma. She had everything to look forward to. ""She was in good spirits and had no worries or reason to run away from her life,"" Fred Murray said. Investigators initially operated under the theory that the dean's list student was troubled and had decided to escape from the demands of her life for a while. As a result, they did not immediately begin to look for her. The search did not begin until 39 hours after her crashed car was found. When it finally got under way, helicopters, search dogs and ground teams covered the area near where Murray's car was found. The dogs picked up her scent for about 100 yards, leading investigators along the road to an area between two homes. There, the dogs lost the trail. Murray's credit cards and cell phone have not registered any activity since the night she disappeared, February 9, 2004. Tom Shamshak, a private investigator hired by the Murray family to continue the search, said police and volunteers looked for her for two days. ""No footprints were even found in the snow,"" he said. ""Luckily there hadn't been any fresh snowfall in those two days."" Shamshak has concluded that only two scenarios could explain what happened to Murray. Either she was picked up by someone driving on the road, or she walked to a nearby house to ask for help. Police say they did not treat Murray's case as an abduction because they saw no signs of a struggle at the scene. Before she left campus, police learned, Murray had e-mailed her professors and informed them she'd be absent for a few days because of a death in the family. Murray's family and friends said no one in the family had died. Police also noted that Murray had enough food and other items in her car to suggest she might be taking a short getaway vacation. Murray is described as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 120 pounds, with brown hair and blue-green eyes. She was last seen wearing a dark coat and jeans and carrying a black backpack and Samsung cell phone. A $40,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to her whereabouts or the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance. The tip line is 603-271-2663, New Hampshire State Police.","Maura Murray told her professors there had been a death in the family .

"(CNN)  -- A federal jury Thursday found a 32-year-old Minnesota woman guilty of illegally downloading music from the Internet and fined her $80,000 each -- a total of $1.9 million -- for 24 songs. Illegal downloads of musical files will cost a Minnesota woman $1.9 million, a jury has decided. Jammie Thomas-Rasset's case was the first such copyright infringement case to go to trial in the United States, her attorney said. Attorney Joe Sibley said that his client was shocked at the fine, noting that the price tag on the songs she downloaded was 99 cents. She plans to appeal, he said. Cara Duckworth, a spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America, said the association was ""pleased that the jury agreed with the evidence and found the defendant liable."" ""We appreciate the jury's service and that they take this as seriously as we do,"" she said. Thomas-Rasset downloaded work by artists such as No Doubt, Linkin Park, Gloria Estefan and Sheryl Crow. This was the second trial for Thomas-Rasset. The judge ordered a retrial in 2007 after there was an error in the wording of jury instructions. The fines jumped considerably from the first trial, which granted just $220,000 to the recording companies. Thomas-Rasset is married with four children and works for an Indian tribe in Minnesota.","Federal jury finds Jammie Thomas-Rasset guilty of illegally downloading 24 songs .

"Americans love beef; we eat nearly 63 pounds per person each year. Although that's a lot, the amount is down from our 1976 high of 89 pounds. When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef. Even as an experienced chef, I often brought home familiar cuts. But researching my book, ""Field Guide to Meat,"" led me to expand my repertoire to tasty, if less familiar, cuts like hanger steak and tri-tip. Soon you can do the same, knowing which cuts to choose for maximum flavor and nutrition. A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus. Beef Background . Humans began domesticating cattle, Bos taurus, about 8,500 years ago. Columbus first brought cattle to the New World, and by 1690, descendants of Columbus' cattle ranging in Mexico were driven north and became known as Texas Longhorns. Others arrived later with the colonists. America's top five cattle breeds are Angus from Scotland, Hereford from England, Limousin from France, Simmenthal from Switzerland, and Charolais from France. More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred. The beef we eat comes mostly from 18- to 24-month-old steers, averaging about 1,000 pounds, and yielding about 450 pounds of meat. Each is divided for wholesale into eight primals (major portions): the chuck (shoulder and upper ribs), the rib, the loin, the sirloin (hip), the round (upper leg), the brisket (breast), the plate (belly), and the small flank. Organs like liver and kidneys are called variety meats. When evaluating your choices at the grocery store, here are a few key terms and facts to know: . • Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots. Since corn is not a natural part of a cow's diet, cattle fed on it may experience stress and other ailments, so they are routinely treated with antibiotics. They also receive growth hormones to increase their size (and value, as beef is sold by weight). Until recently, inexpensive corn has helped keep down the price of beef. • Grass-finished: Grass- or pasture-finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes. Their meat is lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories than grain-finished. (Because it is quite lean, cook rare to medium-rare for juiciness.) Grass-fed beef has a distinct flavor, often described as bold, complex, and gamy. Many people believe that grass-fed cattle are a more sustainable choice. However, raising grass-fed cattle is time-consuming and requires large open spaces, variables that raise its price. Most is imported from Canada, followed by Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Brazil. • Aging: Dry-aging is the traditional process preferred by many steak lovers. The concentrated, intense flavor of dry-aged beef develops as it hangs in special temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms from 10 days to six weeks. The longer the aging, the better the flavor and tenderness, but also the more the shrinkage as water evaporates and a dark crust develops, which must be cut away. About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts. During the average seven-day period the beef spends ""in the bag,"" it ages in a process called ""wet-aging."" • Processing and packaging: Until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half- or quarter-carcasses. Packers then began selling vacuum-packed beef, the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores. Retailers refrigerated the boxes until needed, then opened the package and cut the meat into portions for sale. Next came case-ready meat, which precluded the need for skilled butchers on-site in markets. Leak-proof and easily stackable, case-ready packages are produced in USDA-inspected plants and have a longer shelf life. Packages covered with a sealed layer of clear plastic are modified-atmosphere packages, which have a gas-filled space inside to help preserve freshness and color. Nutrition . • Fat content: The USDA defines ""lean beef"" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef. Half of the fat is saturated and half is heart-healthy monounsaturated. There are 29 naturally lean cuts of beef, including many familiar to Cooking Light readers, such as tenderloin, flank steak, and sirloin, as well as five lesser-known cuts. Others, such as ribeye or chuck roast, naturally contain more fat, although it is similarly divided between saturated and monounsaturated. Because lean beef contains less fat, it's best cooked to medium-rare (145°F) or medium (160°F) to optimize tenderness. If using fattier cuts, slice away the outer rim of fat and cut or pull out any pockets of fat before cooking. For larger cuts, allow the fat to baste the meat while cooking, then trim away before eating, or skim it from the surface of braised dishes or stews. • Other nutrients: A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein -- more than half of the 50g recommended daily in a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. All beef is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus. In general, the redder the meat, the more iron it contains (beef liver has the most). Beef also contains thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin and is a rich source of B12, found naturally only in animal foods. CookingLight.com: Fat and Ground Beef . At the Market . • Inspection and grading: USDA inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state, which encompasses most of today's supermarket beef. Grading is voluntary and done by the same inspectors. The more marbling -- the small white flecks of fat within the muscles -- the higher the grade. Three grades of beef are sold to consumers. Only three percent is highly marbled Prime, sought after by top steak houses and butcher shops. About 57 percent is moderately marbled Choice, the most common supermarket grade. The remaining 40 percent is lean Select. • Private labels: Supermarket chains and large food distributors also have developed private brands with their own specifications. The first such program began in 1978 with Certified Angus Beef, which must come from Angus cattle. Niman Ranch Natural Beef and Certified Hereford Beef are two others. • Natural and Organic: Beef labeled ""natural"" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef. ""Organic"" beef must come from cattle raised and certified according to the USDA's National Organic Program. Organic cattle must be fed 100-percent organically and without antibiotics or hormones. Both natural and organic beef can be either grass- or grain-finished. Ways to Save . • Buy lean cuts. Often, leaner cuts are cheaper than fatty ones. And when the fat cooks away, lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar. • Buy in bulk. Large or family-sized packages cost less per pound than smaller packages. Divide into portions, and freeze the surplus. • Be your own butcher. Beef that has been presliced into steaks or made into patties costs more than less processed meat. Buy bigger cuts, and do some of the preparation work yourself. CookingLight.com: Beef on a Budget . • But don't go overboard. Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store. Such a purchase may yield what one buyer describes as ""cheap steak and expensive hamburger."" For more tips on making healthy taste great, try Cooking Light - CLICK HERE .

"(CNN) -- In 1991, Nirvana changed American rock music with an album that featured a naked baby on the cover. Fred Thorne played in bands for 18 years and says Kurt Cobain's legacy always stuck with him. Now, that naked baby is 17 years old and a high school graduate. The album, ""Nevermind,"" is a classic beloved by music aficionados across the world. It soared to the top of the Billboard charts, swiftly ending the '80s era of dance pop and ""hair metal"" and replacing it with the ""grunge"" movement. In doing so, it irreversibly changed the tastes and even lives of millions of musicians and music lovers. ""One song changed the way we look at rock music,"" said Russ Lancaster of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" the first track on the record. ""Just like the Beatles changed pop music 30 years prior, Nirvana's breakthrough album achieved the same level of power in terms of changing pop music. They weren't singing anymore about happy, funny songs. They were taking a real dark turn to pop music, and it changed everything. Back then it was really different to hear that on the radio. It opened up a floodgate of artists that might never have been heard before that."" What artists, exactly? Lancaster says Pearl Jam comes to mind, and that the entire emo genre might never have come into existence if it wasn't for grunge. ""It wouldn't have the visibility it has today without the stepping-stone that grunge gave it,"" he said. iReport.com: Passing grunge onto the next generation . Pat Ferguson said grunge also was crucial to indie rock becoming mainstream. ""What I appreciate 'Nevermind' the most for was paving the way for other indie bands that I really ended up liking to get put out into the mainstream. Not so much for the exposure they got, but so that everyone could more readily get their product,"" he said. ""It was a world without iTunes, Rhapsody or Napster. The only way you got exposure to music that wasn't pop [or] country was living close enough to a university-run radio station or having a friend who had access to it. It wasn't long after the grunge era started that other indie rock bands like Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, Superchunk, fIREHOSE and a wealth of others broke out and started becoming a bit more accessible."" iReport.com: 'A lot of bands owe a lot to that record' For Derek Ivy, the influence of Nirvana is a little more personal. Hearing ""Nevermind"" and the band's other albums inspired him to learn guitar as a teenager, and he still plays in a band called Golden Hours. ""Nirvana taught me to play music,"" said Ivy. ""Everybody has the first few songs they ever learn to play, and for me it was mostly this Nirvana stuff. When I hear this album or think of it, I recall the countless afternoons I spent playing these songs on guitar and, later, drums. I remember learning every song on it, and pretty much every other Nirvana song."" Ivy said Nirvana front man and songwriter Kurt Cobain was an important influence in his life, musically and otherwise. ""Kurt Cobain was one of my earliest and greatest musical influences, as I'm sure countless others can attest to. And he's a tremendous influence on me in a lot of different ways,"" he said. ""When Kurt died, I felt like I'd lost a personal friend, even though I didn't know him and I was only 14 at the time. It was sort of like, here you go, here's adulthood."" iReport.com: 'My teenage years would have been considerably less bearable were it not for this band' Cobain was also a profound figure in Fred Thorne's life. Thorne played in bands for 18 years, and he said Cobain's success on the charts and ultimate suicide led him to heed the Nirvana front man's advice: ""Be careful what you wish for."" ""These words were the fuel for the angst I needed to 'kill it' on stage and give everything I had to just flat out rocking,"" Thorne said. ""That meant no record deals, no big crowds, no bitching at the sound man because I couldn't hear the vocals in the monitor, no perfect intonation, no perfect pitch, and if I blew out my voice...bonus! These words left me not wanting, but left me satisfied that I played that bar gig to 10 or 20 people like it was my last. In a way I felt like I did it for Kurt. I did it because I knew how badly he wanted to go back to those days of being a nobody and getting booed off the stage, or duct taping gear together and saying...we can just make noise, vent our angst and throw all regard for approval out the window."" iReport.com: 'Kurt will always be an icon for indie musicians' Of course, not everybody enjoyed ""Nevermind"" or the grunge movement it popularized. Take David Gillespie, for example. He agreed that ""Nevermind"" was a turning point in music, but for him, the turn was for the worse. ""Thanks for ending the greatest era of music ever,"" he wrote in his iReport.com submission. ""The onslaught of grunge killed off the best music. The '80s brought such incredible talent and songs that no other decade or era could match."" Gillespie said he doesn't think the grunge movement could compete with styles like glam rock and 1980s dance pop in terms of musicianship. ""Nirvana was not exactly the most musically talented band. Then again, they didn't really need to be,"" he said. ""Grunge as a music form wasn't about technical prowess and didn't need to sound good."" iReport.com: 'Their music was bland and depressing' Amy Suarez, who called the record ""the pinnacle of my music heaven,"" said that opinions of ""Nevermind"" and the grunge movement are probably just a reflection of the different generations. ""I truly believe that Nirvana, its predecessors and like bands of that time will forever be thought, to me, to be the best and most influential music of my life,"" she said. ""I know that everyone who loves music can say that about the music of their prime. So, I guess I would agree with others who would say that Nirvana was great for many and meant nothing to others; it's just a matter of timing."" iReport.com: 'Not everything has to be complicated to be good'","iReporters share their memories of Nirvana and the ""grunge"" era .

"(CNN) -- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world, the average American is probably asking, ""How should I protect myself?"" U.S. health officials stress the importance of frequent hand washing during outbreaks of illness. Health officials' advice is to follow common-sense precautions: Wash your hands, stay home if you're sick and listen to your local health authorities. ""Very frequent hand-washing is something that we talk about time and time again and that is an effective way to reduce transmission of disease,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""If you're sick, it's very important that people stay at home. If your children are sick, have a fever and flu-like illness, they shouldn't go to school. And if you're ill, you shouldn't get on an airplane or another public transport to travel. Those things are part of personal responsibility in trying to reduce the impact. "" So far, Mexico has been hardest hit by swine flu. Cases have been confirmed in the United States, as well as countries including Canada, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and Israel. ""In areas with no disease yet, a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the CDC's Science and Public Health Program. In addition to washing hands often, she recommends covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoiding touching your eyes and nose in case the virus is on your hands. The World Health Organization calls the situation a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" and the United States has declared a ""public health emergency,"" likened by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to preparations for a potential hurricane. No authorities are calling the outbreak a pandemic. The CDC expects U.S. numbers will grow and recommendations will change depending on what happens in individual communities, said the CDC's Schuchat. The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school, work and public events. Because so much is still unknown at this point, the main risk factor is people traveling to areas where cases have already been identified. ""However this virus may already be in other places in the United States,"" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN. ""With enhanced surveillance, we will see more cases and that is why it makes good sense to be proactive, by doing things we know are effective in reducing exposure.""  Explainer: Swine flu facts » . Schuchat noted swine flu symptoms are relatively general and nonspecific. ""So many different things can cause these symptoms. it is a dilemma,"" she said. ""It is a challenge that we are wrestling with. There is not a perfect test right now to let a person or doctor know exactly what this is."" But Schuchat specifically advised anyone who feels ill after returning from Mexico to see a doctor. Unfortunately, since this is a new strain of influenza, the flu vaccine for this past flu season offers no protection. ""However, we do have anti-virals that work against this swine flu,"" said Skinner, referring to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). ""Someone who has [swine flu], if they are treated early, the anti-flu medicines work against this."" According to Skinner, health officials are still trying to figure out where exactly the virus originated, how transmissible it is and why it is mild in some cases and deadlier in others. CNN's Mary Carter contributed to this report.","Take standard flu season precautions to avoid infection, CDC advises .

"(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon can begin. Tetris, the simple puzzle video game, has been addicting players for 25 years. In 1984, Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration: How about creating a computer version? Pajitnov wrote the program in his spare time, simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who aren't math geniuses. He used shapes made of four squares -- hence ""Tetris,"" which comes from the Greek word for four, ""Tetra."" In the game, players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between. Successfully completed sections disappear. The more sections the player completes without reaching the top, the higher the score. iReport: 25 years of Tetris . Steadily, the game worked its way around the world. Millions of people found themselves glued to their computers and game players -- hearts racing and screaming in frustration -- all over getting a simple horizontal line of digital squares to disappear. ""I would just play it for hours and hours,"" said iReporter Joel Vetsch of New Haven, Connecticut, who got addicted to Tetris on a Game Boy when he was 10. ""I'm 29 now, and I still love it."" See Vetsch's iReport here . Vetsch became so obsessed with Tetris that the game even showed up in his dreams. ""I'd go to sleep and in my head I'd see blocks. . .going into each other,"" he told CNN. ""It was weird."" More than 125 million Tetris products have been sold, and Guinness World Records' 2009 Gamers' Edition book ranked Tetris No. 2 on its list of the top 50 console games of all time, behind Super Mario Kart. Twenty-five years to the month after Tetris was born, CNN spoke with Pajitnov and Henk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software, the company that manages the exclusive licensing rights to the game. The two men talked about what makes Tetris so addictive, how they believe the game can help unite the world, and -- no joke -- why they want a Tetris competition in the Olympics.  See Josh Levs' interview with Pajitnov and Rogers » . CNN: Alexey, I want to start with you. When you first dreamed up this scenario all those years ago, did you ever imagine it would turn into a global phenomenon? Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris creator: The very first time when my small game started working even without scoring or leveling, I couldn't stop playing. It's a really good game, but I [couldn't] imagine that it would be that big. Henk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software: When I first found it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1988, I kept on coming back and playing more. And that was a for sure sign that this was going to be a good game. CNN: There are stories of people going in to work on the weekends just to sit at their computer and play for hours. They even dream the Tetris shapes if they play for too long. Could one of you explain to me why it's so addictive and what goes on when you play it? Pajitnov: First of all, it's a very simple game and it has a really strong creative spirit in it. So instead of destroying something, you kind of build up the profile out of those small pieces and enjoy doing it. And that's probably the very important addictive factor. CNN: The simplicity and also the immediate satisfaction -- but then immediately it's time to work for the next one. Pajitnov: Yes. CNN: Henk, tell us some of the stunning statistics. Rogers: Over 70 million products have been sold as a box product, and more recently on the mobile [market] we're almost reaching 80 million downloads worldwide. Last year 10 percent of all games on mobile phones in this country were Tetris. CNN: We have some videos of takeoffs -- turning buildings into Tetris or human Tetris. Is that great publicity or are you concerned in a legal way, like, ""Stop grabbing our name and doing what you want with it?"" Rogers: It's all flattery. I like it. CNN: Alexey, you were originally unable to make a penny off of this for a long time. What happened there and how did it ultimately pay out for you? Pajitnov: Back in the '80s when I designed the game, the situation with intellectual property was very unclear in Russia. Communism Party didn't inspire some individual kind of activity. That's why I decided I granted my rights for Tetris for 10 years to Soviet Union to my computer center. And I didn't receive anything from this 10 years. But 10 years naturally ended, and I'm fine now. (laughs) CNN: You all put something into your news release: ""We have a vision of the future where people all over the world can meet and become friends without speaking the same language."" You go on to say that people will be ""connected through the universal language"" of Tetris. Are you guys being sarcastic about that or is that an actual hope? Rogers: No that's a real dream for us. Games are a universal language and Tetris breaks all culture, language and age and gender barriers. CNN: Have you had complaints from people saying that Tetris is a drug, that it's more addictive, there should be some kind of warning with it? Pajitnov: It happens to me all the time. People approach me and say, ""I spent so much of my college time on Tetris I almost blow my exams."" And I usually ask, ""But was it good hours which you spent on Tetris?"" And everybody say, ""Yes it was really good hours."" So I say, ""I not waste it, I gift it to you!"" Rogers: I think that Tetris is the first virtual sport. And we'll see a Tetris Cup in the future and international competition. Hopefully we'll be part of the Olympics someday. CNN: The actual Olympics? The Olympics Olympics? Rogers: Sure, why limit the Olympics to physical sports? Why not mental sports? CNN: Wow, that would open up a whole new realm. I know you have a lot of plans for building this. What will we see when we envision the future? Will there be 3-D Tetris? Or will I have goggles and play virtual Tetris? Rogers: Tetris is the ultimate casual game, so we need to keep it simple. If 3-D takes it out of simple-to-understand games, then it probably won't go there. CNN: You want to tell me how much you have made off Tetris over the years? Rogers: A lot. (laughter) CNN: Alexey, how about you? Pajitnov: Yes, I am happy. CNN: Enough to give Oprah a run for her money? Pajitnov and Rogers: No, no. (laughter) CNN: No, I don't think real people do that ever. Have memories of Tetris?

"(CNN) -- The number of uprooted people across the world dropped slightly last year, but new displacement this year in conflict zones like Pakistan, Somalia and Sri Lanka so far ""has already more than offset the decline,"" the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday. Pakistani displaced battle severe winds and dust at Jalozai refugee camp near Peshawar. ""Today, we are seeing a relentless series of internal conflicts that are generating millions of uprooted people,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a news release. This is one of the main points in Global Trends, an annual report by the U.N. agency on developments regarding refugees, internally displaced people, asylum seekers and stateless people. The number of ""uprooted people worldwide"" in 2008 was 42 million, a drop of about 700,000 from 2007, according to the report. ""In 2009, we have already seen substantial new displacements, namely in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia,"" Guterres said. ""While some displacements may be short-lived, others can take years and even decades to resolve. We continue to face several longer-term internal displacement situations in places like Colombia, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Each of these conflicts has also generated refugees who flee beyond their borders."" The number of refugees and internally displaced people who returned home in 2008 was around 2 million, a decline from 2007, the report said. Refugee repatriation, which was 604,000, was down 17 percent. Displaced people's returns were down by 34 percent at 1.4 million people. ""Traditionally the largest durable solution for refugees, it was the second-lowest repatriation total in 15 years,"" the report said. ""The decline in part reflects deteriorating security conditions, namely in Afghanistan and Sudan."" The report listed other statistics and trends in 2008: .","U.N. reports shows slight decline in global refugee numbers to 42 million in 2008 .

"(CNN)  -- Six days after official election results awarded him victory in Iran's presidential elections and four days after he compared the putative losers to fans of a losing soccer team, unleashing a wave of fury in his country, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a broadcast aired Thursday his remarks had been taken out of context. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad complained Thursday that earlier comments had been taken out of context. ""I was addressing those who started riots and set up fires and attacked people,"" he told the state-run news agency IRINN in an interview. ""I said these [people] are nothing, they are not even part of the nation of Iran. They are alien in relation to Iran."" Ahmadinejad said that the official results, which gave him an overwhelming margin of victory that many Iranians are challenging as rigged, mean that ""everybody is victorious ... We are a big family, and we have to put our hands together."" In Sunday's remarks to a rally at Vali-e Asr Square in Tehran, he said, ""The Iranian nation is united. In a football match, there are 50,000 to 70,000 spectators. Those whose team has lost are angry and will do anything to vent their anger. Forty million people participated in the elections in Iran. They themselves were the players, and they determined [the outcome]. ""Now four or five dirt or dust creeping from the corners may do something. But you must know that the pure river that is the Iranian nation will not allow them to put themselves on display."" His reference to unhappy Iranians as ""dirt"" or ""dust"" was seen by many as particularly galling, and he offered a qualified apology on Thursday. ""I am sorry about the degree of accuracy of the news that some publicize,"" he said. ""The very clear statement of the president is being distorted."" He said that he had noted that all 40 million Iranians had emerged as victorious in the elections, not just those who may have voted for him. And he attempted to include supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi, the opposition leader who reportedly lost, in his embrace. ""These all are victors of the election forum; they are all dear,"" he said. ""We are all brothers. And I even said the road is open. Everyone should come. And nobody has the right to ask anybody else whom did you vote for. This means this is how much the government cares for the rights of the people.""  Watch report on online sites that support Ahmadinejad » . He added, ""I am sorry that some people base their movements and political activities on these rumors that are basically untrue, and I hope this will be corrected."" Key religious conservatives have publicly complained of Ahmadinejad's treatment of the protesters in rallies demanding a new vote.  Watch the latest from the streets of Tehran » . One of the critics was Habibolah Asgharoladi, a senior member of a key conservative voting bloc allied with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which represents Tehran's influential bazaar merchant class. Asgharoladi has accused Ahmadinejad of treating the pro-Moussavi demonstrators improperly and urged him to treat them with more respect. These developments marked an extraordinary rebuke to  Ahmadinejad and a rare public airing of the existing rift among ruling conservatives.  Watch report on conservatives' reaction » . Other segments of Iranian society are planning to hold rallies, including the Association of Combatant Clerics.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If he knew then what he knows now, he might have made some different decisions before the start of the Iraq war in 2003, the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters Friday. Outgoing Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Peter Pace says he now thinks more troops were needed at the war's start. ""One of the mistakes I made in my assumptions going in was that the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Army would welcome liberation, that the Iraqi Army, given the opportunity, would stand together for the Iraqi people and be available to them to help serve the new nation,"" Gen. Peter Pace said. But ""they disintegrated in the face of the coalition's first several weeks of combat, so they weren't here,"" Pace said. Had he known that would happen, he would have recommended more troops be sent at the outset of the Iraq war, he said. In addition, Pace said, if he had been asked in January 2006 whether the United States should build up its Army and Marine Corps contingents in Iraq, he would have said no, because the plan at the time was to build and equip an Iraqi Army and turn over security duties to it. The force was built and equipped, Pace said, but the February bombing of the Golden Mosque -- one of the holiest Shiite sites -- ignited long-simmering tensions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, further destabilizing the region and cutting short any plans for U.S. troop reduction. Thousands of people have died in reprisal killings and bombings since the attack. Still, Pace said, ""Given what I knew at the time, I'm comfortable with the recommendations that I made."" Any errors that were made are to be learned from, he added. Watch how Pace details the mistakes made at Iraq war's start » . And he continued to voice his support for the Iraq invasion. ""Twenty-six million Iraqis have the opportunity now,"" he said. ""They are working their way through 3½ decades of being trod upon, held down, no opportunity at all for freedom of expression, for living their lives the way they wanted to, for picking [their] leaders."" Pace will retire when his two-year term ends this month. Also Friday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- in his first public comments since President Bush announced Thursday night he was accepting the Iraq troop level recommendation of Gen. David Petraeus -- noted all Bush's senior military advisers are in agreement with those recommendations. Gates said he asked Pace and Adm. William Fallon, the head of U.S. Central Command, to begin examining U.S. options in Iraq months ago, knowing that Petraeus -- the top U.S. commander in Iraq -- was doing the same. ""I wanted the president this month to have the benefit of more than one senior military voice as he considered the next steps in Iraq,"" Gates said. ""I also did not want Gen. Petraeus hanging out there all by himself. ""While the analyses of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CentCom and Gen. Petraeus varied in emphasis and approach, all of the president's senior military advisers are in full agreement with the recommendations made by Gen. Petraeus,"" he said. The United States' next steps in Iraq, among other things, ""had to avoid even the appearance of American failure,"" Gates said. ""Extremist Islam was dramatically empowered by defeating the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. The first attack against us by the extremists, the World Trade Center in 1993, was launched from Afghanistan just four years after the last Soviet soldier left there. ""Should the jihadists be able to claim a victory in Iraq over the United States, the sole remaining superpower, I believe it would empower them worldwide far, far more than their victory over the Soviets,"" Gates said.

"(CNN) -- Imagine arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia, one of the busiest and most bustling airports in the country. People are dashing about, waiting at checkpoints and scanning the screens for departure and arrival times. Invariably there are delays and since you aren't going anywhere anytime soon, you might as well enjoy the tunes playing over the public announcement system. Hey, isn't that the Peaches and Herb classic ""Shake Your Groove Thing""? You haven't heard that in years! But wait, what are they singing? It sounds like ""Shake Your Groove Thing,"" but the lyrics playing don't match the ones you know. Click on the image above to hear two of the airport's new songs. ""Opening Day fresh, Opening Day fresh, . Yeah, yeah . Hartsfield-Jackson do it now . Opening Day fresh, Opening Day fresh, . Yeah, yeah . Show 'em how we do it now! Show 'em how we do it now!"" Welcome to parody with a purpose. As part of an initiative to keep the airport clean and get people excited about the airport's new shops and dining options, officials there bought the rights to three popular R & B classics: ""Shake Your Groove Thing"" by Peaches and Herb, ""Bustin' Loose"" by Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers and ""Fantastic Voyage"" by Lakeside. With rights secured, Doug Strachan, Creative Innovations Manager for the City of Atlanta Department of Aviation, rewrote the lyrics and invited the original artists to record the revamped songs. ""Whereas words reach the mind, music reaches the heart,"" Strachan said. ""These are hit songs that people love ... real powerful, catchy and make you want to dance. If you can make someone dance, you can probably motivate them to do other things."" So ""Groove Thing"" became ""Keep It Opening Day Fresh,"" ""Bustin Loose"" morphed into ""We're Steady Cleaning Up,"" and ""Fantastic Voyage"" was reborn as ""Our New Concessions."" Clean music with a clean message -- literally. The concept of ""opening day fresh"" refers to keeping the airport as clean as if it were opening day, which means smelling fresh and looking as spotless as possible. The catchy tunes are a way to subtly remind visitors that it takes a team effort to keep the airport sparkling. ""Our New Concessions"" reminds travelers about the facility's retail offerings and food service. Strachan said much effort was put into making sure the songs were produced in such a way that they were respectful to the song and the artist. ""The whole idea is to make it sound as much like the original as possible,"" Strachan said. ""If it's not really done with deft, then it kind of detracts from it rather than enhances it."" Herb Fame, half of Peaches and Herb, loved the idea and was pleased to remake his classic. ""Shake Your Grove Thing"" ""was a worldwide song and people recognize the melody,"" said Fame, who continues to perform. ""It was fun to do and every time I come through the airport I listen to it."" Mark Wood, lead vocalist of the group Lakeside, said Strachan did a great job transforming ""Fantastic Voyage"" into a new, yet familiar song. ""It's important to send the message in a way that the message will get through,"" Wood said. ""Ours is a song that people may have grown up hearing or they may have played for their kids and so you might have generations that can relate to it."" Such messaging can be extremely effective, said Matt Wallaert, lead scientist for Thrive, an online financial advisory company for young adults. Wallaert, an expert in behavioral finance and social psychology, said the airport is obviously attempting to do something his company also aims for -- offering useful information in a way that is less stressful for the user. ""If you put up a sign that says 'Don't Litter,' people see it the first time you put it up, but every time after that it loses its impact, because it becomes a standard part of what they see,"" he said. ""Music is pervasive in a way that a sign is not because it's everywhere."" Strachan said officials at the airport definitely want those coming through to enjoy their time. As part of that, the airport recently launched the initial phases of a program that uses a scent called ""Breeze"" to help enhance visitors' mood. Strachan said the scent, which was first tested on a limited group of passengers, uses a variety of different notes, including vanilla and a little lavender. The pleasant, relaxing scent is going over so well that Strachan said a custom scent that will be exclusive to Hartsfield-Jackson is being developed. ""We want to make people feel better,"" he said. ""We wanted to give them an olfactory cue which suggested that the airport is opening day fresh and we want to enhance their travel experience."" Stefanie Michaels, also known as Adventure Girl, is a travel commentator and writer who is a frequent traveler. Anything airports can do to make air travel more relaxing is more than welcome, especially in the times we live in, she said. ""Movie theaters and restaurants have been using scents and those kinds of subliminal tactics for years,"" Michaels said. ""Music makes people feel good and with the economy the way it is, people are just stressed to no end, so from a subconscious level it's a really wise thing for the airport to do.""","Visitors to Atlanta's airport will hear some familiar classics .

"(CNN) -- A cancerous tumor in 13-year-old Danny Hauser's chest has shrunk significantly since he was ordered by a court last month to resume chemotherapy treatment, a family spokesman said. Danny Hauser, 13, was headed for a clinic in Mexico until an arrest warrant was issued for his mom. But the Hauser family attributes much of his progress to the complementary use of vitamins and minerals to boost his immune system, Dan Zwakman said. ""The family is doing it on their own, with the doctor's knowledge,"" Zwakman said. ""Everybody is pleased that the tumor is shrinking, of course. The goal is to get rid of the cancer, but they'd rather be doing it without the chemo."" Danny's case made national headlines last month when he and his mother, Colleen, fled Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, for Mexico to seek alternative cancer care despite a court order that he undergo chemotherapy. They eventually returned after an arrest warrant was issued for Colleen Hauser. But had they made it to their destination -- the Rubio Clinic in Tijuana, according to Zwakman -- they would have joined the ranks of an estimated hundreds of other cancer patients who head south of the border each year for cancer care. ""Their intentions started long ago with Colleen. She's been involved in natural healing for many years now. She believes the world was created with everything needed to sustain and heal life,"" Zwakman said. Despite controversial origins and consistent bad press in the United States, Tijuana's border clinics continue to attract people like the Hausers, who are in search of more holistic approaches to cancer treatment. Because little data exist on how many clinics are operating, it's unclear how many American cancer patients visit Mexico each year, said Stephen Barrett, a patient advocate who runs the Web site, http://www.quackwatch.com/. ""If they answered, you could not be sure they were telling the truth. They might have an incentive to raise the number,"" he said in an e-mail. ""To make matters more complicated, many of the 'cancer' clinics also see people who don't have cancer."" The concept of complementary and alternative cancer treatment has slowly been gaining acceptance for more than a decade in the United States, with the creation of entities including the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine. ""Clinicians and researchers have realized that it's important to conduct methodologically sound studies to help guide patients to understand what's safe and what's effective,"" said Dr. Ted Gansler, medical director of health content for the American Cancer Society. But no one recommends that alternative treatment be used to replace conventional care, such as chemotherapy or radiation, he said. ""The important thing to remember is there is no recommended alternative to conventional treatment, and the reason is because if it worked, it would become conventional,"" he said. As far as Tijuana's border clinics are concerned, the American Cancer Society cautions that ""methods promoted in Mexican border clinics are not consistent with scientific understanding"" of cancer and its treatment. ""Although these clinics often claim great success in advertisements and books, they have not published convincing evidence in medical journals to support those claims,"" the ACS says in a section on its Web site called Questionable Cancer Practices In Mexico. ""Patients traveling to the Tijuana area for treatment appear to be subjecting themselves to costly and potentially hazardous regimens, especially if they postpone standard medical care."" Loose regulatory standards in Mexico allow Tijuana's clinics to thrive, many offering expensive treatment in luxurious, spa-like settings, complete with fresh meals, exercise classes and emotional and spiritual counseling. Many herbs and dietary supplements used in border clinics are not considered dangerous; they just have not been put through the rigorous clinical trials required for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve them for use as cancer treatments. Others, like the antioxidants carotene, lycopene and vitamins C, E and A, have produced inconsistent results in large-scale trials and are still being researched. Still others, like laetrile, a chemical compound whose active ingredient is cyanide, can be dangerous, the National Cancer Institute says. But many patients say they are attracted by the warm, caring relationship between patient and clinic staff. ""They don't just see the disease. They see the person behind the disease and know how to care for them in every way,"" says Sarah Sackett-Hutcheson, who claims she has been cancer-free for 17 years. When she was 11 years old, her oncologist told her family she had six months to live and recommended chemotherapy and radiation to battle her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Instead of undergoing the debilitating treatments, she went to the Oasis of Hope Hospital in Tijuana, where she received low doses of chemotherapy along with intravenous vitamins. The American Cancer Society says there is no scientific evidence that low doses of chemotherapy or large doses of supplements are effective against cancer. But Sackett-Hutcheson believes the small doses of chemo attacked cancerous cells without destroying her immune system while the vitamins boosted her immunity. ""I remember thinking if they'd given me the high doses of chemo I wouldn't have made it. Even the low doses made me so incredibly sick. I'd be getting up like every 15 minutes, puking in the middle of the night,"" Sackett-Hutcheson said. Like Danny Hauser, Sackett-Hutcheson was entangled in a court battle over her family's decision. However, a judge allowed her to continue treatment in Mexico, while last month a judge ordered Hauser to undergo chemotherapy. Sackett-Hutcheson's case was ultimately dismissed after doctors from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston declined to evaluate her progress on the grounds that they felt she was receiving ""inadequate treatment,"" according to court documents. Four months after her diagnosis in 1991, she says, she was cancer-free, and has remained so. Dr. Francisco Contreras, Oasis of Hope's head physician and the son of its founder, says Mexico's ""open-mindedness"" toward alternative therapies is related to the socioeconomic standing of most of its citizens. ""Mexican authorities are much more open to natural therapies because most Mexicans live under the line of poverty so they would not have access to conventional medicine,"" he said. ""I don't know if that's for benefit of our patients or not, but we have this open-mindedness because we have to do something to help our people."" Like many border clinics, Contreras says his center takes an integrative approach, combining conventional treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiation, with alternative methods to create individualized regimens that focus on healing the entire body with fewer debilitating, long-term side effects. Not everyone leaves Tijuana's clinics happy. Several articles on www.quackwatch.com and its sister sites contain negative testimonials from people who say they sought alternative treatment, mostly laetrile, for parents or a loved one only to have them die of cyanide poisoning a few weeks later. Such cautionary tales didn't stop Jennifer Woods from following the example of her grandfather by going to Tijuana to receive the Alivizatos treatment, an intravenous serum that its makers say consists of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. During her first monthlong visit, Woods paid about $15,000 for surgery to remove her tumors, 20 days of worth of the dosage and two meals a day, plus lodging expenses across the border in San Diego, California. But Woods says it was worth every penny. ""I feel well. I've never had any ill side effects, and I have learned so much about nutrition and how to maintain my health,"" she said in a telephone interview from her home in Denver, Colorado. Woods says she has not seen a doctor in the United States since. She says she returns to IBC about every six months for six days at a time to receive ""booster treatments"" for about $1,200 a visit. ""It's a very well-rounded program. You don't just go there and let somebody give you something and then walk out and forget about it. You take responsibility from that day forward to do the right thing to keep your health in order.""","Tumors have shrunk in teen who was ordered to resume chemotherapy .

"(CNN) -- Jeff Kepner just wanted to hold his 13-year-old daughter's hand again. The nine-hour operation completed on Monday was the first double hand transplant in the United States. The 57-year-old Augusta, Georgia, resident underwent the first double hand transplant in the United States on Monday at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. On Friday he remained at the transplant intensive care unit. He is ""very stable, awake and alert, and he's talking with us,"" said Dr. W. P. Andrew Lee, who led the nine-hour surgery. ""He is having good circulation in the transplanted hands."" Kepner shows no signs of transplant rejection, Lee said. The patient was groggy, but asked more questions about the operation as he started feeling better, said his wife, Valarie Kepner. He is expected to remain in the intensive care unit for a week, said Lee,  chief of the division of plastic surgery and professor of surgery and orthopedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In 1999, Kepner lost both hands and feet to a strep infection. As the bacterial infection spread throughout his body, it stopped blood flow to his limbs and shut down his liver and kidneys. While most strep infections are mild, in some cases the bacteria can destroy muscles, fat and skin tissue and cause toxic shock syndrome. At the time, Kepner's daughter was only 3 years old. ""She doesn't remember her dad any other way but this. We looked through pictures and we can't find one of him holding her hand. That's one thing she was looking forward to -- that she's going to be able to hold her dad's hand again."" The infection came at a time when Kepner had just earned a degree in pastry arts. ""He was a good cook all the way around. I worked full time,"" his wife said. ""I was spoiled, because when I came home dinner was on the table. He did it very well."" For the last decade, Kepner adjusted to prosthetic limbs. He drove his teenage daughter, Jordan, to school and worked part-time at Borders bookstore. But he could no longer cook. Although he could do some of the basic tasks, Kepner said her husband could not perform activites that required fine motor skills. She had to help him in the shower and help him get dressed. ""He would be on my schedule, that's why this [the hand transplant] would give him a whole level of independence,"" she said. With his new hands, Kepner hopes to perform small tasks such as changing a light bulb and using a remote control. ""I'm looking forward to his cooking,"" his wife said. ""I'm looking forward to him doing the things he wants to do when he wants to do them."" Kepner initially had doubts, especially since it was an elective procedure. ""The two points that changed his mind as we talked was, No. 1, the independence he wanted to gain,"" his wife said. The second point was that they believed there were fewer risks with this particular  surgery. The Kepners knew a double hand transplant meant Kepner would have to take drugs to suppress his immune system for the rest of his life (like any transplant, the recipient's immune system could attack the new organ as a foreign object). But for this surgery, the Pittsburgh doctors would also transplant bone marrow from the donor to reduce the amount of immunosuppressants Kepner would have to take. According to the doctors, the bone marrow cells could re-educate the immune system so it wouldn't reject the hands. Despite the risks, Lee said hand transplant recipients regain much of their autonomy. ""They can perform activities of daily living -- the simple things you and I take for granted such as personal hygiene, brushing our teeth, combing our hair,"" Lee said. ""When you don't have either hand, you are often completely dependent on another person, a family member or in Mr. Kepner's case his wife, for a lot of very basic activities during the day."" On January 22, Kepner signed up to be a candidate for the medical center's clinical trial for hand transplants. He had to pass a screening process, which included a physical and a psychiatric evaluation of his coping skills, his expectations and his understanding of the transplant. Three months later, Kepner received the call. There was a donor whose hands matched Kepner's skin color, gender and size. After getting permission from the donor's family, the surgeons removed the donor's hands extending midway to the elbows. A team of surgeons attached arteries and veins, repaired tendons and nerves and set the bones for both hands. The surgery involved 27 bones, 28 muscles, three major nerves, two major arteries, multiple tendons, veins and soft tissue. Kepner still cannot feel with his new hands, Lee said. ""We really don't expect him to [now],"" Lee said. ""The nerves grow at a speed of one inch per month, and there are many inches between the mid-forearm to the fingers."" After Kepner leaves the intensive care unit, he is expected to begin three months of physical therapy to gain mobility in his joints, wrists and fingers. ""Based on the results of hand transplants performed so far around the world, just about everyone regains protective sensation, which is the ability to distinguish between hot and cold and feel a pin prick,"" Lee said. While it's difficult to predict how much movement and sense of touch Kepner will have in his new hands, Lee said, ""We are optimistic he will regain protective sensation and even more than that."" More than 32 patients have received hand transplants. Some of these recipients in the United States and Europe have lived with their new hands for more than a decade.","Former pastry chef received double hand transplant Monday .

"SATSUMA, Florida (CNN) -- The father of a missing 5-year-old Florida girl made a renewed plea Thursday for the return of his daughter. The search continued Thursday for Haleigh Cummings, 5, who went missing from her home near Orlando. ""If you have my daughter and you're watching this, drop her off somewhere safe,"" Roland Cummings said of his daughter Haleigh. ""I'm not out for revenge, I'm not out for nothing else. I want my daughter back,"" Cummings said, with his girlfriend, Misty Croslin, at his side. He said he could think of no reason Haleigh would be taken. ""Why would anybody be sick enough"" to abduct a child? he asked. Cummings, 25, said earlier that he and Croslin had passed lie detector tests. Croslin, 17, was the last person to see Haleigh when she put the girl to bed Monday night in their Satsuma, Florida, home. She said she awoke in the middle of the night to find Haleigh gone and the back door to the double-wide trailer propped open with a brick. Putnam County authorities on Thursday continued working with the FBI and state investigators to search a five-mile area for Haleigh. Police have no official suspects, but say they are treating everyone they interview as one. ""All the world's a suspect"" now, a sheriff's spokesman has said. Cummings said earlier that he was surprised when he arrived home from work at 3 a.m. Tuesday to see his girlfriend awake, and he asked her why she was up. ""She said, 'Your back door's open and your daughter's gone,' "" Cummings told Nancy Grace on her show on CNN's sister network HLN on Wednesday night.  Watch Cummings describe his shock » .

The police must ""assume abduction,"" he said, adding, ""All the answers to why you'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly."" Haleigh's mother, Crystal Sheffield, shook as she spoke Thursday near the search area. Sheffield's mother, Marie Griffis, said that she and her daughter are devastated. ""It's like I've got a hole in my body, and she feels helpless because she can't do anything but sit here."" A nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear. Croslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues, said Bowling, describing the girlfriend as a ""child herself."" Griffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a ""rocky relationship"" and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter.  Watch mother's tearful plea » . It's unclear if Sheffield and Cummings were ever married, but they are ""legally separated,"" police said Thursday. Authorities were unable to answer media questions about how and why Cummings had custody of Haleigh. Sheffield lives near the Florida-Georgia line and has been interviewed by law enforcement, according to police. Investigators are looking into various angles of the case, including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home, said Lt. Johnny Greenwood of the Putnam County Sheriff's Office. Police are offering but not requiring all those interviewed in the case to take polygraph tests. A familiar face from the Caylee Anthony case is involved in the search. Bounty hunter Leonard Padilla joined the hunt Tuesday and is offering a $25,000 reward for the girl's return. Padilla initially bonded out Caylee's mother, Casey, who has been charged with first-degree murder in the toddler's death, and then helped launch one of several searches for Caylee. Anyone with information is encouraged to call the Putnam County Sheriff's Office at 386-329-0800 or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse at 888-FL-MISSING.

"Editor's note: Deborah E. Lipstadt, Dorot professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University, is the author of ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving."" She was the target of a British libel lawsuit by Irving, a historian she said had become a spokesman for Holocaust denial. Lipstadt won the case in April 2000. Read her blog here . Deborah Lipstadt says the Holocaust love story seemed incredible on its face. (CNN) -- I don't know whether to be sad or angry -- or both. The recent exposé of the fact that Herman Rosenblat's Holocaust memoir is a hoax was no surprise to me. From the first time I heard the story of his ""miraculous"" survival during the Nazi era, I doubted that it could be true. Rosenblat's claim that, as an inmate in a Buchenwald sub-camp, he had survived because a young girl had tossed an apple over the fence each day for seven months just did not seem credible to me. The notion that a concentration camp inmate could approach the fence without the SS shooting him beggared the imagination. I could not believe that a little girl whose family was supposedly passing as non-Jews would allow their daughter to engage in such an act. The fairy tale nature of the incident was enhanced by the supposed reunion of the couple on a blind date years later when both had moved to America. The story was that they discovered each other's true identity and, after a whirlwind romance, decided to marry. Survivors who had been in the camp with Rosenblat and had kept in touch with him since the end of the war protested that the story could not be true. They wondered why Rosenblat had never mentioned the incident until the late 1990s. A number of other historians shared my doubts, which I posted on my blog. As one of the first to express skepticism about this, I became the target of attacks from those who thought I was demeaning the Rosenblats. We doubters could not, however, initially overcome the power of Oprah, on whose show Rosenblat and his wife appeared twice. Credulous reporters, who should have sought some form of verification, kept writing about this ""miraculous"" event. The producer who acquired movie rights tried to intimidate those of us who raised questions. He wrote to me saying, ""I have traveled all over Eastern Europe for several years in preparation for what will be a major feature film. I may be more of a Holocaust expert than you, even though, I have no title nor university affiliation. What I do know for sure is before I make any statements I know the facts. You simply do not know those facts, and that Deborah, is the greatest sin to the memory of all those perished so long ago."" The publisher refused to let anyone see the book. Public relations people circulated versions of the story urging recipients to send it on so eventually it would reach millions of people. Slowly, thanks to the power of the Internet and the work of some intrepid historians, the hoax was exposed. The publisher pulled the book. The movie producer cried foul, presenting himself as a victim who had been duped. This is not the first time such a hoax has been perpetrated. Most of the previous stories have been spread by people who were passing as survivors. In contrast, the Rosenblats were both survivors of the Holocaust. But that fact has now been lost in the shuffle. What, then, is the danger of these sorts of hoaxes? First of all, they give ammunition to Holocaust deniers. This is a bonanza for them. Deniers expend great efforts in trying to implant doubts in young people about the veracity of the Holocaust. They spend so much energy attacking ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"" because it is a book that is widely read by young people. The fact that this ""apples over the fence"" story has already been published as a widely successful children's story provides the deniers with a great opportunity to peddle their wares. However, the danger posed by deniers is not the primary reason why such fabricated stories should be exposed. The events of the Holocaust are horrible in and of themselves. They do not need to be aggrandized or exaggerated to be made to sound any worse than they were. They also do not need to be rendered as joyful love stories that make us feel good about what happened. Both are insults to the survivors and inimical to the pursuit of historical truth. The optimum way of teaching about the Holocaust and presenting its history is, to quote Detective Joe Friday from the old TV show, ""Dragnet,"" ""just the facts, just the facts."" What we need, particularly in relation to something as mind-boggling as the Holocaust, are ""just the facts."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Lipstadt.","Deborah Lipstadt: People raised questions about Holocaust love story .
She says backers of the story rejected the doubts .
Lipstadt says such tales give ammunition to Holocaust deniers .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- British Airways is asking thousands of its staff to work for free for up to four weeks, spokeswoman Kirsten Millard said Tuesday. British Airways plans to reduce capacity by 4 percent next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft. In an e-mail to all its staff, the airline offered workers between one and four weeks of unpaid leave -- but with the option to work during this period. British Airways employs just more than 40,000 people in the United Kingdom. Last month, the company posted a record annual loss of £400 million ($656 million). Its chief executive declared at the time there were ""absolutely no signs of recovery"" in the industry. ""In 30 years in this business and I've never seen anything like this. This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced,"" said Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive.  Watch more about BA's request » . A spokesman for one of Britain's biggest unions said its workers could not afford to work for free for a month. ""It's all well and good for Willie Walsh to say he's prepared to work for free when he earns four times in a month what they do in a year,"" said Ciaran Naidoo, a spokesman for Unite. He pointed out that the airline was not ordering staff to work without pay. ""It's a request -- you can take unpaid leave or you can work for free, and the chances of people working for free are very unlikely, but there might be some people who want to take unpaid leave."" Demand for the airline's passenger seats and cargo holds fell during the last financial year, while its fuel bill rocketed to almost £3 billion ($4.7 billion). Walsh said British Airways' woes were inextricably linked to the downturn in the global economy and that there had been no sign of any ""green shoots"" of recovery. Like its premium-class competitors, British Airways is losing customers to cheaper rivals. The airline's premium passenger numbers fell 13 percent in the second half of last year, in line with the industry average. Total traffic fell 3.4 percent and while the airline carried 33.1 million passengers last year, it was a drop of 4.3 percent from the previous year. The dip in demand for British Airways' flights has forced a switch in strategy at the airline. From the end of last year, it has been trying to tempt passengers with lower fares, sacrificing profit per seat for ""bums on seats."" It plans to reduce capacity by 4 percent next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft.

"(CNN) -- A 28-year-old Oregon woman has been charged with murder after the body of a new mother was found in the crawl space of her home. Police released a photo of Korena Roberts, who is charged with murder. Rescue crews first went to Korena Roberts' home in Washington County on Friday in response to a call of a newborn in distress. They found Roberts' boyfriend unsuccessfully trying to revive the baby using first-aid techniques. Roberts told deputies the baby was hers, the county sheriff's office said. Medics noticed a lot of blood at the home, and sent Roberts and the baby to a hospital. ""Doctors at the hospital were not able to revive the baby,"" said Sgt. David Thompson of the Washington County Sheriff's Office in a news release. ""They also discovered that Ms. Roberts had not delivered a child at anytime in the recent past."" Deputies returned to the home, where they found the body of 21-year-old Heather Snively in the crawl space under the kitchen, Thompson said. Authorities learned Snively had been pregnant at the time she was attacked, and they determined she was the mother of the infant. An autopsy will now determine how the baby was delivered, and whether he died before or after birth, Thompson said. The outcome could result in another murder charge for Roberts, deputies said. Residents in the woman's Mill Creek Drive neighborhood said Roberts had told them she was expecting a child, according to CNN affiliate KPTV.

"DAVID, Panama (CNN) -- Dozens of families frightened by aftershocks slept outside overnight Wednesday after a magnitude 6.2 earthquake shook coastal Panama near the border with Costa Rica. The quake was centered about 235 miles (380 km) west of Panama City, near the town of David, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . The temblor occurred at 1:11 a.m. ET and residents reported feeling three aftershocks. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but damage was reported in the cities of Paso Canoa, David and Puerto Armuelles. The extent of the damage was not immediately known. Many families opted to stay outside their homes, saying that they felt as if the earth were swallowing them and that trees and their houses were falling down. One resident, Carlos Estribi, said he picked up his children in his arms and ran to the public plaza in David, seeking protection since he felt like his house was collapsing. Family members told CNN that patients at the Regional Hospital of David went outside and refused to go back in because aftershocks were still being felt. Patients at the Materno Infantil Jose de Obaldia Hospital and the Regional Rafael Hernandez Hospital also fled their rooms. Cyclists from Costa Rica, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Germany, who were in David for a bicycle race, also had to leave their hotel rooms.

"(CNN) -- The unlikely alchemy of a hard-rock legend and a bluegrass superstar created Grammy gold Sunday night, as Robert Plant and Alison Krauss picked up five awards -- including album and record of the year -- for their work, ""Raising Sand."" Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's song ""Please Read the Letter"" won record of the year. ""Sand"" won album of the year honor, while a song from the set, ""Please Read the Letter,"" won record of the year. ""I'm bewildered. In the old days we would have called this selling out. But it's a good way to spend a Sunday,"" said Plant, the legendary Led Zeppelin front man. ""Raising Sand"" was produced by T Bone Burnett, whose production and oversight of the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" soundtrack won three awards -- including album of the year -- in 2002. For ""Sand,"" Burnett selected several songs, mostly obscurities such as Gene Clark's ""Polly Come Home"" and Sam Phillips' ""Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us,"" and let Plant and Krauss mix it up in stark, often subdued fashion. The result was widely praised and reached No. 2 on the album charts.  Watch Plant and Krauss talk about their win » . The win adds to Krauss' eye-popping Grammy total of 26 awards -- more than any female artist in history and third only to conductor Sir Georg Solti (31) and producer-arranger-mogul Quincy Jones (27).

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The alleged surviving attacker from last month's Mumbai terror attacks is seeking help from Pakistani officials, India said Monday. Guests arrive at the reopening of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai. The suspect, Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab, wrote a letter to Pakistan's High Commission in India that was handed over to Pakistan's acting high commissioner in New Delhi on Monday evening, India's foreign ministry said. Asked about the statement, Pakistan's foreign ministry said the government in Islamabad ""has so far not received any information or evidence relating to the Mumbai incident from the government of India."" According to India's foreign ministry, Kasab, 21, stated in his letter that he and the other attackers were from Pakistan and asked for a meeting with Pakistan's High Commission. Indian authorities said Kasab had admitted he was one of 10 gunmen who attacked several targets in Mumbai on November 26, sparking three days of battles with police and Indian troops in the heart of the city that is the hub of India's financial and entertainment industries. India said Kasab told investigators he and the others were trained for more than a year in Pakistan by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a banned Islamic militant group. The attacks left more than 160 people dead, as well as nine of the gunmen. Most of the deaths occurred at the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi-Trident hotels, which reopened on Sunday -- three weeks after the attacks. CNN's Sara Sidner in New Delhi and Zein Basravi in Islamabad contributed to this report.","Alleged surviving attacker from Mumbai terror attacks seeks Pakistani help .

"(CNN) -- Police violated the rights of a man charged in the death of a Little Rock, Arkansas, anchorwoman by interviewing him twice without his lawyer present, defense attorneys said in a motion. Anne Pressly spent five days in the hospital before she died from her injuries. The motion requests a judge bar police from ""interviewing, interrogating or otherwise communicating with"" Curtis Lavell Vance. In their response, however, prosecutors note that Vance initiated both interviews with police and waived his right to have an attorney present. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday on the issue, according to the Pulaski County court clerk's office. Vance, 28, is charged with capital murder, rape, residential burglary and theft in the death of Anne Pressly. Pressly, 26, was found unconscious in her home October 20 and died five days later at a hospital. She was the morning news anchor for KATV, a CNN affiliate. Authorities have said Vance is linked to Pressly's death through DNA testing. Little Rock Police spokesman Lt. Terry Hastings and prosecutor John Johnson declined comment to CNN Monday, citing a gag order imposed in the case. However, in Johnson's response to the motion, he notes Vance initiated both of the interviews. In the defense motion filed earlier this month, Vance's public defenders wrote they notified the court in December that he intended to assert his right to remain silent and communicate only through his counsel. A judge issued an order directing that police provide sufficient notice to defense counsel before transporting Vance. However, the defense alleges Little Rock Police transported Vance to a police station and interviewed him without notifying them in December and again in February. In December, the attorneys said they were notified by jail staff that Vance had been taken for a police interview. They went to the jail and waited at the inmate entrance in hopes of seeing him as he arrived but police ""deviated from normal practice and took him through an entrance on the opposite side of the building from that which is ordinarily used, thereby avoiding the possibility that Mr. Vance would see his attorneys."" They said in December, police did not allow them to speak with Vance. In February, they claim in the motion, Vance was not notified of their request to speak with him during the police interview. Although police claim that both of the interviews were initiated by Vance, ""the detectives' lack of candor with Mr. Vance during the interviews violates his Sixth Amendment right to counsel,"" the defense motion said. ""LRPD detectives have engaged in subterfuge and have violated both the meaning and the express language of a standing court order in their successful attempts to interrogate Mr. Vance outside the presence of counsel."" But, prosecutors point out in their response, a defendant is allowed to initiate contact with authorities, even if represented by counsel. ""The only issue here is whether the defendant waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by initiating contact with the police, and clearly he did,"" Johnson wrote. They also said defense attorneys were notified in December that Vance was being transported from the jail -- by the jail staff. And in February, they said, police could not have violated the district court order in the case because the district court lost jurisdiction over the case when it was filed in circuit court -- as spelled out in the order itself. Prosecutors also note that despite requests by the defense to speak to Vance, ""As counsel knows ... law enforcement is under no obligation to allow an attorney access to their client under these circumstances unless the defendant asks for the attorney."" Vance's trial has been set for September 9, according to court documents.","Motion says Little Rock Police interviewed suspect twice without lawyers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Slave labor in developing countries such as Brazil, China and India is fueling part of their huge economic growth, according to a State Department report released Wednesday. Amnesty International activists protest human trafficking during an event in Greece in March. The department's annual ""Trafficking in Persons Report"" found increased allegations of forced labor made in connection with a variety of agricultural products and manufactured goods in developing countries. In Brazil, the report found a ""trafficking phenomenon."" It said thousands of trafficked and forced laborers had been found on plantations growing sugar cane for Brazil's booming production and export of the biofuel ethanol. The report cites shrimp processed in Thailand and Bangladesh; clothing from Bangladesh, India, Jordan and Malaysia; and bricks made in India, China and Pakistan as being among the products of booming industries in which workers are subjected to forced labor, debt bondage and hazardous working conditions. Laws are not adequate to punish those responsible, it adds. China was found to have a ""significant"" problem with forced labor, including forced child labor. Children as young as 12 are reportedly subject to forced labor under the guise of ""work and study programs"" and subject to excessively long hours, dangerous conditions, low pay and physical abuse. The report found China's growing brick industry is fraught with cover-ups of the problem. For the fourth year in a row, China was put on a ""watch list"" of countries that could face sanctions if they don't improve their efforts to combat trafficking. India was also placed on the watch list for not doing enough to solve its trafficking problem, according to the report. While commercial sexual exploitation remained a problem in India, the State Department found internal forced labor ""may constitute India's largest trafficking problem."" It said men, women and children are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, agricultural businesses and embroidery factories. Once again, the report found U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf to have dismal records on trafficking. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman were listed as destination countries with widespread trafficking abuses. The report cites forced laborers trafficked from Asia and Africa who are subject to restrictions on movement, withholding of passports, threats, and physical and sexual abuse. The report found those countries made weak efforts to rescue the workers and prosecute the traffickers. The other countries on the blacklist are Algeria, Myanmar, Cuba, Fiji, Iran, Moldova, North Korea, Papua New Guinea, Sudan and Syria.","State Department report documents human trafficking .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- More than six hundred workers at Total's Lindsey oil refinery in Northern England have been told they no longer have jobs after staging what the company calls an ""unofficial, illegal walk out."" Protesters gathered outside Total's Lindsey oil refinery on Friday, June 19, after hundreds of striking workers were sacked. The steel workers started striking last Thursday after one contractor axed 51 jobs while another employer on the same site was recruiting. Protesters gathered outside Total's Lindsey oil refinery Friday with placards calling for solidarity from fellow workers. The dispute has prompted a number of wildcat strikes at power stations and oil refineries around the United Kingdom. The workers' union GMB, which represents around half of the sacked workers, estimates that, as of late yesterday, up to 4,000 other workers at four power stations and three oil refineries had walked off the job in sympathy. Early this afternoon, Total confirmed that negotiations had started between the workers' employers and ACAS, the British Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Earlier, in a statement posted on its Web site, Total announced that its contractors had started the process of ending employment contracts for 647 workers on the HDS-3 construction project. The statement said the project has been temporarily shut down and that all employees had until 5pm on Monday to reapply for their jobs. Phil Davies, national secretary and head of the manufacturing section at the GMB Union, told CNN the invitation to a job interview would only stoke workers' anger. ""I think that would just humiliate people to be quite honest and it will put their backs up and make them more determined to win it,"" he said. He said union representatives were in the process of gathering information to hold an official industrial ballot, a process that could take six weeks. The British Press Association published one sacked Lindsey worker's appeal for support from fellow union members: ""We are asking for support from workers across the country which I am sure will be given. Total will soon realize they have unleashed a monster."" Workers at the Lindsey oil refinery walked off the job for more than one week in early February to protest against the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers. They returned to work after the unions and the company gave assurances that half the jobs would go to British workers.","NEW: Total says the workers' employers and ACAS are in negotiations .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Are circus elephants abused? Or are the elephants under the big top healthy and thriving in a caring environment? Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey elephants pass the U.S. Capitol in a parade this week in Washington. That's the issue a federal judge must decide in a 9-year-old legal dispute pitting four animal rights groups against the nation's most famous circus, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Closing arguments will be heard Wednesday in the case in which the circus is accused of mistreating its 54 Asian elephants, which are protected under the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Under the law, endangered species cannot be ""harmed, harassed, wounded, injured or killed."" The circus ""is in fact in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act as a result of their routine practices that they use on the elephants,"" according to Tracy Silverman, general counsel for the Animal Welfare Institute. Silverman alleges that the circus uses ""bull hooks"" and electrical prods called ""hot shots"" to train and manage the elephants and that handlers chain the elephants for extended periods of time. These practices violate federal law, Silverman says. But the circus says that no evidence was presented at the six-week trial that such tools as bull hooks and hot shots are used on elephants. ""Ringling Bros.' practices are well known to the federal government who regulates their business,"" says Ringling Bros. attorney Michelle Pardo. The tools the circus uses to handle animals ""are time-tested, approved and commonly used,"" she added. Pardo insists the trial evidence ""showed the elephants are healthy, well cared for and they're thriving in Ringling Bros. care."" Besides the Animal Welfare Institute, other groups involved in the suit are the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Fund for Animals and Born Free USA, acting with the Animal Protection Institute. While the animal rights groups allege the circus ""severely mistreats and abuses"" elephants, the circus says the animals are not only healthy but ""really do benefit from the enrichment that the circus provides.""

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says it's time to get over the fact that baseball turned a blind eye to steroid use. (CNN) -- I loved baseball as a kid. I still have fond memories of my siblings and me, members of the ""Astro Buddies"" club, heading to the Astrodome, the eighth wonder of the world, to watch the Houston Astros play. I played the game in elementary and high school. But now, I'm sick of it, especially when steroids are brought up. The latest baseball drama surrounds a New York Times report quoting two lawyers who say that former Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa's name was on a list of players who tested positive for an illegal substance in 2003. The list supposedly contains more than 100 names of players who tested positive that year. This report comes on the heels of Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees admitting that he used performance-enhancing drugs a few years ago; Manny Ramirez testing positive and suspended for 50 games; and the continuing drama surrounding Roger Clemens. All three were considered locks for the Hall of Fame. But based on what we keep hearing, that'll never happen in this holier-than-thou era. OK, got it. Baseball had a terrible drug problem. Now they have a drug testing plan in place that has some teeth in it. So, can we just move the hell on? Seriously, I'm tired of rehashing the drama. As a sports enthusiast, I would love nothing better than to think that athletes in baseball, football, basketball or any other sport are as pure as heroes from yesteryear. But cheating is cheating. It has been around from Day One, and if a player thinks he can get an edge, well, it's a good bet some will try to get it. Sosa has always been suspected of using drugs, but now that two lawyers say they saw his name on the infamous sheet, he has gone, according to Rick Telander's column in the Chicago Sun-Times, ""from hero to zero."" But you know what? I don't care. Can we just all accept the fact that all of baseball -- players, management, owners, the unions -- turned a blind eye to performance-enhancing drugs ravaging the sport? And they did so because baseball was on its way to being comparable to the National Hockey League or soccer in the U.S. -- irrelevant to sports fans. After the strike in 1994 wiped out the World Series, fans were angry and didn't give a lick about the sport. But then came 1998 and the home-run derby put on by St. Louis Cardinal Mark McGwire and Sosa, both trying to break the record of 61 homers in a year set by Roger Maris of the New York Yankees. Fans were riveted by the hitting prowess of the two, and people were following their every at-bat. I was working at KRLD-AM in Dallas, Texas, that summer, and we would break into programming to broadcast the call of their at-bats when they were about to break the record. Yea, everyone had Sosa-McGwire fever. Baseball became relevant again. The players redeemed themselves, management was happy to say they worked for the sport, and the owners were delirious because the money came rolling in. So there we have it. All of baseball pulled a Robert Johnson, as in the legend of the classic blues singer who supposedly got his gift for music by making a pact with the devil. Or maybe more like Judas. The sport turned in its integrity for a few pieces of silver. Let's just accept this as a fact, acknowledge those were the dark days and move on. It's just tiring to keep going back to what happened then. It's done. It's over. So let it go. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland S.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Some Israeli archaeologists are having a particularly happy Hanukkah, thanks in part to a British volunteer who took time off from her job to work on a dig. Archaeologists found a hoard of gold coins from the 7th century in Jerusalem on Sunday. The Israel Antiquities Authority reported a thrilling find Sunday -- the discovery of 264 ancient gold coins in Jerusalem National Park. The coins were minted during the early 7th century. ""This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem -- certainly the largest and most important of its period,"" said Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets, who are directing the excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Researchers discovered the coins at the beginning of the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which started at sunset on Sunday. One of the customs of the holiday is to give ""gelt,"" or coins, to children, and the archaeologists are referring to the find as ""Hanukkah money."" Nadine Ross, a British archaeological volunteer, happened onto the coins during the dig just below the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. ""To be honest, I just thought, 'Thank God I didn't throw it in the rubbish bucket,' "" said Ross, who had taken four weeks off from her engineering job in England to work at the site. ""I was just glad I sort of spotted it before I disturbed it too much."" The 1,400-year-old coins were found in the Giv'ati car park in the City of David in the walls around Jerusalem National Park, a site that has yielded other finds, including a well-preserved gold earring with pearls and precious stones. They were in a collapsed building that dates back to the 7th century, the end of the Byzantine period.  The coins bear a likeness of Heraclius, who was the Byzantine emperor from 610 to 641. The authority said that while different coins had been minted during this emperor's reign, the coins found at the site represent ""one well-known type."" In that style, the emperor is clad with military garb and is holding a cross in his right hand. On the other side is the sign of the cross. Authorities said the excavation of the building where the hoard was discovered is in its early stages. They are attempting to learn about the building and its owner and the circumstances of its destruction. ""Since no pottery vessel was discovered adjacent to the hoard, we can assume that it was concealed inside a hidden niche in one of the walls of the building. It seems that with its collapse, the coins piled up there among the building debris,"" Ben-Ami and Tchekhanovets said. The find is a a golden moment for Ross, who said ""it is a pity that I can't take it home with me. But there you go."" CNN's Shira Medding and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: Coins were found by British volunteer; ""Pity that I can't take it home,"" she says .

"(CNN)  -- Former champion Maria Sharapova has been seeded for next week's Wimbledon championships. Sharapova powers a forehand during the WTA tournament in Birmingham last week. The Russian has only recently returned to action after a serious shoulder injury, but despite performing solidly in the French Open and reaching the semifinals of the WTA grasscourt event in Birmingham last week, she remained 59th in the rankings. But Wimbledon, who are alone among the grand slams in not sticking entirely with the official rankings of the ATP and WTA in deciding the seedings, have given Sharapova the 24th berth. World number one Dinara Safina of Russia is top seed, followed by Serena Williams and defending champion Venus Williams, who is elevated to third because of her prowess on grass. Rafael Nadal, who remains a slight injury doubt to take his place in the draw, is the top seed in the men's tournament, with the top six spots in the list following the ATP rankings list. The defending champion will  test his injured knees by playing in two exhibition matches on grass at the Hurlingham Club in London later this week, organizers announced Wednesday. The Spaniard will play Lleyton Hewitt of Australia on Thursday and Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland on Friday. Five-time champion and pre-tournament favorite Roger Federer is second seed at Wimbledon as he bids to set a record of 15 grand slam wins after his French Open triumph. Home hope Andy Murray, who won the Queen's Club tournament on Sunday, is seeded third with Novak Djokovic of Serbia in fourth. Eighth-ranked Fernando Verdasco of Spain gets the seventh seed spot ahead of Frenchman Gilles Simon. Outside of the top seeds, Marat Safin of Russia has been elevated to 15th from his world ranking of 23. Former world number one Safin reached the semifinals at the All England Club last year. Big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic is lifted to 23rd from 31st. The third grand slam of the year starts next Monday with the all-important draw being made on Friday. In the pre-Wimbledon warmup action on Wednesday, top seed Dinara Safina of Russia beat Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan 6-3 6-3 in the Ordina Open in the Netherlands. But Amelie Mauresmo of France was beaten 7-6 7-6 by Russian Ekaterna Makarova at the WTA tournament in Eastbourne.","Maria Sharapova elevated to 24th seed by as Wimbledon announces seeds .

"(CNN) -- The New Zealand All Blacks secured a narrow 14-10 victory over France in Wellington on Saturday to square their rugby Test series at 1-1, but France still secured the Dave Gallaher Cup for the first time since it was introduced in 2000 by virtue of their five-point victory in Dunedin last week. Ma'a Nonu goes over for New Zealand's only try in their narrow victory over France in Wellington. Having been out-muscled and out-played 27-22 in the opening Test, the New Zealanders played with far greater intensity, physicality and urgency at a cold, wet and windy Westpac Stadium. A Ma'a Nonu try midway through the first half opened the scoring for the host nation before Stephen Donald slotted home a penalty for an 8-0 advantage at the break. The French reply was swift after the restart, with wing Cedric Heymans crossing the line with a superb solo effort and then Julien Dupuy's conversion getting them back into the game. But another Donald penalty and one from substitute Luke McAlister edged the All Blacks further ahead before a late three-pointer from Dimitri Yachvili kept things interesting. Meanwhile, a much-changed Australia side comfortably accounted for Italy 34-12 in Melbourne on Saturday. Man-of-the-match Adam Ashley-Cooper, who started on the bench, finished with two tries, one in each half, after coming on initially when Peter Hynes was blood-binned, then as a replacement for James O'Connor at full-back. Three first-half tries gave the Wallabies a 20-6 lead at the break and that was a fair reflection of the difference between the teams, but the hosts were held at bay for much of the second half before late tries by Lachie Turner and Ashley-Cooper. Australian-born full-back Luke McLean landed four penalties for Italy for whom fellow-Aussie Craig Gower was effective and creative in his second start at fly-half.","The New Zealand All Blacks defeat France 14-10 in Wellington to level series .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- More than 100 Romanians fled their homes Tuesday night in Belfast, Northern Ireland, following what politicians called ""racist attacks and intimidation."" A Romanian woman and her child are escorted by police in Belfast on Wednesday. ""On Tuesday evening, when the Romanians saw their windows starting to be smashed, they felt the threats were very real and contacted the police,"" said Trish Morgan, the media relations manager at the Belfast City Church, which took them in. A church member was advised by the police that ""the situation was getting too tense,"" and that the group -- 113 people in all -- needed to find a safe place that could accommodate them quickly. The member contacted the church, and that's where they went, Morgan said. The Romanians were ""quite scared"" upon arrival at the church but ""relieved to be out of the situation,"" she added. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown Wednesday condemned what one member of Parliament called ""appalling racist attacks,"" and said he hoped the authorities would be able to ""take all the action necessary to protect them."" Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland -- a province of the United Kingdom -- visited the families on Wednesday, his party Sinn Fein announced. ""People are shocked and completely disgusted by this incident,"" he said in a statement ""I came here this morning to show very clearly my commitment to facing up to any form of intimidation in our community, no matter where it may come from. ""I met with numerous families who are genuinely fearful for their lives and those of their families; I held a five-day-old baby girl in my arms today. She was born in Belfast and now forced to leave her home as a result of attacks by racist, criminal thugs,"" McGuinness said. He was speaking at the O-Zone leisure center, where the families have moved because the space is larger than the church. Race-hate crime in south Belfast has increased in the past six months, Sinn Fein equality and human rights expert Vincent Parker said. The incident came only a day after violence broke out at an anti-racism rally in support of Romanians in Belfast. Belfast Lord Mayor Naomi Long called Monday's scuffles ""totally unacceptable."" ""A small minority of people have sadly taken away from an event which had been organized by the local community to show solidarity for their Romanian neighbors, and to express their abhorrence at their homes being subjected to racist attacks,"" she said Tuesday.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The government is warning that taking the psoriasis drug Raptiva could result in serious brain infection and even death. Raptiva may cause a serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The Food and Drug Administration cited three confirmed cases, and a possible fourth, of people diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) after being treated with Raptiva. ""Three of those patients have died,"" the FDA said in a public health advisory. ""All four patients were treated with the drug for more than three years."" None was receiving other treatments that suppress the immune system. Raptiva's product labeling was revised in October to highlight a boxed warning about the risks of life-threatening infections, including PML. ""At that time, the FDA directed Genentech, the manufacturer, to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to include a medication guide to educate patients about the drug's risks,"" the FDA's advisory says. In the advisory, issued Thursday, the FDA highlighted the confirmed cases and promised to ""take appropriate steps"" to ensure that Raptiva's risks do not outweigh its benefits. The FDA also said it will ensure that patients ""are clearly informed of the signs and symptoms of PML"" and that health care professionals ""carefully monitor patients for the possible development of PML."" Overseas, the European Medicines Agency has gone further, recommending that no new prescriptions for Raptiva be issued and that patients taking the drug talk to their doctors about an alternative. On Thursday it asked the European Commission to make that recommendation legally binding. The group's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use determined ""that the benefits of Raptiva no longer outweigh its risks, because of safety concerns, including the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in patients taking the medicine."" It said patients who have been treated with the drug should be ""closely monitored for neurological symptoms and symptoms of infection."" ""Patients who are currently taking Raptiva should not stop treatment abruptly, but should make an appointment with their doctor to discuss the most appropriate replacement treatment,"" the agency said. Raptiva, a once-weekly injection for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, works by suppressing T-cells -- cells that help fight infection -- in the immune system. Those cells cause the skin inflammation associated with psoriasis. By suppressing T-cells, Raptiva ""decreases the function of the immune system, which increases a patient's susceptibility to infections,"" the FDA said. The National Institutes of Health says the prognosis for PML ""remains grim; the disease usually lasts for months and 80 percent die within the first six months, although spontaneous improvement has been reported. Those who survive PML can be left with severe neurological disabilities."" Around 6 million to 7 million Americans have psoriasis, which is incurable, the NIH says.","NEW: European Medicines Agency discourages new Raptiva prescriptions .

"(CNN)  -- North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals for the first time since 1966 by battling to a 0-0 draw away to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday night. North Korea have qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1966. The point captured in searing temperatures in Riyadh, saw the Koreans edge into second place in Asian qualifying Group 2 to finish ahead of Saudi Arabia on goal difference and seal their place in the finals. It means both group winners South Korea, who co-hosted the World Cup with Japan in 2002, and neighbors North Korea will  play in the 2010 showpiece in South Africa. North Korea coach Kim Yong-Jun Kim had nothing but praise for his players after the final whistle. ""We focused on the defending as we had come under a lot of pressure from the Saudis and I think our preparation for the game was one factor that earned the victory tonight,"" the North Korean boss told FIFA's official Web site. ""We monitored the Saudi team from the beginning of our campaign and I noticed that they have a problem in finding good strikers. We battled to qualify for the  World Cup finals and I would like to thank my players for the great performance that they showed during the whole match,"" added Kim. ""It was so hot in Saudi Arabia and as you know the journey from Korea was long but our belief in the ability of the players snatched the ticket to South Africa,"" Kim stated. The booking of North Korea's ticket to the finale will see the reclusive nation compete against the world's best despite growing international political concern regarding Pyongyang's testing of a nuclear bomb recently. Their form in the tournament is one of upsetting the odds after they Italy 43 years ago en route to the quarter-finals. The home draw sees Saudi Arabia finish in third place to go into the playoffs where they will face Bahrain. The winners will play New Zealand for a place in the finals, while Iran miss out after finishing fourth in Group 2. Earlier on Wednesday, they were denied a victory in Seoul as Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung scored a late equalizer to give South Korea a 1-1 draw. Iran took the lead from an own goal early in the second half against the group winners, but Park popped up to score a brilliant 81st minute goal as he beat several men before firing home. In Group 1, Tim Cahill scored twice as Australia came from behind to beat Japan 2-1 to clinch top spot in the section. The result was academic as both teams had already sealed automatic qualification for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Japan went ahead in front of a big crowd of nearly 70,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) as Marcus Tulio Tanaka headed home a Kengo Nakamura corner in the 40th minute. But the Socceroos, who went through qualifying unbeaten, hit back in the second half. Everton's attacking midfielder Cahill again worked his scoring magic to secure the victory. He was on target in the 59th and 76th minutes to take his tally to 16 in 33 internationals. ""This is a step forward for us, it's great to finish top of the group,"" Cahill told FIFA.com after the win, while captain Lucas Neill paid tribute to their opponents. ""They really played the game with intensity and they were running us ragged for a bit and we couldn't get ourselves in the game,"" Neill said. Bahrain later clinched third spot in the group and their playoff spot with a 1-0 win over Uzbekistan. A 74th minute goal from Mahmood Abdulrahman from a free kick gave his side a crucial three points.","North Korea qualify from Group 2 with 0-0 draw against Saudi Arabia .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Members of Iran's national soccer team wore green arm and wrist bands Wednesday during their World Cup qualifying match against South Korea. Members of Iran's National Soccer Team sport green bands in their game against South Korea on Wednesday. The team does not normally wear green bands. Many Iranians are viewing the team's bands as a sign of support for Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, although that has not been confirmed. Green is the campaign color of Moussavi and has been widely worn by his supporters who have staged massive rallies in Tehran before and after last week's presidential election. Moussavi is disputing the results of the vote that gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term and is calling for a new election. The players took the wrist bands off when the team came out for the second half of the game that was taking place in Seoul, South Korea.

"(CNN) -- DNA test results reveal that a Michigan man is not a Long Island, New York, boy who went missing 54 years ago, according to the FBI. John Robert Barnes claims a DNA test shows he's Steven Damman, who vanished in 1955. John Robert Barnes, of Kalkaska, Michigan, approached police in New York twice in March claiming to be Steven Damman, a toddler who vanished while on a shopping trip with his mother in 1955. Barnes tracked down Pamela Damman Horne, Steven's sister, and the two had private tests performed that showed a ""probability"" they were siblings, according to Nassau County, New York, detective Lt. Kevin Smith. But samples from Barnes and Horne analyzed by the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, determined that they do not share the same mother, the FBI in Detroit said Thursday. Sandra Berchtold, spokeswoman for the FBI Detroit bureau, said the FBI follows strict testing protocols and used mitochondrial DNA to determine Barnes and Horne were not linked to the same mother. Marilyn Damman took her toddler, Steven, and his baby sister, Pamela, to a food market in East Meadow, Long Island, in 1955. The mother went inside to do some quick shopping, leaving her 2-year-old son and baby girl in the stroller outside. But Damman told authorities that when she returned, her children were gone. A short time later, blocks away, the baby girl was found unharmed and the stroller was intact, but Steven was missing, Smith said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A nonprofit consumer group said Thursday that it will sue Bayer HealthCare, alleging ""deceptive and irresponsible"" advertising that contends selenium in two of its multivitamins may reduce men's risk of prostate cancer. One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage ads say selenium may cut men's risk of prostate cancer, a consumer group says. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said it informed the multinational company of its intent Thursday. David Schardt, the center's senior nutritionist, told reporters during a teleconference that the center already has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. ""We are standing behind all the claims we make in support of the products,"" Trish McKernan, Bayer's global spokeswoman, told CNN. ""The selenium claims are made by a [Food and Drug Administration]-approved qualified health claim. We regularly review the evidence, and we change our claims if necessitated. The emerging science hasn't compelled us to change our claims, and the FDA claim is intact.""

Bayer promotes One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage and One A Day Men's Health Formula multivitamins on package labels, TV and radio ads and on its Web site. In its promotions, the company says ""emerging research"" suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the center said. ""Did you know that there are more new cases of prostate cancer each year than any other cancer?"" according to one radio ad. ""Now there is something you can do.""

Supporting the center in its letter of complaint to the FTC are nine researchers, who wrote a separate letter to Mary Engle, associate director of advertising practices. Among the signees are medical professionals from the Harvard School of Public Health, American Cancer Society and University of Illinois at Chicago Division of Pathology Research. All agree there is scant evidence to support Bayer's claim. A seven-year, $118 million study funded by the National Institutes of Health found last year that selenium does not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men, the center said. The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial involving 35,000 U.S. and Canadian men was halted in October when researchers determined that selenium was not protecting the men from prostate cancer and may have been causing diabetes in some of them. According to the researchers in their letter supporting the FTC's complaint, ""the federally financed study was the largest individually, randomized cancer prevention trial ever conducted, and, given its high rates of adherence and its statistical power, it is unlikely to have missed detecting a benefit of even a very modest size."" ""Bayer Healthcare is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer,"" they added.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's election authority has rejected claims of voting irregularities by a defeated presidential candidate, while acknowledging that the number of ballots cast in dozens of cities exceeded the number of eligible voters there, state-run TV reported Monday. Protesters face Iranian riot police on a street in Tehran on Saturday. Iran's Guardian Council -- which approves all candidates running for office and verifies election results -- said candidate Mohsen Rezaie alleged irregularities in 170 cities, and that excessive ballots were found in 50 cities, according to government-funded Press TV. Council spokesman Abbas-Ali Kadkhodaei said voting in those locations did not noticeably affect the outcome of the election, adding that the council will continue to investigate complaints that are filed through ""legal channels,"" Press TV said. The council declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner of the June 12 election. Rezaie had reported some irregularities and called for a recount of some ballots, while opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi and candidate Mehdi Karrubi have rejected the election as fraudulent and demanded a new one. Earlier Sunday, thousands of riot police and militia lined Tehran's streets as the public rift among Iranian leaders appeared to be widening. The country's foreign minister disputed allegations of ballot irregularities in Iran's disputed presidential election, and the parliamentary speaker implied the nation's election authorities had sided with one candidate. Amateur video showed large crowds marching down a major Tehran thoroughfare shouting, ""Don't be afraid, we're together!"" and ""Death to dictator!"" The person who shot the video said it was taken Sunday, but CNN could not immediately verify that the protest had taken place. Eyewitnesses reported a protest also took place at southern Tehran's Azad University, where final exams were postponed after about 200 students refused to take them. Thousands of riot police and members of the Basij militia lined the streets of the city, according to eyewitnesses. Security personnel surrounded the headquarters of the country's state television and radio. Many shops were closed, and shopkeepers whose stores were open said they planned to close early Sunday. However, no tanks were seen on the city's streets. Traffic was light.  Watch amateur video of a volunteer paramilitary forces headquarters burning in Tehran » .

Meanwhile, prominent figures, many of whom were part of Iran's Islamic revolution 30 years ago, issued conflicting statements, a sign that Iran's leadership was far from unified. The foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said Sunday an investigation into claims of fraud in the election will be announced by week's end. But speaking to foreign diplomats in Tehran, he called the possibility of irregularities almost nonexistent. ""The possibility of organized and comprehensive disruption and irregularities in this election is almost close to zero given the composition of the people who are holding the election,"" Mottaki said. On the other hand, Iran's influential parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, implicated the same people -- the Guardian Council -- of siding with one candidate. ""Although the Guardian Council is made up of religious individuals, I wish certain members would not side with a certain presidential candidate,"" Larijani told the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting on Saturday, without naming whom he meant. The comments were reported on Press TV and on another news Web site, Khabaronline, Sunday. Larijani's statement was in direct contrast to that of Khamenei, who in a sermon Friday declared the elections a ""definitive victory"" for Ahmadinejad and rejected charges of vote rigging. ""A majority of people are of an opinion separate"" from that of a minority, Larijani said. While Larijani and Ahmadinejad have had a tense relationship in the past, Larijani is seen as being aligned with Khamenei. For him to directly contradict the leader's statement amounts to another example of the growing disagreement among ruling conservatives. Meanwhile, former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in an open letter posted on his Web site, said, ""the presence of the people is one of the achievements of the revolution and must be respected."" ""Sensational and insulting propaganda against the people, who have always acted independently, and insinuating that their healthy movement is directed by foreigners is itself a sign of the implementation of faulty policies which will widen the gap between the people and the government,"" Khatami wrote. The election and the subsequent clashes in Iran were the subject of protests in some U.S. cities Sunday.  See photos of some of the protests in the U.S. » . In Washington, roughly 400 Iranian-Americans gathered in front of the Iranian Interests Section on Sunday to protest the disputed election. The protesters, dressed in the colors of the Iranian flag, waved signs and chanted slogans such as, ""Down with the dictator,"" ""Democracy for Iran,"" and ""Where's my vote?"" Some carried signs with images of injured and bleeding Iranian protesters. Protests also were held in Los Angeles and New York.","NEW: Iran's Press TV: Council acknowledges excessive balloting in 50 cities .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Spain's northern Basque region, killing a police officer inside the vehicle, officials said. Police investigate the vehicle destroyed by a car bomb in Spain's Basque region. Spain's Prime Minister blamed the attack on the Basque separatist group ETA, although there was no warning call before the explosion, as often happens in ETA attacks. The car exploded at 9:05 a.m. (3:05 a.m. ET) in an open-air parking lot in the Basque town of Arrigorriaga and damaged five other cars. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, and police moved in to investigate. The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez. ""ETA showed us the road to pain,"" Lopez said on national TV. ""We will show them the road to prison."" The officer was a senior figure in the fight against ETA and the explosion was caused by a limpet bomb placed underneath the car, officials told CNN partner station CNN+. A limpet bomb is one that is stuck to the underside of vehicle. Arrigorriaga is about 30 miles south of the largest Basque city of Bilbao. ETA's last fatal victim was a businessman who was shot dead in the same region last December. ""My stance to stop ETA is unbreakable, so that people in the Basque country and Spain can live in peace, to halt this barbarity,"" said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, after the attack. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than four decades of fighting for Basque independence. The European Union and the United States list it as a terrorist group. ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years. He has also vowed to stop the group. There are about 600 ETA members or suspected members in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in both countries have told CNN.","Car bomb explodes in northern Spanish city of Arrigorriaga .

"(CNN) -- A jury Friday acquitted W.R. Grace & Company and three of its former executives of having knowingly exposed mine workers and residents of Libby, Montana, to asbestos. The W.R. Grace plant in Libby, Montana, in an undated photograph. ""We at Grace are gratified by today's verdict and thank the men and women of the jury who were open to hearing the facts,"" said Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO of the company in a written statement. ""We always believed that Grace and its former executives had acted properly and that a jury would come to the same conclusion when confronted with the evidence."" Festa said that during the time Grace owned and operated a vermiculite mine in Libby, ""the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day."" The jury began deliberating Thursday and returned its verdict Friday morning. The Department of Justice's response to the verdict, which came after a three-month trial, was measured. ""The jury has spoken, and we thank them for their service,"" said a written statement issued by the office of public affairs. ""We are refraining from further comment at this juncture because one individual awaits trial in connection with this case."" Prosecutors plan to try another executive separately. Asked if the Justice Department plans to appeal, department spokesman Andrew Ames said, ""I wouldn't want to comment on that."" Federal prosecutors had accused the mining company and its executives of exposing Libby's 100,000 residents to asbestos for decades, resulting in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 illnesses. The product covered patches of grass, dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of residents' daily lives. ""There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime,"" said David Uhlmann in an April  interview. He helped spearhead the case when he was the Justice Department's top prosecutor of environmental crimes before stepping down in 2007. During the trial, those who lost loved ones testified at the federal courthouse in Missoula, about 130 miles southeast of Libby, that residents had been kept in the dark about the dangers. Until 1990, W.R. Grace & Company operated a mine in Libby that produced vermiculite, a substance used in all sorts of products, from insulation to fertilizers. The vermiculite was contaminated with tremolite asbestos -- linked to numerous illnesses including mesothelioma, a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart. The government's indictment alleged that W.R. Grace conspired to ""knowingly release"" the asbestos. It said the company tried to hide the dangers from employees and residents, leaving them ""in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury."" ""It was a purpose of the conspiracy to conceal and misrepresent the hazardous nature of the tremolite asbestos contaminated vermiculite, thereby enriching defendants and others,"" the indictment read. The indictment also said W.R. Grace tried to ""defraud the United States and others by impairing, impeding, and frustrating"" the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies once they launched an investigation in 1999. The 10-count indictment included charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Had it been convicted, the company could have faced criminal fines of up to $280 million, which is twice the value of its profits from the mine. Grace executives, who were named as defendants, could have faced prison time. The company did not deny that asbestos emanated from its plant. Nor did it question that some people had been sickened and killed, though a definitive number of deaths linked to the vermiculite plant probably will never be known. But W.R. Grace denied any kind of conspiracy. In fact, the company said, it acted responsibly and took appropriate steps. It said it had voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents. In the courtroom, defense attorneys noted that the asbestos problem dates back to about 1920, long before W.R. Grace took over the mine in 1963. The attorneys said that, as information about the asbestos came to light, the company took numerous steps to mitigate the dangers and were open about it. Defense attorney David Bernick said he was not surprised by the verdict. ""The evidence showed that what was going on internally with the company was anything but conspiratorial,"" he told said. ""It was responsible."" However, some townspeople did not share Bernick's view. ""I don't see how they could have gotten out of it,"" said Steven Schnetter, who worked at the mine for 17 years until it closed in 1990. Shortly afterward, Schnetter was diagnosed with asbestosis, a lung disease caused by exposure to asbestos fibers. The 60-year-old retiree said he told his managers in the late 1980s that he was concerned to find that tremolite is a form of asbestos. ""They said, 'Oh, yeah, but it's the short-fiber type that won't hurt you,'"" he said. Schnetter settled with the company for a ""small amount,"" he told CNN Friday in a telephone interview. When asked about his frequent coughing, he said, ""I do that all the time. ... My lungs won't expand right.""","Jury acquits W.R. Grace, three former execs in asbestos exposure case .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of the ongoing culture wars, can it be a good idea to put out a comedy about two Stone Age men who wander into the Bible? In ""Year One,"" Jack Black stars as an inquisitive Stone Age man, with Michael Cera as his sidekick. Harold Ramis thinks so. ""Year One,"" which he directed, concerns two men -- played by Jack Black and Michael Cera -- who leave their home and, in their travels, meet biblical characters such as Cain, Abel, Abraham and Isaac. Among the locales: ancient Sodom, which ""didn't seem worse than Las Vegas to me,"" Ramis told CNN. ""Year One"" comes out Friday. Ramis, whose writing and directing credits include ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Analyze This,"" said it was time for a new biblical epic -- of sorts. ""No one had done this film for our generation,"" he told CNN. It's like, you know, when 'Animal House' [which Ramis co-wrote] came out, there were college films. Every generation had college films, but our generation didn't have one yet, and I don't know that our generation - this young, new generation of kids has a, you know, a sandal epic yet, and this is the one. This is for them."" Ramis rounded up a cast of comedians familiar to any watcher of Judd Apatow-produced movies -- no surprise, since Apatow is a producer of ""Year One."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Superbad""), Horatio Sanz (""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Step Brothers"") and Bill Hader (""Tropic Thunder"") all have parts. ""A lot of them were new to me,"" said Ramis. ""[But] Jack knew them, Michael knew them, they were connected -- all connected through Judd Apatow, through 'Saturday Night Live' ... the comedy world is a club."" Black joked that everyone's a member of a secret society, requiring retinal scans, that meets ""inside the O of the Hollywood sign -- the first O,"" he noted.. ""All the projects are laid out on a table,"" he said. ""And we talk generally about how we're gonna take over the planet, take over the comedy and keep a vise grip on it."" Black said he revels in the chance to find the humor in the Bible. ""That was the fun of this thing,"" he said. ""It's like, we are going to have some fun with the Bible; you don't see it very often. It hasn't really been done since Monty Python days. 'Life of Brian.' "" However, the film could get more than it asked for. Films poking fun at the Bible -- or, indeed, treating the Bible with anything less than reverence -- have been the subject of protests and criticism. ""Life of Brian,"" the Python troupe's 1979 comedy about an assumed messiah that parodied the story of Jesus, was protested by clergy in the U.S. and banned outright in Ireland. French protesters threw Molotov cocktails into a Paris theater showing ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" Martin Scorsese's 1988 film version of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel. More recently, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" though a huge financial success, was criticized by some observers for alleged anti-Semitism, as well as its violence. Ramis, who observed that a number of biblical films focus on the New Testament, said he deliberately chose to make the Old Testament his subject. ""I told people that I wanted to do for the Old Testament what Monty Python did for the Gospels,"" he said. ""Which is just to kind of take a funny look and project a contemporary sensibility back to these treasured myths of Western civilization. ""It wasn't so much to attack any particular religion,"" he added. ""I figure all religions are good. They all make sense on paper; it's just the exploitation of religion that's been a problem, by ... people using religion to justify war, or to justify government or, you know, 'God made me do it.' "" Ramis said one of his intentions with ""Year One,"" which he co-wrote with ""Office"" writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, was to focus on people, not God. Paraphrasing the liberal clergyman and activist William Sloane Coffin, he said, God's not the event itself, but ""God's in our reaction to the event."" ""I wanted to do a film that kind of addressed these fundamental beliefs and urged people to take personal responsibility, no matter what they believe God is or isn't,"" Ramis said. ""It's still up to us in the final analysis."" Which is not to say that the film skimps on its comedy -- and with Ramis, Black, Cera, Hank Azaria, David Cross and producer Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Superbad"") around, there's no shortage of jokes. ""It's really just a good, dumb, broad comedy,"" Ramis told Entertainment Weekly. Improvisation often played a role, said Cera and Black. ""We weren't locked to anything,"" Cera said. ""It was a very honest set. If something wasn't working then we would address it."" ""We got a lot of different options [from observers], and they were able to play with different options in the editing room. I thought it was a cool way to do it,"" said Black. ""I've never done a movie like that -- and now I wanna do that on all my movies."" iReport.com: Seen ""Year One""? Share your review . The handful of early reviews have been positive, and Ramis is pleased with the result. He's particularly happy the film was received warmly in the Sodom shooting location -- Sibley, located in northwest Louisiana, in the heart of the Bible Belt. ""It's funny, because Southern people living in the heart of the Bible belt, there's a Baptist church every 150 feet in that area, and here we are in Sodom, in the city of Sodom,"" he said. ""And they just got into it, they enjoyed it so much.""","""Year One"" stars Jack Black and Michael Cera as Stone Age men in Bible .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Smoking in youth-rated movies has not declined despite a pledge two years ago by Hollywood studios to encourage producers to show less ""gratuitous smoking,"" according to an anti-smoking group. The American Medical Association Alliance has been trying to get movie studios to make smoking-free films. The American Medical Association Alliance, pointing to research that big-screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit, called for an R rating for any movie with smoking scenes. The head of the group that gives U.S. movies their ratings, however, said the smoke has been clearing from youth-rated movies, a result of the film industry's sensitivity to the issue. The alliance, the medical association's advocacy arm, launched a summer campaign this week aimed at publicly shaming studios into making smoke-free films. ""Research has shown that one-third to one-half of all young smokers in the United States can be attributed to smoking these youth see in movies,"" said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, head of the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. Fielding cited another study that he said ""found that adolescents whose favorite movie stars smoked on screen are significantly more likely to be smokers themselves and to have a more accepting attitude toward smoking."" The Motion Picture Association of America, the industry group that issues ratings and parental guidance for U.S. films, added smoking scenes as a factor in ratings two years ago, but Fielding said it has not made a difference. ""In all, 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between May 2007 and May 2009 were youth-rated films -- G, PG or PG-13,"" he said. Joan Graves, who chairs the Motion Picture Association's movie rating committee, offered her own statistics, based on all of the 900 films rated each year, not just the top movies included in Fielding's numbers. The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said. Overall, 55 percent of the  movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking, but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given R ratings, Graves said. Twenty-one percent were rated PG-13 and the remaining 5 percent were PG, she said. A G movie is deemed suitable for all audiences, while a PG rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children. PG-13 indicates a stronger warning that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. No one under 17 can be admitted to see an R movie without a parent or guardian. American Medical Association Alliance President Sandi Frost used as her chief example of a movie with ""gratuitous smoking"" this month's blockbuster ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which was rated PG-13 ""for intense sequences of action and violence, and some partial nudity."" ""Millions of children have been exposed to the main star of the film, Hugh Jackman, with a cigar in his mouth in various scenes,"" Frost said. ""I'm willing to bet that not one child would have enjoyed that movie or Mr. Jackman's performance any less if he hadn't been smoking."" A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes. In one scene, the cigar is shot out of his mouth, prompting Jackman's Wolverine character to suggest its loss would lead to clean living -- an anti-smoking statement -- the studio spokesman said. He said that while the Wolverine character has a cigar in his mouth in almost every panel of the comic book series, producers made ""a conscious decision"" to limit the cigar in the movie. The American Medical Association Alliance, hoping to draw studio executives' attention, hired a mobile billboard to drive around the major studios this week. ""The billboard shows a teenage girl asking the question, 'Which movie studios will cause me to smoke this summer?' "" Frost said. The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count ""how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences,"" she said. ""At the end of the summer, whichever studio has delivered the most tobacco impressions to youth audiences will be named in a billboard that will run outside of their headquarters,"" she said. Motion Picture Association of America spokeswoman Angela Martinez said the group ""is very sensitive to the concerns of parents about the purpose of the rating systems."" ""It's reflective of society,"" Martinez said. ""It's really a tool for parents to help determine what their kids see."" They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as ""a reflection of changes in society and health concerns,"" she said. ""Smoking is rated like all the other factors, including violence and sex,"" she said. Fielding said it should be absolute -- and not just a factor. ""Any movie with smoking should be rated R,"" he said. ""And if they worry about an R rating hurting their profits, then they should work with studios to remove smoking from films that hurt youth."" Graves, whose committee makes the decisions, indicated such a zero-tolerance policy would not be accepted.","American Medical Association Alliance wants films with smoking to be rated R .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Hugh Masekela is the legendary South African musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid. He tells CNN about growing up under apartheid, why he left South Africa and what is was like to move back to Johannesburg after 30 years away. Hugh Masekela: ""The people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom."" CNN: How did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art? Hugh Masekela: I don't think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance. We have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing. But in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song. I think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance. We grew up in rallies and in the street. We didn't have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening. Watch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg ». CNN: What's your earliest memory of Johannesburg? HM: I came to Jo' burg from Springs [a town near Johannesburg]. My family moved to Alexandra township and the first time I went to town alone I must have been 10 or 11. Jo' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle. I remember that because I came from Alexander township where there were no lights, no sewage and no cafes. The most vivid memory I have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food, and we'd say ""what do you think that is?"" and ""there are so many types of food!"" CNN: How did it feel to leave South Africa? HM: When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in South Africa. I wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught Miles Davis and Clifford Brown and Chad Baker and they were not in South Africa. I hoped that one day I could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach. It was a rough time, when the apartheid government first started showing that if you don't behave, they'll shoot you -- women and children too. You saw police with guns, with machine guns, and for the first time you saw tanks. We had a group called the Jazz Epistles and we were about to take off on a national tour. We were the first African group to play on an LP, but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we couldn't do our tour. But four years later, when I was ready to come back to South Africa, I couldn't. The place was impenetrable. By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to. See Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg » . CNN: Tell us about coming home. HM: It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa and we were not naive about it. It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening. When I left South Africa there were 10 million people -- when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways. And I had to adjust my language because people would say ""we don't' talk like that anymore!"" I was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things. Not many people came back from exile compared with those who left. About a million left -- 50,000 came back, and of those about 25,000 did a U-turn because it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy but it's been a great experience. CNN: How would you define the culture of Jo' burg? HM: There's no one culture -- it's a cosmopolitan city. It's so diverse, like South Africa itself has so many diverse cultures. But again, we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping. If we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance, it would be the shining path. CNN: Where do you like to go out in Jo' burg? HM: I go to Newtown, I go to the Market Theater a lot, and also to the Dance Forum, because we have very brilliant dance choreographers. Old Jo' burg was vibrant, there were things going on all the time -- concerts, festivals, clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night. CNN: What is life like in the city? HM: It's not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time. There's a sadness about this city that everybody talks about. People in South Africa have become inward; they spend most of the time in their homes. When it gets dark, everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can. That is not only Jo' burg's problem, it is a national problem. What we're talking about doesn't make me very popular with the people who run this country, but it's nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day. It has to be fixed, because the people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say ""this is my country.""","Hugh Masekela songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid .

"(CNN) -- In the pre-dawn darkness Saturday, long after her parents and brother were asleep, Atefeh Yazdi lay in bed cradling the house phone and her cell phone in her hands. Atefeh Yazdi visits with her grandfather, Dr. Ebrahim Yazdi, during his trip to America last year. The only light was from a television tuned to the latest news from Iran, and her laptop displaying her Facebook page in hope of any updates on what was happening halfway around the world. ""I kind of felt I was more there when I couldn't see the rest of the room, just the TV and the Facebook,"" the 28-year-old Iranian-American told CNN by telephone from her home in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Repeated calls to relatives in Tehran only got the ""annoying"" Farsi-language error message. She recounted the thoughts running through her brain all night: ""Are they going to really shoot people? What's going to happen? Is this going to turn into massive killing and violence?"" In Houston, Texas, Reza Soltani said the anxiety of waiting and wondering was like endless pacing at a hospital during a loved one's operation. ""It feels like the operation started last week and it hasn't ended,"" Soltani, 28, told CNN by telephone. ""I'm worried. I'm hoping it will be good but I'm worried it will get very ugly."" The jumble of emotions -- fear, hope, anxiety, frustration -- were reality for millions of Iranian-Americans trying to find out if Iranian authorities would crush protests over last week's election. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming victor in voting that opposition groups called rigged. No independent monitors were permitted for the election. A threatening statement Friday by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei increased fears of bloodshed. Iranian authorities have cut off traditional communications such as cell phone connections, and also banned foreign news outlets from covering the protests. Thousands of protesters took to the streets Saturday, even though the demonstrations were banned and police confronted them with clubs, tear gas and water cannons. The uncertainty and unrest strikes close to home for Yazdi, whose grandfather -- a longtime politician in Iran -- was arrested from his hospital bed this week. He's been returned to the hospital, she said, but she doesn't know if he'll be arrested again or what will happen to other relatives. ""It's very exhausting,"" Yazdi said. ""I have this feeling I want to be there. I want to book the next flight. I want to be with the people. I don't care about the risks involved."" Her parents, who left Iran in the 1970s before the Islamic Revolution, say such talk is foolish, she said. They are as worried as she is, but fear returning now would bring too much risk. ""There's a generation gap, a culture gap,"" she explained. It runs deep, defining her life as an American-born citizen of both Iran and the United States, who refers to Iranians as ""my people."" ""Being born and raised in America, where I was able to voice my opinion, do what I want, say what I wanted, I'm culturally confused,"" Yazdi said. ""I'm not completely American the right way, and I'm not completely Iranian the right way."" Soltani also mentioned the generation gap among Iranian-Americans, but he described it as more political. His parents' generation lost everything in the revolution, and will only consider returning when the revolutionary regime has been toppled, he said. Older Iranian-Americans in the United States ""actually boycotted the election, saying if you vote you're just legitimizing the government,"" Soltani said. ""We sacrificed everything for you guys, and now you're going to the other team,"" is how Soltani characterized their attitude. ""They think the system needs to go completely,"" he said. ""All they care is for the system to collapse. They think if the system collapses, they're going to be able to go back."" No matter what happens, Soltani and Yazdi said, Iran is changed forever by this week's events. ""I believe that anything that comes out of it will be positive,"" Soltani said. ""Even if they fail now, the people know if they get in the streets in millions, they're not going to be able to stop them.""","Pair describe fear and anxiety as they wait for news .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Eleven-year-old Hiroki Ando will likely die if he does not get a new heart. Hiroki in an ambulance on the way to catch his flight to New York, where he will wait for a heart. Hiroki suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart. The same disease killed his sister five years ago. ""We have two children in our family who got a disease that happens one out of every 100,000 people. I am sorry for my children. We are having my daughter and Hiroki going through this harsh experience,"" said father Ryuki Ando. ""We were told by his doctor at the end of last year that the heart transplant operation was the only way for him to survive,"" Ando said. But the law in Japan prohibits anyone under the age of 15 from donating organs -- meaning Hiroki can't get a new heart in his home country. According to the web site for Japan Transplant Network, a non-governmental group that supports changing Japan's transplant law, ""this stipulation has greatly reduced the possibility of transplants to small children; heart transplants to small children have become impossible.""  Watch Hiroki's trip to the United States » . Lawmaker Taro Kono is spearheading efforts to change the law, which was enacted in 1997. Japan's parliament is now debating four proposed amendments-- including one that would scrap the age limit. But, beyond the age matter, the issue of organ transplantation in general, has been a difficult one for the country because of perceptions of brain death. Some refuse to accept it if their loved ones' hearts are still beating. ""For a long time, it's the heart that mattered in Japan. Some religions ask us not to declare being brain dead as death. But that is not the majority,"" Kono said. ""So it is simply that we have been doing things this way and a lot of people are very skeptical about it."" Kono, who gave a kidney to his father, said a total of 81 organ transplants have been conducted in Japan since the transplant law was enacted in 1997, whereas nearly thousands of transplants occur in the United States each year. ""A lot of people in Japan waiting for a transplant, waiting for a liver, a heart, other organs, most of them just die simply because they couldn't get any organs,"" he said. Kono said he believes the public supports changing the law to allow organ donation from children, noting that ""when the parents of the child are going on the street asking for donations, they can actually raise more than a million dollars."" Incredibly, that's just what Hiroki's family has done. They started a group called ""helping Hiroki"" and raised $1.7 million in donations. ""It was very tough to get the donations, but so many people from all over Japan donated the money,"" he said. ""It was not only the money, but so many letters and messages to energize us, sent to the group. We realized there are so many people supporting us, and they are the reason that we made it this far and will be able to continue after going to the U.S."" Hiroki is now at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, awaiting a new heart. His father says he knows that the transplant issue is a difficult one for families. ""The honest wish from the recipient's side is to have a donor show up as soon as possible,"" he said, pausing. ""I still do not know whether I can make a decision to give my child's heart to someone else if I am faced with such a situation. But unless the people face the issue and think about it seriously, I do not think the time will come soon to see more people volunteering to donate organs."" Ando said he hopes that one day he will be able to play baseball with his son, who is an avid sports fan. ""I would like to have a fun time again with Hiroki. I would like to make it home with everyone in good health,"" he said. ""That's the biggest hope I have now."" Ando's mother wrote in a blog on her Web site (http://www.hirokikun.jp/) that Hiroki was high on the waiting list for a heart transplant in New York. ""I believe Hiroki will be all right,"" she wrote.","Hiroki Ando, 11, suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart .
He can't get heart in Japan because people under 15 not allowed to donate organs .
Hiroki's family raised $1.7 million in donations to send Hiroki to New York for surgery ."
"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- An Egyptian business tycoon and a former police officer have been found guilty of last July's slaying of a rising Lebanese pop singer. Suzanne Tamim was found dead in her Dubai apartment in July. The case, with its high-profile victim and defendant, has captivated Egypt and the region. A judge convicted and sentenced to death real estate mogul Hisham Talaat Moustafa and the former officer Muhsen el Sukkari on Thursday. Egypt's Grand Mufti -- the country's highest religious official -- will review the sentence and rule on June 25 if the men will be executed, the judge said. Because the two men were sentenced under Islamic law, it is widely expected that they would be hanged. Moustafa's lawyer told reporters outside the courtroom that he will appeal the conviction, saying there was ""a one million percent guarantee"" the sentence would be overturned. The singer, Suzanne Tamim, was found slain in her apartment in the United Arab Emirates. She had been stabbed and her throat slit. Prosecutors alleged that Moustafa, a parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid el Sukkari $2 million to kill Tamim. During the trial, Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer, but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it's not unusual for men -- such as Moustafa, a married father of three -- to take on additional wives. Prosecutors have said Tamim's death was a ""means of taking revenge,"" but have not elaborated. Moustafa and el Sukkari claim the prosecution's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by UAE authorities and should not be used against them. Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary tried the case in Cairo because the accused were arrested in Egypt. After his arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company. CNN's Raja Razek and Housam Ahmed contributed to this story.","Egyptian mogul and ex-police officer guilty of Lebanese singer's murder .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- The Arab world is among the worldwide audience that has been closely watching as events in Iran have unfolded over the past week. Protesters fight running battles with motorcycle-mounted militia members Saturday in Tehran. ""In all honesty, I am amazed by these Iranians,"" Egyptian human rights activist and blogger Walid Abbas posted on his Twitter page. ""I have no green t-shirt"" Abbas tweeted Saturday. He was referring to the color worn by many supporters of opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supposed failure to win last week's election sparked the wave of unrest that has gripped the nation. Watching the events unfolding in Iran on Twitter, Youtube and other social networks, the Egyptian activist said he is learning from the Iranian activists. He said he does not support Moussavi because he is part of the Mullah system. ""We are not with Moussavi,"" Abbas tweeted, ""We are with the Iranian people and their demands."" Taghlob Salah, a 24-year-old Iraqi student at Baghdad Law College, told CNN that the Iranian youths who make up most of the protesters can be inspiring to Iraqis, despite cultural differences.  See images of the clashes Saturday » . ""Despite the difference that we have with Iran and the fact that many Iraqis don't trust their Persian neighbor, we are still Muslims and at the end of the day that matters a lot,"" he said. ""We will look at this phase in Iranian history and learn, for sure and I can say that we will learn from them, 100 percent."" Iraq and Iran are culturally linked because their populations are predominantly Shiite Muslims, as opposed to Sunni Muslims who make up the majority of most Arab countries. Salah credited the Internet for giving everyone involved a chance to have their voices heard. ""There are so many Iraqi groups all over Facebook,"" he said. ""The world is evolving; we are developing our approach to our surroundings."" Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based pan-Arab newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, expressed dismay over the continued protests. He called on Moussavi to be ""responsible enough to protect his people and avoid bloodshed, instability and confrontation in his country that may rupture the Iranian internal unity spreading chaos throughout the region."" Atwan said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made it clear in his speech during Friday prayers that his patience had run out and he praised the supreme leader for having displayed ""leniency"" in his dealings with the protesters, but predicted that that leniency would not continue. iReport.com: Share images from Iran . Abd Rahman Rashed, editor of the Saudi-owned, London-based Arabic daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, expressed a different point of view. In an editorial published Saturday, Rashed directed comments to Arab supporters of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose landslide victory in last week's election is being challenged by Moussavi and his supporters. ""No matter what happens, Iran did technically change and will shift its course in a great way,"" Rashed wrote. ""It is over,"" he said. ""Iran the one system, the street and the agenda is over."" They may not understand Farsi or why some Iranians voted for Moussavi, Mehdi Karrubi or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but Arabs can surely relate to the passionate shouts of ""God is Great!"" And ""Down with the dictator"" in defiance of Iran's theocracy. Relations between Iran and Arab states have always been tense: through its proxies, Iran sometimes accuses some of the leading Arab states, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, of being subject to the whims of Western imperialism and of failing to confront America and its ally, Israel, in the region. Rashed credited Iranians for speaking with courage against their government's funding of controversial organizations like Hezbollah, Hamas and anti-government groups in Yemen and elsewhere. He said Iranians voted against the current system because they don't want the government to dedicate the country's budget to ally itself to such organizations instead of focusing on the average citizen. Some Arab states look to Iran as a regional superpower that can support them financially, militarily and politically in their confrontation with the international community. Those states include Syria and Sudan, which support organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah -- deemed terrorist organizations by the United States -- that are used as a proxy to challenge America and Israel in the region. Some Arab states have long warned that Shiite Iran wants to spread its power across the Sunni-dominated Arab world, causing more mistrust and friction between the Persian nation and the Arab world. Recently, Egypt and Morocco accused Iran of attempting to spread the Shiite faith among its Sunni population and creating Shiite converts and activists in their communities and in the rest of the Arab world -- a charge that Iran has denied.","Arab world has closely watched as events in Iran have unfolded over past week .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book, ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" will be published next month. Bob Greene recalls a radio exec who was ahead of his time by working an almost endless day. (CNN) -- I think perhaps the oddest person I have ever known was a man by the name of Robert Hyland. But the truly odd thing is that we all seem to have turned into him. Hyland was the vice president and general manager of KMOX radio, the 50,000-watt powerhouse in St. Louis, Missouri. He came to work every day at 2:30. In the morning. That's right: Hyland would show up at his office at 2:30 a.m. each day. He would then work straight through until 5 p.m. He didn't do this once in a while; he did it each and every day. He didn't do it to set an example for his employees. He did it because he couldn't seem to stop working. ""I'm not one of those people who need sleep to be refreshed,"" Hyland told me once. ""I'll go to bed between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., and I'll wake up at 1:30 a.m. I have an alarm clock, but I never set it. I wake up automatically. I shower and shave, and I'm at the office by 2:30."" I asked him if this schedule made any sense at all. ""It's a good time to get a lot of work done,"" he told me. ""The phone isn't ringing, and there are no distractions. I have a pile of paperwork on my desk, and I go through it."" At 9 a.m., he said -- after he had been at work for 6½ hours -- the other people at the office would show up. And he would keep going. Hyland may have seemed eccentric -- he readily understood that perception; he said to me: ""I think what you're thinking is that you're talking to a nut"" -- but if he had lived a little longer (he died of cancer in 1992 at the age of 71), he would have witnessed something that might have astonished even him: . The rest of the world joined him in his obsession. Hyland died just before the era in which everyone began using cell phones and staring at home computer screens. Society might never have been ready to do what he did -- come to the office in the middle of the night and routinely work 14½ hour days -- had the technology revolution not come along. But come along it did -- and with it came the erasure of all the boundaries that at one time separated the workday from leisure time. E-mails and text messages and BlackBerrys and all their digital cousins may have given us the illusion of freedom -- we tell ourselves that we are unfettered by traditional offices, that we can go anywhere we please -- yet in the end they have created a nation of Robert Hylands. We're never off the clock; that cell phone may ring at dinnertime, that allegedly urgent e-mail may arrive at 11 p.m., that instant message from the regional manager may pop onto the screen when we're on vacation with our families. And what do we do? If your answer is, ""We ignore them,"" good for you. But the truth is, mostly we don't ignore them -- mostly we snap to attention. Ask yourself this: What do you think would happen to an employee who received an e-mail at home from his boss at 8 o'clock on a Tuesday night, and who responded to the e-mail by writing back: . ""I'm sorry, but I'm only available for work-related e-mails during office hours. If you'd like to communicate with me about this matter, please feel free to do so tomorrow after 9 a.m."" That might be the rational answer. But how many people -- especially in this economy, and in this job market -- do you think would dare to do that? And it's not just when we're working for our bosses -- it's when we're purportedly doing things for ourselves. Try to picture your father's or grandfather's reaction if in, say, 1958, he had been trying to make an airplane reservation and he had been told by the airline: . ""We'd like you to purchase a computer and set it up inside your house. You pay for it; you also pay for the electricity to run it. Now, we'd like you to buy a printing machine -- you pay for that, and you pay for the ink inside it, and you pay for the paper that feeds into it. Now, we'd like you to use the computer you've paid for to do the work of reservation agents, so we don't have to hire as many of them. Got it? Now, use that computer, make your own reservations, and print out your own ticket. On your own time."" Had your dad or granddad been told that, half a century ago, he might have thought he was having a nightmare. But we're grateful for it; we tell ourselves this is progress. If we log on at the moment the seat-selection process opens up, and we manage, by playing airline-roulette on our keyboard, to get ourselves an aisle seat, we feel triumphant. We barely stop to consider that we're working for the very airline company to which we're paying our money. Robert Hyland said he would feel funny not working all those hours -- he even did it on Saturdays; on the sixth workday of his week he would come in, as usual, at 2:30 a.m. ""I just don't think that most people have the commitment to their jobs that I do,"" he told me. If only he had lived to see 2009. He would have been just a face in the crowd -- just another American to whom the notion of quitting time has lost all meaning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: I once knew radio exec who started work at 2:30 a.m.
He says Americans now accept that they are always on call for work .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Chevron Corp. CEO David O'Reilly says Big Oil is not to blame for skyrocketing gas prices. Chevron Corp. CEO David O'Reilly says world demand for crude oil has been growing, which is affecting gas prices. In an interview Tuesday with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" O'Reilly said high demand and a short supply of crude oil were key factors causing gas prices to spike. Despite reports of record profits among major oil companies, O'Reilly downplayed a recent poll in which Americans said corporate avarice played a role. O'Reilly also discussed President Bush's and GOP presumptive presidential nominee Sen. John McCain's proposal to lift the ban on new offshore drilling as well as presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama's call for taxing companies' windfall profits. The following is an edited version of the show's transcript: . Blitzer: You know you have -- you and ExxonMobil, the Big Oil companies --have a huge public relations problem. In all the recent polls, when the American public is asked, who do you blame for these huge gas prices at the pump, they -- more than any other single source -- they blame Big Oil. They blame you. What's going on?  Watch Blitzer grill O'Reilly » . O'Reilly: Well, I don't think they blame us as much as you think. It looks to me like there's a lot of blame to go around. Blitzer: There's other blame, but more than any other single source, they blame Big Oil. O'Reilly: It depends on the poll you look at. Blitzer: The recent Gallup Poll. O'Reilly: Let me point out what we're trying to do about this because I think the issue here is one of supply. And prices are high today, but it's fundamentally a concern about oil supplies -- 75 percent of the price of gasoline is related to crude oil. We're very dependent on crude oil imports. The total world demand for crude oil has been growing steadily over the last decade. And that is affecting everybody's price. So it is a concern, but we need to work on the supply side, as well as the demand side, to bring change. Blitzer: Because you have had record profits, right? O'Reilly: We're investing those record profits. Blitzer: But billions and billions of dollars in profits, more than ever before. O'Reilly: Yes, but it's a big business. And on a return-on-sales business, we're right in there with the average of American business today. What we're doing is investing that money. For example, last year, we did make a lot of money, $18.7 billion. This year, our capital investment in new supplies is $22.9 billion, almost $23 billion. Blitzer: You know that Barack Obama says if he's president, he wants a windfall profits tax. He wants to take a chunk of your profits right now and give it back to the American people. John McCain opposes that, as you know. So I assume you would like to see John McCain elected president?  Watch McCain explain his stance » . O'Reilly: Well, I would like to see no windfall profit tax. And I will tell you why. First of all, we are already heavily taxed as an industry. Our tax rates last year were at 45 percent, compared with in the 30s for the average of all industry. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we're investing the money. If you take the money away, it will reduce investment, reduce supply and have exactly the opposite effect of helping the problem that you have referred to. And, thirdly, we have done it before. We have had windfall profit taxes. Congress has studied them about 30 years ago. And what happened under those circumstances is supplies dropped domestically, and we became even more dependent on imported oil. You don't want to do that today. Blitzer: Here's how Sen. Obama put it. Listen to this. Obama (in a video clip): Sen. McCain wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to Big Oil and opposes a windfall profits tax on oil companies like Exxon to help families struggling with high energy costs. I think that is exactly why we need to change Washington. Blitzer: So, I guess, given the stark difference when it comes to Big Oil between Obama and McCain -- let me rephrase the question -- do you want McCain to be elected? O'Reilly: I want someone to be elected who will help resolve our energy crisis. And I don't know enough about Sen. Obama's position or Sen. McCain's position to pass judgment on either one of them. What I do know, though, is that if we want to solve this problem of high energy prices, we're going to have to work not only in the demand side, as Congress has done with [Corporate Average Fuel Economy] standards and alternatives, but we're going to have to work on the supply as well. Blitzer: Do you want offshore drilling to be approved on both coasts and in the Gulf, which Sen. McCain now says is a good idea? O'Reilly: I do think that's a good idea. Today, our shores, except for the gulf off Texas and Mississippi and so forth, are off-limits today. So, look, Europeans who are very environmentally conscious -- the British, the Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch -- they can allow sensible offshore production from their oceans. Why can't we?  See where drilling is allowed, banned » . Since we have -- over the last 20 years, domestic production has steadily declined -- and we have been more and more dependent on imports. We definitely need to do something about it. We don't know yet how much oil is under there, but we should at least be given the opportunity to look. Blitzer: We invited our viewers to ask you a question, and some of the I-Reports came in. iReport.com: See what iReporters are saying about gas prices . Unidentified male (in a video clip): If you would had told me a year ago that gas prices were going to reach about $4 a gallon, I wouldn't have doubted you. And if you had told me the year before that that they would reach $3 a gallon, I still wouldn't have doubted you. So what should Americans expect in terms of pricing of gas in the future? Blitzer: What do you think? O'Reilly: Very good question. I mean, $4 gasoline is a reality today because ... Blitzer: In some parts of the country, it's approaching $5. O'Reilly: Well, 75 percent of that is the price of crude oil. And that is the crude oil that we have been talking about here that's driving the current crude oil -- energy market. Blitzer: So, how high is it going to go? O'Reilly: Well, if crude oil prices come down, I think those prices could moderate. But it's a big if. Crude oil prices have to come down. We need to send a very strong signal to the market that we're serious about increasing supplies in this country. Blitzer: Do you think manipulators, stock manipulators, are paying -- are doing things to cause this spiral? O'Reilly: I don't know enough about the financial markets. We're a physical player. But I think most of the price that we see today is because of concern about physical long-term supply. Blitzer: Just because of the huge demand in India and China, also? O'Reilly: Huge demand around the globe, including here in the United States. Blitzer: Here's another question. Unidentified male (in a video clip): Have we reached peak oil supply? And, if not, when do you expect that we will? And, once we do, when do you expect that the prices of gas will go down to a reasonable level? O'Reilly: You know, peak oil is a big question today, and it's a very good question. One of the issues that we face has been addressed -- around people -- has been addressed to the National Petroleum Council study, which was issued last year by the secretary of energy. It is a very important study. What it really says is, there's enough oil and gas in the ground, but the access is what's impeding production. So, we could have a squeeze in the years ahead if we don't get after increasing our supplies, not only here in the U.S., but creating a global environment which permits access around the globe and free trade around the globe as far as oil is concerned.","Chevron CEO says his company is investing windfall profits in supplies .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Health and Human Services' acting secretary has appointed Dr. Richard Besser as the interim director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. William Gimson will  return to his position as the CDC's chief operating officer. He replaces William Gimson, who took over as interim CDC director at noon on January 20. Gimson notified CDC employees that HHS acting secretary Charles E. Johnson had announced the appointment. Gimson replaced Dr. Julie Gerberding, who was the head of the CDC from 2002 until two days ago. Gerberding, along with other senior officials, also resigned on January 20, when Barack Obama and his administration took over. Past HHS secretary Michael Leavitt said that the interim directors would take over until the next HHS nominee -- former Sen. Tom Daschle -- is confirmed and makes the permanent appointments. Gimson told employees he's returning to his post as the CDC's chief operating officer. The CDC usually has a physician as its director, which Gimson is not. According to the biography posted on the CDC Web site, Besser's last position at the CDC was as the director of the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, where he was responsible for public health emergency preparedness and emergency response activities. According to CDC sources, Besser was seeing patients when he learned of his new position. In addition to heading the CDC bioterrorism preparedness division, he is a practicing pediatrician.","Dr. Richard Besser has been designated acting director of the CDC .

"(CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour ""will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament."" Scott added: ""The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking."" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is ""very, very disappointed"" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. ""They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,"" Peer said from Tel Aviv. ""So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair."" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: ""Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. ""Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer."" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. ""At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,"" Scott said. ""They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,"" Scott said. ""I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.""  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, ""The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through."" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, ""We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament."" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. ""'All the players support Shahar,"" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, ""We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis."" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. ""I don't think it should happen,"" she said. ""I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Steve Bierfeldt says the Transportation Security Administration pulled him aside for extra questioning in March. He was carrying a pocket edition of the U.S. Constitution and an iPhone capable of making audio recordings. And he used them. Steve Bierfeldt is accusing the Transportation Security Administration of ""harassing interrogation."" On a recording a TSA agent can be heard berating Bierfeldt. One sample: ""You want to play smartass, and I'm not going to play your f**king game."" Bierfeldt is director of development for the Campaign for Liberty, an outgrowth of the Ron Paul presidential campaign. He was returning from a regional conference March 29 when TSA screeners at Lambert-St. Louis (Missouri) International Airport saw a metal cash box in his carry-on bag. Inside was more than $4,700 dollars in cash -- proceeds from the sale of political merchandise like T-shirts and books. There are no restrictions on carrying large sums of cash on flights within the United States, but the TSA allegedly took Bierfeldt to a windowless room and, along with other law enforcement agencies, questioned him for almost half an hour about the money. The American Civil Liberties Union has taken up Bierfeldt's cause and is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, whose department includes the TSA. Their complaint alleges that Bierfeldt was ""subjected to harassing interrogation, and unlawfully detained."" Larry Schwartztol of the ACLU said the TSA is suffering from mission creep. ""We think what happened to Mr. Bierfeldt is a reflection that TSA believes passenger screening is an opportunity to engage in freewheeling law enforcement investigations that have no link to flight safety,"" he said. Schwartztol believes many other passengers have been subjected to the same kind of treatment, which he claims violates constitutional protections against unlawful searches. The TSA wouldn't comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement that the movement of large amounts of cash through a checkpoint may be investigated ""if suspicious activity is suspected."" Unbeknownst to the TSA agents, Bierfieldt had activated the record application on his phone and slipped it into his pocket. It captured the entire conversation. An excerpt: . Officer: Why do you have this money? That's the question, that's the major question. Bierfeldt: Yes, sir, and I'm asking whether I'm legally required to answer that question. Officer: Answer that question first, why do you have this money. Bierfeldt: Am I legally required to answer that question? Officer: So you refuse to answer that question? Bierfeldt: No, sir, I am not refusing. Officer: Well, you're not answering. Bierfeldt: I'm simply asking my rights under the law. The officers can be heard saying they will involve the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and appear to threaten arrest, saying they are going to transport Bierfeldt to the local police station, in handcuffs if necessary. Bierfeldt told CNN he believes their behavior was inappropriate. ""You're in a locked room with no windows. You've got TSA agent. You've got police officers with loaded guns. They're in your face. A few of them were swearing at me."" But the officers did not follow through on their threats. Near the end of the recording an additional officer enters the situation and realizes the origins of the money. Officer: So these are campaign contributions for Ron Paul? Bierfeldt: Yes, sir. Officer: You're free to go. According to the TSA, ""Passengers are required to cooperate with the screening process. Cooperation may involve answering questions about their property.

"(CNN) -- A white tiger mauled a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park Wednesday as a group of tourists watched in horror, police say. The zookeeper at Zion Wildlife Gardens in New Zealand could not be saved by other staff. The attack took place at the Zion Wildlife Gardens near Whangarei, about three hours north of Auckland. Two zookeepers had gone in to clean an enclosure at the park, when one of two white tigers inside lunged at a keeper, said Sarah Kennett, spokeswoman for Northland Police. The second keeper and other zoo staff tried to pull the tiger off the man but failed. He died shortly after, Kennett said. The tiger was put down, the park said.  Watch park officials, visitors react » . A group of eight tourists who were on a guided tour of the park witnessed the Wednesday morning attack, Kennett said. ""This is an incredibly sad day,"" the park said in a statement, adding that it would provide counseling to its employees. The Zion Wildlife Gardens is home to several endangered tigers and lions. It is best known in New Zealand as the setting for the popular television series ""Lion Man."" In February, an employee needed surgery after he was attacked by a white tiger, according to local media reports. Last year, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry released documents to CNN affiliate TVNZ that said animals at the park were kept in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Inspectors were so concerned about the conditions that they considered having 40 cats put down, the documents said.","White tiger mauls a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park .

"Only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their employer-sponsored health insurance through the safety-net program COBRA, most likely because the premiums are too expensive, according to an analysis released Friday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that supports independent research on health care issues. Only about one in 10 workers who lose their job opt to keep their insurance through the COBRA program. Experts worry that the highest unemployment rate in 16 years, combined with a health care system dependent on employer-sponsored health insurance, is a recipe for disaster, and will swell the ranks of the uninsured particularly if people aren't using COBRA. About 46 million people in the United States (18 percent of those under 65) lacked health insurance in 2007. Health.com: Laid off? The healthiest ways to spend your time . The new report is based on a 2007 survey of 3,501 people. The researchers found that two-thirds of workers, if they were laid off, would be eligible for COBRA. Data from 2006 data suggest that only 9 percent would opt into the program. Health care insurance premiums have risen since then, so it's likely that the problem is getting worse not better, they say. ""The affordability issue gets worse every year, that's the big concern,"" says Meredith Rosenthal, PhD., an associate professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. ""Of course [some people can] still get an offer of coverage through a spouse, but we're still talking about very, very serious increases in the number of uninsured."" Health.com: Natural cold and flu remedies . COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) was passed in 1985 to allow laid-off workers to continue their health insurance if they lose their job. (COBRA only covers workers in companies that offer health insurance, have 20 or more employees, and are still in business.) But there's a catch. Most employers pick up 75 percent to 85 percent of the tab for their workers' health insurance, and once a person has been laid off, the entire bill falls on the ex-employee's shoulders. That means that health insurance costs dramatically escalate at a time when people have little or no money to burn. The Commonwealth Fund estimates that the cost of COBRA is four to six times higher than what people pay when they are employed; $4,704 per year for an individual and $12,680 for a family. Health.com: Live healthy for way less . Erin McCullar, 26, of Birmingham, Alabama, has type 1 diabetes and was laid off from her job as an interior designer in October. At the time, she didn't sign up for COBRA, a decision she now seriously regrets. Overwhelmed, she didn't realize she had a 60 days to sign up for the program and missed the deadline by a couple of days. ""On the day I got laid off I got a packet slapped in front of my face and that was it,"" she says. ""I was just totally in the dark."" She quickly found out that she couldn't get health insurance that would cover her type 1 diabetes, at least without a six-month or year-long waiting period, because it is considered a preexisting condition. She stockpiled a six-month supply of lifesaving insulin in the two-week period before she lost her job, but since then has scrimped on the drug to make it last longer. At one point, she even disconnected her pump, which delivers a continuous dose of insulin, for about three weeks. She used only a couple of insulin injections in that time to control high blood sugar, a potentially serious threat to her health. Even if she did sign up, she's not sure she could afford the premiums, which would have cost about $8,000 a year. Health.com: Healthy meals for under $10 . ""Ultimately, yes, I need it, but cost did factor into it,"" she says. ""I don't know that I would have been able to keep up my payments because I was barely able to keep up on my rent."" Cost is clearly a major issue for most laid-off workers, says Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. Only 3 percent of workers near the poverty level who are eligible for COBRA opt to keep their insurance, compared to 14 percent of workers who made more money before they lost their job. It's a problem that ""is not going away,"" says Davis, ""The Congressional Budget Office estimates that we're going to go to 8.3 percent unemployed in 2009 and 9 percent in 2010,"" says Davis. (The unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in December.) She notes that each percentage point increase in the unemployment rate leads to a 1.1 million increase in the number of uninsured. ""So it's pretty urgent that the economic stimulus bill not only address the job situation, but address health insurance coverage too,"" she says. While some laid-off workers may get health insurance coverage though a spouse or partner, their research suggests that only about 14 percent of people who are not eligible for COBRA could get coverage through a partner or some other source after losing their job, she says. Rosenthal and other experts hope that if there is a silver lining, it's that there may be more political will to change the current health care coverage system. ""One of the biggest challenges to health care coverage reform has been that the status quo is okay for many people, particularly for many people who vote,"" she says. ""If that is no longer true, and if the people who have coverage now are insecure enough, they may be willing to give up something to get coverage security."" McCullar just hopes she can get health insurance soon. ""It sounds just colossally stupid to not have heath insurance, but I luckily had enough vials and insulin so I'm not near running out now, but I have to get health insurance in the near future,"" she says. ""God forbid I had to go to the hospital during this; that would be a nightmare."" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNN) -- No one expected them to live long. A glass tree at the University of Miami commemorates those who died from complications of HIV/AIDS. Many of their peers succumbed to unusual infections by their first or second birthdays.  They were living on borrowed time, it seemed. While their friends' parents visited schools, these kids visited their parents' graves. When their classmates planned for the future, they often thought about death. But those babies who were born with HIV/AIDS in the 1980s have defied initial expectations. With advances in medicine, the babies born with what was once thought of as a sure-fatal virus have danced at their high school proms, walked on stage to receive their diplomas and even experienced the birth of their children. ""It's a battle -- not because the HIV is going to defeat us,"" said Quintara Lane, a 22-year-old student with long braids. ""It's more of what we have to go through to take care of ourselves."" Lane is part of a generation that was born with the virus. Since the mid-1990s in developed countries, antiretroviral drugs have largely prevented mothers from transmitting HIV/AIDS to their babies. A new kind of family . On a warm Florida Friday, boys in high-tops and loose jeans hanging from their thighs greet one another with a nod and then a slap on the hand. They tease relentlessly. Others pay little attention, listening to music blasting through their earbuds or texting so quickly that their thumbs appear a blur on pink, sparkly phones.  See more photos. » . Nearly 30 young adults and teenagers who were born with HIV/AIDS meet every week at the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida. ""The teens are teenagers,"" said Ana Garcia, an adjunct assistant professor in pediatric infectious disease and immunology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine who helped form the group. ""They just happen to have HIV. It's about fitting in, being normal, and having goals and living long enough to meet them."" The group of HIV-positive teens, which calls itself the Kool Kids, formed in 1995. The youth who grew up with HIV/AIDS describe the usual complications of adolescence  --  dating, high school drama and rumors. But they also experienced broken families, medical complications and fights for acceptance. As their parents and family members died, the peer group here became a new family, Garcia said. Over an hour of joking, merciless teasing and eating Chinese food, the teens scarcely mention HIV/AIDS. It's a fellowship that silently understands one another's struggles. ""We don't want to talk about HIV every day,"" said Eric Koumbou, 19. ""If you talk about HIV and you don't have it and I do, sometimes it makes me angry or makes me sad."" Even if they don't talk about it, it helps a young person with HIV who may think, ""This is the end of my life. I don't know what to do,"" said Lane, who joined when she was 11. The older teens support the younger ones and show that HIV/AIDS doesn't consume one's life. Quintara Lane . Lane was raised by her grandmother after her mother left her at the hospital. More than two decades ago, ""The families frequently lacked hope,"" said Dr. Gwendolyn Scott, director of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who treated the newborns. ""Many times, the parents died when children were at a young age."" As a child, Lane understood she had to take ""vitamins"" -- two dozen antiretroviral pills chopped into pieces and taken with orange juice every day. The pills made her nauseated and gave her headaches and skin rashes. Side effects of taking the medications can include gastrointestinal problems, weight gain, neuropathy and other symptoms. ""I didn't want to take the medicine,"" Lane recalled. She lied to her grandmother about taking them for nearly two years. ""I could say I took 'em when I didn't. Being around friends, I didn't want to take them and I didn't want them to ask questions."" After fainting from a decimated immune system at the age of 12, Lane started to understand the gravity of her situation. But questions and the anger occasionally surfaced. ""Why did I get it?"" Lane would ask. ""All these questions of why, why, why -- all that anger makes this worse. Dealing with school, relationships, dealing with life -- it could be overwhelming. But I try to look at the best of everything and not dwell so much on myself."" Lane counsels other young adults who have new HIV diagnoses, answering questions about how HIV/AIDS affects dating and how to handle the medications. Young patients with HIV/AIDS often get pill fatigue, Garcia said. ""It makes me different. I feel sick. I'm allergic to them,"" they tell her. Some of her young patients died because they stopped taking the pills. ""There are kids who are set with, 'I don't want to be in this world. I want to be with my mother or I want to be with my father,' or they don't care,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter what you offer them. So it's very complicated to move through that -- sometimes you run out of time."" The next generation . Over the years, the number of pills required to treat HIV/AIDS has dwindled significantly. But, it's not the physical side effects that bother patients. ""I'm only reminded of it when I have to take medication,"" said a 28-year-old with HIV who asked to be identified only as ""Mike."" ""That's what we do. That's our lives."" Mike contracted HIV after receiving a contaminated blood transfusion as a newborn. ""I wasn't promised to live on Earth long enough,"" he said. ""At times, I'd think about suicide and think 'Why me? Why would the doctor give me dirty blood?' I come to realize that it's no one's fault."" He joined the HIV support group as a teenager. There, he met his wife, who had contracted the virus from her mother.  Their primary focus now is raising their 5-year-old daughter, a petite, shy girl with wavy brown curls. This newest generation of children born to HIV-positive parents has a different fate. ""My wife took her medicine to reduce chances of our daughter being infected with the virus,"" Mike said. ""By the grace of God and praying, my daughter is HIV-negative.""","Babies born with HIV/AIDs in the 1980s defy expectations .

"(CNN) -- A Nestle plant linked to an outbreak of illness has been shut temporarily, and the company said Monday that it expects to lay off more than 200 workers as a result. Preliminary results ""indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough,"" the CDC says. ""It's likely that we're going to have some temporary layoffs at that facility,"" Nestle spokeswoman Roz O'Hearn said of the Danville, Virginia, facility that was churning out refrigerated cookie-dough products until Thursday. About 550 people work at the factory, but only about half of them work on cookie dough, she said. The rest work on Buitoni pasta and sauce in a separate facility at the plant. She said there is little chance that the Buitoni products might be tainted, because -- even if the cookie dough is proved to be the source of the outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 -- it is a kosher product, meaning it is made from a segregated stream of ingredients. Danville's Economic Development Office said the city's unemployment rate is 14.3 percent. Nestle was first alerted to the problem late Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, O'Hearn said, adding: ""Less than a day later, we made the decision to remove the product. We shut down. We stopped shipping."" Included in the recall are 300,000 cases of the product. Each case contains 12 packages, and each package contains 24 cookies. That's a total of 86.4 million cookies' worth of dough. The recall does not include Dreyer's or Edy's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House ""cookie dough"" ingredients. That's because the ""dough"" in ice cream is not really dough at all; it is cooked. ""Ice cream is a different formulation,"" O'Hearn said. ""Since it's not meant to be baked before consumption -- those cookie crumbles that are in the formulation -- they're all cooked. For the cookie dough that's present in the ice cream, Dreyer's is using heat-treated ingredients."" According to the CDC, between March 1 and Monday, 70 people in 30 states had been infected with a strain of E. coli. The ages of the people affected ranged from 2 to 57 years, though more than 70 percent were younger than 19, and 75 percent were female, the agency said on its Web site. Twenty-five people had been hospitalized, and seven had developed a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. No fatalities had been reported, it said. ""Preliminary results of this investigation indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough,"" the agency said. ""Most patients reported eating refrigerated prepackaged Nestle Toll House cookie dough products raw."" Though cooking the product would kill the bacteria, the agency did not recommend that people holding on to the company's cookie-dough products do so, ""because consumers might get the bacteria on their hands and on other cooking surfaces."" The recall does not include Nestle Toll House morsels, which are used as an ingredient in many homemade baked goods, or other baked cookie products. CNN's Louise Schiavone contributed to this story.","Nestle may lay off factory workers after illness linked to cookie dough .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The high-end specialty coffee industry isn't immune to the effects of a recession, but many companies are still doing well. Growers, roasters and equipment manufacturers were represented at the coffee expo in Atlanta. Portland Roasting had a slow holiday season, but business is picking up, said owner Mark Stell. ""February was a great month for us,"" he said. Stell traveled from Oregon to Atlanta, Georgia, for the Specialty Coffee Association of America expo, where the show floor was filled with nearly 800 booths featuring everything from exotic coffee beans to the latest Italian espresso machines. Stell's company sells about a million pounds of coffee a year. He said sales to offices and hotels are down but are being replaced by orders from grocers and universities. ""People don't leave coffee,"" he said. ""They just get it differently.""

Riffel said business at his coffee shop was flat last summer, but sales are up 10 percent for the first quarter of 2009. ""The first part of this year has been our best ever,"" he said. ""People are being careful with what they're spending money on, but they're spending it on quality products."" Business is good enough that Riffel plans to open a second location this year. ""Now is a really good time to do that,"" he said. ""Developers and landlords are more flexible and negotiable,"" even though banks are ""pickier than normal."" Joseph Taguman also knows about picky banks. The general manager of the Zambia Growers Association said the lack of financing is holding back the association's 80 farmers. Taguman said the farmers could grow more than their current rate of about 300 metric tons per year, but trees take time to grow and long-term financing is hard to come by in Zambia. A couple of aisles over from Taguman's booth, Shawn Contreras sees a similar problem. Contreras is the sales director for Diedrich Manufacturing, which has been selling roasting equipment for nearly 30 years. He said wholesale roasters are continuing to grow, but smaller operations are having ""an extraordinarily difficult time"" getting funding. Consultant Andrew Hetzel acknowledges that credit is a hindering factor for companies, but he is optimistic about the specialty coffee industry. ""The U.S. market is continuing at a steady pace,"" he said. But it's a slower pace than the past few years. ""Coffee is something that has been with humanity for 1,500 years,"" Hetzel said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After touring the wreckage Tuesday of two Metro transit trains that crashed the day before, killing nine, Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said it was a sight that ""no one should have to see."" Investigators work Tuesday at the site of a Metro train crash in Washington. Officials said that all the wreckage has been cleared and that no other bodies have been found in what was the worst subway train accident in the history of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Three bodies discovered Tuesday were lodged behind the driver's compartment of the rear train, an official said at the scene. The driver of that train, who was among the dead, was Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Virginia, Metro spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said. McMillan had worked at Metro since January 2007. McMillan's aunt, Venice Foster, said her niece loved her job and ""was just a joy to be around."" Retired Maj. Gen. David F. Wherley Jr., former commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, and his wife, Ann, also were killed in the collision. Both were 62. Names of the other casualties were released by authorities Tuesday afternoon: Mary Doolittle, 59; Lavanda King, 23; Veronica Dubose, 26; Cameron Williams, 36; and Dennis Hawkins, 64, all of Washington; and Ana Fernandez, 40, of Hyattsville, Maryland.  Watch what officials know about the crash » . The Metro's board approved a $250,000 hardship fund to assist the victims' families with funerals and other immediate expenses. According to Fenty, at least three bodies were trapped in a ""very compressed area."" It wasn't clear whether those were the bodies found behind the operator's station. ""It just brings home what an awful tragedy this was,"" the mayor said. The crash occurred along the Red Line just before 5 p.m. Monday on an above-ground track in the District of Columbia near Takoma Park, Maryland.  See location of crash » . Both cars were on the same track, traveling in the same direction: southward from the Fort Totten Metrorail station to the Shady Grove station. The train in front had stopped behind another train undergoing service and awaited directions to move ahead. ""We don't know at this point whether the operator could see the train in front of her in time to stop,"" said Deborah Hersman, who is leading the investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board. The weather at the time of the crash was good, she said.  See pictures of crash site » . ""I did have the opportunity to walk the track with our investigators. I can tell you it is a scene of real devastation,"" Hersman said. Jamie Jiao was sitting in the front car of the second train. He said he suffered injuries to his feet and back. ""I see the train in front a split second before we crashed. That's all. You don't have time to react or do anything,"" he told CNN's Jeanne Meserve. He said that after impact, ""You just hear really loud noises, as if there was an explosion. I could see things falling apart, tearing apart."" A pole fell on top of him, but he was able to throw it off. The car broke open, and he crawled outside, where he waited for firefighters. He said he didn't notice whether the driver tried to brake before hitting the other train. Many of the passengers in his car were injured, he said. ""I'm lucky to be alive,"" Jiao said. ""My injuries aren't too bad."" iReport.com: Were you there? Share your photos, video . Hersman said there was a telescoping effect when the second car slammed into the first and landed atop it. ""The first car [of the second train] overrode the rear car [of the front train], and much of the survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised,"" she said. One of the factors the NTSB will examine is the crash-worthiness of the cars. ""The safety board has long been on record making recommendations about survivability when accidents do happen to make sure that operators and passengers are protected as much as possible,"" Hersman said, but those haven't been implemented. She didn't elaborate. The safety board has called since 2006 for the transit authority to modernize its fleet of transit cars. The agency has sought more safety features and higher technology, such as data boxes on each car that can provide valuable information in case of a crash, Hersman said. Citing the most recent federal data, she said the average age of the cars in the fleet was 19.3 years old. The lead train in the crash contained 5000-Series and 3000-Series cars, which are newer and have better technology than the cars in the rear train, with 1000-Series cars.  Watch woman say she, fellow passengers ""went flying"" » . The Metro board is ""aggressively seeking"" to replace 300 1000-Series cars purchased between 1974 and 1978, said Jim Graham, chairman of Metro's board of directors. There should be nine data recorders aboard the first train, which will aid the investigation a great deal if they aren't damaged, Hersman said. The recorders provide data on such things as speed, braking and emergency applications. She said there were no recorders on the rear train. ""We've recommended for years that WMATA either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet. They have not been able to do that. And our recommendation was not addressed, so it has been closed in an unacceptable status,"" she said. ""If there are changes we can make to those cars, we will do so,"" said John Catoe Jr., general manager of the transit authority. Fenty said 76 people were injured, and two remained in critical condition Tuesday. The condition of another critical patient was upgraded. Two of the injured were emergency responders, Washington Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said.  Watch injured passengers limp from the scene » . All trains were to operate in manual, instead of automatic, mode Tuesday, Catoe said at the briefing. He called the move ""an extra safety precaution"" until there is more information on the crash. The rear train was operating on ""automatic"" mode, which is routine during rush hour, and preliminary evidence shows that the driver may have employed the brakes, Hersman said. Hersman addressed reports that the trains may have been two months past due on brake inspections, saying, ""We are very interested in looking at those records, and we're interested in looking at all of the records."" She said cell phone and texting records would also be reviewed, which is standard. ""We've investigated a number of accidents where there were distractions,"" she said, adding that it's unknown whether cell phone use was a factor in this crash. Nine safety board teams will examine aspects such as train operations and communications, signals, tracks, crash-worthiness of equipment, maintenance and survivability -- ease of fleeing the trains after the crash and other survivability factors, Hersman said. The transit authority gave Red Line riders several options for commuting Tuesday morning and was providing free shuttle buses to drive people around the accident scene. The only other time in Metrorail's 33-year history that there were customer fatalities was in January 1982, when three people died as a result of a derailment between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian Metrorail stations.

"(CNN) -- ""Which is more important -- the customer being king or the employees being highly motivated (keeping in mind reduction of operating expenses and being competitive)?"" - Ronald Mahondo, I&M Bank, Kenya . The customer is king. The customer is always right. These are phrases that have been with us for a while. As business and marketing environments have become tougher, it's true that those companies that have found out what the king wants -- and provided it -- have been successful. This would make it easy, if only it was clear which king to ask. Many companies draw a distinction between ""consumers,"" those who are the end-user of a product or service, and ""customers,"" those who are the trade, distributors and so on. This kind of customer is very powerful indeed -- especially if they are Wal-Mart or Tescos. So which customer is more king than the other? And what if they don't agree on what they want? Sounds like war. In global companies the complexity rises. They have consumers and customers, but it's also common that employees of that company are also customers of other employees. A trend at the moment is that regional employees are customers for central employees. Motivation and, more importantly, aligned goals, are absolutely critical to success. Getting this wrong can be costly in many ways -- not least in morale, time and money. The real truth is that this is not a question of ""or."" Customer and employee satisfaction and motivation are critical. The challenge is to create a virtuous circle. Motivated employees are a great way of delivering what the customer wants, be that service, fast moving consumer goods, innovation, or anything else, and happy customers make employees feel rewarded. Of course, the virtuous circle has to start somewhere. In creative industries such as ours, often the job is to stretch further than the customer can see. They can tell you what they like today, but tomorrow looks misty and murky. A motivated group of creative individuals love nothing more than the art of invention, the creation of the new, the alchemy of an idea. If you want a king, it's the idea, not the customer or the employee. Being competitive comes from having better ideas than your competition: an idea about targeting a particular group of people, an idea about a new product, an idea about how or where to distribute it, or an idea about how to advertise it. In 1944 James Webb Young, an employee of JWT, defined an idea as ""nothing more or less than a new combination of old elements."" It's a definition that we continue to find very useful today. Your customers are an excellent source of the familiar; a highly motivated employee will most likely be the one who combines the familiar in a new way, creating the idea, and the competitive edge. On my way to work this morning with a trainload of people in glorious iPod isolation, I wondered what kind of company Apple would be today if the employees had been thinking the customer was king instead of working out how to combine some music with a little bit of one of their computers.","Motivation and aligned goals are absolutely critical to success .

"(CNN) -- There is a general consensus that women's tennis needs a new name to ignite some excitement into it and, at this week's Wimbledon, it does appear likely that the Williams sisters will once again be the ones to beat at the grass-court grand slam. The Williams sisters have dominated Wimbledon this century and contested last year's final. Defending champion Venus (five wins) and younger sibling Serena (two wins) have dominated the tournament since 2000, with only Maria Sharapova (2004) and Amelie Mauresmo (2006) breaking that monopoly. In fact, the Williams domination has been so great this century that the 2006 final -- when Mauresmo beat Justine Henin -- is the only final when one of the American duo has not been involved. Both Sharapova and Mauresmo are back this year, although their participation had seemed in doubt in the early part of 2009. Sharapova certainly has the powerful game to claim another Wimbledon title, but a persistent shoulder injury has plagued her all year and she comes into the competition poorly prepared. At nearly 30, Mauresmo is now a veteran of the WTA Tour. She had looked a spent force last year, but has enjoyed some better results this year and comes into the tournament as the 17th seed. A potential third round showdown with top seed Dinara Safina will test her to the limit, although she would undoubtedly have the fans' support should that encounter materialize. Safina's standing as world number one has divided opinion. The Russian is yet to win a grand slam and wasted another opportunity to end that particular hoodoo when losing to compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in the French Open final last month. The 23-year-old comes into the tournament with a niggling knee injury and has not impressed in her pre-tournament displays. The feeling remains that should the Williams sisters decided to play more WTA events then one of them, and not Safina, would be topping the world rankings. Russians Elena Dementieva and Kuznetsova are seeded fourth and fifth and both have chances should they bring their top game to SW19, although again it is hard to see one of them defeating an in-form Williams sister.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Puzzled zookeepers in northern Japan have discovered the reason why their attempts to mate two polar bears kept failing: Both are female. A 4-year-old polar bear sent to impregnate a female polar bear at a zoo in Kushiro was found to be female as well. The municipal zoo in the city of Kushiro in Hokkaido brought in a polar bear cub three years ago. They named it Tsuyoshi, after the popular baseball outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo, and waited until it reached reproductive age. In June, the zoo introduced Tsuyoshi to its resident bear, an 11-year-old female named Kurumi, and waited for sparks to fly. But much to the disappointment of zookeepers, Tsuyoshi never made any amorous advances toward Kurumi. Earlier this month, zookeepers put Tsuyoshi under anesthesia to get to the bottom of the matter. That's when they made their discovery: Tsuyoshi is a female. Still, the Kushiro zoo plans to keep Tsuyoshi because he -- or rather, she -- has become immensely popular with visitors. ""I have rather mixed feelings, given the need for breeding, but Tsuyoshi is an idol for Kushiro,"" Yoshio Yamaguchi, head of the Kushiro zoo, told Japan's Kyodo news agency. Tsuyoshi will even keep her name. ""We will not be changing it to 'Tsuyoko' since it is loved by citizens (by the current name),"" Yamaguchi said. ""Ko"" is a common suffix for a Japanese female name. Meanwhile, Tsuyoshi's ""brother,"" who was adopted by another zoo, has also turned out to be female, Kyodo reported. -- CNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report .","Zoo introduced polar bear cub to its resident bear and waited for sparks to fly .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientist and author Stephen Hawking is ""very ill"" and has been hospitalized, according to Cambridge University, where he is a professor. Stephen Hawking in Pasadena, California, in March. Cambridge University said the 67-year-old is ""comfortable"" and will stay overnight at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge. Hawking, one of the world's most famous physicists, is also a cosmologist, astronomer, and mathematician. Wheelchair-bound Hawking is perhaps most famous for ""A Brief History of Time,"" which explored the origins of the universe in layman's terms. The book is considered a modern classic. Hawking has Lou Gehrig's Disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS), which is usually fatal after three years. Hawking has survived for more than 40 years since his diagnosis. On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS. ""I try to lead as normal a life as possible, and not think about my condition, or regret the things it prevents me from doing, which are not that many,"" he wrote. He added: ""I have been lucky, that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case. But it shows that one need not lose hope."" The disease has left him paralyzed -- he is able to move only a few fingers on one hand. Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing, dressing, eating, even speech. He uses a speech synthesizer with an American accent. Hawking has been married and divorced twice. In 2004, police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking's daughter that his second wife was abusing him. Authorities said they found no proof. His Web site says he has three children and one grandchild. Hawking was born in Oxford, England, on what turned out to be an auspicious date: January 8, 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei. A Cambridge University spokesman told CNN: ""Professor Hawking is very ill and has been taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge."" Professor Peter Haynes, head of the university's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, said: ""Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague, we all hope he will be amongst us again soon."" At Cambridge, he holds the position of Lucasian Professor Mathematics -- the prestigious post held from 1669 to 1702 by Sir Isaac Newton. Hawking has guest-starred, as himself, on Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Simpsons. He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe, his choice would be Marilyn. In October, CNN's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking. The following are some quotes from that interview: . ""Over the last twenty years, observations have to a large extent confirmed the picture I painted in 'A Brief History of Time.' The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now, rather than slowing down... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds."" CNN's Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report .","Physicist Stephen Hawking hospitalized Monday in ""very ill"" condition .

"(CNN) -- A New York Times reporter who was held by the Taliban for seven months has escaped, the newspaper reported Saturday. New York Times reporter David Rohde, shown in 1995, escaped from the Taliban. David Rohde told his wife, Kristen Mulvihill, that he and a local reporter, Tahir Ludin, climbed over the wall of a compound late Friday where they were being held in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan. Pakistani military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN that the Pakistani military was involved in freeing Rohde. Additional details were not immediately available. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement expressing her relief about Rohde's ""return to freedom."" ""I would like to thank the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan for their assistance in ensuring his safe return,"" Clinton said. ""Journalists put themselves at risk every day to report the news in regions gripped by conflict. We rely on their vital role and I am grateful for their service.""  Watch CNN's Nic Robertson report on the escape » . Rohde, Ludin and their driver were kidnapped outside of Kabul, Afghanistan, on November 10, and Afghan and Western officials said recently that Rohde was being held in Pakistan. After leaving the compound Friday night, the two men then found a Pakistani army scout who led them to a nearby army base. On Saturday, they were flown to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, the newspaper said. A U.S. official told CNN that Rohde will arrive in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates at 10 p.m. Saturday. ""They just walked over the wall of the compound,"" Mulvihill said, according to the newspaper. Ludin hurt his foot during the escape, but otherwise both men appear to be in good health, the newspaper said. The driver, Asadullah Mangal, did not escape, the newspaper said. ""It is hard to describe the enormous relief we felt at hearing the news of David and Tahir's escape and knowing he is safe,"" a statement from Rohde's family said. ""Every day during these past seven months, we have hoped and prayed for this moment,"" said the statement, which was provided to CNN by The New York Times . It asked that the family's privacy be respected. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the White House was ""very pleased to see that David Rohde is now safe and returning home."" ""This marks the end of a long and difficult ordeal for David's family, friends and co-workers. The FBI has been the lead agency on his case, and we refer you to them for any further information,"" he said. The New York Times and other media outlets had kept the kidnapping quiet out of concern for the men's safety. ""From the early days of this ordeal, the prevailing view among David's family, experts in kidnapping cases, officials of several governments and others we consulted, was that going public could increase the danger to hostages,"" The New York Times said in a written statement. ""Therefore, we did not publicly discuss the kidnapping. We are deeply grateful to the other news organizations that honored our request to refrain from reporting on it."" A Taliban spokesman told CNN several weeks ago that the Taliban had released two ""proof of identity"" videos and had demanded negotiations. The Taliban wanted some of its leaders in U.S. custody to be released as well as money, the spokesman said. Rohde, 41, had traveled to Kabul in early November to work on a book, The New York Times said. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1996 for his reporting on the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia while working for The Christian Science Monitor. He was also part of The New York Times reporting team that won a Pulitzer Prize in May for coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan last year.","NEW: U.S. secretary of state Clinton thanks Pakistan, Afghanistan for help .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Convicted ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski, who terrorized the country with a series of mail bombs over nearly two decades, is fighting to stop a public auction of his diaries and other personal possessions. Ted Kaczynski is fighting auction of possessions like this jacket and sunglasses made famous by a police sketch. But Kaczynski's five-year legal battle will come to an end soon unless he can convince the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. ""I regard him as the essence of evil. He's evil and amoral. He has no compassion,"" said Dr. Charles Epstein, who was seriously injured in 1993 when a bomb went off in a piece of mail he opened at his home. The blast destroyed both of Epstein's eardrums, and he lost parts of three of his fingers. Epstein, 75, is a world-renowned geneticist and retired professor at the University of California at San Francisco. He is one of four victims who are owed $15 million in court-ordered restitution from Kaczynski, and he told CNN the auction was important to victims.  Watch why the auction is causing controversy » . ""Who would think that we would still be sitting, this many years later, still having dealings ... with the man who tried to kill us?"" Epstein said. Kaczynski was arrested in 1996, pleaded guilty in 1998 and is currently serving a life term in the federal ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado. CNN was given exclusive access to videotape the items that will be up for auction, which were seized from the Montana cabin in which Kaczynski lived for years and held in evidence by the FBI in San Francisco and Washington.  See who else calls ""Supermax"" home » . The property includes tools, typewriters, knives and a hatchet; Kaczynski's degrees from Harvard and the University of Michigan; and the glasses and hooded jacket made famous by an artist's rendering of the suspect. But experts say the most valuable items probably will be the 40,000 pages of Kaczynski's diaries and other writings. ""Personally, I don't think he has any rights to anything,"" Epstein said. ""I think he abrogated all of his rights by his behavior."" The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the victims earlier this year, and now Kaczynski has until June 15 to file a notice of appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. Steve Hirsch, a California attorney who represents the four victims, said he doubts the Supreme Court would consider an appeal, and thinks the auction could happen later this year. A private company will handle the auction, but no company has yet been selected. ""The victims were placed in this terrible position of either accepting this idea of an auction with all of its problems or letting Kaczynski have all of his things back, which would have been another wound for them,"" Hirsch told CNN. In handwritten legal documents, in which Kaczynski refers to himself as ""K,"" he claims, ""The District Court's orders violate K's First Amendment rights."" ""The case involves the question of whether the government, consistent with the First Amendment, can confiscate an individual's personal papers and sell them at public auction to enforce payment of a debt,"" Kaczynski wrote in one of his numerous legal arguments. Lawrence Brown, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California, said his office has no choice but to support the auction. ""This is a directive from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,"" he said. ""We were put in a situation where it was sort of an either-or. Either we returned all of the property back to Kaczynski, or we sought to maximize its value by holding an auction to put it back towards the $15 million that's owed in restitution."" Kaczynski, now 67, killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of attacks from 1978 to 1995. The remainder of the victims have declined to seek restitution. Federal agents gave the case the code name ""Unabom"" because universities and airlines were the early targets. Kaczynski quit a tenure-track position at the University of California-Berkeley in 1969 to build a 13-by-13 foot shack near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived without running water or electricity until his 1996 arrest. Agents closed in after his brother noted similarities between his old letters and journals and the bomber's 35,000-word anti-technology manifesto. The New York Times and the Washington Post agreed to publish the document under a promise that the bombings would stop. ""If some funds are raised by this auction, to help out some of the victims, well, then that does help promote some level of justice,"" Brown said. ""But you just cannot right the tremendous wrong that Kaczynski committed.""","""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski fighting to stop auction of his personal possessions .

"(CNN) -- Three attacks were made on Royal Dutch Shell oil facilities in Nigeria on Sunday, according to a company spokesman who said details were not immediately available. Investigating the attacks will be difficult because they happened in remote areas, Royal Dutch Shell says. The attacks were against pipelines in the eastern part of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, said the spokesman, Rainer Winzenried. ""Shell is investigating the impact on facilities, the environment and the production capabilities,"" he said. The attacks happened in remote areas, making investigations difficult, he said, adding that the company would not send in investigators until it was certain the area was secure. It was not known whether there were any casualties, he said. The pipelines are part of a Shell joint venture that provides oil to several companies, Winzenried said. Shell runs the venture, and Nigeria is the operator. Winzenried refused to speculate on who was behind the attacks, but Nigeria's main militant group -- the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND -- said it had attacked an offshore facility earlier Sunday and that ""the structure is ... engulfed in fire."" Winzenried had no information about that claim. MEND, which demands a fairer distribution of Nigeria's oil wealth, claimed Friday that it destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the Italian gas company Agip, but Agip has not confirmed that report. Earlier in the week, MEND claimed to have destroyed Royal Dutch Shell's main trunk line in Bayelsa state and a Chevron oil station in the delta region. Shell confirmed an attack on that pipeline and said it had shut it down to avoid an environmental impact. Chevron, which halted its onshore operations in the region last month, said it was investigating. Last month, the militant group declared an ""all-out war"" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians. It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be invested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent.","Royal Dutch Shell: Pipelines attacked in eastern part of Nigeria's Niger Delta .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- World War II didn't just divide the world. It also divided four brothers. Ken (left) and Harry Akune served in the U.S. military during World War II. Not long after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Harry and Ken Akune were sent to live in an internment camp in Amache, Colorado. When the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service came to their camp to recruit Japanese-speaking volunteers as interpreters, they joined so they could prove their loyalty to their country. Across the world in Japan, their father Ichiro was raising the rest of his large family -- which had returned to his home country after the death of his wife -- in a fishing village, Kagoshima, on the island of Kyushu. The youngest brothers, Saburo and Shiro, were just teenagers when they were drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy. The brothers, four of the Akunes' nine children, had all been born or raised in the United States; Ichiro Akune owned a grocery business before moving back to Japan. Harry and Ken had been sent back to America to work and earn money for the family.  Watch how brother fought brother during the war » . Harry and Ken graduated from language school in 1942 and were dispatched to the Pacific Theater. Ken served in Burma at the Office of War Information. His job was trying to create propaganda to persuade the Japanese to surrender rather than sacrifice their lives on the battlefield. Harry served in New Guinea and the Philippines. His ethnicity didn't endear him to some of his colleagues. ""I had an intelligence officer who disliked me,"" Harry recalled. Before a parachute jump onto the island of Corregidor with the 503rd Paratroopers late in the war, the officer stripped Harry of all of his gear, including his weapon. ""I got onto the airplane with only my parachute. A soldier took pity on me and helped find a rifle and one clip,"" he said. He survived, but many of his fellow soldiers did not. Twenty percent of them lost their lives just on the jump because of the jagged terrain and enemy fire. iReport.com: What did you do in the war? His work was heroic. Harry's interrogation of prisoners and translation of captured documents revealed a Japanese occupation force of over 5,000, which vastly outnumbered the American forces. ""My information helped reduce casualties,"" he said. Most of the Japanese soldiers chose death over what they perceived as dishonor. Harry says only 22 were captured, with the rest dying in combat or suicide attacks -- and they often weren't satisfied with dying alone. At one point, with Harry's back turned, a prisoner jumped him and tried to kill him. Harry recalls the incident vividly. ""My guard beat him with his gun. It seemed like this prisoner was clinging to me for dear life,"" he said. ""That feeling I have never lost. Even though he was the enemy, to see him die the way he did, affected me."" The Japan-based Akune brothers saw death from the other perspective, as part of the war effort. Saburo became a spotter for kamikazes, known for their suicide dive-bomb missions on Allied ships. Shiro, just 15, served at Sasebo, a naval base, helping to orient new recruits. He remembers American Grumman torpedo planes flying into the harbor. ""Bap, bap, bap ... ships going down ... we just watching! We cannot do anything!"" he remembered. After the war, the Akune brothers discovered they served against each other, leading to ill feelings on both sides. Harry and Ken, now in Japan as members of the Allied Prisoner of War Recovery Team, joined Saburo and Shiro at a family reunion in Kagoshima. ""When we first met, the topic of the war came up. Both sides were saying their side was right,"" Ken said. ""Saburo and Shiro got really hot and stood up, they wanted to fight us."" ""The propaganda situation in Japan was very extreme,"" Shiro said. ""The elders told you what you should do is revere the emperor like a god, and if you didn't abide by it, you were physically harmed."" It took the intercession of their father to stop the familial battle. ""Shut up,"" the elder Akune said. ""The war is over."" All four brothers ended up in the United States, with Shiro -- ironically -- serving as an American GI in Korea. Saburo died several years ago, but Shiro, Harry and Ken continue to live in Southern California. Ken still volunteers full time with the ""Go For Broke"" National Education Center, which preserves the memory of Japanese-American soldiers who served the United States in World War II. Harry says his military service helped him identify as an American. ""The benefit of going to war for the United States helped me manage myself not as a Japanese-American, but more like an American. I feel very happy I was able to do that,"" he said. But he holds nothing against the two brothers who fought for the other side. ""They were in Japan, educated there. It's only right to be loyal to the Japanese force,"" he said. ""I feel like they were like any other Japanese and we were like any other American. Two sides had their ideas, and there was a clash,"" he said. ""Everything worked out. All four of us were able to survive without having to be casualties of the war.""","Two Akune brothers fought for U.S., two for Japan in World War II .

"RECIFE, Brazil (CNN)  -- Eight more bodies have been recovered from last week's crash of an Air France jetliner in the Atlantic Ocean, bringing the total to 24, Brazil's military announced Monday. Recovery efforts have found several items confirmed to have come from Air France Flight 447. The bodies were found floating about 440 kilometers (273 miles) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha archipelago northeast of the Brazilian coast on Monday, military officials said Monday evening. Air France 447 disappeared over the Atlantic early June 1. The jet was en route to Paris, France, from the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro with 228 passengers and crew aboard. The military said earlier Monday that 16 bodies had been recovered. Items found in the same area Saturday were confirmed to have come from the jet, including pieces of the aircraft's wing section, luggage and a leather briefcase containing an airplane ticket with a reservation code for the doomed flight, Brazilian air force spokesman Jorge Amaral said. The exact location of the crash has not been determined, because ocean currents probably caused the bodies and debris to drift in the days since the crash. Two key pieces of evidence -- the flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- remain missing and could lie on the ocean floor.  Map of Flight 447's flight path » . The part of the ocean where the debris and bodies have been found ranges from 6,000 to 8,000 meters (about 19,700 to 26,250 feet) deep. The search area covers 200,000 square kilometers (77,220 square miles), an area nearly as big as the country of Romania.  Watch CNN's Karl Penhaul report on more bodies found » . Brazilian officials emphasized Monday that finding bodies was their priority. The French are in charge of finding the black boxes, and a submarine was en route as part of that mission. Fourteen aircraft -- 12 Brazilian and two French -- were participating, along with five Brazilian ships and one French frigate. In Washington, a U.S. defense official said the U.S. Navy will contribute two high-tech acoustic devices to listen for emergency beacons still operating in deep water. The ""towed pinger locators,"" which help search for emergency beacons on downed aircraft to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet, will be placed aboard two French tugs that are part of the search efforts, the official said. Recovery of bodies and debris is significant not only for families but also for crash investigators, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""Even if they don't find anything else, they can get some very important clues from the pieces that they do find and from the human remains,"" she said Saturday.  Watch an explanation of what could have caused the crash » . She said investigators would be able to tell whether there was an explosion from possible residue on the bodies or other items. Or, if water is found in the lungs of victims, investigators would know that the plane went down intact, she said. Investigators in Paris said Saturday that the Air France flight sent 24 automated error messages about four minutes before it crashed. The messages suggest the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through severe thunderstorms it encountered before the crash, officials said. Schiavo said four minutes ""was a very long time"" for automated signals to be sent from the plane. Investigators also reported that the airline had failed to replace a part as recommended by the manufacturer, Airbus. Airbus had advised airlines to update part of the equipment that monitors speed, known as pitot tubes. The recommendation was a result of technological developments and improvements, an Airbus spokesman said. The change was not mandatory, and the spokesman would not comment on Air France's failure to follow the advice. CNN's Karl Penhaul, Richard Quest, Helena DeMoura and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Brazilian officials emphasize that finding bodies is their priority .

"(Southern Living) -- When I was 5, my parents went to a conference on Hilton Head Island and let me tag along, leaving my brothers landlocked in central Mississippi. Two memories stand out from my first encounter with the watery majesty of this Southern icon. Hilton Head Island's relaxed atmosphere is ideal for families. For starters, it's the first place I ever heard the term ""market price."" Daddy encouraged me to eat whatever I wanted at restaurants -- no kid's menu here -- so I tried my hand at swordfish. I figured anything so fresh they couldn't put a price on it until the day it was served had to be good. And for years, I ordered based on that idea. From the right side of the menu. If it was fresh (and expensive), it had to be the best. More boats than cars . Second, water was everywhere. I'd been to the beach before, but never an actual island. It seemed like Hilton Head had more boats than my hometown had cars. And even then, I understood that the marinas were the real lifeblood of the community. On my most recent visit to Hilton Head, my brothers and their wives joined me, while my parents stayed home with the gaggle of grandkids. The tables had turned. But I discovered a few constants remain: From fresh cobia (available only in May and June) to wild shrimp caught in local waters, ordering ""market price"" from the menu isn't a bad way to go. Water is everywhere. And each marina celebrates the spirit of the island with its own special style. Explore them, one by one. SouthernLiving.com: A coastal S.C. retreat . Harbour Town: The classic .

The 18-month investigation, dubbed ""Operation Raw Deal,"" targeted traffickers who allegedly imported raw materials from China and used them to make anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and insulin growth factor, the Drug Enforcement Administration said. ""Today we reveal the truth behind the underground steroid market: dangerous drugs cooked up all too often in filthy conditions with no regard to safety, giving Americans who purchase them the ultimate raw deal,"" DEA Administrator Karen Tandy said in a statement. Authorities made arrests in 27 states, including busts in Los Angeles, California; New York City; San Diego, California; Providence, Rhode Island; and Kansas City, Missouri. They seized more than 530 pounds of raw materials and 11.4 million steroid dosage units in the United States, officials said, enough to supply hundreds of users. Most of the arrests were made between Thursday and Sunday, the DEA said. Chinese authorities cooperated with the investigation, which targeted 37 companies in China, the DEA said. So far, one Chinese lab has been shut down, officials said. The Chinese ""have done everything"" they were asked to do, said DEA spokesman Rusty Payne.  Watch DEA officials say bust is only the beginning » . The operation, according to the DEA, also cracked down on underground trafficking of counterfeit medications as well as Web sites that were distributing materials that helped in converting raw steroid ingredients into the finished product. ""DEA successfully attacked the illegal steroid industry at every level of its distribution network-from the manufacturers in China who supply the raw materials, to the traffickers in the United States who market the deadly doses,"" the DEA statement said. Besides China, other countries which cooperated in the operation included Mexico, Canada, Belgium, Australia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Thailand, officials said.

"JESSUP, Maryland (CNN) -- The beer is flowing, the polka band is playing, and dancers are twirling across the dance floor. Couples dance at Blob's Park, a dance hall that owes its revival, in part, to the economic downturn. Blob's Park lives again. The popular Bavarian beer hall and weekend nightspot had closed its doors in 2007, the victim of an unlikely foe: progress. Developers, eager to build on the 400 acres of prime real estate in the bustling Baltimore/Washington, D.C., corridor, had purchased the 400 acres upon which the dance hall sat. It was the end of an era for the farmland first owned by Max Blob, a German immigrant, who, among other things, helped found America's first ""Oktoberfest"" 70 years ago. Blob was the great-uncle of Max Eggrel, who grew up on the land in Jessup, Maryland. Standing on that farmland recently, Eggrel recalled the old days. ""We would farm during the week and have a biergarten during the weekend,"" Eggrel says. Those weekend events were held in a small, wood-framed building situated between rows of golden crops. The building would come to be known as Blob's Park, a restaurant, dance hall and German-style biergarten. It opened in 1933. Thousands of patrons came to know the dance hall, which saw most of its business on Friday and Saturday nights. But time marched on, and developers came calling. ""My brother ran the park until New Year's Eve (of 2007), and the rest of my family members decided, with the pressure from developers, to sell the land,"" Eggrel says. ""Our land butts right up to Fort Meade and the NSA (National Security Agency) facility,"" Eggrel explains. Fort Meade is currently going through major renovation and upgrades on its facility. The fort is part of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program implemented by the Department of Defense in 2005 that will see thousands of new jobs on base. With all these jobs comes a need for housing, Eggrel says. ""There are people that are going to be working there, and they are going to have to live somewhere, and so this is one of the spots."" Private developers are expected to build townhomes, condominiums and retail storefronts on the rolling hills of farmland where Blob's Park stands. But that's somewhere in the future. For now, the economic crisis gripping the country has played a role in the revival of Blob's Park. With the economic slowdown, developers couldn't see spending all the money on building upon the land since there currently isn't a demand. ""The infrastructure is going to take time to develop. There is no water or sewer on the property right now,"" adds Eggrel, who still lives on the property. Once the land was sold and Blob's Park shut down, Eggrel found himself gazing out his front yard at the facade of a dance hall and all the open space surrounding it. ""The building was sitting there, just inviting someone to jump in and bring it back,"" Eggrel says. That's exactly what he set out to do. But it wouldn't be an easy task. ""To open it back up took a sizable financial risk,"" Eggrel says. ""I just had the vision that it could succeed again and be bigger then it was before, and I was just willing to take that risk."" Eggrel took his idea to the developers and a few attorneys. The developers agreed to rent 40 acres of the land back to Eggrel, a small portion compared to the land he grew up on, but it gave Eggrel the right to reopen the doors to Blob's Park. Eggrel spent five months renovating the hall, and in January 2009 he and his employees reopened the doors to the public.  Watch the action on the dance floor » . The hall currently has a three-year lease, but Eggrel speculates the dancing could go on for as many as 10 years -- or so he hopes. Eggrel says his customers share a deep affection for his place. For $8, they can listen to or dance to live musicians who play for five hours every Friday and Saturday night. The customers who keep coming back to the hall week after week have as much fondness for the hall as the owner himself. ""Every week someone else comes up to me and thanks me for opening it back up,"" Eggrel says. As for the economy and Blob's Park, Eggrel has this to say: ""I hope it takes a long time to rebound. The longer this place stays open, the happier I'll be. And so will hundreds of other people.""","Popular Bavarian dance hall opened in Maryland in 1933 .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- The five remaining defendants in the racially charged ""Jena Six"" case will appear in court Friday and are expected to enter a plea, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said. Protesters converged on the small Louisiana town in September 2007 after the ""Jena 6"" were charged. Bill Furlow, spokesman for LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters, declined to say whether the defendants will plead guilty. ""It's not a done deal until it's a done deal,"" he said. In December 2006, six African-American teenagers were charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy in the beating of a white classmate. The incident followed months of racial tension in the community of about 3,000 people. Jena, Louisiana, is about 140 miles southeast of Shreveport in the north-central part of the state. The case drew national attention from civil rights groups, who argued that the charges were excessive. An estimated 15,000-plus demonstrators turned out for a rally on behalf of the teens: Carwin Jones, Jesse Ray Beard, Robert Bailey Jr., Bryant Purvis, Theo Shaw and Mychal Bell. The charges were eventually reduced. Bell pleaded guilty to battery in a juvenile court and moved to Monroe, Louisiana. In January, Bell said he had attempted suicide the month before by shooting himself in the chest but was recovering. Friday's hearing is set for 1:30 p.m.","""It's not a done deal until it's a done deal,"" spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of fatally shooting an Iowa football coach Wednesday was released from a hospital the day before, without the knowledge of police, who had asked to be notified, authorities said. Ed Thomas had been with the school district for more than 30 years and was well-known in the region. Mark Becker, 24, faces first-degree murder charges in the death of Ed Thomas, 58, a longtime football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School. Investigators believe Becker walked into the school's weight room, where Thomas was overseeing athletes' weight lifting, about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday and shot him multiple times as about 20 horrified students looked on. Thomas was flown to a hospital, where he later died. ""It's just too early to speculate"" on a motive for the shooting, said Kevin Winker, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. Authorities said Becker was a former student at Aplington-Parkersburg, which is about 100 miles northeast of Des Moines, Iowa, and a former football player. The agency, however, noted that Becker had ""recent contact"" with police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, about 25 miles to the east of Parkersburg. On June 20, Becker led police on a high-speed chase after he allegedly broke into a man's house, according to a division statement. He was taken into custody, but early the next morning authorities determined he needed medical attention and he was taken to a hospital. Police asked to be notified when he was released, the statement said. But on Tuesday, Becker was released and spent the night at his parents' Parkersburg home before heading to the high school Wednesday morning, the division said. ""Law enforcement was unaware that Becker had been released."" Cedar Falls police earlier said in a statement that they responded June 20 to a report of a man breaking several windows in a Cedar Falls home with a baseball bat and driving his car through a garage door. Just before officers arrived, the man fled the scene in his car and was seen leaving the area. Becker was arrested after a pursuit that reached speeds of more than 80 mph, Cedar Falls police said. He was taken into custody by Butler County authorities and later taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, according to the statement. ""Cedar Falls police was awaiting notification that the subject was to be released from custody in order to arrest Becker and file the charges relevant to the Cedar Falls incident,"" according to the police statement. He faces felony charges of criminal mischief and eluding authorities, along with traffic offenses, in the Saturday incident, Cedar Falls police said. Winker would not provide further details about why Becker was transported to the hospital. A 911 call was received at 7:47 a.m. Wednesday regarding the high school shooting, the Division of Criminal Investigation said. Becker was located in the driveway of his parents' home, where he was arrested without incident. Coincidentally, Becker had been released from the same hospital where his alleged victim died -- Covenant Hospital in Waterloo, Iowa. Thomas had been with the school district since 1975 and was a regionally well-known coach, according to district Superintendent Jon Thompson. The coach's son, Aaron Thomas, spoke briefly to reporters Wednesday, saying that his father would want to be remembered not only as a coach, teacher and father, but also for his involvement in his church, calling him ""a man of deep faith who touched many lives."" ""God always has a reason,"" he said. ""At this time, it's very tough for us to understand that."" He thanked the community for an outpouring of support, recalling residents' struggle to rebuild after a deadly tornado struck the Parkersburg area last year. But he also reminded residents to have concern and compassion for Becker's family. ""We ask that people pray for them as well, and that people take time to comfort and be with them,"" he said. ""I know that my father's legacy ... will live on,"" Aaron Thomas said. ""Without a doubt, we're going to miss him. We will have many great memories to share and to think back upon. We were lucky to have the father we had ... I feel very fortunate to be the son of Ed Thomas."" No students were injured or threatened in Wednesday's incident, authorities said. The school was placed on lockdown immediately. Crisis counselors were on the scene to assist students who witnessed the shooting, Thompson said. A vigil was planned in Thomas' honor Wednesday night.

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- An ex-astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival in a Florida parking lot will stand trial December 7, a judge ruled. Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles wearing NASA diapers to track down her rival. Lisa Marie Nowak, 46, is accused of stalking Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman and pepper-spraying her in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport in February 2007. She has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. If convicted, she could face a sentence of up to life in prison. Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot. Her attorney, Don Lykkebak, has denied that she wore the diapers. Shipman told police that after she got into her car, Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window. When Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray, Shipman said. Police said Nowak was apprehended as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin. Nowak has said she went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps. Judge Marc Lubet handed Nowak a legal victory in November 2007 when he ruled evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial because both were unlawfully obtained. Prosecutors appealed, however, and in July 2008, the Fifth District Court of Appeals ruled that evidence found in Nowak's car was admissible, although it agreed her statements to police were not. At a hearing in August 2007, Orlando police detective William Becton testified that when he searched Nowak's car, he found maps showing how to reach the airport, maps of the airport's layout, a buck knife and papers including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein's mother. He also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle. Nowak's attorneys have said they intend to utilize an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include more than a dozen psychiatric disorders. A pretrial conference in the case is set for November 10, Lubet ruled Tuesday. A hearing set for Friday was canceled. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","Lisa Marie Nowak, 46, is accused of stalking Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- President Obama misinterpreted Cuban President Raúl Castro's offer to start talks with the United States, Castro's brother Fidel said Wednesday, appearing to dismiss the U.S. leader's call for Cuba to release political prisoners. Fidel Castro appears with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, left, and brother Raúl Castro in a photo released in June. In an essay published in state-run newspapers Wednesday, the ailing revolutionary leader said the people Washington calls political prisoners are ""in the service of a foreign power that threatens and blockades our homeland."" Fidel Castro's comments come after signs of a thaw in the decades-old impasse between the United States and the communist-ruled island to its south. Obama lifted all restrictions on visits and money transfers between American citizens and relatives in Cuba this month, while Raúl Castro said Cuba is prepared to talk with the United States about ""everything -- human rights, freedom of the press, political prisoners."" Speaking at a conference of inter-American and Caribbean leaders Sunday, Obama said the Cuban leader's declaration was ""a sign of progress."" He added that the Cuban government could send a much clearer, more positive signal by releasing political prisoners or reducing fees charged on remittances Americans send to relatives in the country. But Fidel Castro wrote Wednesday, ""There is no doubt that the president misinterpreted Raúl's statements."" ""When the president of Cuba said he was ready to discuss any topic with the U.S. president, he meant he was not afraid of addressing any issue,"" Castro wrote. ""That shows his courage and confidence on the principles of the revolution."" He said Cuba would be willing to release prisoners held since a 2003 crackdown on dissidents if the United States would release five Cubans convicted of spying in 2001. And he criticized Obama for not doing more to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba, imposed in 1962. ""Should we wait for so many years before his blockade is lifted?"" Castro asked. ""He did not invent it, but he embraced it just as much as the previous 10 U.S. presidents did."" Castro ceded power to his brother in 2006 before undergoing surgery for a still-undisclosed intestinal condition. But he remains head of the Communist Party, and his essay raises the question of who would be calling the shots in any talks with Washington. ""Who's in charge?"" one Havana man asked Wednesday. ""Raul -- ah, Fidel -- ah, Raúl."" But a woman who spoke to CNN said, ""The president is Raúl. He's the one you have to listen to now.""","Fidel Castro essay seems to dismiss U.S. leader's call for Cuba to free dissidents .

"(CNN) -- A pilot dragged his passenger to safety and buried him neck-deep in sand to protect him from hypothermia Sunday night after their helicopter crashed in crocodile-infested mudflats in Australia's Northern Territory. Air ambulance workers attend to a man buried in sand following a helicopter crash. ""The pilot thought that in this remote location, nobody would find them. So he buried his friend to try and stop the hypothermia,"" said Ian Badham, director of CareFlight, the air ambulance service involved in the rescue. The two friends had gone camping on a remote beach without road access, about 130 km (80 miles) from the Northern Territory capital of Darwin. While leaving Sunday night, the pair decided to fly their two-seater helicopter over waters that are home to large crocodiles. ""It's an area known for its big saltwater crocodiles,"" Badham said. ""Those things make alligators look like wussies."" The pilot later told rescuers that they flew in to take a closer look. The next thing he remembered was lying upside down in the mud with the wreckage of the helicopter on top of him, Badham said. The men, both in their 50s, were about 100 meters (328 feet) from the main beach. Finding his friend seriously hurt, the pilot dragged him back to shore, away from the crocodiles -- and buried him in sand up to his neck to prevent him from freezing to death. Rescuers responded after the pilot used a satellite phone to alert them. The friend remained hospitalized Monday in serious but stable condition, Badham said. He suffered head and chest injuries. He also fractured his arm and several ribs. The pilot suffered minor injuries. ""It was the opinion of the (air-ambulance) doctor that the friend's injuries were grave and, quite likely, this man would not have survived the night,"" Badham said.","Helicopter pilot buries injured passenger in sand to save him from hypothermia .

"LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- Peru's Congress voted overwhelmingly to revoke two decrees that indigenous groups had said would result in the exploitation of their native lands for oil drilling, mining and logging. A man shouts slogans at a demonstration in Lima against the Garcia government on June 11. The 82-14 vote on Thursday with no abstentions came after five hours of intense debate. ""Today is a historic day,"" said Daysi Zapata, vice president of the Interethnic Association for Development of the Peruvian Jungle, in a statement on the group's Web site. She repeated the group's call this week to its members to abandon further opposition efforts, including blockades of rivers and roads. ""My brothers from Yurimaguas affirmed that they will return to their communities as soon as the legislative decrees are repealed,"" she said. ""We are thankful because the will of the indigenous people has been heard and we only hope that, in the future, government will pay attention to and listen to the people and not legislate behind their backs."" However, despite praising President Alan Garcia for supporting the revocation of the decrees, Zapata said that had he done so earlier, lives might have been saved. She called for the repealing of seven remaining legislative decrees and the immediate lifting of the state of emergency and curfew in the city of Bagua. And she asked the government to stop the political persecution of her group's leaders, including Alberto Pizango, who faces charges in Peru related to the clashes. He flew this week to Nicaragua where he was granted asylum. The vote came a day after Garcia's cabinet chief, Yehude Simon, called on lawmakers to repeal the laws which have created tension between the government and indigenous communities in the Amazon. Striking the contentious Forestry and Wildlife Law and a related decree -- laws that Congress had voted last week to suspend indefinitely -- ""will prevent more blood from being spilled,"" Simon said Wednesday. ""The government must have the wisdom to know when its best to back down,"" Andina cited him as saying. He announced this week that he will resign once peace is restored. Simon's call marked a turnaround, considering that last week, he called the repealing of laws in response to the protest the equivalent of bowing to extortion. Violence earlier this month in northwest Peru left more than 30 dead and more than 50 wounded, according to reports. Indian rights advocates put the number of dead and missing higher, with some groups saying more than 100 were killed or missing. The controversial laws were part of numerous decrees that Garcia passed through special powers awarded to him by Congress last year with the goal of having Peru meet rules set in a free trade agreement with the United States. The decrees made it easier for companies to gain concessions for oil drilling, mining and logging, including on indigenous lands. The forestry law, in particular, removed some 45 million hectares (more than 170,000 square miles) of Peruvian jungle from the government's list of protected lands. The government is taking three major steps to address protesters' concerns, Vicki Gass, senior associate for rights and development at the Washington Office on Latin America told CNN. Those include requesting to repeal the controversial laws, ending a state of emergency in the Amazon area and forming a working group with the indigenous groups, she said. The government's responses have diffused tensions, but ""had the government done this process of consultation earlier, we wouldn't have seen the blockades, and avoided the violence,"" Gass said. The real test for the Garcia government will be how seriously officials listen to the concerns of indigenous citizens, Gass said. ""These are positive steps, but the question is the process -- will they really allow for detailed debate?"" she said. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this report.","NEW: Indigenous leader Zapata calls for end of political persecution of other leaders .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former middle-school student who was strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her Supreme Court appeal Thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety. Savana Redding leaves the U.S Supreme Court in April. She was 13 when she was strip-searched. Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs. No medication was found, and she later sued. The justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued. The larger issue of whether a campus setting traditionally gives schools greater authority over students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed was not addressed fully by the divided court. ""Savana's subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening and humiliating,"" wrote Justice David Souter for the majority, likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week. But reflecting the divisiveness over the issue, Souter said, ""We think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case."" Whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court. ""I'm pretty excited that they agreed with me, they see that it was wrong for the school to do that,"" Redding said from her Hobbs, New Mexico, home after the ruling was announced. ""I'm pretty certain that it's so far less likely to happen again"" to other students. Redding was an eighth-grade honor student in 2003, with no history of disciplinary problems at Safford Middle School, about 127 miles from Tucson, Arizona. During an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that Redding had given her prescription-strength 400-milligram ibuprofen pills. The school had a near-zero-tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the-counter medication, including the ibuprofen, without prior written permission. Redding was pulled from class by Vice Principal Kerry Wilson, escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence. The girl denied the accusations. A search of Redding's backpack found nothing. A strip search was conducted by Wilson's assistant and a school nurse, both females. Redding was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear, so any hidden pills might fall out, according to court records. No drugs were found. ""The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had,"" Redding said in an affidavit. ""I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry."" Souter said Wilson initially had ""sufficient suspicion"" to justify searching the girl's backpack and outer clothing. But when no contraband was found, the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the school, calling the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. That court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom. The Supreme Court found little agreement on key issues. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the search was illegal but would have also made individual officials liable for damages by Redding. ""Wilson's treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it,"" said Ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in April, criticizing the school's actions. But Justice Clarence Thomas took the opposite view: that administrators deserved immunity and that the search was permissible. ""Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution,"" he said. ""And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative."" In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes. Such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing that it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive."" Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes and those participating in other extracurricular activities. The court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over. Adam Wolf, an ACLU attorney who represented Redding, applauded the decision. ""When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials,"" Wolf said . But school administrators said the ruling does not make their jobs any easier. ""The home medicine cabinet now poses a serious threat to students, who may take those medications for abusive purposes,"" said Francisco Negron, general counsel for the National School Boards Association. ""That's a problem schools are trying to stem."" ""How they determine now whether the drug is dangerous, whether it's not dangerous -- that kind of clarity and that kind of guidance, the court did not give us."" Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience. ""Before it happened, I loved school, loved everything about it. You know, I had a 4.0 GPA, honor roll, and now, well, afterwards I never wanted to go to school again."" She is attending college. The case is Safford Unified School District No. 1 v. Redding (08-479).","Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected she was carrying drugs .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old girl stoops and screams above the body of a Kent State University student killed in 1970 by an Ohio National Guardsman. John Filo's 1970 photo at Kent State University became a symbol of the anti-war movement at the time. A police chief aims his gun at a Vietcong prisoner's head in 1968, while executing him on a Saigon, Vietnam, street. And in 1989, an unarmed man in Beijing, China, stands defiantly in front of a column of tanks as they rolled into Tiananmen Square. These are iconic images, the kinds of shots that changed the way people viewed history as it unfolded. They put human faces on conflicts and became rallying cries for movements, inspiring those who demanded change. But while these photographs -- chronicling a single, silent moment -- were taken by seasoned photographers, two of whom won Pulitzer Prizes, this time amateur cell phone video is grabbing worldwide attention. It captures the death of a young woman named Neda Agha-Soltan, galvanizing protesters in Iran and shaping perceptions of a land and people few Westerners know.  See how images have inspired change » . ""Every revolution needs icons and symbols -- an image that embodies a sense of universality of blight and at the same time innocence,"" said Roya Hakakian of Connecticut, a writer, poet and journalist who was born and raised in Iran. ""The image of Neda does both."" The graphic video of Neda's death, caused by a gunshot fired during a  protest in Tehran, Iran, records her final moments: Her eyes turn toward the camera, people scream and struggle to revive her while blood streams across her face.  Watch how Neda's proven to be a tipping point » . Having gone viral with the help of social networking sites such as Twitter, the video of Neda's death has earned her the highly revered status of martyr. The woman who by all counts was an innocent bystander is now known as the ""Angel of Iran"" and is inspiring poetry. She is mourned publicly despite Revolutionary Guard threats, and her likeness graces posters. For Hakakian, who left Iran about 25 years ago, the significance of Neda's image runs deep. She said it's part of a larger picture of current protests being propelled by women, and a reflection of the Iran and the Iranians she knows. What outsiders have seen over the past three decades, she said, are fist-pumping men decrying America, images of hostages and ""the burning of Uncle Sam effigies."" Americans, she continued, have gotten to know little beyond the talk of Hezbollah and Hamas support, discussions of nuclear bombs and the rants of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling for, among other things, the destruction of Israel. ""We come from different corners of the world, but we see the same thing,"" Hakakian said of the video of Neda's death. ""You don't need to be Iranian. You don't need to be her neighbor. You don't need to know her name. ... Anyone can watch this and come away with the sense of injustice and what's taking place, and I think that's why it's catching on."" Graphic images have long played a role in driving social awareness and change, said Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. The skeletal figures of concentration camp victims drove home the horrors of the Holocaust. And the brutalized body of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy killed in 1955 for allegedly flirting with a white woman, was shown at the insistence of his mother at his funeral, galvanizing the civil rights movement, Shapiro said. In more recent years, amateur video was credited with capturing the 1991 beating by Los Angeles police of Rodney King. And the first images out of Virginia Tech during the 2007 campus shooting were taken by students before professionals could hit the scene, added Nora Paul, founding director of the Institute for New Media Studies at the University of Minnesota. The challenge today, in a time when anyone can post images, is making sure graphic photos or videos are put in context and used by news organizations in a way that moves stories forward, both Paul and Shapiro agreed. While news outlets may blur faces, offer warnings to viewers or not even use some images, the vastness of the Internet means that once they are out there -- no matter how horrifying or inappropriate for viewers -- it's next to impossible to stop them from being circulated. ""Even if you try to control access, the dam is already broken,"" Paul said. As for the impact on viewers, the effect of disturbing and violent images is hard to measure, said Elana Newman, who teaches psychology at the University of Tulsa and is a specialist in psychological trauma. An image often can communicate ""the depths of pain"" in a way that words alone cannot, Newman said. But she added scholars often debate whether such images turn people away from news, desensitize them or bolster a story's credibility. And there is also the challenge to consider of ""balancing the privacy of the victim with the importance of telling the story."" Her own opinion? ""These images are helpful when these events are far away,"" she said, because they can bring home a story. They, however, are ""not helpful to people when they're in their own backyard."" And the impact on the person who captures the image is often untold. John Filo was a senior photography student at Kent State when he snapped the photo that became a symbol of the shootings on campus and helped propel the anti-war movement at the time. He doesn't remember going through six rolls of film that day, but he remembers being shot at and is all too aware that a mere feet -- even inches -- separated him from life or death. In 13 seconds, four students were killed and nine were wounded. It took ""a good nine years"" for him to sort through the experience, he told CNN. His relationships suffered, as did his confidence as a photographer. He grappled with survivor's guilt, the images he saw but didn't share and the anxiety about how his work affected other people's lives. ""Everyone that was there that day was affected,"" said Filo, now director of photography for CBS media relations. ""At least I had something to do that day. There were people who felt totally helpless -- people who tried to hide behind a four-inch street curb."" When no one could believe what was happening around them, he had the power to show it. ""You sit there as a journalist and say, 'If it was my brother or my mother, would I have taken this picture?' "" he reflected out loud. It's ""your purpose of being there. So yes, if it was my brother, if it was my mother, I'd still shoot the picture.""","Photos from Vietnam, Tiananmen Square and Kent State galvanized movements .

"MANAGUA, Nicaragua (CNN) -- Nicaragua's election council will allow a review of the mayoral election in the nation's capital after opponents of the ruling Sandinista Party raised fraud allegations, the council's president said Wednesday. Opponents of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista party have raised election fraud allegations. Election council President Robert Rivas announced that ballot tally sheets from Managua would be reviewed after violence followed a resounding victory for the Sandinistas in Sunday's municipal elections. The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front won mayoral races in 94 municipalities, while the main opposition party, the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC), captured 46 posts and minor parties won six, according to results provided by the government. The PLC and other groups rejected the results and called for an international investigation. The Organization of American States met with opposition leaders Wednesday. Jose Pallais, a PLC leader, asked for the annulment of the elections. The Supreme Electoral Council is to verify final results by November 23, but a tally is possible by next week. ""Everyone is waiting for the final numbers,"" journalist Rosemary Thornton said. ""Once they do, there might be violence again."" Election critics cite many irregularities for their allegations, including the government's refusal to allow foreign and local monitors, the delay in tabulating ballots and discrepancies between results certified by election officials and the tallies released on television. In addition, ballots were found in trash dumps in the municipalities of Tipitapa, which is part of Managua, and Leon. La Prensa newspaper published 40 photographs on its Web site that appear to show discarded ballots and other election material at an unnamed dump. Ethics and Transparency, a Nicaraguan observer group that was not sanctioned by the government, has reported discrepancies in about one-third of the polls it monitored. The group said it had 30,000 volunteers nationwide monitoring the election. The monitoring group said the results in more than 100 of the 146 elections were correct, a local newspaper reported. But the results in another 30 municipalities require further investigation into possible irregularities, La Prensa newspaper said on its Web site, citing Ethics and Transparency executive director Roberto Courtney. The Catholic Church asked the electoral council for a recount. The Sandinista government is led by President Daniel Ortega, a leader in the guerrilla movement that ousted Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979. Ortega served as president from 1985-90. After three unsuccessful bids, he won the presidency again in 2006. Sunday's elections were the first since he regained the presidency.","Ballot tally sheets will be reviewed in mayoral election in nation's capital, Managua .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A defiant and chaotic protest sprouted in and around a public square Monday despite a warning by Iran's Revolutionary Guard against the kind of street demonstrations that have roiled Iran for more than a week, witnesses said. Security forces patrol the streets of Tehran on Monday. Thousands of Iranians congregated and passed through Haft-e Tir Square, but riot police and the pro-government Basij militia confronted them and smacked their batons against their shin guards, making loud cracking sounds that seemed like gunshots, the witnesses said. As the protests continued, an election official with the Interior Ministry said the ""box-by-box details"" of the ballots -- which were confidential in previous elections -- would be released in response to claims that the election was rigged, Press TV reported. Iran's Guardian Council declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner of the election with 62.63 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, received 33.75 percent, surprising many experts who expected him to win. Iranians have continued protesting the results by taking to the streets. Most stores around the square were closed as the unrest reverberated, with some guarding against damage by erecting steel fences on their windows. Helicopters hovered overhead as the security forces wielded batons and used a spray to push the crowd out of the square. After that, police chased down demonstrators in nearby alleys and streets, with protesters and lawmen playing cat and mouse over several tension-filled hours until the crowd began to thin out around dusk. There were isolated face-offs and quarrels that broke out between demonstrators and the riot police and the Basij militia -- a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard, a military unit under the direct control of Iran's supreme leader. There were no reports of serious injuries, but there were at least eight arrests, witnesses said. ""Thirty years after the revolution, this is what we get,"" one man said dejectedly, watching the noisy and chaotic scene as he remembered the birth and the promise of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. The location was the spot where a vigil was to be held in memory of Neda, a young woman who became a symbol for the opposition after her death was caught on camera. While Internet postings on Twitter, Facebook and an Iranian opposition leader's Web site had mentioned a possible rally, it was unclear whether people who were at the square were there for a vigil. Some people were clad in black, a symbol of mourning, but placards and banners about Neda and candles have not been seen. However, security forces and demonstrators appeared at the square at the time the vigil was to be held.  Watch how women are on front line of protests » . Meanwhile, a message on opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's Facebook page, which could not be authenticated, called for a peaceful demonstration in Tehran on Thursday to honor the dead. ""We are waiting for the route of the march to be announced as well as the location of the sit-in,"" the message said. ""Presently the mausoleum of the founder of the Islamic Republic seems to be the safest place for the sit-in, so that we can mourn for our martyrs in a place that is close to the spirit of that free man. Demonstrators Monday had brushed off a warning from the Revolutionary Guard that people who ""disturb the peace and stand up to security forces"" would be met with a strong response. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the Revolutionary Guard as saying ""the guardians of the Islamic revolution and the courageous Basiji together with the security forces following the orders of the supreme leader and following him unquestioningly."" It said the authorities ""are determined to act strongly to return peace and tranquility to society ... and to clean the country of these plotters and hooligans."" Iran's Revolutionary Guard is directly under the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and enforces the government's Islamic codes and morality. With more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals. The regime's lawmakers called for a review of ties with Britain amid concerns over so-called Western ""meddling"" in the country's daily unrest. The government-funded Press TV reported that Iranian lawmakers were calling for a review of the country's ties with Britain because of its ""interference in Iran's recent post-election unrest."" Britain's Foreign Office announced Monday it is withdrawing the family members of its embassy staff from Iran until the situation there improves. News coverage in Iran has been limited by government restrictions on international journalists. On Sunday, the BBC said Iran had expelled Jon Leyne, the British network's permanent correspondent in Tehran. Al-Arabiya, a Dubai-based Arab satellite network, said its Tehran bureau was ordered closed. At least 19 people were killed in clashes in Tehran on Saturday as Iranians took to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 presidential election, according to hospital sources. Iranian-funded Press TV confirmed 13 fatalities, while unconfirmed reports put the number as high as 150.

"(CNN) -- Attacks in January and February by Sudanese forces on Darfur villagers are described in a U.N. report as ""violations of international humanitarian and human rights law."" Between January and February, Sudanese forces killed 115 people -- including women, children and elderly -- in air and ground attacks on four Darfur villages, according to the report.  Prepared by the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur, the report says attacks in January and February point to a deliberate plan to destroy civilian infrastructure. Helicopter gunships and fixed-wing aircraft targeted the villages while armed militias rode in on horses and camels to force about 30,000 people from their homes, according to the report. The attacks were ""carried out during a major military push by the Sudanese government to regain control of West Darfur's northern corridor, and drive out an insurgent group,"" it said. The village of Saraf Jidad, Sudan, was attacked three times in January, while the villages of Sirbal, Silea and Abu Suruj were attacked within hours of each other on February 8, UNAMID said in the report. The militias and the Sudanese armed forces looted, vandalized and burned homes, schools, shops, community centers and other buildings in the villages, the report said. Sometimes, buildings were burned with people inside, it said. The attacks ""amount to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law,"" they said. ""The scale of destruction of civilian property, including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of a military strategy."" The Sudanese government had no immediate response. However, last week, Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir accused the international media of ""exaggerating"" the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq, the Palestinian territories and Somalia. He said the crisis in Darfur is a ""media fabrication"" and that in most of the region there is little or no conflict and people are living normal lives, he said. Citing Sudanese government statistics, el-Bashir said fewer than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and fewer than 500,000 have been displaced. International figures, including U.N. data, put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000, with another 2.5 million people displaced. The conflict began five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government. Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed, which have allegedly committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the United Nations of widespread human rights abuses. El-Bashir rejects claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines. At the start of this year, more than 9,000 UNAMID peacekeeping troops were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering. Plans are for the force to eventually number 26,000. E-mail to a friend .","Report: January through February, Sudanese forces killed 115 people in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins have won the Stanley Cup for a third time after a pair of second-period goals by Max Talbot gave them a narrow 2-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings in the deciding game of the best-of-seven series. The Penguins celebrate with the Stanley Cup after claiming a narrow game seven victory at Detroit. Talbot opened the scoring early in the second period and added a second on a two-on-one break midway through the session to help the Penguins to avenge their defeat to the Red Wings in last year's finals. Jonathan Ericsson pulled a goal back for the home side with just over six minutes remaining in the game but Detroit were unable to prevent Pittsburgh from becoming the first team in 38 years to claim the Stanley Cup with a game seven victory on the road. The Penguins, who last won the title in 1992, were depriving the Red Wings of becoming the first team since Detriot themselves (in 1998) to retain the Stanley Cup. ""We're going to enjoy this one. We're going to sit back and relish the moment. We're going to get our names on the Cup, and we'll get our day with it,"" Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma told their official Web site. The result proved a difficult pill to swallow for Red Wings winger Marian Hossa. Last summer, the Slovakian turned down a lucrative long-term contract with the Penguins, thought to be worth in the region of $50 million, to sign a one-year $7.5m deal with Detroit -- thinking they had a better chance of hoisting the Stanley Cup. However, he failed to score once in the finals and cast a lonely figure watching his former team-mates lift the trophy.","The Pittsburgh Penguins secure Stanley Cup for the third time in their history .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama is planning to sign an executive order Monday to overturn Bush-era policy that limited federal tax dollars for embryonic stem cell research, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations. President Obama will overturn Bush policy on embryonic stem cell research, administration officials say. Obama's move will be hailed by advocates for those suffering from a host of afflictions, ranging from diabetes to Parkinson's disease, who believe that an expansion of stem-cell research could boost medical progress toward eradicating the debilitating diseases. But many conservatives object to the destruction of human embryos because they contend that it ends a human life. The officials said the administration is planning a Monday event at the White House at which Obama will overturn the executive order signed by President George W. Bush in August 2001. It barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time.  Interactive: Unlocking the promise of stem cells » . Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council accused the White House of leaking the details Friday night so that the move gets little attention, declaring that it is ""a slap in the face to Americans who believe in the dignity of all human life."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said, ""Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C., and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos."" In addition to signing the executive order, Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research. At the time, Bush also argued that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos. Bush's moves led to Democratic charges that he had put politics over science.","NEW: Critic says move is ""a slap in the face"" to many Americans .

"(CNN) -- The ""King of Pop"" had been topping music charts long before he ever pulled on that white-sequined glove, made the moonwalk a household move and sent screaming fans into a frenzy. In spite of all of the rumors and his ""Wacko Jacko"" persona, Jackson's musical draw remained strong. But the spotlight that followed Michael Jackson, earned him headlines and made him a tabloid favorite as an adult, often had little to do with the artistry. While filming a commercial for Pepsi in 1984, a pyrotechnic accident set his hair ablaze, leaving him with second-degree burns on his scalp and igniting what would eventually became an odyssey of reconstructive work. Rumors about his face, the ever-changing nose and lightening skin fueled the ""Wacko Jacko"" persona, a moniker he'd be given later and seem to embrace. There was, for instance, Bubbles, a chimpanzee he adopted, befriended and allowed to share his toilet. Jackson didn't fight and even perpetuated claims, even though they weren't true, that he'd bought the remains of The Elephant Man and slept in a hyperbaric chamber -- although he would deny both years later during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. It was then, in that 1993 interview, that he also shot down rumors that he was dying his skin to make it lighter. Instead, he spoke for the first time about having vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disorder. iReport.com: Share your favorite Jackson memory . Meantime, he had designed his dream home, the Neverland Ranch in Santa Ynez, California, as if he were the Peter Pan he so admired. Replete with a zoo, his own amusement park and the bevy of children who surrounded, played and sometimes slept over with him, he proudly set out to recapture the childhood he publicly said he'd never had. Allegations of what went on privately, however, landed him in a big-boy pool of legal hot water. He was accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy. Soon after came talk about his addiction to prescription drugs. He settled the civil lawsuit with the accusing family in 1994 and was never charged criminally. Then came the shocking, albeit relatively short-lived, marriage to Lisa Marie Presley -- a move that set off a whole new round of speculations.  More facts about Jackson's life » . Did he tie the knot to fight the child abuse speculations that dogged him? Was this eccentric ""King"" aspiring to be the son-in-law of ""The King,"" Elvis Presley? Or could it have been true love? Despite this two-year marriage, and the reported relationships he'd had earlier with Tatum O'Neal, Stephanie Mills and Brooke Shields, Jackson remained sexually ambiguous and, in many people's eyes, sexless altogether. He'd later marry once more for several years, this time a nurse named Debbie Rowe. People debated whether they consummated that marriage or if artificial insemination played a role, but Jackson left in 1999 with custody of two children, a son known as Prince Michael and a daughter named Paris. For years when they appeared in public, the children wore veils or masks. Prince Michael II was born in 2002. An unidentified woman gave birth after reportedly being artificially inseminated with Jackson's sperm. His second son was semi-revealed to the public in Berlin, Germany, when Jackson momentarily dangled the baby, his face hidden beneath a blanket, over a balcony four stories above the ground and a mass of fans.  Watch Jackson introduce Prince Michael II » . It was yet another move that spawned talk and accusations, and it was one he'd apologize for later. In recent years there was yet another child sexual abuse accusation, one Jackson was acquitted of in May 2005. The trial was a media spectacle, and one where the fashion icon wore his pajama bottoms to court and danced atop a car. He also had enormous financial problems to deal with and narrowly escaped bankruptcy and foreclosure on his Neverland property. But in spite of all of this, Jackson's draw remained strong. More than 25 years after the release of his epic album, ""Thriller,"" it was being celebrated again. He was scheduled to start what he described at a March press conference as his ""final curtain call"" concert tour, which had recently been postponed to next year.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Jackson had a level of hero worship on a par with Elvis Presley or the Beatles but he was the first black star to inspire such a massive following around the world. Michael Jackson, the ultimate showman, craved attention and was rarely disappointed. Total worldwide sales of more than 350 million records over his 40-year career give just a hint of the adoration there was for the ""King of Pop."" The fact that his death came on the eve of a comeback tour in London will leave his devotees feeling even more bereft. While his career -- and wealth -- had waned greatly in recent years, there was still enough support for the concerts to sell out at a rate of nearly 40,000 an hour. Fans from as far afield as Japan, Germany and Dubai queued to buy their tickets. Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jockey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when ""Thriller"" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. His was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. ""He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,"" Greenberg said. ""He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it."" Jackson was known for far more than his music though. Speaking after his death in Los Angeles was announced, U.S. civil rights campaigner Rev. Al Sharpton paid tribute to the work of a ""trailblazer"" in helping people around the world through his charities. How will you remember Michael Jackson? Sharpton added that the song Jackson co-wrote with Lionel Richie, ""We Are the World,"" a 1985 charity single that raised an estimated $50 million for famine relief in Africa, ushered in Live Aid and the era of celebrity philanthropy. Jackson was the supreme showman who had an unrivalled knack of grabbing headlines. From his precocious abilities as the 11-year-old singer in the Jackson 5 to his legendary ""moon-walk"" dance, the star craved attention, and was rarely disappointed.  Jackson ""as big as it gets"" » . But in the years after his colossal 1982 hit album ""Thriller"" and its 1987 follow-up ""Bad,"" much of the focus did not cast him in a good light. In 1996 the lead singer of Pulp, Jarvis Cocker, caused a furor at the Brit Awards in London when he invaded the stage during Jackson's performance of ""Earth Song"" in protest ""at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing."" Jackson failed to see the humor in Cocker's mockery, responding that he was ""sickened, saddened, shocked, upset, cheated, angry"" by the protest. He also alleged that Cocker had attacked children on stage, something that the Pulp singer denied. But many in the music industry backed Cocker, who was arrested but later released without charge. The theme of children was one that continued to haunt Jackson. In 2002 he caused a public outcry by dangling his baby son Prince Michael II from a third-floor hotel balcony in Germany before the world's press. He later said he regretted the incident.  Watch video of the incident » . And in a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir that was supposed to repair his image around the world, the singer revived allegations of child abuse when he said of sharing a bed with a young boy: ""It's a beautiful thing. It's very right, it's very loving. Because what's wrong with sharing a love?"" A warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of sexually molesting 12-year-old Gavin Arvizo. Jackson surrendered himself to police amid a media furor. In the 2005 trial conducted in the glare of the world's media spotlight, Jackson was cleared of child molestation charges. Following the trial, Jackson's finances took a hit and he was forced to sell his Neverland ranch in California. He later kept a low profile in the United States and spent time in Britain, where his friends included psychic spoonbender Uri Geller and Harrod's owner Mohamed Al Fayed, and also in Bahrain. But in November last year, Jackson was sued by an Arab sheikh at the High Court in London for $7.7 million. They parted ""amicably"" after agreeing a settlement. Jackson had been invited with his children and entourage to Bahrain by the king's son, Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who lavished money on Jackson and built a recording studio, which he believed would be used to record albums by Jackson using material the sheikh had helped to write. But Jackson insisted there was no valid agreement and that the sheikh's case was based on ""mistake, misrepresentation and undue influence."" He said sums of money paid out by the sheikh were ""gifts.""

One car was ""about 75 percent compressed,"" and recovery workers aren't sure if any more bodies are inside, Fenty told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night. ""We just haven't been able to cut through it to see if there's bodies in there,"" Fenty said. A certified nursing assistant who was on one of the trains told CNN affiliate WUSA she was trying to help those in severe condition after the crash, including a lady who appeared to be in her 20s. ""She is very, very torn in her legs -- the muscles and everything are torn, ripped through. She had metal pieces in her face,"" said the nursing assistant, who said her name was Jeanie. Other witnesses described seeing more blood than they had seen before. Tom Baker, who was in the train that hit the stationary train, told WUSA that after the collision, he looked toward the front of the car, and when the smoke cleared, ""all you could see was sky."" Jasmine Gars, who also was on the moving train, told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that the collision ""was like nothing I've ever felt before."" ""It was like we hit a concrete wall,"" Gars said. ""Almost immediately I fell off my seat. Another person -- I don't know who -- flew off their seat. And the lights went off and smoke started filling the train car."" Four people were taken to Providence Hospital in Washington, including two with back injuries, one with a hip injury and one complaining of dizziness from hitting her head, hospital officials said. Washington Hospital Center reported seven patients from the crash with injuries ranging from serious to minor, while Howard University Hospital reported three and Suburban Hospital in Maryland reported two. Groups of people wearing green plastic ribbons to show they had been checked by paramedics left the scene about 90 minutes after the crash. Some were crying, and a woman with her arm in a sling who gave her name as Tijuana described the crash as ""an earthquake."" A National Transportation Safety Board team arrived to investigate the crash, assisted by the FBI Evidence Response Team, according to NTSB board member Deborah Hersman, who said she walked the tracks by the wreckage. ""I can tell you it is a scene of real devastation down there,"" she said. Hersman said both trains contained six cars. One train struck the other train from the rear and and its ""first car overrode the last car of the other train in an accordion fashion,"" she said. She said it wasn't clear if the trains involved in the accident carried devices that recorded speed and other data. At least two FBI officials were at the scene, and the FBI confirmed it was assisting as part of the National Capital Response Squad. Amy Kudwa of the Department of Homeland Security said ""at this early stage,"" there was no indication of anything other than an accidental collision.  It was the second Metro crash to involve fatalities in the 33-year history of the transit authority. In January 1982, a derailment killed three people. The only other collision between Metro trains occurred in 2004. ""We are extremely saddened that there are fatalities as a result of this accident, which has touched our Metro family,"" Catoe said in a statement.   ""Our safety officials are investigating, and will continue to investigate until we determine why this happened and what must be done to ensure it never happens again.""","One train was stationary when crash happened, Metro official says .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's autobiography, ""My Remarkable Journey,"" published by Weinstein books. Larry King anchors ""Larry King Live"" at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. Larry, left, at age 10 with his younger brother, Marty, shortly after their father died. I was walking home from the library carrying nine books. That's the way my memory sees it. I can't know for sure if it was exactly nine books. Maybe I picture nine books because I was nine years old. I'm certain that I was nine years old, because I'm sure of the date -- June 9, 1943. There were a lot of books under my arm on that summer day because I loved books. I wonder what happened to those nine books ... There were three squad cars in front of my apartment building. Flivvers, we called them. I don't remember exactly when I started to hear my mother's screams. But as I hurried up the steps, a cop quickly came down, straight for me. He picked me up and the books went flying. Watch Larry on his ""Remarkable journey"" » . I'm not sure if I knew the cop. But I may have. For years, before the war started and my father went to work in the defense plant, he'd owned a little neighborhood bar and grill. He was friendly with all the cops. The cops loved my father the way they loved any bar owner who had a great sense of humor. I remember having my own police costume when I was very young. A badge and a little nightstick came with it. I'd make like I was walking the beat. The cop put me in the squad car. He told me that my father had died. Heart attack. I didn't cry. I remember that. I didn't cry. I was more befuddled than anything else. It must have been difficult for the cop. He started the car and drove. We wound through the streets of Brownsville and ended up at a movie theater. I'll never forget the movie, Bataan, starring Robert Taylor as Sergeant Bill Dane. It was about a bunch of American soldiers trying to stave off the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Larry King's life in pictures » . Sergeant Dane and his patrol are ordered to blow up a bridge to stop the advancing enemy. They're cut down one by one until only Sergeant Dane and two others remain. The first is killed by a sniper. The second is stabbed by a Japanese soldier who'd been playing dead. The movie ends with Sergeant Dane firing his machine gun straight into the camera at the Japanese soldiers coming at him in one last act of courage and defiance. I don't remember what it was like when I got home that day. A lot about that day I've blocked out. My younger brother Marty has blocked it out, too. He was only six at the time. But there are a few more memories attached. I didn't go to the funeral. I'd been so close to my father -- yet I refused to go. I stayed at home. There must've been somebody watching me, but I remember being alone. I remember bouncing a spaldeen -- the Spalding rubber ball we used to play stickball -- off the front stoop. Two other things I can tell you for sure. I never went back to that library again, and from that day on I was nervous if I saw a squad car in my neighborhood. If one parked by my apartment building, I'd start running home, in fear that my mother had died.","Larry was 9 years old when his father died of a heart attack in 1943 .

"(CNN)  -- To guard against public indifference to climate change the United Nations has enlisted a coalition of the world's leading advertising agencies. The world in their hands: New campaign aims to empower public. Leading up to the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen in December, the global ""Hopenhagen"" campaign has been unveiled. The initiative is aiming to generate active interest and persuade the public into believing they have a say in the negotiations between world leaders that will ratify a new global climate treaty. ""Climate change is one of the epic challenges facing this and future generations. World leaders will come together for the Copenhagen climate change conference in December, and every citizen of the world has a stake in the outcome. It is time to seal a deal. We need a global movement that mobilizes real change,"" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a press statement. ""It is about global action for a global climate treaty and a better future for humankind."" The campaign is a collaboration between a number of the world's largest communications companies. The strategy and creative concept for the Hopenhagen idea came from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather team; digital framework and direction were developed by MDC Partners' Colle+McVoy; and the global PR and messaging plans are spearheaded by Omnicom Group's Ketchum. Michael Lee, executive director of the International Advertising Association called the coalition of media companies involved ""unprecedented,"" adding that it was ""testament to the significance the industry places on the need for action to address climate change."" According to the campaign brief, the aim is to change from the idea that we are just ""coping"" with global climate challenges to ""hoping"" and ultimately acting to combat the perils of climate change. The Hopenhagen Web site will be the center of an open source campaign where the public can send messages to the delegates of the UN summit meeting as well as raise awareness and debate issues. While the Web site will be developed as the months go by, the IAA also hopes that businesses, governments and NGOs engage in the campaign as well to create a broad global community with shared goals. Unveiled at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival this week, the first elements of the campaign can be seen at New York's JFK International, LA International and London Heathrow airports. From September a more ""aggressive"" consumer launch of the campaign will commence until the conference begins on December 7. What do you think?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The U.S. Open golf championship had a humble beginning when 11 players in 1895 completed on a nine-hole course in Newport, Rhode Island. Tiger Woods celebrates his triumph over pain with victory in the 2008 U.S. Open . Since then it has gone on to become one of the most prestigious golf events in the world. Now in its 109th year the tournament has produced some truly unforgettable golf. Here CNN takes a look at some of the greatest moments in the history of the shoot-out. Disagree with our assessment of the best moments in U.S. Open history? Let us know by posting your comments on the Sound Off box below. 1 Tiger Woods plays through pain 2008 Woods had struggled throughout the tournament at Torrey Pines with a fractured left leg but was still in contention heading into the final round. The American, who was visibly in pain, managed to summon enough strength to force a play-off with Rocco Mediate after he sunk a 12-foot put on the 72nd green. Woods' mental tenacity then shone through as he maintained his concentration levels to defeat Mediate with a birdie on the 18th hole in the subsequent play-off to claim his 14th major championship. 2 Arnold Palmer's remarkable comeback 1960 Few people would have considered Palmer a contender to lift the title at Cherry Hills Country Club when he began his final round in 15th place -- seven strokes behind leader Mike Souchak -- but what followed was one of the greatest comebacks in golf history. Palmer ousted Ben Hogan and then Jack Nicklaus with a virtually flawless round of 64 to finish on four under and take the U.S. Open crown for the only time in his career by two shots. 3 Ben Watson's chip 1982 There was little to choose between Watson and Jack Nicklaus when the pair came up against each other at Pebble Beach at a time when they were both vying for the title as the best golfer on the planet. In the final round Watson struck perhaps the most famous shot in U.S. Open history, when he produced an audacious chip from a bad lie in thick rough for a birdie on the 71st hole to move a shot clear of Nicklaus before eventually winning the championship by two strokes. 4 Tiger Woods wins by record margin 2000 Old Tom Morris' achievement of a major victory by the record margin of 13 strokes in the British Open in 1862 had not been broken for 138 years, but at the peak of his powers Woods was also to add that accolade to his collection. He finished 15 strokes ahead of second-placed Ernie Els at Pebble Beach and also became the first player in the history of the U.S. Open to finish at double-digits under par as part of his 'Tiger Slam' when he held all four major championship titles. 5 Phil Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie collapse 2006 Australia's Geoff Ogilvy was handed the U.S. Open trophy when two of his rivals for the title pressed the self-destruct button. Ogilvy had earlier chipped in at the 17th and holed a brave putt at the 18th to set the target at five over par for victory. Montgomerie dropped two shots on the 18th hole when a first major title seemed to be within his grasp and moments later Mickelson, who needed only a par to secure the title, also suffered a case of the last-hole jitters and double-bogeyed to completed the double collapse. 6 Ben Hogan puts crash behind him 1950 With heavily bandaged legs after a near-fatal car accident 16 months earlier, which left medical experts predicting he may never walk again, Hogan defied the odds to lift the title at Merion Golf Club. He had struggled to find form in the build up to the tournament which led to some commentators predicting his career was over. But Hogan proved he was made of sterner stuff as he defeated Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18-hole playoff to win his second of four U.S. Open titles. 7 Tony Jacklin dominates in 1970 Europe was without a U.S. Open winner since Willie Macfarlane's victory in 1925 but Jacklin was able to end the 45-year hiatus and give fans across the pond a moment to savor on a challenging course at the Hazeltine National Golf Club. Jacklin produced some superb golf and what made the victory all the more impressive is that he led the event from start to finish, eventually taking the title by seven shots with a margin that has been bettered only by Tiger Woods. 8 Payne Stewart wins four months before death 1999 Famed for his eccentric patterned trousers and ivy caps Stewart won the last of his three major titles at the Pinehurst Resort. Having first won the U.S. Open in 1991 Stewart clinched his second title in style when he rolled in a superb 20-foot par putt at the 18th hole which he celebrated with fist pump over the hole. He was unable to defend his title after he died in a plane crash four months later at the age of 42. 9 Francis Ouimet's shock win 1913 As the leading players of the era Harry Vardon and Ted Ray from Great Britain were hot favorites to land the title at The Country Club in Brookline. But the pair were shocked by the performance of the relatively unknown 20-year-old American who became the first amateur to win the U.S. Open after victory in an 18-hole play-off. Ouimet's modest background saw him turned into a folk hero and the unlikely victory also helped raise the profile of the sport which had been considered the preserve of the elite up to that point. 10 Glover conquers Mickelson and Duval 2009   American journeyman Lucas Glover denies Phil Mickelson, a perennial bridesmaid at the event, a fairytale victory at Bethpage Black. It was the 29-year-old's first major title, but what was of greater note was the fact Glover won with a final round three-over-par 73 in tough and windy conditions, holing only one birdie on the final day.","Some of the most memorable moments in golf have been at the U.S. Open .
Remarkable comebacks against the odds feature strongly in the list .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- DreamWorks Studios will back out of plans to produce a movie about the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. unless King's three surviving children settle their differences over the deal, the studio said Wednesday. From left, Dexter, Bernice, Martin and Yolanda King. The three surviving siblings have had several public rifts. A longtime friend of the three Kings predicted peace may be at hand for the squabbling siblings and that all of them want Steven Spielberg's studio to portray their father's life on the big screen. The latest public rift between Dexter King, the chief executive of the King estate, and his brother and sister -- Martin Luther King III and Bernice King -- erupted Tuesday after it was made public that Dexter King, 48, had finalized the deal with DreamWorks. Martin King, 51, and Bernice King, 46, learned that a deal had been struck when Dexter sent them an e-mail Tuesday morning, just as the news media was being told by the studio, a source close to the family told CNN. Yolanda King, the eldest of the Kings' four children, died two years ago at age 51. Martin King and Bernice King, who live in Atlanta, Georgia, had known that Dexter King, who lives in California, was negotiating with Spielberg on a possible movie deal, the source said. Bernice King and Martin King said they knew nothing about the DreamWorks project. They said they embraced the idea of a film about their father but told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" they were concerned about the deal. ""I think Mr. Spielberg is a great producer and we look forward to hearing from him about the scope of this agreement,"" Bernice King said. ""We know nothing about the scope of this agreement. We have no details to say whether or not this particular one is a good idea."" DreamWorks issued a statement Wednesday that suggested King family unity was essential for the movie to be made. ""The purpose of making a movie about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is to tell a great story which could bridge distances and bring people together,"" the statement said. ""We remain committed to pursuing a film chronicling Martin Luther King's life provided that there is unity in the family so we can make a film about unity in our nation."" DreamWorks executives appeared caught by surprise by the King family's infighting, although such squabbles are not new -- Martin King and Bernice King filed a lawsuit against Dexter King last year over publication of their mother's recently discovered love letters. Martin King and Bernice King have complained in court filings that Dexter King has acted independently for years on estate business matters, refusing to call a family meeting. Over the past year, angered over Dexter King's move to publish their mother's love letters, neither Martin King nor Bernice King has spoken to Dexter King, the source close to the family said. Dexter King, in a written statement Wednesday evening, said he has ""always upheld my duty"" as CEO of the King estate to communicate with the others. ""Although my communication with family members has been somewhat stymied by the current litigation, I have continued to reach out and I remain committed to working together with my siblings on projects to educate people about the life, leadership and teachings of our father, Martin Luther King Jr.,"" Dexter King said. DreamWorks is ""a company with unrivaled resources for making epic films of the highest quality, offers an unprecedented opportunity for educating the largest possible audience about our father's legacy as the leader of America's greatest nonviolent movement,"" he said. ""Just as Sir Richard Attenborough's film, 'Gandhi,' educated many millions of people all over the world about the Mahatma's teachings, I believe this project can do the same regarding the life, work and teachings of Martin Luther King Jr., and I sincerely hope my brother and sister will join us in supporting this urgently needed project,"" Dexter King said. Tom Houck, an Atlanta public relations agent who has known all three children since the 1960s, when he was their father's driver, suggested the dispute could be resolved. ""I don't think that either Martin or Bernice are opposed to having a megafilm done on the big screen by DreamWorks, but I think it's the mechanism and the way it was done that's got them upset,"" Houck said. ""They're feeling that, until they resolve some problems with Dexter, that they're not going to be very forthcoming in letting this project go forward,"" he said. Houck suggested someone such as the Rev. Andrew Young, a close aide to the patriarch during the civil-rights movement, might be able to help the siblings reconcile. Young is a former Atlanta mayor and former U.N. ambassador. ""Martin and Bernice want to have some reconciliation with Dexter before they sign off on it,"" Houck said.","DreamWorks Studios hesitates on movie about Martin Luther King Jr.

"(CNN) -- Kimberley Locke knows a thing or two about singing competitions. ""American Idol"" finalist Kimberley Locke is the new co-host of ""Gospel Dream."" Having placed third during season two of ""American Idol"" -- just behind winner Ruben Studdard and runner-up Clay Aiken -- the singer is back in reality show action as the new co-host of ""Gospel Dream."" The Gospel Music Channel's talent search is going into its fourth season, and Locke joins fellow host Mike Kasem (son of Casey Kasem) and the judges -- gospel artist J. Moss, Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams and industry executive Mitchell Solarek -- on the show. Locke has worked steadily since she first burst onto the ""Idol"" scene in 2003. She has modeled, served as a spokesperson for plus-sized clothier Lane Bryant and Jenny Craig and appeared on VH1's ""Celebrity Fit Club."" All the while, she has continued to pursue her music. Her ""8th World Wonder"" was a big hit, making the Top 10 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts. She's had three dance chart No. 1s. Locke recently spoke with CNN about the ""Gospel Dream,"" life after ""American Idol"" and the one reality show she really wants to appear on next. CNN: How did you get involved with ""Gospel Dream?"" Kimberley Locke: Funny enough, I've been wanting to do more hosting, and I had been talking to my manager about it. They contacted me out of the blue, and I was like ""Oh, I put it out to the universe, and here it is."" CNN: Are you a gospel music fan? Locke: I am a gospel music fan. Of course I grew up in the church singing gospel music. I don't listen to as much as I used to, but I used to sing in a girl a cappella group and that's how we started, performing in church. CNN: Why do you think so many performers in the music industry come out of the church? Locke: I think a lot of people become stars in their church. ... The church environment is so supportive. When you are first starting out and learning how to sing in front of an audience, that's the kind of audience you want to be in front of. Even if you mess up and you sound horrible, they kind of let you stand there and collect yourself while the pianist keeps playing. Then they plow through it with you. That's a part of the business, a professionalism that really comes in handy when you get to this level. CNN: You've had some experiences with singing competitions. How is ""Gospel Dream"" different? Locke: It's different in that the contestants are very focused on where they want to be and the type of music they want to sing. When you are on ""Idol,"" you are forced to fit into all of these different genres you may or may not want to do and you may or may not even be familiar with them. The ""Gospel Dream"" contestants' direction is really clear and defined, so they are picking songs that really speak to them on a personal level.  Watch Locke talk about the show » . CNN: How has life been for you post-""Idol?"" Locke: Life has been great post-""Idol."" So many opportunities, so many things I would have never imagined. Things that I didn't even associate with singing, like modeling, hosting, being a spokesperson, owning a restaurant. It just opened so many doors. CNN: You were a plus-sized model and spokesperson for Lane Bryant, but now you are way too small to do that. Locke: That really opened me up to bond with my fans. I tell people I'm still a big girl at heart. CNN: When is your next album coming out? Locke: I just started working on the next album. We are in the very preliminary stages of putting together the concept of the record and we just compiled a bunch of songs to start listening to. CNN: Are you planning on doing any other reality shows? Locke: I'm not really a big reality show fan. I did ""Celebrity Fit Club"" because there was a purpose behind that in my wanting to lose weight. There is only one reality show I really, really want to do, and that's ""Dancing With the Stars."" I want to be on that show because then I'd lose the extra 10 to 15 pounds I want to lose.","Singer Kimberley Locke finished third during season two of ""American Idol""

"(CNN)  -- Pop icon Michael Jackson, 50, who died Thursday afternoon after being rushed to a Los Angeles hospital in cardiac arrest, had a long history of confirmed health problems, in addition to rumored conditions. Michael Jackson, seen here in 2005, was taken to UCLA Medical Center in cardiac arrest Thursday. In 1984, Jackson was burned while singing for a Pepsi-Cola commercial in Los Angeles, when a special-effects smoke bomb misfired. He had to have major surgery on his scalp and said that because of the intense pain, he developed an addiction to painkillers. He also was reported to have a form of lupus in the 1980s, but it was later said to have gone into remission. Jackson also had had numerous plastic surgeries, including rhinoplasty and a chin implant. In 1993, Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, released a statement saying that Jackson had a skin disease called vitiligo. The condition causes a person to lose melanin, the pigment that determines the color of skin, hair and eyes, in patches or all over the body. Vitiligo affects 1 million to 2 million people in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health, and no one knows what causes it.  Learn about the difference between heart attack and stroke . He was also hospitalized with chest pains in 1990 and postponed a concert because of dehydration in August 1993. A concert tour was cut short in November 1993 because of an addiction to prescription painkillers amid allegations of child molestation. During a rehearsal at the Beacon Theater in New York in December 1995, the entertainer collapsed onstage from apparent dehydration and low blood pressure and was hospitalized. While jurors deliberated in a case in which he was accused of child molestation in June 2005, Jackson went to a hospital for treatment of what his spokeswoman said was recurring back pain. He had complained of back problems before. Rumors circulated in December that Jackson was ill and in need of a lung transplant because of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare genetic condition. More rumors emerged in May that Jackson had skin cancer. But Randy Phillips, president and CEO of AEG Live,  told CNN at the time, ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever."" Jackson apparently collapsed in his home in Los Angeles on Thursday and was taken by ambulance to UCLA Medical Center.  Watch CNN's Sanjay Gupta talk with Anderson Cooper about Jackson's death » . Jackson family attorney Brian Oxman told CNN on Thursday that Jackson's use of medications had gotten in the way of doing rehearsals. ""His injuries, which he had sustained performing, where he had broken a vertebra and he had broken his leg from a fall on the stage, were getting in the way. I do not know the extent of the medications that he was taking,"" he said. Cardiac arrest, distinct from heart attack, affects about 300,000 Americans every year, Dr. Clyde Yancy of the American Heart Association told CNN. Without immediate efforts to resuscitate a person, the survival rate is usually 5 percent to 15 percent, he said. If resuscitation takes longer than three to five minutes, a person could experience profound impairments, particularly neurologically, he said. Beyond five minutes, the likelihood of success falls quickly, especially in older people. Younger people can tolerate cardiac arrest somewhat better, he said.","Jackson was burned while singing for a Pepsi-Cola commercial in 1984 .

"(CNN) -- Monica Conyers, Detroit's embattled City Council president pro tempore, pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring to commit bribery, a federal court representative in Michigan told CNN. Detroit City Council member, Monica Conyers, admits accepting bribes to sway a $1.2 billion contract vote. Conyers, 44, admitted accepting bribes in exchange for her vote to sway the City Council to approve Synagro Technologies Inc.'s $1.2 billion contract in 2007. It's unclear when Conyers, the wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers, began her relationship with Synagro, but court papers say she received money from Synagro until December 2007. Conyers voted in favor of the wastewater treatment contract on November 20, 2007, the same day she received an envelope filled with cash from Detroit businessman Rayford Jackson, court papers say. Jackson pleaded guilty to providing Conyers with the money. He had been a paid consultant of Synagro. On December 4, 2007, Conyers received another envelope of cash from Jackson in a McDonald's parking lot, said Terrence Berg, the U.S. attorney from the eastern district of Michigan. ""She was the swing vote in this deal,"" Berg said. ""She used her power to get the deal done, and she acknowledged that."" The mood was somber at Conyers' office on Friday, an official there told CNN. A few office workers cried. They found out about the developments through news reports, said Denise Tolliver, Conyers' deputy chief of staff. ""We've been going through this for a while,"" Tolliver said. ""Reporters would ask us questions about anonymous sources, and we just didn't believe them."" Office workers were preparing for an afternoon meeting with City Council President Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr. later Friday. According to state law, Conyers will have to forfeit her seat, Tolliver said. Cockrel said there's language in the law that makes it unclear whether she needs to forfeit her seat immediately or after sentencing . ""It hurts the City Council's image, for sure,"" Cockrel said. ""But we need to remember, this is only one member of the council. You can't paint the entire council with the same brush."" For a seven-month period in 2008, Cockrel replaced former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick after Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to two counts of obstructing justice. During that time Cockrel terminated the city's contract with Synagro because of rumors circulating about bribes, he said. Conyers faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, according to prosecutors. Synagro would not comment on Conyers' plea, but a spokeswoman said, ""We have cooperated fully with the federal investigation and will continue to do so.""","Detroit City Council president pro tempore admits taking bribes for contract .

"(CNN) -- Few have had a bigger influence on today's musical artists than Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson performs with Usher in September 2001 at Madison Square Gardens in New York City. Younger singers, from Justin Timberlake to Usher and Chris Brown, have emulated his dance moves, his look and his sound. He was, for many, the ultimate performer. ""[His influence] feels like something that is instilled and embedded in anyone who wanted to create anything musically,"" said Marsha Ambrosius, one half of the duo Floetry that wrote the single ""Butterflies."" That single appeared on Jackson's 2001 ""Invincible"" album. ""He will always be the King of Pop, and no one will ever be able to fill those shoes with those shiny socks and that glove,"" Ambrosius said. For many of the younger generation, he was the first to not just cross over but  explode onto the pop charts from the R & B scene. His phenomenal talent and worldwide appeal made his throne one to be aspired to even as they stood in awe of him. ""If you're a singer and you don't want to be like Michael Jackson, something is wrong,"" said 19-year-old singer and rapper Sean Kingston, who scored a hit in 2007 with the song ""Beautiful Girls."" ""He's a huge influence."" Sonia Murray, a longtime Atlanta-based music columnist, said Jackson was for the younger set what James Brown had been for Jackson: an inspiration. ""It was the many dimensions he had as a performer,"" Murray said. ""A lot of those artists strive to be all around entertainers. Michael looks to James Brown and Sammy Davis Jr. and for the younger guys, he was the closest thing they had."" His music videos were must-see TV, and aspiring artists learned that it took more than just holding a microphone if they really wanted to make it big. ""He was the total package,"" said Gail Mitchell, senior editor for R & B and Hip-hop for Billboard. ""I was talking to somebody the other day about what trends they were seeing, and they said that a lot of the acts these days seem to going back to the whole entertainer thing."" ""It's not just good enough anymore to lip-synch or program your computer, but some of these newer artists are more concerned about putting on a great show for their fans."" Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jokey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when ""Thriller"" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. Greenberg said Jackson ""influenced everyone who has come after him."" ""He's been around so long that everyone on the contemporary scene has come after him,"" Greenberg said. ""His was the first very contemporary, very exciting dance music to emerge after the death of disco."" His was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. ""He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,"" Greenberg said. ""He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it."" His music also crossed genres. He was a favorite of rappers to sample and working with him was a badge of honor in the industry. Producer Dallas Austin worked with him on Michael Jackson's ""HIStory: Past, Present and Future"" and, like the rest of the world, was stunned by his death. ""Michael Jackson was a magical person to work with,"" Austin said in a released statement. ""I am saddened by his death. The world won't be the same without him."" Even for the most hardcore in hip-hop, there was no shame in admitting love for the King of Pop. ""Michael Jackson has always been an inspiration to me as far as his music is concerned,"" Rapper Snoop Dogg told MTV in 2001. ""You can't take nothing from him."" Wyclef Jean released a statement saying ""Michael Jackson was my Musical God."" ""He made me believe that all things are possible, and through real and positive music, he can live forever,"" Jean said. ""I love Michael Jackson. God Bless him."" Floetry member Marsha Ambrosius said she felt blessed to have spent two weeks working with Jackson in New York City a few years ago after he fell in love with a song she had written. She had the opportunity to get to know him, not just as a superstar, but as a fun-loving family man who stayed in touch with her even after the project was finished. ""He was one of the most amazing people you would ever want to meet ,"" she said. ""I can say I worked with the most incredible artist on planet Earth.""

"(CNN) -- Five of the six black high school students charged with attempted murder in 2006 for allegedly beating a white classmate pleaded no contest in a Louisiana court Friday, closing the book on a racially charged case. Terms of the settlement include restitution to Justin Barker, shown here in 2007 in Jena, Louisiana. The men agreed to plea deals that settled lawsuits filed against them by Justin Barker and his family the year after the December 4, 2006, incident in the town of Jena, population 3,000. The case was referred to as the ""Jena Six."" An underage boy also allegedly was involved in the case, but was not named as one of the attackers. Each man, excluding Theo Shaw, was fined $500, must pay $500 in court costs and will have seven days of unsupervised probation. They also were ordered to pay restitution to Justin Barker and to have no contact with the Barker family. The $500 fine was waived for Shaw because of the almost seven months he has spent in jail. According to Barker's mother, Kelli, her son was taken to a hospital with cuts and with injuries to his eyes and ears after the assault. His right eye had blood clots, she said. Parents of the Jena Six say they heard Barker was hurling racial epithets, but Barker's parents insist he did nothing to provoke the beating. In the settlement, the Barkers received an undisclosed amount of money. The family also had sought to retain the right to sue the school board and to receive a percentage of any profits the youths might receive in the next five years from book or video deals, family attorney Henry Lemoine Jr. told CNN before the hearing. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The case drew national headlines when the teens were charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to commit attempted murder. After the charges triggered protests from critics who said they were too strict, a judge reduced the charges against Shaw, Jesse Ray Beard, Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones and Bryant Purvis to battery and conspiracy. The sixth defendant, Mychal Bell, pleaded guilty in December 2007 to a misdemeanor second-degree battery charge and was sentenced to 18 months in jail. At the hearing, attorneys representing the five men read a statement expressing sympathy to the Barkers and acknowledging that Justin Barker did not use a racial slur. They also apologized to the residents of Jena for the uproar caused by the case. ""They are pleased with the settlement. The settlement is under a gag order,"" the Barkers' lawyer, Henry Lemoine Jr., said after the hearing. ""Hopefully, all the wounds that were opened will now be healed."" James Boren, an attorney for Bailey, added, ""We're all proud of our clients, who are doing well."" ""They're moving on with their life.""","The family of Justin Barker filed lawsuits after alleged beating in 2006 in Jena .

"(CNN) -- In 2003, the BET Awards had a priceless moment when Michael Jackson surprised his idol, James Brown, by showing up on stage where the duo thrilled the audience with an electrifying performance. Michael Jackson performed with James Brown at the BET Awards in 2003. This year's show is dedicated to Jackson. Now, both the King of Pop and the Godfather of Soul are gone. Sunday night's 9th Annual BET Awards is sure to be filled with tributes to Jackson, whose videos and performances were a staple for the network in his heyday. BET has already paid tribute to the singer, going wall-to-wall with Jackson videos Thursday night. Many of the celebrities scheduled to attend the show were also fans of the singer and it is expected that the night will provide an opportunity for them to salute the star. ""Words cannot capture the impact Michael Jackson has had on pop culture around the world,"" said Debra L. Lee, chairman and chief executive officer of BET Networks. ""He changed the way we hear and feel and move to music; he epitomized what true musical talent and star power really mean. He is and always will be the King of Pop."" Academy Award-winning actor and R&B singer Jamie Foxx is set to host the show. Several of the scheduled performers include artists, such as Ne-Yo and Beyonce, who have acknowledged the influence of Jackson on their music and careers. The annual event is a premier one for the network and this year's plan was to recognize the musical legacy and longstanding career of the legendary soul trio, the O'Jays, with the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award. Artists Alicia Keys and Wyclef Jean are to be honored with the Humanitarian Award for their respective charitable work. BET CEO Lee said Sunday's show will be dedicated to Jackson and will also pay tribute to his legacy. Lee reflected on Jackson's career and his importance to BET -- which stands for Black Entertainment Television -- in a prepared statement after his death, while also offering heartfelt prayers for the singer's family and friends. ""Michael's influence is felt every day in so many ways at BET Networks, and it's been that way throughout our network's entire 29-year history,"" she said. ""We watched him grow up and, like everyone around the world, he feels like he is a member of our family. ""He will be missed more than we can say ... but his legend and memory live on in the artists, musicians, producers, dancers, fans and everyone else who looks to him for inspiration.""

"(CNN) -- Several of Michael Jackson's comeback concerts in London have been postponed until next year because producers can't be ready in time for the July debut, according to a ""Dear Customer"" e-mail sent to ticket holders Wednesday. Michael Jackson gestures to the crowd at the March announcement of his series of London concerts. The delay comes days after the concert promoter said Jackson was in good health, contrary to media reports he was diagnosed with skin cancer. Jackson's ""This Is It"" shows were to begin July 8 at London's 20,000-capacity O2 Arena. ""It was not an easy decision to change the schedule but in the end we wanted to ensure that all of Michael's fans attending the concerts get the same quality in staging and level of entertainment,"" said the Ticketmaster e-mail sent to someone who bought tickets for the third show. ""In order to deliver a phenomenal and unprecedented show -- the first show on the 8th July will take place on 13th July 2009,"" according AEG Live, the promoter of the London concerts. ""The subsequent shows on 10th July will be moved to 1st March 2010, 12th July will be moved to 3rd March 2010, and the show on the 14th July will be moved to 6th March 2010."" The delay is ""due to the sheer magnitude"" of the concerts, AEG said. The decision ""to move back a few of the opening shows"" was needed ""in order to meet the challenges presented by such a massive and technically complex show,"" it said. Randy Phillips, president and CEO of AEG Live, last week denied reports that Jackson had skin cancer. ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,"" the executive told CNN on Saturday. ""Michael, who is directly involved with all aspects of the styling/choreography/band selection and rehearsals, is working around the clock to ensure this is the show to end all shows!"" AEG said in it's delay announcement. Jackson held open auditions for dancers last month at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, California. Promoters released a video this week showing that process and  ending with a clip of the 12 dancers who were chosen meeting Jackson in an undisclosed gym in the Los Angeles area, where he has been preparing for the shows. Ticketmaster, in its e-mail, assured the ticket holders they would ""have the same seat originally purchased."" ""You do not have to do anything as you will be automatically allocated the same seats and moved to the revised date,"" it said.","Michael Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 shows starting July 8 .

"(AOL Autos) -- It's that time again, when you turn on the A/C to chill out from the summer heat and all you get is hot air! Air conditioning on the fritz? Taking your car to an A/C tech will keep you from getting hot headed. Ughhhh! How do you restore that refreshing, cool air to your vehicle's interior cabin so you can survive the heat? Well ... sit back and relax, and I'll tell you exactly what to expect from your shop. System performance test . First, the tech should perform an A/C system performance test. He/she will first check vent temperature to confirm that the system is indeed inoperative. Should this be the case, the tech will then perform a head pressure check. During this process, gauges are installed on the high and low side of the system to determine if there's any refrigerant in the system. An extremely low (or no) pressure reading usually indicates a lack of refrigerant in the system, which means it has leaked out. Sometimes the pressure reading may be too high, in which case there is a restriction in the system, inhibiting the flow of refrigerant. There are three diagnostic paths, depending on the initial evaluations. Should the system be low on refrigerant, the tech should run a leak test, identify the location of the leak, repair it, and recharge the system with refrigerant and oil. If the pressure in the system is too high, the tech should locate the restriction, often caused by dirt that finds its way to the orifice tube, a small in-line filter designed to screen out any particulates in the system. (Restrictions can occur for other reasons that I will not go into here for the sake of space.) Once the plug is found, it is removed, and dirt is flushed from the system. Finally, if the system seems to be operating properly (all head pressures are in line with factory specifications), then the tech will look to the duct system for problems. The duct system . The engine in your car generates vacuum as a result of taking in air. This vacuum is used for the duct system. How the system works: Vacuum is collected in a vacuum reserve chamber; this device usually resembles a plastic ball or a coffee can. The vacuum builds up inside this chamber and when A/C is called for, vacuum is channeled through the switch and small vacuum lines (capillary tubing) to the servo motor. The servo motor is responsible for opening a special duct door (the air blend door), which directs the correct amount of cool air into the vehicle's cabin. Problems crop up when vacuum is lost due to a cracked vacuum reserve chamber, broken vacuum line, faulty vacuum servomotor, bad switch, or poor engine vacuum. The tech must track down the cause of the vacuum loss and repair it in order to restore the system. Other causes of poor HVAC air volume are broken air blend door or door hinge, organic debris in the fan squirrel cage inhibiting airflow, worn blower motor shaft bearings slowing down the squirrel cage, or electrical wiring / component problems that control fan operation. Proper A/C leak test procedure . The main cause of A/C system failure is refrigerant leak. This system is a closed system, so the refrigerant chemical and lubricant are sealed from the outside atmosphere. When a leak forms, the system drains of both refrigerant chemical and the lubricant vital to compressor life and function. In addition, moisture and dirt can get in through the leak causing contamination. This contamination eats away at the inside of the system resulting in rust and scale buildup, corrosion and erosion in vital A/C system parts. Proper A/C system leak tests are necessary to identify the source of a leak. There are three types of leak inspections: visual, halogen, and dye testing. The visual test includes inspection of all lines and external components (specifically condensers, hi and low pressure lines, compressors, air dryers, and expansion valves). Any indication of refrigerant oil on these components is an indication of a leak and the component must be replaced. The halogen tester is designed to detect the presence of leaking refrigerant gas, which is odorless and colorless. The tech scans the system with the flexible probe on the tester. If there is a leak, then the tester will howl, light up, or click. Finally, if the tech is convinced that there is a leak in the system and he cannot find it, then he performs a dye test. After a fluorescent dye is charged into the system, an ultra violet light is shown on the system. If there is a leak, it will show up as a bright yellow color under the light. These are tried and true diagnostic methods that have been used in A/C system diagnostics and repairs for years and are guaranteed to track down the most stubborn A/C leaks. A word about refrigerant chemicals . As a result of the Clean Air Act, all chlorofluorocarbons are no longer used as refrigerant chemicals because of their negative effect on the ozone layer. Consequently, all A/C systems now use an ozone-friendly refrigerant called R134A. Any vehicles that still run the road with the old R12 chemical have to be retrofitted to run R134A. In addition, the tech is required by Federal Law to recapture the R12 into a reclaiming station for disposal (it cannot be released into the air). Venting of chlorofluorocarbons to the atmosphere is considered a Federal Offense. Should you have a vehicle that still has the old R12 system in it, have the system converted. This procedure involves the installation of new schrader valves for system charging and testing, as well as a complete and thorough cleaning and flushing of the system. It is essential that all of the R12 be removed, because the mixing of R12 with R134A results in 'system meltdown. Now that you know all about the air conditioning in your car, you can see that there are many sources of potential problems. Thus, proper diagnosis of problems with this system can save you a lot of money; so make sure you take it to a reputable shop that has the necessary equipment and experienced techs. And enjoy the summer heat!","Problems with your A/C/ system can cost you money by wasting extra gas .

"(CNN) -- She hit the big time in the 1980's with Eurythmics and found huge success as a solo artist with her 1992 album ""Diva"", but for singer Annie Lennox, being able to express her passion has always been the motivating factor in whatever she's done. Annie Lennox will continue to SING with her AIDS awareness charity. As a result her musical career has taken a back seat to her political activism and charity work in recent years; most notably with SING her AIDS awareness in Africa charity, as well as working with Amnesty, Save the Children and as a UNICEF ambassador. Yet the 54-year-old maintains that she'll always keep singing as well as working on the other things that she feels passionate about. ""I'm a multi-tasker. I have to do a lot of things at once. I love music. And I want to keep making music. I hope that I'll always be a music-maker and I'll always be an activist,"" she told CNN in Hong Kong. Growing up in Aberdeen, Scotland, Lennox found enormous success with Eurythmics and the 1983 album ""Sweet Dreams"" and single of the same name. It catapulted her to international success and stardom, something she had always wanted, but at first found difficult to adjust to. ""We were really on a whole kind of roller coaster with [Eurythmics], which on the one hand I was very grateful for, and on the other hand, it sort of sucked out your life, any sort of privacy,"" she said. ""Just the ability to be anonymous which I absolutely really value. I love to just to be mixing with people and not have to be the one person in the room with the spotlight and the heads all turning. So that was a little bit hard to adapt to...I might as well have a neon light for a head."" She's sold over 80 million records during a career that has spanned four decades, which she credits to hard graft fueled by an unending passion for music. ""The glamour side to it is what we see as the end result. But all the rest of it is hard work and dedication. And it's not easy always, you have to be very focused. And you have to be really, really motivated to do it. You have to have a kind of yearning, a passion for that. ""I was never thinking, 'Oh, I'm in this for the long haul.' I just think as I'm still thinking, I want to have a life where I'm able to do the thing that makes me feel alive."" Aware of the downsides of a career in music, Lennox also has a greater sense of the perils and pitfall in life, something she has often expressed in her music. ""I have encountered individuals and I've encountered things in the industry that were vile. Bad things happen everywhere. And the music industry and all that surrounds it, is no exception."". Having experienced unscrupulous people in the music industry and been through her own personal upheaval through two failed marriages, Lennox remain passionate, energetic and sanguine. Ultimately, she says, ""its all part of life's rich tapestry.""","Sold over 80 million records in career that has spanned four decades .

"(CNN)  -- The woman and children held captive in a cellar for years by their incestuous father will take years to recover from their disturbing ordeal, doctors warned Wednesday as the family at the center of the case remained in psychiatric care. The bathroom used by Elizabeth Fritzl, who was held captive for more than two decades, and her three children. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. Hans-Heinz Lenze, the head of local social services said the family was ""doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances"" and said any change of identity would be the family's decision. Elizabeth Fritzl -- now 42 -- spent more than two decades in the windowless basement after being drugged, handcuffed and locked up by her father, Josef Fritzl, as an 18-year-old. Repeatedly raped, she gave birth to seven children by Fritzl, one of whom died as an infant. Three of the children -- Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5 -- remained imprisoned underground with their mother. The other three lived in an apartment upstairs with Fritzl and his wife who believed Elizabeth had abandoned them after running away from home. Elizabeth and five of the children were continuing to receive treatment at a local clinic near Amstetten after being reunited on Sunday. Kerstin, whose hospitalization at the weekend finally brought the family's plight to the attention of authorities, remained in a coma at a nearby hospital. ""It is astonishing how easy it worked that the children came together, and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together,"" clinic director Berthold Kepplinger said. But Kepplinger warned that the family would require extensive counseling. ""We're talking of 20 years of darkness, incest and its effects and other illnesses they might have suffered from."" Kepplinger said the two sets of children were tentatively getting to know one another, adding that the two boys who had lived underground had an unusual way of communicating with each other. A policeman who had accompanied the boys to hospital after their discovery on Sunday said the pair had ""screamed with excitement"" during the car journey as they experienced the outside world for the first time. ""The two boys appeared overawed by the daylight they had never experienced before,"" said Chief Inspector Leopold Etz. ""The real world was completely alien to them... We had to drive very slowly with them because they cringed at every car light and every bump. It was as if we had just landed on the moon."" In an interview with the Austrian newspaper, Oesterreich, psychiatrist Max Friedrich, who treated the abducted teenager Natascha Kampusch, estimated it would take ""between five and eight years"" for the children to recover from their experiences. Another psychologist, Bernd Prosser, told Austrian television that it would be impossible for the four held prisoner underground to lead normal lives. ""I am afraid it is too late for that."" Kampusch, the Austrian girl abducted as a 10-year-old and held captive in a basement for more than eight years until she escaped in 2007, also offered her help to the family on Tuesday, but questioned the decision to move them from the cellar into psychiatric care. ""Pulling them abruptly out of this situation, without transition, to hold them and isolating them to some extent, it can't be good for them,"" said Kampusch, now 20, in an interview with Austrian TV station Puls 4. ""I believe it might have been even better to leave them where they were, but that was probably impossible. This case is not like mine, where that was not my environment. They were born there and I can imagine that there is a strong attachment to that place."" E-mail to a friend .","Austrian family held captive in a cellar will take years to recover, doctors say .

"Editor's note: Gene Seymour has written about movies, music and culture for The New York Times, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. Gene Seymour says we want to relive Michael Jackson's youth, not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life. (CNN) -- Seconds after the news first hit the airwaves, your own shock merged with everyone else's in the immediate vicinity. And you could feel it rolling through the rest of the planet like a runaway diesel. As with most things you neither expected nor wanted to hear, you thought that there had to be more to it than what was being said. Especially because it was Michael Jackson, who seemed too dominant, too other-worldly and, more than anything, too complex to be brought down by anything as simple as cardiac arrest. And also because most of what we'd been hearing about Jackson's personal life over the last decade and a half had been bizarre, sordid and sad. It was to those aspects -- the deepening isolation, the child molestation trials, the financial woes, the ""Wacko Jacko"" moments like that 2002 interlude on the balcony with the baby -- that the talking heads on TV devoted tentative attention within minutes of the official announcement. The commentariat presumed it had a responsibility to poke those embers for clues of something beyond the single, dreadful fact of Jackson's death. Even if we didn't care for this conversation, we had been conditioned by the most recent events to wonder, deep down, if there was something stranger or more unpleasant attached to his passing. But acceptance came easier -- and sooner -- than any of us expected last night. And when it did, we wanted the talking heads to go away and leave us with our memories ... and nothing but the good ones, thank you very much. We wanted the loop of performances and hit singles. Retrieve for us, please, the electricity of the 10-year-old wunderkind who literally leapt into our consciousness in that shattering year of 1968 with ""I Want You Back"" and ""ABC."" Let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the Motown Anniversary TV special when Jackson seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering, moon-walking recital of ""Billie Jean."" We wanted the videos -- ""Beat It,"" ""Bad,"" ""Thriller,"" ""Black and White"" and all that incredible, unearthly dancing. That was all we needed to see and hear. Save the armchair psychoanalysis for later. Maybe, much later. No one would have understood or indulged such yearnings as quickly or as intuitively as Michael Jackson. As surely as he was the King of Pop, Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment. His performances as both precocious child and child-like adult made growing up or growing old the only unimaginable things in the known world. This Peter Pan mystique even became part of the Jackson brand to the point of naming his combination of retreat and theme park the Neverland Ranch. The promise of eternal youth was embedded in pop music way before Jackson and his four brothers emerged from the grit of Gary, Indiana, to jump-start Motown's winning streak. But it's when that promise expands to shatter boundaries and expand possibilities beyond Top-40 parameters that pop music becomes pop phenomena. And Michael Jackson, in the early 1980s, was a pop phenomenon powerful enough to pool together previously polarized audiences -- heavy metal, disco, funk -- and get them all on the same bandwagon. Only twice before -- with Elvis Presley and the Beatles -- had the cultural landscape been changed as decisively by a pop star. It hasn't happened since -- and may never happen again. Certainly, ""Thriller,"" the best-selling LP of all time, won't be surpassed because LPs have been superseded twice over by discs and downloads. Jackson's off-stage public diffidence gave the impression that his transformations of both self and society were all happening by off-hand magic. But his wispy speaking voice belied a steely resolve to control his image, his artistry and his product. The energy he devoted to keep what he considered ""negativity"" at bay was meant to nurture his audience's dreams of release -- and to maintain his primacy in the pop marketplace. Even the eccentricities, at the peak of his influence, seemed calculated to promote, if not perpetuate, his product. But time (by far, Jackson's worst and most formidable enemy) couldn't stop even his most devoted admirers from wondering what drove him to change his appearance so drastically over the years. Or why he wanted to both save the world and hide from it with the same ferocious intensity. If he'd been able to stop the clock at 1985 or even 1987 (the year of ""Bad""), life would have been so much easier. The magic faded. Setbacks and embarrassments were occasionally offset by a tour or show that transported us back to the better, happier times when we were willing to overlook real life for our most elemental dreams of release. We seek those dreams even more urgently now that we know, for certain, that we'll never again see him on stage -- the one place where he was happiest and most assured. But perhaps the hardest dream to give up -- and the reason so many people in so many countries were almost physically leveled by yesterday's news -- is of finding common ground and sharing common awe in a song or a dance or a single act of outreaching, transcendent audacity. However divided (or worse) we may have felt about Michael Jackson at the end, we cherish how he brought out the best in us at the beginning. Whatever the days ahead, that will be more than enough for now, forever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: We want to relive the promise of Jackson's eternal youth .

"Editor's note: Roya Hakakian is the author of ""Journey from the Land of No: A Girlhood Caught in Revolutionary Iran."" Her web site is http://www.royahakakian.com/live/. Roya Hakakian says she lived through an earlier moment when Iranians thought freedom was at hand. (CNN) -- Since last Saturday, the images of Neda Agha Soltan, the young woman who died on the streets of Tehran, keep playing before my eyes. When I don't look at the clip on my computer, it runs on its own in my mind's eye. What has me so riveted is not entirely empathy, the intuitive human response the images are bound to stir in everyone. There is also something less noble at work in me, an obsession with seeing my own face upon hers. Each time I see her die, I die along with her. I, too, was born and raised in Iran. My coming-of-age years coincided with the Iranian revolution of 1979. I, too, was on the streets, watching and rooting for the demonstrators. Nothing seemed more natural, more compelling than being on the streets, calling for freedom, breathing the intoxicating, the dangerously euphoric Tehran air. I was 12 in 1978, yet I was as undaunted as any adult. Nothing, least of all my pleading parents, could keep me away from the rooftops at 9 p.m. Amid the night's dark, where the crowds were as indiscernible as ghosts, the shouts of ""Allah-o-akbar"" rose from every rooftop like smoke rising from an invisible bonfire. We were all victims of the flames and the very arsonists at once. We were burning in the fire of our own making. Thirty years hence that fire still burns in Iran, because moments before her death, Neda Agha Soltan cried: ""I'm on fire!"" I am entranced by her because she and I are the only two possibilities of the dictatorial narrative: Death or escape. She died. I escaped. I live. And because I live I cannot escape her death -- the memory of her large eyes languidly drifting to one side, then freezing upon the abyss. Survival of this kind brings its own eternal damnation: A bifurcated existence lived in the here and now, but perpetually haunted by there and then. Making peace with the past would have been easier, if only the essence of that past had not been in doubt, if its dignity were intact. But in my first American ride in my first American taxi cab, I learned the staggering counter-narrative that I would hear again and again, dominating the western perceptions of Iran, when the driver asked: ""So, where are you from?"" ""I come from Iran,"" I said, in broken English. ""Eeran,"" he asked with uncertainty. ""Eeeran?"" Then passing his fingertips across his throat like a knife, he said, ""Eeran ... Khomeini?"" In that, 2,500 years of civilization was reduced to one vile name and the invocation of a throat being slit. It did not take long for me to learn that between the Iran that I knew and the Iran that Americans knew was a discrepancy as vast as the waters that separated us. I soon learned that the images of a fist-throwing mob of angry men and darkly veiled women burning the Uncle Sam effigies were the only images that most Americans had of Iran. Those images had little in common with the Iran I knew -- greater in numbers and in the grip of the same fist-throwing crowds. With Neda's death, the Iran I know finally has a face. The sequence of her death is the sequence of our nation's struggle in the past 30 years: The democratic future that 1979 was to deliver collapsing, then trails of blood -- that of so many executed or assassinated -- streaming across its bright promise. The film of Neda's death is the abbreviated history of contemporary Iran. If history is a contest among competing narratives and icons, let the image of a young woman lying on the ground endure as that of Iran today. Let it loom so large to wipe away the memory of the thugs marching American hostages out of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Let the scarf that loosens and falls off her head to expose her dark hair be emblazoned in our memories as the metaphor for the plight of Iran's women. As if her death were not tragic enough, the authorities have banned all mosques throughout Tehran from holding prayer services for Neda. Silence in the face of such inhumanity is a sin as great as the one a war could spur. This Friday evening throughout Iran, people will be lighting candles in memory of Neda and others who have died in the past few days. Here in the United States, I hope you join me and thousands of my compatriots in a memorial campaign for Neda by asking your religious and spiritual leaders to include a prayer for Neda and other fallen Iranians of the recent days in this week's services. For 30 years, Iran's regime has appropriated God. Let us reclaim God from those who deny a family the right to properly mourn the death of their child through our prayers and help bring peace to a tormented nation.

"(AOL Autos) -- There are two good ways to buy your new car or truck at a reasonable low price and avoid all of the negotiating games and hassles: . 1. Buy through the Internet . Buying your new or used car or truck through the Internet is the easiest and most hassle-free way to make the purchase. All you have to do is choose the vehicle brand and model you wish to purchase as well as provide some basic contact information such as your name and e-mail address. In return, you'll receive - via e-mail - low bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area for the exact vehicle you want to buy. Compare the various selling prices and find the lowest one. Then, simply go direct to that dealership's Internet Department, sign the papers and drive your new car home - no negotiating, no hassles. To begin the process, get your free price quotes from AOL Autos. It only takes a few minutes. This service is totally free and you are under no obligation or pressure to buy. AOL, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner. Within 24 hours, you'll receive your bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area. Once you've compared the various prices and found the lowest one, you then have four good options: . • You can go to the dealership that gave you the lowest price, sign the papers and drive your new car home -- no hassles, no negotiating. AOL Autos: Best deals of the month . • You can try to negotiate the lowest price with the dealership in order to get the price even lower. There's nothing that says you can't. AOL Autos: Aggressive car buying tactics . • You can shop the lowest price around to other dealerships to see if any of them are willing to beat it. AOL Autos: Which dealers treat you best? • You can do nothing. If you feel unsure or uncertain, then set it aside for a while. You are not obligated to buy anything you don't want. By getting these low bottom-line selling prices via the Internet, you're avoiding the car salesman's entire negotiating game altogether. And you're buying your car at about the same price you would expect after lengthy negotiations. It's certainly the fastest and easiest way to beat the car salesman. AOL Autos: New rules to car buying . 2. Buy through the dealership's Fleet Department . Almost every dealership has a division called the ""Fleet Department."" It usually consists of only a handful of salespeople who specialize in selling fleets of cars -- large orders of several vehicles direct to businesses. This department is authorized by the dealership to sell their cars at bottom-line non-negotiable prices. The prices they offer are about the same as you would expect from an online price quote or after lengthy negotiations. A secret of the car business is that many dealerships' Fleet Departments also sell direct to the public. By the rules of the game, however, they can't advertise to the public since they don't want to compete with the dealership's retail sales team. So to buy from the Fleet Department, you have to specifically ask. To buy your vehicle direct from the dealership's Fleet Department, simply call the dealership and ask to speak with the Fleet Manager. When you get him on the line, explain to him that you're ready to buy a car and you'd like to buy it from him. If he asks you what business you are associated with, tell him where you work. He'll probably be happy to set up an appointment with you. When you arrive at the dealership, the Fleet Manager will show you the vehicle, allow you to test drive it, and then bring you to the office to discuss price. With absolutely no negotiations, he'll offer you a reasonable bottom-line non-negotiable selling price for the vehicle. If the price he gives you falls within the pre-set limits of your buying goal and you're satisfied with the deal, then you can buy the car. No pressure, no games, no hassles. If for some reason, you don't want to buy the vehicle, you are under no obligation. Simply thank the salesman for his time and leave on good terms. Then, if you'd like, you can visit (or call) the Fleet Departments of other dealerships to compare prices. The selling prices offered by the various Fleet Departments can vary depending upon their inventories.

"(CNN) -- One female fan on Twitter said ""Off the Wall"" was the first cassette tape she owned. ""I have it on CD now and still listen to it,"" she said. Many people found out about Michael Jackson's death through Web sites like Twitter and Facebook. ""I saw the Victory Tour at Dodger Stadium in 1984,"" posted a man on his Facebook status update. ""Anybody else?"" And on CNN's iReport.com, a tearful Melissa Fazli of Yorba Linda, California, posted an emotional video. ""I grew up with Michael Jackson,"" she said, choking back tears. ""This is just a very sad day."" From Facebook to Flickr, Twitter to YouTube, stunned and saddened fans came together across the vast online universe to share their memories of the iconic pop star, who died Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles. By Thursday evening, 9 of the 10 top trending topics on micro-blogging site Twitter were about Michael Jackson. Because traditional media outlets were slow to confirm the news of Jackson's death, many people appeared to find out through messages on social-networking sites. Some of those linked to celebrity gossip site TMZ.com, which was among the first to report the news. ""Damn ... it's official,"" posted one Twitter user, shortly after the news of Jackson's death was confirmed. ""RIP to the BIGGEST star the world has EVER seen."" Another woman vowed in a tweet never to change her cell phone's ringtone, which was set to ""P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing),"" a hit from Jackson's classic ""Thriller"" album. Sony BMG, Jackson's music label, removed from its Web site a list of dates for the singer's European tour, which was to kick off next month in London. Within minutes, Jackson's Wikipedia page had been updated to reflect his death, with biographical information changed to the past tense. On Flickr, fans posted images from all phases of Jackson's career, from his child-star, large-Afro days to moody publicity shots to dramatic photos of a costumed, windblown Jackson in concert. While most fans celebrated Jackson's buoyant music and dynamic stage presence, others viewed him as a tragic figure with an increasingly bizarre public image who, in his later years, battled child molestation charges and mounting debt. One grieving fan posted an image on Flickr of herself, head in hands. ""He was ... amazing. And had amazing songs. :( What's so weird is that I was singing his songs today before I found out about this,"" she wrote. ""At least he'll be safe now. Away from all the troubles and stuff. :)"" On Twitter and other sites, several online mourners posted ""Never Can Say Goodbye,"" echoing the title of one of the Jackson 5's early hits. Another fan quoted from Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror,"" saying, ""If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, then make a change."" The swirling news may have overwhelmed Facebook, which was inaccessible at times Thursday evening. When the site was viewable, people filled their status updates with Jackson memories, lyrics and links to his videos. Others remarked on the coincidence of two pop icons, Jackson and Farrah Fawcett, dying within hours of each other. ""Johnny [Carson] is going to have a great show in heaven tonight,"" wrote a Los Angeles man on Facebook. Ed [McMahon]'s back, and he's got two great new guests.""","Stunned fans came together across the Web to share memories of Michael Jackson .

"LONDON, England -- A huge crowd gathered in London, UK on Friday for a mass ""moonwalk"" -- paying tribute to Michael Jackson by dancing to his most iconic songs and replicating his famous walk. Two young fans who say Michael Jackson meant a lot to them donned self-made T-shirts at the event in London. The horde of people gathered on the streets outside Liverpool Street train station, one of the city's major transport hubs, and burst out into cheers, chants and dances to the tunes of ""Billie Jean,"" ""Bad"" and ""Thriller."" Life-long Jackson fan Milo Yiannopoulos organized the moonwalk, the singer's trademark backwards shuffle, by sending messages via Twitter and Facebook. His messages went ""viral"" --spreading like wildfire around the Internet -- as the number of people wanting to join his impromptu ""flash mob"" event far exceeded his expectations: . ""I don't know what I've unleashed here,"" Yiannopoulos, who said he doesn't even know how to moonwalk, told CNN. He came up with the ideas ""because of all of the stuff people are saying about Michael Jackson -- surgeries, molestation etc. -- I wanted to do something to remind people how great he really is and remind them of his music."" But those who were there did not seem to need much reminding of Jackson's greatness. ""He is the biggest idol in my life. Unfortunately, I did not grow up with all his best hits, but he has been so important for me. I am very sad,"" said 13-year-old Paul Graham, who wore a self-made Michael Jackson ""Rest in Peace"" T-shirt. See images of Jackson fans at the moonwalk event » . Another of the many young fans there was 17-year-old George Webster, who spontaneously performed a perfect Michael Jackson dance routine for a cheering audience. He told CNN: ""This is a celebration. We are here to remember Michael Jackson's best moments."" And the laughing crowd did indeed seem to be celebrating, rather than mourning: . Hanging off lampposts and standing atop telephone booths, people were brandishing everything from white paper gloves to black hats and face masks. Watch video of the crowd singing to Billie Jean » . British television presenter Gail Porter was also at the tribute: ""As soon as I saw it on Twitter, I thought 'let's go and have a dance',"" she told CNN while twittering away on her cell phone. The gathering started off to a rocky start, as the short notice had left London city police unsure about how to handle it and what to expect. They were overheard telling organizer Yiannopoulos that they would not allow him to do the moonwalk outside the station and that he had to limit his gathering to 300 people. Eventually the crowd was allowed to gather outside, attracting many more tourists, commuters and passers-by to join in the event. ""I want to thank the police for being so cool,"" Yiannopoulos told the audience. ""You guys are great, let's continue dancing."" More tributes are now expected to take place around the world and Austria has already replicated London's moonwalk event with their own on Friday.","A huge crowd gathered in London, UK on Friday for a mass ""moonwalk""

"(WIRED) -- Two cable powerhouses have announced an ambitious pilot program that aims to convince their customers that, actually, TV on the web should not be free. Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman and CEO of Time Warner, speaks at the NCTA conference in Washington. With a service called TV Everywhere, Comcast and Time Warner will give cable subscribers access to ""premium"" television content via broadband, and later cellphone connections. To begin with, 5,000 Comcast subscribers will begin testing the system next month, giving them access to Time Warner's TBS and TNT channels on their computers, and the same channels' video-on-demand catalogs on their cable boxes. If you made peace long ago with the idea of paying a monthly cable bill, this probably sounds great. It means watching your existing subscription on new screens without paying additional fees or buying more hardware. (Of course, as consumers adopt TV Everywhere, they can probably expect price increases.) But if you prefer to watch your television for free on ad-supported sites like Hulu while paying only for the internet connection that delivers it, you could be in for a rude awakening. TV Everywhere represents an alternative -- and possible threat -- to the popular Hulu model. If the pilot program impresses the group -- and proves to other networks that its user-authentication system is secure -- Comcast and Time Warner expect the other television programmers, ISPs and mobile providers to join, giving all cable subscribers a way to watch the content they pay for on their televisions using any broadband-connected computer or authenticated cellphone. Already ""at least 92 percent of Americans qualify to watch this for free online,"" according to Jeff Bewkes, chairman and CEO of Time Warner. For these subscribers, TV Everywhere represents a potential win. The only question is whether they will keep paying for the old cable subscription model as their viewing habits shift online. There's nothing to stop television networks from putting their content on both Hulu and TV Everywhere, because TV Everywhere's contract will be non-exclusive, according to Bewkes. However, given the choice between Hulu and TV Everywhere, television programmers have an incentive to go with the latter. Only the TV Everywhere model promises to port yesterday's lucrative business model onto today's platforms. And that, according to some critics, is exactly the problem. ""[TV Everywhere] raises substantial anti-competitive issues by restricting the availability of programming to the favored distribution methods,"" said Gigi B. Sohn, president and co-founder of the public interest group Public Knowledge. ""Under the TV Everywhere plan, no other program distributors would be able to emerge, and no consumers will be able to 'cut the cord' because they find what they want online. As a result, consumers will be the losers. ""In addition, we are concerned that this program violates the open nature of the internet. By adding this additional toll lane, Comcast and Time Warner want to create their own 'managed channel' within the internet and turn the internet into their own private cable channel."" So, what about Hulu? Will its deals fall through given this new option? ""There will be some part [of Time Warner's content] that will be out there [on Hulu], said Bewkes.""Short-form content, I think, will continue to be available -- promotional content will continue to be available."" However, only cable subscribers will be able to access other content online -- through officially licensed avenues, anyway. Bewkes added that some other television programmers have avoided Hulu ""for security concerns and because they didn't like the model,"" but that they will give TV Everywhere a chance. ""Consumers vote every single month with their pocketbook,"" he added. ""They don't have to subscribe to cable. They don't have to pay for these services, yet they do. The number of people paying for subscription television has gone up and up and up every single quarter that we've been in the business.""

"(CNN) -- The teenage niece of golf superstar Tiger Woods has failed to make the cut in her first professional tournament. Cheyenne Woods was handed entry into the Wegmans tournament on a sponsor's invite. Cheyenne Woods was four strokes shy of qualifying for the weekend rounds of the LPGA Tour's Wegmans event at Locust Hill in Rochester, New York. The 18-year-old had to complete her second round on Saturday along with half of the 140-player field due to delays of almost five hours following thunderstorms in the area. Competing on a sponsor's invite, the college amateur followed up her opening 75 with a two-over-par 74 to be well down the field. She had been two-under for the round after 10 holes on Friday, but fell back again with a triple-bogey at the par-four 12th before finishing strongly with a birdie. Cheyenne is the daughter of world No. 1 Tiger's half-brother, Earl Jnr. Defending champion Eun-Hee Ji also missed the cut after completing a 71 which saw her seven over the card. South Korean Shin Jiyai had led by three strokes overnight after posting a 68 which gave her a 36-hole total of  11-under-par 133. However, Morgan Pressel reduced that advantage to just a single stroke when she picked up two birdies to complete a 66, leaving her one shot ahead of third-placed fellow American Stacy Lewis.","Cheyenne Woods four strokes shy of qualifying for final rounds of Wegmans event .

"(CNN) -- Sharp-witted. Direct. In control. Loyal. Jenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford. That's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina. Jenny Sanford, unlike so many wives of cheating politicians, was not there facing the cameras, standing beside her husband. A reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated. ""I'm here, and she's there,"" he replied. As romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday, the state's first lady, a former Wall Street executive, stayed far away from reporters. She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends. ""Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story,"" said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP. ""She will stand next to Mark emotionally, but she cannot stand in the glare of others,"" Mosteller continued. ""She is out there taking a dignified road, one that is defined by principle, even if her heart might have difficulty following that principle. But her overriding priority is to protect her children."" Jenny Sanford released a lengthy statement late Wednesday making clear she had learned of her husband's infidelity before his recent secret trip to Buenos Aires. His whereabouts were a mystery for six days, leaving his family in the dark and creating a power vacuum and considerable confusion in the Capitol, with aides telling reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. ""When I found out about my husband's infidelity I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness, and then to work diligently to repair our marriage,"" she wrote. ""We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago. ""This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage. During this short separation it was agreed that Mark would not contact us. I kept this separation quiet out of respect of his public office and reputation, and in hopes of keeping our children from just this type of public exposure."" Mosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to ""Maria"" became public. The messages from Mark Sanfordcompliment the woman on her ""tan lines"" and ""gentle kisses."" The e-mails were published by The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina's capital, which said the governor's office confirmed they are authentic. When contacted by CNN, the governor's office would neither confirm nor deny their authenticity. ""[The e-mails] are almost like reading a novel that you would embarrassed to buy,"" Mosteller said. ""To be one of his four children and know that is there for the world to see, it is incredible to all of us."" Jenny Sanford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and earned a degree in finance from Georgetown University. She met Mark Sanford when they worked for investment firms in New York, she at Lazard Freres and he at Goldman Sachs. The two married and moved to his native South Carolina, and she managed his campaign for Congress in 1994. ""Mark started out with five other opponents, and he didn't really have a shot. That was the opinion of most people,"" Mosteller said. ""But she and Mark worked together and turned that thing around so that candidate three, four and five ended up throwing their support behind him, and he won."" The two are equals intellectually, according to people who know them. She went on to manage his gubernatorial campaign in 2002, turning her home into campaign headquarters. Jenny Sanford was more than a visible first lady of South Carolina; she was involved in the finances of her husband's office to an extent that drew heated criticism from his opponents. She also took a $70,000 deficit from the operations of the governor's mansion and put its finances into the black. ""I pretty much am in his office in the mornings most days, and I do pretty much anything he wants me to do for him. I help to bridge the gap between things that have been commonplace themes in his life and make sure everybody in the office is on pace with his agenda,"" Jenny Sanford told Charleston's Post and Courier in June 2005. The governor told the newspaper that his wife is ""particularly good with financial analysis [and] working with numbers."" She took up health as a key issue in her role as first lady, advocating nutrition, exercise and cancer prevention, serving on major boards and speaking at various functions to raise funds for disease research. ""This is a classy woman who lacks pretension,"" Mosteller said. ""I took a road trip with her last year, and she just automatically got into the back seat. When we were making a lot of appearances, and the schedules were hectic, she called and said, 'I've figured out that the key is changing your deodorant.' ""Jenny is someone you can talk politics with, you can talk about grand issues with, and you can also discuss deodorant,"" Mosteller said.

"(CNN) -- I was a high school student in 1983, when the video for ""Thriller"" was released, getting plenty of air time on MTV. By then, the network's ""M"" could just as easily have stood for Michael. It was an event. At a time when MTV was criticizing for not featuring black artists, Michael Jackson's success changed all that. I can remember getting together with a group of friends to watch the premiere like it was a new movie release. The video did not disappoint. Once again Michael disregarded all conventions of the genre and not just redefined, but completely re-imagined, what a music video could be. But most people don't know that the album broke new ground in a non-musical way, too. Viewers today of MTV, with its steady stream of reality shows like ""Real World 22 - Cancun"" and ""16 and Pregnant,"" might forget that, when it started nearly three decades ago, MTV was all music, all day. Actually, it wasn't really all music. It was just what MTV considered rock music. By the late 1970s, radio formats had essentially resegregated the music world. When MTV launched in 1981, it modeled its playlist on the popular album-oriented rock radio format of the day, which meant that music by black artists was effectively excluded from the network. You might see the occasional Jimi Hendrix clip, but there was no room for funk, disco, R&B or that new emerging form -- rap. It wasn't long before the public took note of the glaring absence of African-American artists. MTV was called to task on the air in 1983 for its lack of black artists by none other than David Bowie. At about the same time, MTV famously refused to air Rick James' ""Superfreak"" video. It defended itself by claiming it wasn't a rock song. Michael Jackson changed all that. Jackson opened the door with the video for ""Billie Jean,"" which was simply too good for its time to be overlooked. He blew that door wide open with ""Beat It,"" which featured a guitar solo by the reigning rock god of the day, Eddie Van Halen. Jackson succeeded in this not just because he was a great singer, but because of his musical daring. ""Beat It"" was a song that was incapable of being slotted among the genres of the day. Yes, it had all the signatures of a rock song -- overdriven guitars, a driving tempo and a searing solo. But it had more. It had a backbeat. You could dance to it. You wanted to dance to it. And the viewers loved it, regardless of their race or ethnicity. iReport.com: Share stories of Jackson's success, legacy . Jackson's effect on MTV was both immediate and permanent. His videos became cultural events and his success laid waste to the notion that white rock audiences wouldn't tune in for ""black"" music. In the aftermath of Jackson's breakthrough success, MTV helped usher rap into the mainstream with shows like ""Yo! MTV Raps,"" and black artists like Prince and Chaka Khan became mainstays of the network. It wasn't long before young people schooled on a diet that ranged from Public Enemy to AC/DC began to experiment with what those genres would sound like if they were combined -- just as Jackson had done with ""Beat It."" The outcome was some of the most interesting music of the next decade. Artists like Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, P.O.D. and Beck all owe a debt of gratitude to Jackson for creating a welcoming environment. And we as fans all owe him the acknowledgment reserved for those individuals whose achievements transcend their chosen field and reshape the world around us.  Watch fans in Los Angeles react to Jackson's death » . I was always mournful about the sad spectacle his life became in recent years. But that should not detract from the meteor-like impact he had on popular culture at his peak. Michael Jackson was the Jackie Robinson of MTV. He disregarded the conventional categories of the day and created something that was both new and immediately accessible to millions of listeners. In so doing, he forced an industry still informed by stubborn prejudices to rethink itself. Most successful entertainers can ride in tandem with the zeitgeist for only so long before they drift away. Michael Jackson did more than that. He inhabited the zeitgeist and bent it to his will. No matter where his life may have gone after that, it cannot overshadow this transcendent moment.","Michael Jackson's breakthrough success forced MTV to rethink itself .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- United States accident investigators are probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s -- the same type of plane that crashed into the Atlantic nearly a month ago. Investigators are looking into incidents aboard two other Airbus A330s. The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The probes were launched in the aftermath of the June 1 crash in the Atlantic Ocean -- when Air France Flight 447 was flying to Paris, France, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All 228 people on board the plane, an A330, were killed. Investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as pitot tubes, among other factors, as a possible cause of the Flight 447 crash. That flight sent 24 automated error messages in the four minutes before it crashed, the head of the French accident investigation board, Paul-Louis Arslanian, has said. The error messages all indicate there were problems with on-board information about the plane's speed, which can cause some of the plane's instruments to stop functioning, Arslanian said. Search teams are looking for the bulk of the plane's wreckage and for its flight data recorders. The first of the two incidents being investigated by the NTSB happened May 21, when a TAM Airlines flight from Miami, Florida, to Sao Paulo, Brazil, experienced a loss of primary speed and altitude information while in flight, the NTSB said. ""Initial reports indicate that the flight crew noted an abrupt drop in indicated outside air temperature, followed by the loss of the Air Data Reference System and disconnections of the autopilot and autothrust, along with the loss of speed and altitude information,"" the NTSB said. The flight crew used backup instruments and the primary data was restored in about five minutes, the NTSB said. Another ""possibly similar"" incident happened June 23 on a Northwest Airlines flight between Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan, the NTSB said. Investigators from the NTSB are gathering data recorder information, monitoring system messages, crew statements and weather information, the NTSB said.","Probe involves two failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard A330s .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A sharply divided House of Representatives narrowly passed a White House-backed climate change bill Friday after hours of cajoling and arm-twisting by Democratic leaders among members worried about the legislation's potential economic and political fallout. The House of Representatives passes an energy bill that includes a ""cap-and-trade"" program on emissions. The bill passed 219-212, with virtually no Republican support. The bill would reduce nationwide greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a so-called ""cap-and-trade"" program under which companies would buy and sell emissions credits. Among other things, the bill would also require utilities to generate an increasing amount of power from renewable sources. Even before daybreak Friday, consternation over the bill brewed anew. The Democrats released a 301-page amendment to the bill at 3:09 a.m. Friday, drawing protest from Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""This is the biggest job-killing bill that has ever been on the floor of the House of Representatives. Right here. This bill,"" Boehner said. The leaders of the House are customarily granted unlimited speaking time, but when the Boehner's speech went more than 2½ hours, Democrats objected. ""Is this an attempt to try to get some people to leave on a close vote?"" asked Rep Henry Waxman, D-California, the bill's lead sponsor. Also Friday, the House of Representatives phone switchboard went down as conservative radio hosts and congressmen made direct pleas for voters to dial the Capitol to voice their opposition to the bill. ""Phone traffic has increased to a level where some callers are receiving an 'all circuits are busy now, please try back again later' message,"" communications director Jeff Ventura said via e-mail. Congressional sources said Democrats were hoping their constituents would also attempt to match phone calls opposed to the bill with phone calls for the bill. ""Call your congressman, right now!"" urged Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, from the House floor as the chamber seemed near a vote. Ventura said the bill was likely behind the phone-line crash. ""The suspected cause ... is believed to be interest and inquiries regarding the expected vote on the climate bill,"" he wrote. The House vote came one day after President Obama made an urgent plea for congressional approval in what could be an early make-or-break test of his young administration. ""Now is the time for us to lead,"" Obama said during an appearance Thursday in the White House Rose Garden. ""We cannot be afraid of the future. We cannot be prisoners to the past."" The president said the bill will spark a ""clean energy transformation"" of the U.S. economy and ""make possible the creation of millions of new jobs."" ""Make no mistake,"" he emphasized. ""This is a jobs bill."" Several moderate and conservative Democrats indicated that they received heavy constituent pressure in the final hours to buck their party leadership and vote against the bill. ""I can't begin to tell you how many calls we've received,"" said Rep. Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas. ""And it's disproportionately vote 'no.'"" Gonzalez, who voted ""yes,"" believes special interest groups generated many of the calls on both sides, including the late surge of negative feedback. However, Gonzalez also said Obama tried to counter much of that pressure by personally reaching out to swing members since Thursday night. Republicans have argued the bill would have the unintended consequence of devastating the country's battered industrial base while pushing polluting industries to countries with lower environmental standards. Having cleared the House, the bill now faces an unclear future in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have held off on introducing their own version of the legislation. CNN's Evan Glass contributed to this report.","Democratic leaders, Obama twist arms to get politically dicey bill passed .

"(CNN) -- ""Refugees are the most vulnerable people on Earth. They are fighting to survive."" -- Angelina Jolie, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees goodwill ambassador . Children play in floodwater at a Pakistan refugee camp after floods displaced residents in August 2008. The world's population at the end of last year included 42 million displaced people, 80 percent of them in developing nations, according to a report this week by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many of these refugees are living in minimal standards for shelter and are exposed daily to the harshest elements of weather, the report says. For example, in Pakistan, some 300,000 refugees are living outdoors, in tents or similar structures, said Michael Kocher, vice president of international programs for the International Rescue Committee. That part of the world has been hit hard by extreme weather over the past couple of months. First, extreme heat plagued Pakistan, with temperatures in May and June soaring past 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). The heat is escalating the discomfort for many. ""People are living in cramped situations, often unsanitary situations, and it's very hot,"" Kocher said. ""In many places, there is not enough clean water or adequate sanitation. Heat exacerbates that problem."" As World Refugee Day approaches -- it falls on Saturday this year -- the forecast calls for even more dramatic weather changes in the coming weeks. In Southeast Asia, long stretches of scorching temperatures are usually the prelude to the rainy, or monsoon, season.  Watch Angelina Jolie talk to CNN's Anderson Cooper about the world's refugee problem » . The term ""monsoon"" refers to a seasonal reversal of wind that typically occurs in late June or early July. For countries like Pakistan and India, this change brings daily, nonstop downpours. The change in the weather is essential for local crops, according to John Fasullo, project scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""The Southeast Asian monsoon is the key source for regional agriculture,"" he told CNN. ""It provides the majority of the moisture to support food needs for one-half  the world's population. ... It also brings a beneficial cooling of the temperatures."" The problem is, monsoon rains can also cause devastating floods. Fasullo says the threat for flooding can be ""continual from late June through early September."" In Pakistan, for example, where agencies have witnessed a large increase in displaced people over the past year, the monsoon of 2008 was particularly intense. If 2009 brings similar floods to the country, there will be a new threat for refugees exposed to the storms: mud.  Watch how the monsoon is affecting refugees » . ""The camps are quite threadbare,"" Kocher said. ""Tents are held to the ground by rope. It's hard to keep people dry. The ground gets muddy, which can lead to dirty water and bad sanitation facilities."" Vulnerability to nature's dangerous elements is not only a concern for people displaced in Pakistan. Refugees in Afghanistan are subject to brutal winters, while in Iraq, scorching heat and sandstorms are common challenges for those without sufficient shelter. Of World Refugee Day, actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie says, ""Please do not forget them, and remember them on this day."" Here are answers to some commonly asked questions: . • How can I help world refugees that are exposed to the monsoon season and other weather dangers? Go to CNN.com/ImpactYour World. There, you will find links to charities that help refugees and others in need. • Does the monsoon season affect the weather in the United States? Southern Arizona and parts of New Mexico see heavy rain during the North American monsoon season, which runs from June 15 through September 30. This time of year, the wind shifts, tapping into moisture from the Gulf of California and the Gulf of Mexico, and producing strong thunderstorms that bring the majority of the region's annual rainfall.","As World Refugee Day approaches, monsoons could compound refugees' troubles .

"Editor's note: Kevin Fenton is director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fenton has written for journals including The Lancet, AIDS, the British Medical Journal and the Journal of Infectious Diseases. After graduating from medical school, Fenton earned his Masters in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and his Ph.D. in Epidemiology from University College London. Dr. Kevin Fenton urges Americans to get tested for HIV. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Every 9½ minutes someone's brother, mother, sister, father, or neighbor becomes infected with HIV in the United States. That's 56,000 people every year. But there's something we can all do to help protect ourselves and our partners from this disease -- get tested for HIV. In the fight against HIV, I can tell you that few things are more important than testing. It's an essential step in reducing the number of new HIV infections and extending the lives of those who are infected. Put simply, HIV testing saves lives. As a CDC official, I've spoken with hundreds of people who have made the decision to get tested. Many described the relief they felt when they found out they were HIV-negative. Thanks to the HIV test, they could take steps to make sure they and their partners stay that way. I've also met people who found out they were HIV-positive. Although initially worried about their diagnosis and their future, they were thankful they had their infection diagnosed early, and were able to live long, healthy and productive lives with HIV. They had the knowledge and will to protect their partners from infection, or to prevent their infants from becoming HIV infected. I recently met one young woman who learned about her HIV infection after being diagnosed during routine HIV testing in pregnancy. By getting tested early, and having access to effective treatment, her child was born without HIV, and she now has two healthy children. She is a living testament that life does not stop with this disease. Instead, knowledge of her HIV status along with effective treatment and care has given her the freedom, resolve and respect to make choices to protect her life and the lives of those she loves. Yet today, not everyone has benefited from knowing their HIV status. Far too many individuals with HIV don't know that they're infected. CDC estimates that one in five people with HIV in the United States is unaware of being infected. That's more than 200,000 Americans who may be transmitting the virus to others without knowing it, and who can't take advantage of HIV treatments that could prolong and improve the quality of their lives. As we mark National HIV Testing Day on Saturday, I strongly encourage all Americans to get tested for HIV. At CDC, our goal is to make HIV testing as routine as a blood pressure check. HIV testing has never been quicker, easier or more accessible. In fact, with rapid HIV tests, results can be available in as little as 20 minutes, and tests can be given in your doctor's office or other locations in your community, such as churches and college campuses. To ensure that all Americans know their HIV status, CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV as part of routine medical care -- regardless of their perceived risk for infection. CDC also recommends that those at increased risk, such as sexually active gay and bisexual men, get tested at least annually. We are also working with our partners to bring HIV testing services directly to communities across the nation. Increased HIV testing will make it possible to significantly reduce the number of new infections. Research indicates the majority of new sexually transmitted HIV infections are transmitted by people who do not know they are HIV-infected. Studies also show that most people who test HIV-positive take steps to protect their partners from infection. Nearly 30 years after the start of the epidemic, far too many people continue to be diagnosed late in the course of their infection. Too many times, I've heard stories from people who went to the emergency room after a few days of flu-like symptoms. Once there, doctors conduct tests and inform them they have both pneumonia and AIDS. They never knew they were HIV infected, and yet they had the virus for years. In fact, data released today show that nearly 40 percent of people develop AIDS within just a year of being diagnosed with HIV. Many of these people could have stayed healthier if they were diagnosed with HIV and began drug treatment much earlier. Anti-retroviral treatment can lower the amount of the virus in the blood, slowing progression from HIV to AIDS. We must remember that AIDS still kills in this country -- more than 14,000 people die every year. Yet we have the tools to diagnose an HIV infection early, to begin life-prolonging treatments to prevent progression to AIDS, and to ensure a strong quality of life for HIV-infected people. But without a test, there is no diagnosis -- and no treatment. The fight against HIV here at home is far from over. But too many mistakenly believe that HIV in the United States is no longer a serious problem. In fact, a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found a troubling decline in awareness and concern about the domestic HIV/AIDS crisis, in the general population and among those at greatest risk. To help combat this complacency, the White House recently joined CDC and the rest of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to announce a new communication campaign, ""Act Against AIDS."" The campaign is working on a number of fronts to refocus national attention on the U.S. epidemic, and to increase the number of Americans who get tested for HIV. Although HIV/AIDS continues to pose a serious threat to the nation's health, HIV testing is a powerful weapon against the disease. By increasing the number of people who know their HIV status, we can decrease the number of new HIV infections, and help save thousands of lives. What you don't know can hurt you. In fact, it can kill you. But a simple test could change your fate and the fate of others. That's why today I urge all Americans to take the test -- and take control.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson knew ""exactly how his fate would be played out"" and feared his death would echo that of Elvis Presley, Lisa Marie Presley wrote in an online blog posted Friday morning. Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley in 1994. Presley says, ""I loved him very much"" and believes he loved her. Presley -- the daughter of Elvis, the ""King of Rock,"" and the ex-wife of Jackson, the ""King of Pop"" -- wrote on her MySpace page that she wanted ""to say now what I have never said before because I want the truth out there for once."" Her publicist confirmed Presley wrote the blog. She said her short marriage to Jackson -- from May 1994 until January 1996 -- ""was not 'a sham' as is being reported in the press,"" but she divorced him because she was ""in over my head in trying"" to save Jackson ""from the inevitable, which is what has just happened."" Jackson talked with her about his death during ""a deep conversation"" 14 years ago about ""the circumstances of my father's death.""  Watch more from Presley on Jackson » . ""At some point he paused, he stared at me very intensely and he stated with an almost calm certainty, 'I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did,' "" Presley wrote. ""I promptly tried to deter him from the idea, at which point he just shrugged his shoulders and nodded almost matter of fact as if to let me know, he knew what he knew and that was kind of that."" That conversation haunted Presley as she watched television coverage of Jackson's death Thursday, she said. ""I am sitting here watching on the news [as] an ambulance leaves the driveway of his home, the big gates, the crowds outside the gates, the coverage, the crowds outside the hospital, the cause of death and what may have led up to it and the memory of this conversation hit me, as did the unstoppable tears,"" she wrote. ""A predicted ending by him, by loved ones and by me, but what I didn't predict was how much it was going to hurt when it finally happened."" Elvis Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. ""As I sit here overwhelmed with sadness, reflection and confusion at what was my biggest failure to date, watching on the news almost play by play the exact scenario I saw happen on August 16, 1977, happening again right now with Michael (A sight I never wanted to see again) just as he predicted, I am truly, truly gutted,"" she wrote. ""I wanted to 'save him',"" she wrote. ""I wanted to save him from the inevitable, which is what has just happened."" ""The hardest decision I have ever had to make, which was to walk away and let his fate have him, even though I desperately loved him and tried to stop or reverse it somehow,"" Presley wrote. Their marriage, which some suggested was only to help Jackson's image, was real, she said. ""It was an unusual relationship, yes, where two unusual people who did not live or know a 'normal life' found a connection, perhaps with some suspect timing on his part,"" she wrote. ""Nonetheless, I do believe he loved me as much as he could love anyone and I loved him very much."" Presley called Jackson ""an incredibly dynamic force and power that was not to be underestimated."" ""When he used it for something good, it was the best and when he used it for something bad, It was really, REALLY bad,"" she wrote.

"(CNN) -- There's a photo of the Jackson family on the cover of the September 24, 1971, issue of Life magazine. In it, Joseph and Katherine Jackson stand at the foot of a set of stairs, their star children -- known as the Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them. The Jackson brothers, here in the 1970s, were driven to be great by their father, Joseph. They appear to be the all-American clan, gold records arranged behind them, the boys loose and smiling, the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor. Over the years, that façade crumbled. The brothers bickered; some made accusations of abuse. But the group remained tight-knit through crises, including Thursday's tragedy, when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center. The journey began with music in Gary, Indiana. Joseph Jackson, the patriarch, played in a short-lived band called the Falcons (no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett) in the 1950s. His primary job, however, was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel. Katherine Jackson, the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949, tended to the couple's large family: Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, all born between 1950 and 1961. Daughter Janet arrived in 1966. By that time, the three oldest boys -- Jackie, Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group, which Marlon and Michael eventually joined. Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he'd found elusive. Joseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster. He drove his sons hard, forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity. He wasn't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child, Michael. ""My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day,"" Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. He said his father also beat him: ""He was very strict, very hard, very stern. ... There's been times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick, I'd start to regurgitate."" He quickly said, imagining his father's reaction, ""Please don't be mad at me."" Joseph Jackson disputed the word ""beat,"" but didn't question Michael's account. ""I whipped him with a switch and a belt,"" he told the BBC in 2003. He added, ""I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick."" In a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King, Jermaine defended his father's actions. ""We grew up like any other black family. You did something, you got your butt tore up, and it wasn't tore up, it was just, you got a spanking,"" he said. ""I will say this. He kept us off of the streets. He kept us away from drugs. He kept us away from gangs and ... we've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world."" By 1968, when Michael turned 10, the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine. They'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the ""chitlin circuit"" of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group. Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them ""the last big stars to come off my assembly line,"" according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site. The group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base, along with an animated TV show. But success took its toll, particularly when it wasn't so easy to come by. In the mid-1970s, the band -- minus Jermaine, who'd married Gordy's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records, where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions, which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit ""Enjoy Yourself."" ""It was a collaboration,"" Gamble said. ""They all participated in creating. Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians."" Huff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting, complete with a ""fantastic meal"" cooked by Katherine Jackson. ""I've got nothing but respect for the father,"" added Gamble. ""He's a great man. He made something out of nothing."" Even during that era, however, Michael was standing out. Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded. Going solo with Quincy Jones producing, as he did in 1979, was the right move, Gamble and Huff said. The family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older. After Michael's ""Thriller"" became the biggest album of all time, the brothers -- including Jermaine -- regrouped for a new album, ""Victory,"" and accompanying tour. But Michael, now the undisputed draw, disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity. Michael's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings; even Rebbie had a hit. But it was Janet who broke out with the most success, including the No. 1 singles ""Miss You Much,"" ""Black Cat"" and ""Again"" in the 1980s and '90s. With the increased interest in the Jacksons came tabloid scrutiny of the family's every move. When La Toya appeared nude in Playboy magazine, the story made headlines. She later criticized Michael and was on the outs for several years. Jermaine put out a song called ""Word to the Badd,"" an attack on Michael, in 1991; he later changed the lyrics. Janet's relationships were probed in detail, as were the brothers' marriages. And Michael, of course, was seen as increasingly eccentric, his personality overwhelming his music. But for all their own bickering, the family closed ranks when a member was attacked. In 1992, Jermaine co-produced ""The Jacksons: An American Dream,"" a TV miniseries based on Katherine Jackson's memoir, which chronicled their rise to stardom. When Michael faced molestation allegations in the early '90s and was tried in 2005, the family rallied around. ""The Jackson family was groomed to be a team,"" said Linda Johnson Rice, president and CEO of Ebony and Jet magazines' Johnson Publishing and a longtime family friend. ""As you can see through their performances, they were always there for each other."" In recent years, La Toya has appeared on the reality shows ""Armed and Famous"" and the UK ""Celebrity Big Brother."" She originally had a scene in the forthcoming Sacha Baron Cohen movie, ""Bruno,"" but CNN confirmed the scene has been cut, ""out of respect for Jackson's family,"" the studio told The (UK) Guardian. Jermaine, who converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Abdul-Aziz, appeared on ""Celebrity Big Brother"" in 2007. Jackie runs a record label, Tito remains involved in the music business, and according to a 2008 article in the New York Post, Marlon and Randy have struggled financially. In the hospital emergency room Thursday, Randy and Jermaine were witnessed hugging and crying over their late brother. ""We're a family,"" Jermaine told Larry King in the 2005 interview. ""We're no different than any other family who has feuds and problems. ... But at the same time, we're united, and we have a united front that is very, very strong, and it's supported by God. ""My mother and father did a great job in instilling the morals and principles in us from the very beginning. We feel that with that, that's all you need to go through life.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Thursday that he won't push to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center during his visit to the United Nations next week. Iran's president said he wanted to ""pay his respects"" and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks. The controversial leader asked to ""pay his respects"" and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks, but New York city officials on Wednesday denied that request, citing safety concerns at what is now a construction site. Ahmadinejad said he would try to visit the site ""if we have the time and the conditions are conducive."" But if local officials cannot make the proper arrangements, ""I won't insist,"" he said in an interview to be aired Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" The Bush administration considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism, and State Department spokesman Tom Casey called the request ""the height of hypocrisy."" CBS correspondent Scott Pelley told Ahmadinejad he ""must have known that visiting the World Trade Center site would infuriate many Americans."" ""Well, I'm amazed,"" he said, surprised by the question. ""How can you speak for the whole of the American nation? The American nation is made up of 300 million people. There are different points of view over there."" More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center, when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers. A third jet hit the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers. Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda. Ahmadinejad's predecessor, Mohammed Khatami, condemned the attacks and cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed. But the United States calls Iran the world's top state sponsor of terrorism because of its support of the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah and other militant groups. Washington and Tehran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days. The Bush administration has also accused Iran of meddling in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11, 2001, attacks. It accuses Iran of supplying advanced explosives to Shiite Muslim militias, some of which have used the devices against U.S. troops. Ahmadinejad also has drawn fire for his hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy international demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium. Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants, but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to create a nuclear bomb. The Iranian leader has made statements suggesting that Israel be politically ""wiped off the map,"" though he insists that can be accomplished without violence. He has questioned the existence of the Holocaust, the genocidal Nazi campaign against European Jews, and warned Europeans that they may pay a heavy price for its support of Israel. Ahmadinejad is also slated to speak on the campus of Columbia University during his visit, university President Lee Bollinger said. His presence is likely to spark protests on and off campus. Bollinger said the appearance is part of the World Leaders Forum -- an annual university event ""intended to further Columbia's long-standing tradition of serving as a major forum for robust debate.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A defiant and chaotic protest sprouted in and around a public square Monday despite a warning by Iran's Revolutionary Guard against the kind of street demonstrations that have roiled Iran for more than a week, witnesses said. Security forces patrol the streets of Tehran on Monday. Thousands of Iranians congregated and passed through Haft-e Tir Square, but riot police and the pro-government Basij militia confronted them and smacked their batons against their shin guards, making loud cracking sounds that seemed like gunshots, the witnesses said. As the protests continued, an election official with the Interior Ministry said the ""box-by-box details"" of the ballots -- which were confidential in previous elections -- would be released in response to claims that the election was rigged, Press TV reported. Iran's Guardian Council declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner of the election with 62.63 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, received 33.75 percent, surprising many experts who expected him to win. Iranians have continued protesting the results by taking to the streets. Most stores around the square were closed as the unrest reverberated, with some guarding against damage by erecting steel fences on their windows. Helicopters hovered overhead as the security forces wielded batons and used a spray to push the crowd out of the square. After that, police chased down demonstrators in nearby alleys and streets, with protesters and lawmen playing cat and mouse over several tension-filled hours until the crowd began to thin out around dusk. There were isolated face-offs and quarrels that broke out between demonstrators and the riot police and the Basij militia -- a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard, a military unit under the direct control of Iran's supreme leader. There were no reports of serious injuries, but there were at least eight arrests, witnesses said. ""Thirty years after the revolution, this is what we get,"" one man said dejectedly, watching the noisy and chaotic scene as he remembered the birth and the promise of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. The location was the spot where a vigil was to be held in memory of Neda, a young woman who became a symbol for the opposition after her death was caught on camera. While Internet postings on Twitter, Facebook and an Iranian opposition leader's Web site had mentioned a possible rally, it was unclear whether people who were at the square were there for a vigil. Some people were clad in black, a symbol of mourning, but placards and banners about Neda and candles have not been seen. However, security forces and demonstrators appeared at the square at the time the vigil was to be held.  Watch how women are on front line of protests » . Meanwhile, a message on opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's Facebook page, which could not be authenticated, called for a peaceful demonstration in Tehran on Thursday to honor the dead. ""We are waiting for the route of the march to be announced as well as the location of the sit-in,"" the message said. ""Presently the mausoleum of the founder of the Islamic Republic seems to be the safest place for the sit-in, so that we can mourn for our martyrs in a place that is close to the spirit of that free man. Demonstrators Monday had brushed off a warning from the Revolutionary Guard that people who ""disturb the peace and stand up to security forces"" would be met with a strong response. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the Revolutionary Guard as saying ""the guardians of the Islamic revolution and the courageous Basiji together with the security forces following the orders of the supreme leader and following him unquestioningly."" It said the authorities ""are determined to act strongly to return peace and tranquility to society ... and to clean the country of these plotters and hooligans."" Iran's Revolutionary Guard is directly under the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and enforces the government's Islamic codes and morality. With more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals. The regime's lawmakers called for a review of ties with Britain amid concerns over so-called Western ""meddling"" in the country's daily unrest. The government-funded Press TV reported that Iranian lawmakers were calling for a review of the country's ties with Britain because of its ""interference in Iran's recent post-election unrest."" Britain's Foreign Office announced Monday it is withdrawing the family members of its embassy staff from Iran until the situation there improves. News coverage in Iran has been limited by government restrictions on international journalists. On Sunday, the BBC said Iran had expelled Jon Leyne, the British network's permanent correspondent in Tehran. Al-Arabiya, a Dubai-based Arab satellite network, said its Tehran bureau was ordered closed. At least 19 people were killed in clashes in Tehran on Saturday as Iranians took to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 presidential election, according to hospital sources. Iranian-funded Press TV confirmed 13 fatalities, while unconfirmed reports put the number as high as 150.

"(CNN)  -- Two of the biggest stars in the NBA will be team-mates next season after a blockbuster trade which sees Shaquille O'Neal move from the Phoenix Suns to the Cleveland Cavaliers -- the home of league MVP LeBron James. Shaquille O'Neal is hoping his arrival will put a smile on the faces of Cleveland fans. The 37-year-old O'Neal is one of the all-time greats of basketball, winning four NBA championships, three straight with the Los Angeles Lakers and the other with Miami Heat. James is widely recognized as the sport's current superstar, but the 24-year-old has been left frustrated by Cleveland's failure to win the title. He stormed off the court after  their loss to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, not even shaking hands with 2008 Olympic teammate Dwight Howard. The trade, which sees Phoenix get center Ben Wallace and guard Sasha Pavlovic, has been talked about since February but finalized on Thursday night. ""I was elated about the trade because I get to play with one of the greatest players to ever play the game in LeBron James,"" O'Neal was quoted on the NBA's official Web site www.nba.com. O'Neal averaged 17.8 points and 8.4 rebounds in 75 games for the Suns last season and believes he still has much to offer the NBA. ""My numbers are not good enough to retire. Three more years left,"" O'Neal wrote on his Twitter blog. His career averages are 24.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots, with his peak seasons coming as he led the Lakers to three straight titles from 2000-02. The Lakers traded him to Miami where he spent three seasons, helping them to the NBA Championship three years ago. He has played in Phoenix for the past two years, restricted by injuries in his first season. The Cavs, powered by James, won 66 regular season games and their first eight in the playoffs before coming unstuck against the Magic. They will be hoping that O'Neal will be the final piece in the jigsaw to land the first American sports championship for Cleveland in 45 years.","Shaquille O'Neal is traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Cleveland Cavaliers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Transportation investigators Wednesday discovered ""anomalies"" in an essential control circuit of a track where a fatal crash between two Washington subway trains killed nine people. Investigators work Tuesday at the site of the Metro train crash in Washington. Each section of the transit system's track contains a circuit that transmits and receives signals that generate speed commands for trains, said Debbie Hersman of the National Transportation Safety Board. She said the circuits are ""vital providing information to the operators and the train itself when on automatic."" Investigators found no problems in five of the six circuits on the stretch of track in the crash area. But they found ""anomalies"" with the sixth circuit, Hersman said. She would not say what those anomalies were but said simulated crash tests would be conducted to try and determine what caused the deadly accident. The findings could mean that the striking train, which was on automatic, did not know to slow down because another train was stopped on the track ahead. Hersman said investigators walked the tracks Wednesday, finding markings on the track that indicated emergency braking had taken place. Investigators hoped Thursday to interview the operator of the struck train, who was released from a hospital Wednesday. The driver of the striking train was killed. The crash, the worst in the history of Washington's transit system, known as the Metro, occurred along the congested Red Line just before 5 p.m. Monday on an above-ground track section near Takoma Park, Maryland. Both cars were on the same track, traveling in the same direction -- southward from Fort Totten Metrorail station to the Shady Grove station. The struck train had stopped behind another train undergoing service and was awaiting directions to move ahead. The striking train was pulling some of the oldest cars in the fleet of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. On Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he plans to seek $3 billion for Metro transit capital improvements, some of which would likely be spent to replace some those old Series 1000 cars, purchased between 1974 and 1978. Upon impact, the train pulling those Series 1000 cars jumped on top of the other train. All the fatalities were on the striking train, Train 112, Metro transit spokeswoman Angela Gates told CNN on Wednesday. In the collision, the front car of the striking train was severely damaged, leaving minimal space for survivability, said Hersman. According to one report, 50 feet of the 75-foot length of that lead car were lost to the accident, leaving only one-third of the space after the crushing impact.  Watch Hersman talk about previous warnings » . The NTSB recommended in 2006 that Metro transit replace or retrofit all of its Series 1000 trains, to bring them up to current safety standards. Metro transit responded that because it was constrained by tax-advantage leases, it intended to keep the 1000 Series until the end of 2014. ""Our recommendation was not addressed, so it [the case] has been closed in an unacceptable status,"" Hersman said. The NTSB has no regulatory powers and can't force implementation.  Watch Hersman talk about the computer systems » . ""The safety of our citizens is our highest priority and we must take every precaution that this loss of life does not occur again,"" said Hoyer, a Democratic congressman from Maryland. He said he would soon introduce a final measure to authorize dedicated federal and local funding for Metro. The Series 1000 cars comprise a quarter of Metro transit's 1,126 cars, or nearly 300 cars, Gates said. At $3 million per car, the agency can't afford to replace them all at once, Gates said. Each car has a 40-year life and can last until fiscal year 2015, she added. ""So we've taken steps to keep them in good condition."" She said they have been phasing out the outdated cars as new cars are bought, she said. That plan hasn't gone as quickly as anticipated, however, because of an increase in ridership, Gates added. The lead train in Monday's crash contained newer 5000-Series and 3000-Series cars. These have data recorders, which will aid the investigation a great deal if they aren't damaged, Hersman said. The recorders provide information on such things as speed, braking and emergency applications. She said there were no recorders on the rear train. The rear train was being operated in automatic mode, which is the normal operating procedure during rush hour. Washington transit trains are being operated manually until the cause of the crash is determined, Hersman said. She said there is no indication that any of the brakes on the rear train failed before it rear-ended the other train. ""Our investigators on scene yesterday did find some evidence of emergency brake application. They found the emergency mushroom, which is a button that was depressed in the control cab, and they also examined the wheels and the brakes, and they found that the rotors showed some bluing,"" Hersman said. ""That bluing is consistent with an emergency brake application,"" she said. Bluing indicates the rotors have been subjected to extremely high temperatures, and this can be caused by hard stops.","House majority leader to push for $3 billion in Metro transit funding .

"(CNN) -- Carly Smithson wants to make one thing clear: She is not the new lead singer of Evanescence. Former ""American Idol"" contestant Carly Smithson is the lead singer of the new band We Are The Fallen. There may be some confusion because the former ""American Idol"" contestant has joined forces with original Evanescence members Ben Moody, Rocky Gray and John LeCompt for the new band We Are The Fallen. The dark-haired Irish rocker made it to the top six during season seven of ""American Idol"" before being eliminated. Smithson said that since then, quite a few opportunities have come her way that were not a good fit. This new band, which also includes bassist Marty O'Brien, is perfect for her, Smithson said . Guitar player LeCompt agrees. ""I've said many times about Evanescence that we caught lightning in a bottle ... and I think we are doing it again,"" he said. ""Carly is a good fit for the band because more than anything she is a brilliant, brilliant vocalist who is very down to earth and a humble person. She wants to do something where everyone is involved rather than being a posturing diva."" Smithson recently spoke with CNN about why she is thankful to Moody's roommate, why the group gets along so well and how they want to collaborate with fans. CNN: You must be pretty psyched about this new band. Carly Smithson: I am. It's pretty awesome and everything I think we have all ever wanted. We all blend together and it's all about making business. CNN: With all of the opportunities that have come your way since ""Idol,"" why go this route? Smithson: I had a lot of the wrong opportunities approach me. They were very flattering offers, but musically not on the same page with where I envisioned myself. As soon as Ben [Moody] came to me, he was actually someone that I had in mind, after coming off the ""Idol"" tour, to go and try and work with. He's worked on some music that I had a lot of respect for and really admired, but he was busy, oddly enough, working on this project. CNN: So how did you two connect? Smithson: He had never watched ""American Idol"" and he didn't know who I was. I am good friends with his roommate who recently moved in and I had met him briefly. My friend came and saw me live and then planted the seed in his head. She said, ""You should really consider my friend for this band,"" and he said ""Who is your friend?"" She said, ""You know, the girl you met down the basement,"" and an artist he has been working with played him a bunch of YouTube clips of me. We were hanging out at about one in the morning and he called my friend and said, ""I just watched your friend. I should have done this a long time ago. Where is she, when can I meet her, I need to meet her right away."" She said, ""Well, actually we are out right now and we're going to be at the house in about 20 minutes."" We came back to the house and we had a meeting which lasted until about 4 a.m. ... Obviously it was a decision I needed to make very fast because they were looking for a singer and people don't wait forever. I called my manager and it was a done deal pretty much the next day. CNN: Sounds like it was meant to be. Smithson: Everybody was very excited and thought it was the right direction to go. I'm happy that it happened in such an organic way. It's really weird, but as people we are all very alike. We all like the same jokes, watch the same TV shows and play the same music. It's great. CNN: Do you at all feel pressure because of the success that Evanescence had? Smithson: No, because this is a new band. Evanescence is still out there. We are not Evanescence and our band isn't here to follow.  Watch Smithson talk about the new band » . I'm here to make music. Obviously I want to be successful but I think we all are in a contented place to make music. If we can grab some fans, that's great. If we can grab a bunch of fans, that's awesome. We are here to compete with ourselves and put out something epic. CNN: What does the name mean? Smithson: It's more of a statement rather than a name. We feel like our fans can say ""We Are The Fallen"" as well as us. It's not just a band name, it's kind of like a movement name. We are trying to create a group of people that are in to the same thing. It's a collaboration of our fans and us appreciating music that we are making. CNN: So what do you all stand for, since you want the fans to be a part of it. Smithson: Freedom. Every since we all came into this band, we feel so free to go and be who we are. I embrace that.","""Idol"" finalist Carly Smithson is lead singer of new band We Are The Fallen .

"(CNN) -- Rem Koolhaas revolutionizes city landscapes with distinctive and cutting-edge buildings. Seattle's Central Library is one of Rem Koolhaas' recent builds. Responsible for the iconic CCTV headquarters in Beijing the Dutch architect was named one of ""The World's Most Influential People"" by Time magazine. Similar to the man himself, his buildings are not afraid to make a statement. ""We felt it was very important for an entity like CCTV to make its presence felt... To generate a space and to define a space, that is the main thing,"" he told CNN at the opening of his ""Transformer"" building in Seoul, South Korea. Koolhaas admits that the current economic climate is not particularly favorable to big and bold architectural plans, but from adversity comes creativity. ""Definitely there were a number of projects that we worked on put on hold, but on the other hand certain things were also accelerated because the price of construction is getting so cheap."" Despite these new parameters he remains optimistic that his profession will continue to invent and be relevant, ""because it means kind of smaller, but more complex and kind of interesting things, kind of related to, not necessarily with commerce, but more connected to culture and to the social world."" His buildings have attracted worldwide fame and given Koolhaas himself a form of semi-celebrity status. Yet Koolhaas still feels a sense of unease being labeled a ""Starchitect."" ""I think it's a name that is actually degrading to the vast majority of people it is applied to. And it really is a kind of political term that for certain clients is important because they use star architects. My hope is that through the current complexity that title will exit discretely and disappear,"" he said. He believes that by being able to respond to different demands architecture is evolving into something new. ""It is not possible to live in this age if you don't have a sense of many contradictory forces,"" he said. ""Each building has to be beautiful, but cheap and fast, but it lasts forever. That is already an incredible battery of seemingly contradictory demands. So yes, I'm definitely perhaps contradictory person, but I operate in very contradictory times.""","Dutch architect is creative force behind landmark buildings across the world .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- The five remaining defendants in the racially charged ""Jena Six"" case will appear in court Friday and are expected to enter a plea, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said. Protesters converged on the small Louisiana town in September 2007 after the ""Jena 6"" were charged. Bill Furlow, spokesman for LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters, declined to say whether the defendants will plead guilty. ""It's not a done deal until it's a done deal,"" he said. In December 2006, six African-American teenagers were charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy in the beating of a white classmate. The incident followed months of racial tension in the community of about 3,000 people. Jena, Louisiana, is about 140 miles southeast of Shreveport in the north-central part of the state. The case drew national attention from civil rights groups, who argued that the charges were excessive. An estimated 15,000-plus demonstrators turned out for a rally on behalf of the teens: Carwin Jones, Jesse Ray Beard, Robert Bailey Jr., Bryant Purvis, Theo Shaw and Mychal Bell. The charges were eventually reduced. Bell pleaded guilty to battery in a juvenile court and moved to Monroe, Louisiana. In January, Bell said he had attempted suicide the month before by shooting himself in the chest but was recovering.

""Entrepreneurs are at the very heart of what the American dream is all about,"" says Demmellash, a native of Ethiopia. And from her small office in Jersey City, her nonprofit, Rising Tide Capital, is helping small businesses flourish.

Demmellash's own struggle began in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, amid instability and unrest. Thousands of Ethiopians -- including her aunt -- disappeared or were tortured and/or killed under the ruling military regime. When Demmellash was 2, her mother fled the country, leaving the toddler in the care of her grandmother and aunt. Demmellash lived on less than a dollar a day but never considered herself poor.  Watch Demmellash talk about her childhood » . Nearly a decade later, Demmellash and her mother reunited in Boston, Massachusetts. But Demmellash found her mother wasn't living the American dream she'd envisioned. ""I [thought] I would find my mom in a beautiful mansion with trees [and] gold everywhere,"" recalls Demmellash, now 29. ""I was shocked when I found her in her tiny apartment ... working very, very hard."" Her mother had worked as a waitress during the day and a seamstress at night to earn money to bring her daughter to the United States. Watching her mother sew beautiful gowns for low profits, Demmellash thought there had to be a way for her to increase what she was making as a seamstress. ""Even though she had the skills, she did not necessarily have the business skills,"" she says, adding that her mother's pricing ""was completely off."" Still, her mother worked tirelessly to keep her daughter adequately fed, clothed and in school. Demmellash was later admitted to Harvard University, which she was able to attend with the help of ""wonderful financial aid."" At Harvard, Demmellash and classmate Alex Forrester discussed what their generation could do to alleviate poverty on a local level. They set out to learn what resources people needed -- or as Demmellash says, ""to find people like my mom."" In 2004, the pair started Rising Tide Capital (RTC) to help those who had ideas and abilities but needed the education and support to launch or grow their businesses. ""You hear a lot of talk about Main Street and Wall Street, but no one really talks about how exactly you go about helping the Mom-and-Pops,"" says Demmellash. The group runs the Community Business Academy, an intensive training session coupled with year-round coaching and mentorship to help individuals ""really work on the hands-on management side of their business,"" Demmellash says. The organization supports underserved populations, including women, the formerly incarcerated, minorities, unemployed and working poor, and immigrants and refugees. Demmellash and Forrester -- now married -- have helped 250 entrepreneurs and small-business owners in New Jersey so far, 70 percent of whom are single mothers. RTC raises money from corporations and works with local governments for funding in order to provide classes and support its participants at affordable costs. Participants pay a small materials and registration fee based on their income range: either $100 or $225 for the course that Demmellash says would cost thousands of dollars otherwise. The organization has also built partnerships with micro-lenders, so when students are ready, the lenders provide financing. ""The ability to become self-reliant, to have economic hope, [that is] the fabric of this country and we have to fight for it,"" Demmellash says. Many of RTC's students use the increased earnings from their new business to supplement their wages, allowing them to better provide for their families and transform the face of their communities, according to Demmellash. ""There are thousands of entrepreneurs, millions across this country, who do incredible things and make money to put food on the table, to pay their bills, and to save for the future and their children,"" she says. ""If we were to literally bank on them, invest in them [and] support them ... that's the kind of stuff that changes lives and strengthens families."" Want to get involved?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States is providing weapons and ammunition to Somalia's transitional government as it fights al Qaeda-linked Islamic militants, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Thursday. Somali government soldiers, who are fighting Islamic militants, patrol Mogadishu. ""At the request of that government the State Department has helped to provide weapons and ammunition on an urgent basis,"" he said. ""This is to support the Transitional Federal Government's efforts to repel the onslaught of extremist forces which are intent on destroying the Djibouti peace process.""

There is growing concern that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said that the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives. ""Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa, like Somalia and Yemen, that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there,"" Panetta said earlier this month. ""We are focusing on those countries as well in order to ensure that there is no safe haven for al Qaeda as we continue to pressure them, continue to push them, and hopefully continue to make the effort to destroy them, not only in Pakistan but throughout the rest of the world."" Somalia is not new territory for al Qaeda, according to CNN's terrorism analyst Peter Bergen. ""Al Qaeda was running training camps in Somalia in the early and mid-1990s,"" he said. ""If this is now coming back, this is something that al Qaeda has already done and it's worrisome for the future. ... ""The fact that we're seeing evidence of this already happening in both Yemen and Somalia suggests that, A, the drone program in the tribal areas of Pakistan has been effective, but, B, you know it's pushing al Qaeda into areas where they'll build up larger operations."" Somalia recently called on its neighbors to send military forces to help government troops stop hard-line Islamist militants from taking over. The call for help came hours after a third top politician was killed this month in ongoing fighting. The deaths included Mogadishu's police chief and Somalia's internal security minister, who was killed in a suicide car bombing in the central city of Beledweyne. A Pakistani militant who is a high-ranking official in al Qaeda is leading the fighting in Somalia against the government, said Sheikh Adan Madowe, Somalia's parliament speaker. Madowe warned that militants will spread fighting into the rest of the region if they topple the government in Somalia. The United States is concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power later that year. ""We think this government ... represents Somalia's best chance for peace, stability and reconciliation,"" Kelly said Thursday. ""This government is the best chance they've had in the last 18 years."" Somalia's current President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed is a former member of the Islamic Courts Union, which took part in the 2006 coup. His decision to renounce the bloody insurgency and try to establish peace in Somalia has put him at odds with Islamist hard-liners who are still battling for control of Somalia. Residents and journalists in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, have reported seeing foreign fighters among Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamic militia that is battling to overthrow the weak transitional government. Those foreign fighters recently distributed recorded messages from al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden calling for the overthrow of the government. Al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahideen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in March 2008. It is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia.","State Department: Weapons for fighting al Qaeda-linked Islamic militants .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A blossoming of cinematic creativity has swept Argentina in recent years, bringing about a second golden age of film. Pablo Trapero's latest movie ""Lion's Den"" stars Martina Gusman (left) and was in competition at Cannes. In Argentina, the renaissance marks a return to form for a cinematic tradition that was prolific and highly successful until creativity was stifled by a succession of military regimes that began with the ascendancy of Juan Peron in the 1940s. A revival occurred after the country returned to democracy in 1983 as filmmakers focused on life under the military dictatorship -- Luiz Puenzo's ""The Official Story"" (1985) won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. But an economic malaise ensued, turning off the taps to film financing. An economic boom in the 1990s quickly turned unstable, resulting in a crippling financial crisis earlier this decade that plunged Argentina into its worst recession ever. Out of the chaos, a new group of Argentina filmmakers emerged. The leaders of the so-called ""New Argentine Cinema"" have become critical contributors to the wider Latin American film movement that has captivated international critics and audiences alike. What's fueling New Argentine Cinema? Argentina's economy has recovered remarkably since its collapse in 2001, and the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), has been keen to foster the industry's development. The combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made Buenos Aires a hub of creativity. Already one of the most cosmopolitan cities in South America, the city is attracting everyone from local bohemians to big Hollywood names. Francis Ford Coppola, the most recent notable to tap into the vibrant scene, opened an Argentine unit of his Zoetrope production company last year to film his Buenos Aires-set family drama ""Tetro,"" which is anticipated to be released next year. What movies are creating buzz? Pablo Trapero's ""Lion's Den"" about a woman who gives birth and raises her child in prison was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year. Trapero is best known for his depiction of ordinary people. He gained acclaim with ""Crane World"" (1999) -- a gritty look at Argentina's working class -- and is widely considered one of Argentina's leading directors. Also in competition at Cannes this year was ""The Headless Woman"" from the ever subtle Lucrecia Martel. The film focuses on a woman's guilt after a hit-and-run accident and like Martel's other works, offers up a dose of social criticism. Martel burst on the scene with her first movie ""The Swamp"" (2001), winner of the Alfred Bauer Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Lucia Puenzo stirred debate with ""XXY"" (2007), an exploration of adolescent sexuality centered around the life of a teenage hermaphrodite. The daughter of award-winning Luiz Puenzo, Lucia took home the Critic Weeks Grand Prize at Cannes last year. Are you excited about Argentine cinema? What is your favorite movie or director? Enough with the dramas -- who makes Argentines laugh? Daniel Burman has cited Woody Allen as one of the auteurs he most admires, and the influence is quite clear in his work, in which his identity as a Jew in Argentina figures prominently. ""Waiting for the Messiah"" (2000), ""Lost Embrace"" (2004) and ""Family Law"" (2006) make up the trilogy of films about fatherhood for which he has gained praise. The young director's latest film ""Empty Nest"" (2008) takes a touching and comedic look at married life. What's this I hear about a Hollywood in Argentina? You're referring to Palermo Hollywood. No, it's not a Las Vegas casino but rather a neighborhood in Buenos Aires where many film and TV studios are based. A bohemian spirit distinguishes the neighborhood from its more polished cousin to the south, Palermo Soho. Once occupied by desolate factories and warehouses, the area is now humming with activity. An abundance of hip lounges, cafes and trendy restaurants keep the buzz going all day and through the night. How does Argentina figure in the Latin American film scene? As the Latin American film renaissance has gained stride, filmmakers across the region have become more interested in collaborating on projects. The end of military dictatorships which ruled Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s ""created really interesting national cinemas that blossomed a little bit everywhere but also created a correlation between directors from different countries,"" Brazilian director Walter Salles told CNN earlier this year. Salles works frequently with Argentine directors. He co-produced Trapero's ""Lion's Den"" and Julia Solomonoff's ""Sisters"" (2005). Meanwhile, Eduardo Constantini Jr, of the philanthropic Constantini family in Argentina, recently launched a fund with the Weinstein Co. aimed at backing Latin American movies. He is also behind The Auteurs, an ""online movie theater"" where Web users can watch and discuss film. Is this boom going to run out of steam? The renaissance in Argentina has been building for some time, but it's only just hitting its stride now. Earlier films were mainly art house successes but now with the spotlight shining on Latin America cinema, Argentine films may start to connect more with international audiences. The country continues to attract productions, and there is a vast pool of talent that is being groomed to lead the next generation of auteurs. More than 12,000 undergraduates are currently studying film directing, scriptwriting and technical production, according to the INCAA. Five other must-see Argentine films . 1. ""The Night of the Pencils"" (Hector Olivera, 1986) 2. ""Nine Queens"" (Fabian Bielinsky, 2000) 3. ""Son of the Bride"" (Juan Jose Campanella, 2001) 4. ""The Dog"" (Carlos Sorin, 2004) 5.

"(CNN) -- Former rugby superstar Jonah Lomu has revealed that he is poised to make a shock playing comeback at the age of 34 with French third-division club Marseille Vitrolles. Jonah Lomu pictured in action for New Zealand's All Blacks during the 1999 World Cup in France. The giant New Zealander, who became a global name after an electrifying series of performances on the wing for the All Blacks at the 1995 World Cup, retired in 2007 after a succession of injuries hampered his attempt to return following a kidney transplant. He played 63 internationals, the last of them in 2002, but was never able to regain his previous dominance even after regaining full health. ""Marseille Vitrolles is on the point of finalizing the transfer of the greatest legend in world rugby,"" said statement on the club's Web site. Lomu, who is featuring in a new worldwide advertising campaign for sportswear manufacturer adidas called ""Nothing Is Impossible"", was also quoted as confirming his desire to return to the playing field. ""I took a sabbatical year to be at my pregnant partner's side and to fully enjoy this important moment in any man's life,"" he said on the Web site. ""Everyone thought I had ended my playing career, but that was wrong. I still feel the desire to play and it will be me alone who decides when to call it a day. ""My ambition is to help a club like Marseille join the group of top clubs in France."" Lomu was first diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996. He successfully returned to the game after treatment, but in May 2003 he was put on dialysis three times a week due to deterioration in his kidney function, with the treatment's side effects leaving him with severe nerve damage in his feet and legs. Lomu faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed, so underwent the operation. He signed a two-year contract with New Zealand province North Harbour in 2005, and also played for Welsh club Cardiff Blues during the southern hemisphere's off-season. However, he was unable to achieve his goal of being selected in the All Blacks squad for the 2007 World Cup in France, having suffered a shoulder injury. Lomu agreed to play in a charity match in England last year, but withdrew after injuring his ankle in training.","Former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu to join French third-division club .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Tess Sosa and her daughter have had a hard time forgetting US Airways Flight 1549's emergency landing in New York City's Hudson River in January. Tess Sosa holds her infant son, Damian, as her daughter Sophia, 4, plays on the couch. Sosa and Sophia, 4, have needed therapy, and the Sosas have had to pay out of their own pockets because US Airways' insurer says only three counseling sessions are covered. The family has private insurance and large deductible. The airline and insurer say compensation to the passengers has already exceeded US Airway's obligation, adding they gave $5,000 to passengers after the incident. But Sosa said she thinks the airline is still falling short . ""They have gone to incredible measures to get all of our belongings back, dry them out,"" she said. ""However, I think in doing so, there was this huge oversight in 'Let's take care of these passengers.'""  Watch Sosa explain her expectations » . Relief over her family's survival can't undo the trauma she endured after the January 15 landing, during which she had to scramble over seats with her infant son, Damian, in tow. Water rushed into the plane as she turned and saw her husband, Martin, sitting at the back of the plane with their then-3-year-old daughter, Sophia. She recalled her husband ""in shock with my daughter being held up high, the water coming in, and hoping they'd see me."" Another passenger ""bear hugged"" her and Damian and escorted them to the exit. Today, Sosa still remembers how she felt that day: ""the possibility, the imminent death, just waiting to see if the plane was going to plunge any further in the river."" Following the emergency ditching of Flight 1549, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was quickly crowned a hero for ably landing the Airbus A320 after birds disabled its engines. He made the cover of several magazines, including People, which featured him holding Damian Sosa.  See other notable air accidents » . U.S. Airways hired a firm to restore and return thousands of personal items to passengers -- items ranging from boarding tickets to suitcases. The airline's insurer, American International Underwriters Holdings, a unit of AIG, says US Airways went above and beyond its obligations because the airline is not liable in the crash and the insurers' responsibility ""is to pay valid claims on behalf of US Airways as a result of its legal liability."" Commenting for AIU, Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, said he concurred that the airline and insurer had fulfilled their obligations. ""We have a flock of birds flying into jet engines for a perfectly well-functioning aircraft and a crew that exhibited extraordinary professionalism in this particular incident. This is very important to recognize, but again, the liability does not exist,"" he said. This is little consolation to the Sosas, whose private insurance has a $3,000 deductible. Sosa said the family still needs help dealing with the trauma, especially Sophia. The family just received another $1,000 bill for therapy sessions. ""I expect my family to be taken care of in the very best way possible, and I don't feel like that's happening when you're balking at my claims to a therapist and you are setting limits on that,"" she said.","Family paying for therapy out of pocket after Flight 1549's crash landing .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- One year before the FIFA World Cup kicks off, 26 teams of gay and lesbian footballers are battling for global supremacy in the Gay Soccer World Championships. Players from the London Stonewall Lions hold the 2008 Gay World Soccer Championship trophy aloft . Co-ordinated by the International Gay & Lesbian Football Association (IGLFA), the tournament, which began on Sunday, is being hosted by the Federal Triangles club in Washington D.C., and supported by the local Major League Soccer (MLS) side D.C. United. IGLFA spokesman Michael Pranikoff told CNN that the competition has been running annually since 1992. ""We started very small. There were just a few clubs from around the world. But we have gone from strength to strength. Last year the tournament was in London and sanctioned by the Football Association."" Pranikoff said there are no professional players involved, but the standard of play is strong and the teams in the top divisions are very competitive. Although the tournament involves club sides -- rather than national teams, there is still a strong international feel with players from the U.S., United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Germany, Australia, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Argentina, Italy, and Norway all taking part. The London Stonewall Lions are the reigning champions in the men's division and expected to figure in Sunday's final at Trinity Washington University, he said. Despite the competitive nature of the event, Pranikoff said there are also less serious divisions where there is a more important message. ""When you are on the pitch it's all about the game. But it's also about providing an environment where people can be free to be who they are. ""It's a lot about camaraderie too. There are a lot of places in the world where gays and lesbians aren't accepted."" So, is the competition restricted to only gay and lesbian players? Not at all, said Pranikoff. ""It's very open, we don't discriminate."" He said gay, lesbian, bi-sexual and heterosexual players were all welcome to play. Pranikoff said he is happy with how the 2009 event is unfolding, despite numbers being slightly down on what was expected -- due to the effects of the recession, swine flu and the upcoming Out Games in Denmark which has made attending the football tournament unaffordable for some teams. ""This year we didn't have as big a global turnout as we hoped for but there have been a lot of challenges -- so we're pleased to have 26 teams here."" Outside of organizing the current world championships, the IGLFA has also been involved in helping other organizations at stamping out homophobia, Pranikoff said.","The Gay World Soccer Championships are being held in Washington D.C.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Media maven Oprah Winfrey earned 10 times more than Angelina Jolie last year, but the actress bumped the talk show host from the top spot on Forbes' 2009 Celebrity 100 list just released by the business magazine. Angelina Jolie has ousted Oprah Winfrey from the No. 1 spot on Forbes' 2009 Celebrity 100 list. Jolie's fame, evidenced by magazine covers and TV, radio, newspaper and Web stories, outweighed Winfrey's, giving her the edge as ""the most powerful celebrity in the world"" based on Forbes' formula, Forbes Senior Editor Matthew Miller said. Winfrey, who was at the top for two years straight, grossed $275 million last year, compared with Jolie's $27 million, Miller said. ""We try and measure a celebrity's power, and we look at two metrics to do that,"" Miller said. ""We look at money, and we look at fame."" A world tour, which helped Madonna pull in $110 million, and a bumper crop of tabloid gossip pushed the Material Girl into the third spot, up from her 21st ranking on last year's list. Beyonce Knowles held steady in fourth, same as last year, with $87 million in income from her multiplatform empire, Miller said. Forbes leveraged the singer-actresses fame by placing her on this week's cover. A bad knee kept Tiger Woods off the PGA tour over the past year and lowered him to the fifth spot on the Forbes list. The golfer, still the highest-paid athlete in the world, was second last year. Bruce Springsteen's tour landed the Boss in sixth, while director Steven Spielberg's latest Indiana Jones movie helped him to seventh place. Actress Jennifer Aniston and her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, were eighth and ninth, respectively, on the strength of successful movies and tabloid headlines. Basketballer Kobe Bryant's endorsements and popularity, boosted by his play on the U.S. Olympic team, jumped to the 10th spot. Miller said Forbes' has spent a great amount of time compiling the list for the past decade because ""celebrities play an ever increasing role in everyone's lives, whether we like it or not."" ""Celebrities are brands, and they are marketing to us and there's stuff we consume off of them, from movies to albums to concerts to books to speaking tours to everything in between, and we sort of all buy into it,"" he said. The income figures used are gross numbers and do not take into account what goes to agents, managers, taxes and expenses, Miller said. ""It can be very expensive to be a celebrity,"" he said. ""What they're taking home to their personal checking accounts is far less than their gross earnings."" The list, which has been ""put through our special sauce of earnings and fame,"" is used as a barometer of who has the real power in Hollywood, Miller said. ""When you look at the components of fame and earnings, you can get a good vibe as to who's important this year and who's not,"" he said. ""Angelina Jolie is, by far, the most famous celebrity on the planet,"" he said. ""There's not a day that goes by where she's not on the cover of a tabloid magazine or a regular magazine. There's not day that goes by when people are not talking about her philanthropy or her relationship with Brad Pitt or her movies or her children. All of that lends to a more popular, more robust and, frankly, more valuable brand."" Miller estimated that Jolie was on about 20 to 30 times more magazine covers last year than Winfrey. It's normal for celebs to fall down or off the list for a year if they are between projects, he said. One newcomer to the list of top 100 celebrities is Barack Obama, debuting at 49. Obama is the first sitting head of state to appear in Forbes' Celebrity 100 rankings. CNN's Jim Roope contributed to this report.","Angelina Jolie's fame factor is too much for Oprah Winfrey's money-making machine .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former middle-school student who was strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her Supreme Court appeal Thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety. Savana Redding leaves the U.S Supreme Court in April. She was 13 when she was strip-searched. Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs. No medication was found, and she later sued. The justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued. The larger issue of whether a campus setting traditionally gives schools greater authority over students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed was not addressed fully by the divided court. ""Savana's subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening and humiliating,"" wrote Justice David Souter for the majority, likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week. But reflecting the divisiveness over the issue, Souter said, ""We think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case."" Whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court. ""I'm pretty excited that they agreed with me, they see that it was wrong for the school to do that,"" Redding said from her Hobbs, New Mexico, home after the ruling was announced. ""I'm pretty certain that it's so far less likely to happen again"" to other students. Redding was an eighth-grade honor student in 2003, with no history of disciplinary problems at Safford Middle School, about 127 miles from Tucson, Arizona. During an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that Redding had given her prescription-strength 400-milligram ibuprofen pills. The school had a near-zero-tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the-counter medication, including the ibuprofen, without prior written permission. Redding was pulled from class by Vice Principal Kerry Wilson, escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence. The girl denied the accusations. A search of Redding's backpack found nothing. A strip search was conducted by Wilson's assistant and a school nurse, both females. Redding was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear, so any hidden pills might fall out, according to court records. No drugs were found. ""The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had,"" Redding said in an affidavit. ""I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry."" Souter said Wilson initially had ""sufficient suspicion"" to justify searching the girl's backpack and outer clothing. But when no contraband was found, the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the school, calling the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. That court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom. The Supreme Court found little agreement on key issues. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the search was illegal but would have also made individual officials liable for damages by Redding. ""Wilson's treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it,"" said Ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in April, criticizing the school's actions. But Justice Clarence Thomas took the opposite view: that administrators deserved immunity and that the search was permissible. ""Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution,"" he said. ""And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative."" In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes. Such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing that it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive."" Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes and those participating in other extracurricular activities. The court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over. Adam Wolf, an ACLU attorney who represented Redding, applauded the decision. ""When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials,"" Wolf said . But school administrators said the ruling does not make their jobs any easier. ""The home medicine cabinet now poses a serious threat to students, who may take those medications for abusive purposes,"" said Francisco Negron, general counsel for the National School Boards Association. ""That's a problem schools are trying to stem."" ""How they determine now whether the drug is dangerous, whether it's not dangerous -- that kind of clarity and that kind of guidance, the court did not give us."" Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience. ""Before it happened, I loved school, loved everything about it. You know, I had a 4.0 GPA, honor roll, and now, well, afterwards I never wanted to go to school again."" She is attending college. The case is Safford Unified School District No. 1 v. Redding (08-479).","Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected she was carrying drugs .

"(CNN) -- Will Smith's Hancock wasn't the first superhero with bad habits and a bad attitude. Hellboy, the protagonist of ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army,"" has a bit of the devil in him: His skin is red; he has two shorn-off horns on his head, a gargantuan club fist and a long, slippery tail. Ron Perlman returns in the title role in ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army."" He also has a down-to-earth side: a fondness for Cuban cigars, Mexican beer, TV and candy. He has a short fuse and he'd like a little appreciation for his efforts, please. He deserves it, too. This rank outsider isn't a billionaire like Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark. He's not even a scientist like Bruce Banner. He's more of a working stiff, a slugger with a gruff manner and a stogie in the side of his mouth -- but he wants to bat for the right team. (According to writer-artist Mike Mignola, the character was inspired by his father, a cabinetmaker.) Hellboy -- or ""Red"" to his friends -- has switched studios since his 2004 big-screen debut, from Columbia to Universal. Not that it shows. Writer-director Guillermo del Toro is still pulling the strings, and the key creative personnel are all back, including Ron Perlman in the title role, Selma Blair as the pyrokinetic Liz (now Mrs. Hellboy), Doug Jones as the piscine Abe Sapien (the brains to Red's brawn), and -- behind the scenes -- cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, and art whizzes Stephen Scott and Peter Francis. Between them, they conjure up one hell of a creature feature. ""Hellboy II"" boasts a dazzling multitude of imaginary beings: the deceptively delicate tooth fairies (so called because they eat bone, with a fondness for teeth in particular); the elfin king whose antlers grow out of his head to form a crown; the plantlike forest god that collapses into a strangely beautiful floral mulch right under the Brooklyn Bridge; the magnificent Angel of Death, an old crone who unfurls her wings to reveal a sparkling set of eyes (an avian variation on the creepiest creation in the acclaimed ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" del Toro's last movie). Then there's the redoubtable Johann Kraus, an officious but in many ways admirable German who only exists as a vapor trail -- except when he's bottled up in an ingeniously modified, but still splendidly archaic, deep-sea diving suit. When a filmmaker can invest even a puff of smoke with so much chutzpah you know he's on to something. It's wonderful to see del Toro let his imagination run rampant like this. iReport.com: Did you see ""Hellboy II""? Share your review . The plot concerns an ancient race that's determined to wage war on humanity, but it's secondary to del Toro's amazing characters. The Mexican director's first Hollywood movies (""Mimic"" and ""Blade II"") were far less distinctive than his Spanish-language films: ""Cronos,"" ""The Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth."" You couldn't really call ""Hellboy II"" an advance on the latter -- ""Pan's"" was nominated for six Oscars and won three -- but it's obvious he relishes this material. It's pulpy and hammy and unashamedly lowbrow, and del Toro has the confidence and power to make it his own. The film feels very free, loose and (unusually for a special-effects picture) improvisational. An outsize personality such as Perlman is in his element here. Even when the wisecracks fall short -- there are an awful lot of ""ass"" gags -- they are closer to the grubby, subversive impulses of the comic books than the over-hyped, market-tested, industrial-strength blockbuster adaptations Hollywood churns out. It's not for nothing that the central tension running through this movie is Red's anarchic streak, his sometimes irresponsible need to be his own man in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (the ""X-Men""-like institution where he works) and in his marriage. Scratch the surface, and this is a film about love and loyalty, figuring out where your deepest bonds lie. Highbrows may damn ""Hellboy II"" as a ""comic book movie,"" though even they would have to grant that its wonderful idiosyncrasies indicate brilliance. But it's more than that. Hellboy does so much growing up over the course of these 110 minutes, we may have to call him ""Hellman"" from now on. Let's hope Universal stays the course and gives us that opportunity. People as creative as del Toro and his gang need all the support we can give them. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is rated PG-13 and runs 110 minutes.

"(CNN) -- China's Olympic adventure may be over, but new age chanteuse Sa Dingding is one global export that in many ways echoes the Beijing Olympic fantasy of ""One World. One Dream."" Sa Dingding's music should find a home on the iPods of millions of chill-out world music fans. Born to a Mongolian mother and Han Chinese father, she sings in Mandarin, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and the rare dialect of Lagu, while fusing chill-out beats and floaty instrumentation played on zither, horse head fiddle and bamboo flute. Already hugely popular in China, she has been finding similar success farther afield: Her first album sold 2 million copies in Southeast Asia, and she has appeared on MTV. Earlier this year she won a BBC Radio 3 World Music Award as well as performing at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Her linguistic skills and musicianship were honed from a young age. Born in Inner Mongolia in 1983, she spent three years until the age of 6 with her grandmother, living a nomadic life in northern China, where her imagination and creativity were allowed to roam free. ""We actually lived in a small city between grassland and the big city. In spring time, we move to the grassland. And in winter time, we moved back to the city,""she told CNN's Talk Asia. ""The whole memory of my childhood is in one word: Play. I just played everywhere on the grassland. And there a lot of interesting things happened which affected the ... life of mine."" Later she became a student of Buddhism and yoga as well as becoming a multi-instrumentalist, releasing her first album at the age of 18. Melding different musical cultures and ethnic influences, notably Tibetan, has also caused a certain amount of discussion, especially on her own position toward the status of Tibet within China. ""From a musician's point of view, Tibetan culture and its music cannot be seen as an isolated subject... lots and lots of other ethnicities have added their colors on the Tibetan culture. So I see the Tibetan culture nowadays as an integral part of the greater Chinese culture,"" she said. Aiming to avoid controversy, organizers of the Glastonbury festival dropped her from this year's lineup. ""I don't quite understand the reason behind [it]. To me, art and music really belong to the whole world and they shouldn't be limited by boundaries. So I really hope that I could join Glastonbury next year,"" she said. Until then further explorations in language and music beckon, and there have been recent collaborations with house music DJ Paul Oakenfold and French chill-out duo Deep Forest in Europe. ""It's very amazing because when I had to return to China, they drove me to the airport and told me: 'Life is full of miracles. When you first arrived here, these three songs didn't exist.

"(CNN) -- A 6-foot-4 football player is more than a million times the size of a typical Staphylococcus bacterium. But under the right conditions, that athlete could find himself defenseless against the microscopic bug. Kellen Winslow recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up. The problem came to the forefront last week with Cleveland Browns player Kellen Winslow, who recently had his second staph infection. He is reportedly the sixth player to acquire staph among the Browns in five years. Winslow recently said the Browns treated him like a ""piece of meat"" when he was hospitalized for the condition, and he claimed they covered up the cause of his illness. After Winslow spoke out, the organization suspended him for one game, then rescinded the suspension after a settlement with Winslow over the weekend. The Browns said in a statement Saturday that the team and Winslow had worked through their differences, and that the team looked forward to his return. Winslow joined the team again Monday. Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts was revealed to have a staph infection, the Indianapolis Star reported Friday. University of North Carolina-Asheville fans also recently learned that Kenny George, the 7-foot-7 center on the basketball team, had a staph infection complication that led to part of his foot being amputated. It's unclear how these high-profile athletes acquired their infections, but locker rooms have been found to habor staph bacteria in previous outbreaks. The topic is generating buzz throughout the sports world as more players' staph cases are revealed. Hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph, but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings. Regardless of where these players got their infections, the close quarters of a locker room raise questions about overall risks. About 30 percent of people carry staph in their noses without exhibiting symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a form of staph resistant to common antibiotics, has become a more prevalent problem in settings such as contact sports that involve skin-to-skin touching. Most MRSA infections acquired in community settings present themselves as sores or boils and often appear red, swollen, painful or with drainage such as pus, the CDC says. Infections often occur in cuts and abrasions but also on body parts covered in hair, such as the back of the neck, armpit or groin. Schools, prisons and other crowded environments are particularly known for transmitting MRSA, said. Elaine Larson, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. MRSA may spread particularly easily among athletes because they have repeated skin-to-skin contact, share items and surfaces that touch skin and have a hard time staying clean, the CDC says. Athletes often get cuts and abrasions; MRSA can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection. Dr. James Steinberg, medical director at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, said that environment plays a role in the spread of MRSA but that it's less a factor than coming into contact with a person's skin. ""If you have somebody who has an infection -- he has a draining infection -- and he gets some of his pus on a bench, that staph's going to be there for hours or days before it dries out,"" he said. ""But the higher concentration is going to be on that person's skin."" A second infection in the same person could result from re-exposure or from treatment that didn't get rid of the bacteria colonization, he said. MRSA has been around in hospital settings since the 1970s, but community-associated MRSA was born in the late 1990s, and is now widespread in the community, said CDC spokesperson Nicole Coffin. A report from the CDC said that the deaths of four children from MRSA in North Dakota and Minnesota during the late 1990s ""demonstrate the potential severity of community-acquired MRSA infections."" A study on the St. Louis Rams published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2003 found that during the 2003 football season, there were eight MRSA infections among five of the 58 Rams players. To protect against MRSA, the CDC recommends practicing good personal hygiene and taking care of your skin, which includes wearing protective clothing and covering cuts and abrasions with clean, dry bandages. Also, do not share items that come into contact with your skin, such as towels, razors and ointments. Put something between your skin and shared equipment -- for example, sit on a towel on a bench. Larson said she is not directly familiar with Winslow's situation but understands the dilemma that a team would face if a player contracted a staph infection. There could be economic and psychosocial repercussions -- for example, another team might not want to play against that one, she said. But in general, other team members should be made aware of the situation so they do not share towels or engage in other behaviors that might transmit the infection. Still, there is a danger of overreaction, she said. In some instances when a child in a public school has died, the whole school panicked and fumigated the facility, she said. ""It's a good idea to avoid that level of fear, because it's costly and it scares people unnecessarily,"" she said. On Thursday, the Brown's General Manager Phil Savage said the team did not alert players to Winslow's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in ""game mode"" when Winslow had a confirmed diagnosis. ""To come out and talk about that just was going to be another distraction,"" Savage said on his regular weekly appearance on WTAM radio in Cleveland, Ohio. ""That's our job, is to limit distractions as much as we can."" Winslow said in a statement released through his publicist, Denise White of EAG Sports Management, that he had been discouraged from making the issue public. ""This has nothing to do with football, and this has nothing to with my current contract situation,"" he said. ""This is a health concern."" A spokesperson for the Browns did not return a request for comment. An NFL representative said the league has no statement on the issue.","Several professional athletes have recently had staph infections .

"(CNN) -- A student who videoed a re-enactment of the ""Jena 6"" incident apologized and said the video was not intended to make fun of the six black students arrested in the beating of a white classmate, according to The News-Star newspaper of Monroe, Louisiana. The incident involving six black students has sparked protests across the country, like this one in Washington. The video, taped by University of Louisiana-Monroe student Kristy Smith, shows students in blackface apparently acting out the beating of Jena High School student Justin Barker.   One of the males in the tape runs onto the beach acting as if he is holding a noose, and three others -- covered in river mud -- pretend to knock him to the ground, punch and kick him. At least one racial epithet can be heard. It was unclear when the video was made. Smith said she taped it on the banks of the Red River in Alexandria, Louisiana, and posted it on her Facebook page, according to The News-Star. The page has since been made private, but the video was posted on YouTube and The Smoking Gun.  Watch Jena 6 re-enactment »  More than 500 people attended a forum held Tuesday night at the university in response to the video, a university statement said. ""The majority ... decided not to let the actions of a few define the entire student body.""  Vice President of Student Affairs Wayne Brumfield told students ""there are no words to express the dismay at what happened in that video ... We're here tonight because the action of one or two set our university in motion."" In a Tuesday interview with the News-Star, a tearful Smith denied being racist. ""This is so not me,"" she said in the Wednesday article. ""It wasn't that we were making fun of the Jena 6 incident. We were just fed up with it ... I have just as many black [friends] as I do white friends.""  School administrators are reviewing the incident for possible disciplinary action from ULM's Office of Judicial Affairs, university spokesperson Laura Harris said. Smith and another participant in the video are ULM students, Harris said. The beating of Barker followed an increase in racial tensions in Jena, Louisiana, including at least two fights, sparked originally when three white teens hung nooses from an oak tree on the grounds of the town's high school.  The six black teens arrested in the beating were initially charged with attempted murder. Those charges, later reduced and moved to juvenile court, focused nationwide attention on Jena and led about 15,000 protesters to the town to participate in a march on the youths' behalf. Smith did not respond Thursday to an e-mail from CNN. Harris said she has left the ULM campus and returned home.  Smith told the News-Star she has taken the video off her Facebook page and has apologized to Facebook groups and bloggers. She said she is getting threats that have prompted her to delete her e-mail address and has had to keep her cell phone off. ""My dad's back home dying of cancer, and I can't call him,"" she said. Brumfield told students at Tuesday's forum that Smith ""is suffering terrible shame right now."" ULM asked Facebook and YouTube to remove the videos, Brumfield said, but it was still available on YouTube as of Thursday afternoon. Brumfield also created his own Facebook account to respond to the video. University President James Cofer has directed that educational materials be developed for students, especially freshmen, on cultural sensitivity and racial diversity, according to a university statement. ""We are naturally appalled, and we intend to face this matter directly by gathering our community together and exploring these difficult issues,"" Cofer said in a statement. Students at the forum offered ideas for strengthening racial unity on the campus of about 8,500 students. ""What we're doing here right now is a very important thing,"" said Ma'ya Blount, a ULM junior from New Orleans, according to a university statement on the forum. ""Racism doesn't get resolved when people hush up about it and sweep it under the rug. It only gets resolved when we talk about it in an educated manner ... As long as we continue to do this, maybe 10, 20 years from now, race won't be so much of an issue. We need to talk about it in a positive manner. We can only learn from this.""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A veteran of over 20 years of mountain climbing, Dave Bunting has been in some pretty tight scrapes. Soldier mountaineer Dave Bunting on Mount Everest. His team tried to summit via the mountain's notorious West Ridge in 2006. He and his climbing partner once watched in terror as a huge avalanche careered down a Himalayan mountainside straight for them. They were miraculously spared when the wall of snow parted on either side of the promontory where they were standing at a distance of just 50 meters. On another occasion he spent an agonizing night hanging precariously over a 3,000-foot (900 meter) drop during an electrical storm in the Alps. He estimates he was electrocuted ""half a dozen times"" during the course of the night. Faced with the fearsome power of nature mountaineers like Bunting rely on one indispensable ally -- other mountaineers. Teamwork is essential in climbing. The first successful ascent of Everest was as much about the bond of trust that existed between modest New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and his diminutive Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay, as their individual talents. To illustrate this point, when Bunting -- a warrant officer in the British Army -- was compiling a team of soldiers to attempt an ascent of Everest's notorious West Ridge the first quality he and the rest of the selection panel looked for was not climbing expertise, but compatibility. ""A lot of people think that when you go and do something like that, you immediately look for all the best climbers in the army,"" he says. ""But what we based our selection process on, compatibility was first."" Of course, all team sports rely upon a strong dynamic between the individual members. But there can be few disciplines in which the stakes are as high as in mountain climbing, where your life often literally rests in someone else's hands. Bunting, 40, led the expedition of 21 army mountaineers to Everest's West Ridge two years ago. It was a daunting undertaking. Of over 2,200 climbers who have made it to the top of the world's tallest peak since it was first conquered, only 19 have done so via this route. The ridge is rarely attempted because of its steepness and because its position leaves it exposed to high winds and the risk of avalanche. The army's summit attempt took three and half years in the planning and preparation and was the subject of a documentary, 'Everest: Man v Mountain.' Much of this build-up involved establishing strong bonds between team members. Practice climbs, social events and corporate-style teambuilding days were all employed to try to instil an atmosphere of mutual trust within the group. An essential factor on a mountain as significant as Everest, Bunting says. ""You are massively wrapped up in emotions there because you've spent three and a half years preparing for it,"" says Bunting, who now runs his own outdoor events company in the Bavarian Alps. The prestige of getting to the top of Everest can sometimes blur a climber's moral judgement, leading to acts of single-mindedness that border on the downright callous. During the same season as Bunting's army expedition, David Sharp, a 34-year-old British climber died of cold, exhaustion and lack of oxygen on his descent from the summit. As details of Sharp's death became public it emerged that 40 climbers had passed him, making no attempt to save the stricken climber as he lay stranded in the scant shelter of a rock alcove on the mountain's northeast ridge. The incident drew much soul-searching in the mountaineering world, with Sir Edmund Hillary complaining to New Zealand's Otago Daily Times of the ""horrifying"" attitudes it revealed. ""(On Everest) a lot of people are out for themselves completely,"" says Bunting. He says this selfish streak is exacerbated by the fast turnover of commercial climbing expeditions, which often meet for the first time just a couple of weeks before a summit attempt, meaning there is little opportunity to build team morale. By contrast, among Bunting's army mountaineers the needs of the group were always put before personal ambition. He gives an example: . ""As we went for the summit there were a number of support teams, one of whose job it was to break trail from base camp right the way up to 7,500 metres, clambering through two foot of snow. ""Each step you take at those altitudes is absolutely horrendous. There's a clip in the documentary of one of the lads breaking trail, every step up to his knees in snow, and you hear him say: 'Well, this is our job so we've got to get on with it.' ""A brilliant demonstration of teamwork."" The biggest test of this togetherness came when Bunting was left the unenviable task of telling his team of ambitious young soldiers he was abandoning the summit attempt because of a high risk of avalanches. ""Two or three of the guys were pretty pissed off, to be honest. ""Instead of getting wrapped up in emotions -- because Everest is a very emotional place -- I looked at it in very black and white terms. I couldn't risk sending my team up the mountain with that kind of real and present danger involved."" This clear-headed thinking meant his team braved one of the most dangerous climbs in the world and made it back down again, together.","Army officer Dave Bunting recruited a team of 21 soldiers to summit Everest .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Smoke blanketed the Argentine capital Friday as brush fires apparently set deliberately consumed thousands of acres in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre Ríos. A haze surrounds the Palermo neighborhood of the Argentine capital early Thursday. The smoke, from about 300 fires, is blamed for at least two fatal traffic accidents this week that left eight people dead. Sections of major highways and the Buenos Aires port, among the busiest in the world, have been closed. Incoming flights to the city's domestic airport, Jorge Newbery Airpark, have been diverted. The Argentine government has blamed farmers looking to clear their land for crops and grazing for the fires, which are estimated to cover 173,000 acres (70,000 hectares). ""This is the largest fire of this kind that we've ever seen,"" Argentine Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo said Thursday. Randazzo called the situation a ""disaster."" As of Friday morning, little progress had been made extinguishing the blazes. No rain is predicted for the next few days, but the National Meteorological Service predicts that the winds will change direction soon, dispersing the smoke. On Friday morning, the National Roads Administration closed sections of the heavily traveled Panamericana Highway, which leads in and out of Buenos Aires. Spokesman Ernesto Arriaga said ""visibility is 5 meters"" (about 16 feet) in some sections of the highway. ""Covering highways with smoke just to clear a field of weeds is unforgivable,"" Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez told Radio Diez. ""It's incredibly irresponsible."" Hospitals have reported an increase in visitors complaining of breathing problems, sore throats and burning eyes in the past three days. Citing a high level of carbon monoxide in the air, officials have encouraged people not to exercise outside. Schools in Pilar, a city in the province of Buenos Aires, were closed Friday because of the gray, thick air. The smoke has obscured views of some of the capital's landmarks, such the Obelisco monument and the government house, Casa Rosada, and people were seen walking on the city streets covering their faces with clothes. This month, Argentina's farmers suspended a three-week strike over a new government export tax on commodities. The bitter lockout left grocery shelves empty and caused major friction between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government and Argentina's large agricultural sector. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- One 12-year-old Virginia boy was playing baseball when it happened. Lightning strikes Las Vegas in 2006. Already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the U.S. The same week, a 33-year-old man was struck while jogging in Texas, a 70-year-old California woman was hit while doing yard work and a Kentucky man, 44, fell victim while waiting under a tree for a ride. They are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the United States, according to the National Weather Service. ""Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities,"" National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN. ""We normally see a good amount of lightning in June, but this is unusually high. There really is no good explanation of why that's the case."" Six of the 15 lightning-strike deaths in the U.S. so far this year occurred in California, Texas and Florida, with the rest scattered through the South, Midwest and West. No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, ""likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,"" Jensensius said. ""There have been less severe thunderstorms there."" Summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks ""Lightning Safety Awareness Week"" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency's message is ""When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors."" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors. Taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one-third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit. More than 400 people in the U.S. are hit by lightning each year, according to the National Weather Service. Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more). While not all injuries result in death, many victims are left with devastating and permanent disabilities. You may remember that as a child you were told to count the seconds between a lightning flash and thunder to see how far away the lightning was. But by the time you calculate it, it may be too late. Sometimes thunder and lightning can happen simultaneously. Despite its ""Sunshine State"" nickname, Florida receives more cloud-to-ground lightning than any other state in the country, according to data from NASA satellites. But Florida does not receive the most lightning in the world. According to NASA research, that dubious honor goes to the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 158 strikes per square kilometer each year. Thunderstorms occur in Central Africa year-round. Here are some commonly asked lightning questions: . How powerful is lightning?

"(CNN) -- Former rugby superstar Jonah Lomu has revealed that he is poised to make a shock playing comeback at the age of 34 with French third-division club Marseille Vitrolles. Jonah Lomu pictured in action for New Zealand's All Blacks during the 1999 World Cup in France. The giant New Zealander, who became a global name after an electrifying series of performances on the wing for the All Blacks at the 1995 World Cup, retired in 2007 after a succession of injuries hampered his attempt to return following a kidney transplant. He played 63 internationals, the last of them in 2002, but was never able to regain his previous dominance even after regaining full health. ""Marseille Vitrolles is on the point of finalizing the transfer of the greatest legend in world rugby,"" said statement on the club's Web site. Lomu, who is featuring in a new worldwide advertising campaign for sportswear manufacturer adidas called ""Nothing Is Impossible"", was also quoted as confirming his desire to return to the playing field. ""I took a sabbatical year to be at my pregnant partner's side and to fully enjoy this important moment in any man's life,"" he said on the Web site. ""Everyone thought I had ended my playing career, but that was wrong. I still feel the desire to play and it will be me alone who decides when to call it a day. ""My ambition is to help a club like Marseille join the group of top clubs in France."" Lomu was first diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996. He successfully returned to the game after treatment, but in May 2003 he was put on dialysis three times a week due to deterioration in his kidney function, with the treatment's side effects leaving him with severe nerve damage in his feet and legs. Lomu faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed, so underwent the operation. He signed a two-year contract with New Zealand province North Harbour in 2005, and also played for Welsh club Cardiff Blues during the southern hemisphere's off-season. However, he was unable to achieve his goal of being selected in the All Blacks squad for the 2007 World Cup in France, having suffered a shoulder injury. Lomu agreed to play in a charity match in England last year, but withdrew after injuring his ankle in training.","Former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu to join French third-division club .

"(CNN) -- The nation's foreclosure crisis threatened a high-profile victim this week:  TV legend Ed McMahon, best known as Johnny Carson's sidekick on ""The Tonight Show."" Ed McMahon and his wife, Pam, talk to CNN's Larry King about their mortgage problems. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that McMahon was $644,000 in arrears on a $4.8 million loan for a home in Beverly Hills, California, and his lender had filed a notice of default.

You want everything to be perfect, but that combination of the economy, I have a little injury, I have a situation. And it all came together. King: Did you break your neck? Ed McMahon:  I broke my neck. I had a fall. ... King: Has that stopped you from working? Ed McMahon: Oh, sure. You know, you can't work with this [brace] around your neck. And I have to wear this. King: But, Pam, the assumption is that the McMahons are multimillionaires and multimillionaires -- how much behind are you, $644,000, right? That's what's reported? ... If you're a millionaire, shouldn't you be able to pay $644,000? Pam McMahon: I think over the years, you know, it's just a kind of a combination of maybe Ed working so hard and not kind of looking at proper management, which happens a lot. ... Because you're a celebrity, people think you have a lot more than you have. And you always want to take great care of all of your friends and your family and everybody, and you do. And you don't, and I think, you know, we didn't keep our eye on the ball. We made mistakes. King: And are they foreclosing? Pam McMahon: Yes, they are. ... King: So you will lose this home? Ed McMahon: It's possible, yes. But now, I'll tell you what's happened, oddly enough. Today, all kinds of wonderful things have happened. New things have happened. And new interest in this house. Where the house had no interest, now there's all kinds of, tons of interest. So who knows what's going to happen. I'm optimistic. ... King: Ed, why have you gone public? Ed McMahon: Well, I figured I wanted to, in a sense, speak for the million people you mentioned [facing foreclosure]. I heard that figure today and I just couldn't believe it. Anyway, the million people that now have foreclosure signs on their house, or nearby. And I just want to give them hope, give them optimism, give them some kind of guidance. Get the best corrective people you need around you. Keep working on it. Don't stop.

""It's a collection that spans his career, and we put them together in a way we thought they would just kind of flow, you know, musically, into one another,"" she said of ""Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison,"" out Tuesday. ""But, it's all George, you know."" In 1970, the Beatles broke up. Harrison burst out of the palace with ""All Things Must Pass,"" a monster three-record set that featured friends like Eric Clapton, Leon Russell and former bandmate Ringo Starr. Critics and fans agree the album is among the best solo offerings from a former Fab. Although five cuts from ""All Things"" got the nod on this package -- the title track, ""Isn't it a Pity,"" ""What is Life,"" ""The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp"" and, of course, ""My Sweet Lord"" -- this look back displays Harrison's solo work throughout his career. The 19-cut CD extends all the way through ""Brainwashed,"" his final album, featuring that album's chirpy ""Any Road"" and the hypnotic instrumental ""Marwa Blues."" The Beatles are present too. Three live Harrison songs from ""The Concert for Bangladesh"" -- ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun"" -- sound as good today as they did on that August date in 1971 at Madison Square Garden. And, of course, his bouncy, tongue-in-cheek ""When We Was Fab,"" from his 1987 release ""Cloud Nine,"" shows Harrison looking back without anger. ""I think that there is an underlying thread that he always expressed, always a bit of humor, always a bit of longing,"" said Olivia Harrison. ""You know, I don't like to overuse the word spirituality, but, you know, he was interested in things not of this world."" Harrison is a two-time inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, once as a Beatle and once as a solo artist.","New George Harrison collection, ""Let It Roll,"" out Tuesday .

"BATON ROUGE, Louisiana (CNN)  -- The case of Mychal Bell, a black teenager accused of beating a white classmate in Jena, Louisiana, will be heard in juvenile court, Louisiana's governor announced Wednesday. Mychal Bell, 17, is accused with five others of beating Justin Barker in a school fight. Gov. Kathleen Blanco said that she discussed Bell's case with LaSalle Parish  District Attorney Reed Walters on Wednesday, and that Walters agreed not to challenge a state appeals court ruling that dismissed Bell's battery and conspiracy convictions. The court ruled that Bell, who was 16 at the time of the beating, should have been tried in juvenile court instead of having the case transferred to adult court. Blanco made the announcement with civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton. Last week, they led about 15,000 marchers to Jena, a town of 3,000, to protest how authorities handled the cases of Bell and five other black teens accused of beating white high school student Justin Barker. Many said they are angry the students, dubbed the ""Jena 6,"" are being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on high school property. The white students were suspended from school but did not face criminal charges. The protesters say they should have been charged with a hate crime. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy . The black students now face charges of aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy in the schoolyard beating. The altercation was the culmination of racially tense events in the town, including two fights sparked by the hanging of the nooses. E-mail to a friend .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Scientific tests prove bones housed in the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome are those of the apostle St. Paul himself, according to Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Benedict XVI looks at the tomb of St. Paul at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome in 2007. ""Tiny fragments of bone"" in the sarcophagus were subjected to carbon dating, showing they ""belong to someone who lived in the first or second century,"" the pope said in a homily carried on Italian television. ""This seems to confirm the unanimous and undisputed tradition that these are the mortal remains of the Apostle St. Paul,"" Benedict said in Sunday's announcement. The tomb also holds ""traces of a precious linen cloth, purple in color and laminated with pure gold, and a blue colored textile with linen filaments,"" the pope said. The tests were carried out by inserting a probe into a small opening in the sarcophagus, ""which had not been opened for many centuries,"" the pontiff said. The probe ""also revealed the presence of grains of red incense and traces of protein and limestone."" Separately, archaeologists have uncovered an image of St. Paul which ""could be considered the oldest icon of the apostle known to date,"" the Vatican's official newspaper reported Sunday. The painting, in the St. Tecla Catacomb, is ""among the oldest and best-defined figures from ancient Christianity,"" according to the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology, L'Osservatore Romano reported. St. Paul is one of the most significant figures in Christianity. Originally a persecutor of early Christians, he became a follower of Jesus after seeing a vision on the road to Damascus, according to Christian tradition. ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"" the vision of Jesus asks Paul, using the apostle's birth name, in the Acts of the Apostles. Saul then took the name Paul and became a missionary. His letters, or epistles, to early Christian communities around the Mediterranean form a significant portion of the New Testament. Paul was beheaded by Roman authorities sometime between 65 and 67 A.D., according to the Catholic Church. He was buried a few miles away, and when the Roman Empire stopped persecuting Christians some 250 years later, the Emperor Constantine had a basilica built over his grave. It currently lies under a marble tombstone bearing the Latin inscription PAULO APOSTOLO MART (Apostle Paul, martyr), according to the Web site of the basilica. A papal altar stands over the tombstone, which is visible through a window-like opening, the Web site says. Monday marks the end of a year of celebration in honor of the 2,000th anniversary of St. Paul's birth. It also happens to be the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul.

"(CNN) -- Cal Ripken Jr. will always be known for his consecutive games played streak, but it may surprise many people that just two years into his big-league career, he already was planning for life after baseball. Cal Ripken Jr. is introduced to the crowd at the 2002 All-Star Game in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While many of the athletes who took to the playing fields of major league baseball this season only are focused on the game, Ripken began saving and planning for retirement long before his career neared its end. ""When I joined the Orioles [in 1982], the team was transitioning,"" said Ripken, who will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in July. ""I saw guys who were 34, 35, 36 years old -- still young guys -- about to get out of the game, and I wondered what will they do now? ""It got me thinking about what I would want to do when I got out of the game. Most people don't realize how fast the time goes, but I turned those questions on myself."" Though he quickly points out that he didn't dwell on those questions, Ripken admits it got him thinking, and eventually planning, so that when retirement came in 2001, the shift from baseball to business was easy. ""From the outside, I'm sure it looked like a smooth transition just by virtue of the fact that I had another thing to go into,"" he said. ""I had prepared for what was next."" These days, five seasons after retiring from a 21-year career he spent with the Baltimore Orioles, Ripken is a businessman, team owner, radio-show host and author. He also will be a baseball analyst for TBS, which like CNN.com is owned by Time Warner. Ripken jumped full time into his company, Ripken Baseball, without taking any break, lessening the emotional jolt of retirement. ""I didn't give myself the luxury of taking a month off [after the baseball season],"" he said. ""I think I would have opened myself up to regret, thinking about the past. I had to get a minor league baseball team in that stadium. I just put my head down and started working."" Ripken's first post-baseball venture was developing a youth ballpark in his hometown of Aberdeen, Maryland, financed in part by a $75,000 gift from the Major League Baseball Players Association. It was presented to him the night he broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played. Ripken was a ""rookie"" for the second time in his life, this time in business. ""I was learning all over again, learning what was important,"" he said. ""The off-season never went by so fast. I had meetings, phone calls, plans and long days in the office. ""By the time I looked up, [the Orioles] were at spring training. I didn't think, 'They left without me,' which is what I thought I would do."" Ripken's latest project is a business principles book called ""Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference,"" co-authored by Donald T. Phillips. The book, available April 10, was born out a speech Ripken gave about the ""secrets"" of his success. Writing it turned out to be an emotional journey, he said. ""I got to reflect on what my parents had taught me, the values and principles, right and wrong,"" Ripken said. ""It's good to be in touch with those things."" The fact is, whether in baseball or business, Ripken rarely strays from the principles he learned from his late father, Cal Sr., a former player and manager. The book is filled with anecdotes from on and off the field. Now 46, Ripken is president and CEO of Ripken Baseball, and his brother, Bill, a former teammate, is executive vice president. The company owns minor league teams in Aberdeen and in Augusta, Georgia. The brothers also have co-written two books on baseball and co-host a baseball call-in show on weekends on XM Radio. There were reports in December that Ripken was heading a group that was interested in buying the Orioles, but Baltimore owner Peter Angelos denied that claim. ""There is no question that Cal and I have a great relationship,"" Angelos told The (Baltimore) Sun. ""He was a great player for the Orioles, and I have an affection for him. But what's being reported, there is simply no substance to it. It has not happened. There have been no such discussions."" Still, Ripken said he probably would ""stick his nose in"" if the Orioles became available. Ripken, who has a boy and a girl, also has ventured into children's literature, and his first book is scheduled to be released Thursday. ""The Longest Season"" tells the story of the 21-game losing streak Ripken and his Orioles teammates endured in 1988 and teaches the lessons of perseverance. Ripken also continues his longstanding association with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America through the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation. The foundation says it has refurbished fields, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the country and teamed up with Nike to help provide baseball and softball equipment to school sports programs nationwide. Asked what type of advice he would offer to young professional baseball players, Ripken said, ""Put that [huge contract] aside, save your money, that's your nest egg. In the off-season, think about skill development or the interests you have in a small way but be very careful. ""You can't think too much about retirement as a young player. You have to live a narrow existence for your sport."" E-mail to a friend .","Ripken played in 2,632 consecutive MLB games .

"LAVONIA, Georgia (CNN) -- Sonya Savage's back door opens to a cozy wooden porch that serves as a shelter for her 9-year-old son's bicycles and spare parts. Residents of Beaver Creek in Lavonia, Georgia, say they had no idea a neighbor was holding his family captive. A 30-foot tract of red clay and splotchy crab grass separates her mobile home from the home of Raymond Daniel Thurmond, a residence so rank and squalid that it forced a seasoned police investigator to vomit upon entering. Another officer donned a gas mask just to walk inside. Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years. ""My son, he's a little bicycle mechanic. He's always in the backyard, and he don't recall ever seeing nobody over here,"" said Savage, 29, who also has a 4-year-old daughter. ""Usually I've got a yard full of kids, but I've never seen any of those kids come out and play."" Savage recalls speaking to Thurmond once, after someone stole one of her son's bike tires. Thurmond kindly told Savage he hadn't seen anything suspicious. ""He was nice, polite, seemed like a normal guy,"" she said.  Watch a walk-through of the filth » . Alma Medina, the property manager for the 100-unit Beaver Creek mobile home park, lives three doors from what is now a crime scene. She remembers Thurmond was a polite fellow. He always called her ""Miss Alma"" when he dropped by the office to explain that his rent was late, a routine occurrence that eventually led Medina's maintenance man to a foul discovery. She occasionally saw Thurmond mingling with other tenants, but she never saw his family. The only indication that one existed, Medina said, was that he and his wife both signed a lease August 22, 2005, and noted on their application that they had three sons and a daughter. ""I never saw them outside, never,"" she said.  See what the trailer looked like » . Lavonia, a city of about 2,000 on Interstate 85, about five miles from South Carolina and the sprawling Lake Hartwell, is not the best place to keep secrets. The locals know each other, if only by face, and the police chief personally directs school traffic and walks the entire town daily to check on local businesses. The self-professed ""big-time small town"" has its share of crime, but hasn't seen a murder in six years. Lt. Missy Collins, the investigator who had Thurmond arrested Tuesday after a two-week investigation, said her husband used to work with Thurmond at a pump-manufacturing facility in nearby Toccoa. Chief Bruce Carlisle remembers seeing the burly 6-foot-4 Thurmond around town, at hardware and grocery stores. He generally wore shorts, work boots and a tank top or sleeveless shirt. Carlisle and Thurmond weren't acquainted, but the chief heard he was always cordial. ""You never saw anybody with him,"" the chief said. Authorities never had a problem with Thurmond until August 4, when Collins received a call from a women's shelter. ""They said they had a mother and four kids, and apparently they'd been kept at home, and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldn't let them leave,"" Collins said. Collins interviewed the women and children, who all gave the same story: Thurmond had forced the wife, three sons (9, 13 and 14 years old) and his 12-year-old daughter to remain inside. Police are still investigating how. Medina on Wednesday provided CNN a tour of the trailer that revealed a hasp, used to secure a door with a padlock, that had been fastened to the mobile home's back door. Holes on the inside of the front door and on one of the children's bedroom doors indicate hasps had been placed there as well, Medina said. Collins said police are not sure if padlocks were the only way Thurmond imprisoned his family. There is no indication Thurmond had any accomplices, but he was prone to bouts of rage. Collins said Thurmond had once allegedly raped his wife with the children in the next room.  Watch Collins explain how Thurmond instilled fear » . ""The entire family lived in fear of this man,"" the investigator said. ""Just his presence alone was enough for them to comply."" They had never left the trailer except for a few hours in April, when Thurmond allowed them to visit his in-laws in North Carolina. Collins said the wife's parents had been sending the family money and threatened to cease sending cash if their daughter and grandchildren didn't visit. The wife's mother answered the phone Wednesday, but said she had been told not to speak to the media. It is unclear by whom. Her parents' names are being withheld to protect the woman's identity. Collins said she is not certain exactly what emboldened the family to flee the filthy trailer, but the mother told police that Thurmond had said he was leaving her for another woman. He'd be back in a few days, he told her, and he'd left some food for them, Collins said. The food was insufficient, Collins said, but she is not sure if it was hunger or ire over the mistress that provided the impetus to leave -- ""only the mother could really tell you why."" When Collins interviewed the family, all but one of the children were pale and thin, she said. Only one, the 14-year-old, had ever attended school, and though the mother said the other children were home-schooled, the children told Collins that Thurmond wouldn't buy them school supplies. When Collins visited the home, the only educational implement she found was an old dictionary, she said. After interviewing the family, Collins launched a manhunt that ended without incident Tuesday at Thurmond's workplace, a poultry processing plant in neighboring Stephens County. About the time Collins kicked off her hunt for Thurmond, Medina was growing frustrated that he hadn't paid his rent. On August 6, after Thurmond hadn't responded to a notice on his door threatening eviction, Medina sent her maintenance man to the mobile home. He returned disturbed and told Medina he hadn't entered the home, she said. ""I want you to see this with your own eyes,"" she recalled the maintenance worker telling her. ""You better wear some shoes and gloves or something."" The kitchen floor was rotted. Heavy, brown stains covered both toilets. There were anthills under a mattress in the master bedroom. Roaches freely roamed the inside of the refrigerator, and maggots owned the stove. There were several piles of trash, including one reaching the laundry room ceiling and a mound of Diet Mountain Dew bottles between a recliner and the living room couch. Tufts of human hair were scattered on the kitchen floor among bags of fetid trash.  Watch how the home remained squalid after a week of cleaning » . Collins said she went behind an adjacent mobile home and vomited when she and another officer first opened the door. This was after the windows had been opened to air out the residence. Collins said she had never experienced such a stench -- this from a police investigator who as recently as last week rode in an ambulance with a corpse that had been pulled from a burning building. When Collins went in the bathroom and pulled back the once-clear-but-now-chocolate-brown shower curtain, it revealed so many roaches that the bathtub floor appeared to be moving. On Wednesday, after a week of cleaning that has already yielded two Dumpsters of trash, dozens of roaches still scurried across the floor and walls. A stench still lingered, and a film of bug feces covered the kitchen counters. Medina said she has to gut the entire trailer and replace the floor, walls and ceiling before she can rent it again. Collins said rebuilding the family may take more work. As of Thursday morning, Thurmond still didn't have an attorney and no bail hearing had been set, Collins said. In an interrogation after his arrest, Thurmond seemed ""even-tempered"" and didn't behave like someone being charged with rape and a host of other felonies, Collins said. Though he was not forthcoming and admitted nothing during the interview, Collins said, one aspect of his behavior stoked her suspicion. ""If I had been arrested and hadn't done anything, my first reaction would be, 'Where's my wife and kids?' "" Collins said. ""He didn't even ask until he was behind bars.""","Neighbors say they saw Daniel Thurmond on occasion but never his wife, kids .

"Editor's note: Brian Levin is director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Jack McDevitt is the director of the Institute on Race and Justice and Associate Dean in the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. Both have testified before Congress in support of federal hate crime legislation and are co-authors of a book on hate in America, due to be published next year. Brian Levin says a new federal hate crime law is needed to combat violent incidents of bias. SAN BERNARDINO, California (CNN) -- America needs a coordinated and multifaceted response to combat the continuing scourge of violent hate crime like the crime committed at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, originally introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy a decade ago and nearly passed during the most recent legislative session, is expected to go before the Senate for a vote soon. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder testified on its behalf Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is a crucial step in the nation's evolving response to hate crime. A hate crime occurs when an individual intentionally targets a victim or their property because of his or her actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, disability or sexual orientation. While some have argued that these kind of laws criminalize free speech, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in the 1993 case, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, that well-drafted hate crime laws are constitutional and do not punish speech. Rather they enhance the penalties only for acts that are already considered crimes. The act is named for Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay college student who was kidnapped, robbed, tortured and left to die, tied to a fence in a remote area outside of Laramie, Wyoming in October 1998. His mother Judy has been a tireless advocate for hate crime laws and victims. The Shepard Act remedies legal loopholes in federal and state criminal law that fail to protect against bias-motivated attacks based on such characteristics as sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability. It also removes antiquated ""Klan era"" language that forces federal prosecutors to tie violent racial attacks to a small number of activities such as participating in a jury, voting or using hotels. As recent events have indicated, today's violent hate offenders, unlike their predecessors, will often swing into brutal action on their own initiative without waiting for a victim to exercise a specific activity covered by old 1960s laws. However, much of the act's potency lies not in what it punishes, but rather in its recognition of the primary role local authorities now play in combating hate crime. Nearly all hate crime investigations and prosecutions in the United States are handled by state and local authorities, such as the Boston Police or Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police. Gone are the days where masses of federal agents and soldiers had to swoop into states to protect new students and freedom riders from thugs in Klan-dominated municipalities. The act has a clear bias in favor of local prosecution and has restrictions that require federal prosecution only in limited cases where the leadership of the DJ approves. However, reporting data indicates that some states apparently provide limited assistance to hate crime victims. These jurisdictions report either zero hate crimes or a handful of crime to the FBI, year after year, while neighboring states with similar demographics and crime profiles report far more. A 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics victimization study found that only a small fraction of hate crimes nationally are actually reported. Thus, there appear to be various instances where federal help or prosecution are still necessary. Today, in the midst of our economic downturn, federal authorities are needed much more to assist cash-strapped local departments, not as an unwelcome occupying force, but as a desperately needed partner to assist with forensics, technical assistance and investigations. Even in police departments with model hate crime investigative units, such as the Boston Police Department's Community Disorders Unit, modern cases increasingly involve interstate travel or Internet hate networks, and require sophisticated ballistic and DNA testing or computer forensics. These measures may be beyond the capacity of many local police agencies, particularly in difficult economic times. The act also provides greater access to local communities for federal training programs and mediation services that can prevent hate crimes before they boil over into violence. Our research has established that hate crimes are a qualitatively unique category of offenses. Compared to non-bias motivated crimes these crimes are more likely to involve violence, injury, hospitalization, psychological trauma and a greater risk of retaliatory attacks, which can often spill across municipal borders. And while we cannot say whether hate crimes overall are actually increasing, there does appear to be an increase in the most violent hate crimes. In 2007, hate-motivated homicides claimed nine lives, up from three in 2006, and the last year has seen a steady stream of violent plots and attacks against symbolic targets by hardened hate-mongers. Since the beginning of the year we have seen many examples of extremist crimes. Here are a few: . Brockton, Massachusetts: January 21 -- White supremacist Keith Luke 22, allegedly kills two, rapes one, and shoots another while en route to a synagogue to kill Jews. Miramar Beach, Florida: February 26 -- Dannie Baker, 60, a man known for anti-immigrant rantings, allegedly shoots 5, killing two Chilean immigrants. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: April 5 -- Neo-Nazi Richard Poplawski, 22, agitated over the belief that President Obama would ban guns, allegedly kills three police officers during a domestic violence call. New York: May 20 -- Four Muslim converts are arrested on federal charges relating to a plot to bomb Jewish and military targets. Pima County, Arizona: May 30 -- Leaders of the Minuteman American Defense group allegedly kill a 29-year-old Latino man and his nine-year-old daughter in an attempt to steal drugs and money to finance their civilian border patrol group. Washington: June 10 -- Holocaust denier James von Brunn, 88, allegedly kills a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Two national research reports released last week document a disturbing level of supremacist activities and overall violence against a broad range of groups. Another report from the Southern Poverty Law Center counted a record number of 926 hate groups in the United States last year. But there is something more to hate crime's harms that cannot be completely captured by statistics or criminological studies. As the Holocaust Museum attack demonstrates, hate crimes threaten pluralistic democracies in a way that other crimes do not. Unlike many other crimes, they are at once discriminatory and terroristic. As law professor James Weinstein observed: ""The effect of Kristallnacht on German Jews was greater than the sum of the damage to buildings and assaults on individual victims."" Violence and threats that destabilize the bonds between citizens and the democratic institutions that they share are worthy of additional punishment and federal assistance. Moreover, victims of hate-motivated violence are entitled to legal protection no matter where they reside. That is why over two-thirds of the American public favor hate crime laws, and why the Senate should heed their call to pass the Shepard Act. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Levin and Jack McDevitt.","Levin, McDevitt: Senate to vote on Matthew Shepard hate crime bill .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian playmaker Kaka was officially presented as a Real Madrid player, after being handed the number eight jersey in front of thousands of supporters and a huge media contingent at the club's Bernabeu stadium on Tuesday evening. Kaka parades his new Real Madrid jersey after completing his $92 million transfer to the Spanish giants. An estimated 50,000-strong crowd, almost three times the anticipated number, turned up to watch the ceremony as Kaka was unveiled as Madrid's latest addition by club president Florentino Perez and honorary president Alfredo di Stefano. Latest transfer gossip and rumors . Kaka, who completed his medical earlier in the day having landed in the Spanish capital in the morning, has penned a six-year contract and has cost Madrid a reported $92 million. There had been speculation that Kaka would be handed the number five shirt that Zinedine Zidane had once worn for Madrid, but the new arrival will instead take up the number eight shirt formerly worn by Fernando Gago. The presentation took place on a stage erected on the Bernabeu pitch that also included Madrid's record nine European Cup trophies, a giant screen and with a backdrop of four huge images showing club legends Raul, Juanito, Di Stefano and Zidane. The 27-year-old Kaka, who was named player of the tournament after helping Brazil win the Confederations Cup in South Africa over the last few weeks, told supporters: ""Today is a very happy day for me. ""I'm very happy because this new stage of my career will be at Real Madrid. I hope to write my name into the history of this club with many victories and successes."" Kaka was the first signing confirmed by Madrid after Perez returned to the club presidency at the start of June. Soon after bringing in the Brazilian, Perez also agreed a world-record 80 million euros fee with Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo. That deal was finalized on Friday night and will come into effect from Wednesday, with Ronaldo, who like Kaka will be tied to the Spanish giants until 2015, being presented on July 6. Aside from Kaka and Ronaldo, Madrid also struck a deal to sign Valencia defender Raul Albiol last week for a fee believed to be around 13 million euros, while the likes of Franck Ribery, David Villa and Xabi Alonso are all being linked with moves to the Bernabeu as Perez relaunches the famous 'galacticos' policy that he presided over during his first tenure at the club. Then, while president from 2000-06, Perez sanctioned the big-money signings of superstars such as Zidane, David Beckham, Luis Figo and Ronaldo, a policy that reaped indifferent rewards with Madrid winning seven trophies under Perez in total but none in his final three years.","Kaka is unveiled as a Real Madrid player after completing his move from Milan .

"(CNN) -- NASA and Japan improved our world view this week, or at least our view of the world. This image using ASTER imagery shows the Himalayan glaciers in Bhutan. The American space agency and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry have released a new digital topographic map of Earth that accurately portrays more of our planet than ever before. The new map consists of 1.3 million images taken by NASA's Terra satellite that have been pieced together to form a unified picture of the planet. The images were taken by a Japanese imaging instrument called the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, or ASTER. ""This is the most complete, consistent global digital elevation data yet made available to the world,"" said Woody Turner, a program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington. The map covers more than 99 percent of Earth's land mass from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Antarctic Circle. During February 2000, space shuttle Endeavour mapped about 80 percent of the planet's surface. ""The ASTER data fill in many of the voids in the shuttle mission's data, such as in very steep terrains and in some deserts,"" said Michael Kobrick, a shuttle project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the program.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Had the government not delayed its controversial order that all computers be equipped with Green Dam by July 1, the result would have been the same -- Chinese computer retailers were far from ready. The Green Dam's developers say they've received death threats. PC sales representatives at Bainaohui, one of Beijing's largest electronics retailers, say their merchandise is not pre-installed with Green Dam, a Web filtering software the government said was necessary to prevent children from viewing pornography and other harmful content. Some retailers were unclear as to when the software would even be available on new units. Computer experts say manufacturers have not had enough time to pre-install new computers with the software -- which is one reason behind the government's delay. PC companies may also be taking more time to test the software after programming errors, with the potential to make computers susceptible to hackers, were detected by University of Michigan professors. The Chinese government said that these errors have been fixed. The international backlash against the Green Dam directive may be further delaying the pre-instillation process. Twenty-two chambers of commerce and trade groups made an appeal to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao urging that he abandon the software mandate. ""China is putting companies in an untenable position by requiring them, with virtually no public notice, to pre-install software that appears to have broad-based censorship implications and network security issues,"" said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke in a press-release. With the support of U.S. trade officials, computer-makers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard are threatening to bring the matter to the World Trade Organization. Other computer manufactures, including Sony and Acer, say they are bound to comply with the Chinese policy. Domestically, Chinese Internet users are rallying against the government. Last week an anonymous group of ""netizens"" posted an open letter on Chinese blogs and forums. ""We hereby decide that from July 1 2009, we will start a full-scale global attack on all censorship systems you control,"" the message said. The Chinese artist, activist, and architect who designed the Olympic ""Bird's Nest"" stadium, is one of the leaders behind the cyber battle. Ai Weiwei called for his Twitter followers to boycott the Internet on July 1st. The Green Dam's developers say they've even received death threats. The Chinese online community has been in an uproar since the new policy became public, and a ""Declaration of Anonymous Internet Users 2009"" circulating directly addresses government censors, said Charles Mok, chairman of the Internet Society of Hong Kong. ""They are showing altered pictures of their own face using masks like that from 'V for Vendetta',"" said Mok, referring to the 2005 film updating the story of Guy Fawkes, who tried to destroy Parliament building in England in the 17th Century. ""It says, 'We're behind the mask; if one of us falls down, ten others will join.'"" Mok also questions the true intent of the Green Dam software. ""On its black list are 2000 words related to pornography and 6000 other types of politically sensitive key words like 'Falun Gong',"" he said, referring to the banned Chinese religious group. ""That ratio alone makes it obvious what's behind it."" Sharp criticism of the software partially stems from fears that the software will simply further strengthen the government's control and censorship of the media. Yet the government said it is simply acting in response to parental complaints about the negative affects of the Internet on children. Responding to reporters' questions, foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang acknowledges the controversy over the software in and outside China. ""However,"" he said in a regular press conference last week, ""no matter how many different views there are, the Chinese government assumes the responsibility to protect our youth from unhealthy information on the Internet, and so do various social circles and enterprises. This is the essence of this problem."" The government said it is simply providing the software free of charge, as a pre-installed file on computer hard drives or as a CD, to give users to choice to install the software. China is not the first country to try to censor the Internet; Iran, Myanmar, even France and Germany in various ways attempt to put limits on the blogosphere. But analysts doubt whether this particular policy can even be enforced. Said Victor Gao, a former government functionary who now heads a policy think tank: ""The government always has its own views, but whether they are able to execute it to the detail and push it through the country is another issue.""  Watch why the filtering software mandate has been postponed » . The extent to which the software's can block harmful content is still in question. Unofficial tests by Internet enthusiasts showed that while Green Dam considered a cartoon of a cat in blue clothes safe, pictures of Garfield the Cat were sometimes blocked by the software because it is programmed to categorize images with large areas of ""yellow"" as pornographic. Over at Bainaohui, a hub of computer and Internet commerce in central Beijing, many salespersons seem oblivious to the new government edict. ""I think I've read something about it on line,"" said one. And what do they think of Green Dam? ""I have no idea since I have not used it yet,"" said a seller of computer software. Worried? ""I don't think there would be any impact,"" replied another. Meantime, Bainaohui's robust IT business continues unimpeded. CNN's Kevin Voigt contributed to this report.","China extends deadline for Internet filtering software to accompany PCs .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Bollywood's recent financial growth has been as dizzying as the swirling dancers, colorful costumes and pulsating music that typify the industry's films. Mumbai's once booming flamboyant Hindi-language film industry is hit hard, as overseas investment dries up. Foreign money has poured into Mumbai's flamboyant Hindi-language film industry, which churns out more than 1,000 films each year. Twice as many films as Hollywood -- and for a fraction of the cost. But a financial drama has arrived on the movie sets and production suites of India's largest city courtesy of the world economic downturn and a producer's strike -- fewer films are being made; less tickets are being sold and money is suddenly tight. ""It's become more difficult now to green light films; to be able to think of developing films,"" Nikhil Advani of People Tree Films who works as both a producer and a director told CNN. ""Today you think twice how you're going to be able to put that thing together before you commit any money to it."" It's the new reality: Money that was gushing into the market from abroad to finance films a year and a half ago is now just trickling in. Production of Bollywood movies has only just resumed, having ground to a halt for seven weeks due to a producer's strike.  The strike is finally over, but money is still tight and this is affecting the number of films going into production. ""The number of movie projects has come down by almost 30 percent,"" Farokh Balsara, a partner at business consultants Ernst & Young told CNN. Balsara heads Ernst & Young's media and entertainment division in Mumbai and looks at trends in the market. What's more, after several years of fast-rising film revenues due to India's exploding middle classes who were willing to spend, Bollywood finds itself back on a budget. If you don't have a solid financial plan these days, getting funding for a film is nearly impossible. Throwing around a known filmmaking family name and getting a star signed up won't cut it anymore. ""The easy finance is a thing of the past,"" Balsara told CNN. Some producers are asking big name talent to take a cut in their pay or at least get paid on the ""backend."" In other words, waiting until the movie releases -- if it does well you get a piece of the pie; if not, you eat it. In some cases, accountants are actually on movie sets crunching numbers daily to make sure the budget is on target. ""They are getting into daily audits,"" Balsara said. The thought of an accountant on set might make some producers shudder, but many believe the slowdown has done Bollywood a favor. ""Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"" says Advani of the changes the slowdown has forced on the way he produces upcoming films. ""I think it's a very good [thing]."" He currently has several in the works: an animated film in post-production called ""Ab Dilli Door Nahin"" and a gritty action-packed thriller ""Basra,""  named after the Mumbai street term for heroin. The slowdown has made Bollywood focus on making better, not more movies, according to Advani: ""I don't call it a credit crunch, I call it a credit correction. ""I think what has happened is it's corrected itself, because I think Bollywood or the Indian film industry was going absolutely crazy last year."" Mairi Mackay contributed to this story.","The economic downturn and a producer's strike have hit Bollywood financially .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton will stop telling an emotional story about a uninsured pregnant woman who died after being denied medical care, Clinton's campaign said. Sen. Hillary Clinton was repeating a story she heard from someone on the campaign trail. A hospital has raised questions over the accuracy of the story, and Clinton's campaign has said although they had no reason to doubt the story, they were unable to confirm the details. In the story, Clinton describes a woman from rural Ohio who was making minimum wage at a local pizza shop. The woman, who was uninsured, became pregnant. Clinton said the woman ran into trouble and went to a hospital in a nearby county but was denied treatment because she couldn't afford a $100 payment. In her speeches, Clinton said the woman later was taken to the hospital by ambulance and lost the baby. The young woman was then taken by helicopter to a Columbus hospital where she died of complications.  Watch why the story is raising questions » . The New York senator heard the story during a campaign visit to a family's living room in Pomeroy, Ohio, in late February. Bryan Holman was hosting the candidate and told Clinton the story. She has repeated it frequently since then. As recently as Friday night in Grand Forks, North Dakota, Clinton said she was ""just aching inside"" as she was listening to the story. ""It is so wrong, in this good, great and rich country, that a young woman and her baby would die because she didn't have health insurance or a hundred dollars to get examined,"" she said. While Clinton never named the hospital in her speech, the woman she was referring to was treated at O'Bleness Memorial Hospital in Athens, Ohio. The hospital said the woman did indeed have insurance, and, at least at their hospital, she was never turned away. Hospital Chief Executive Officer Rick Castrop in a statement said, ""we reviewed the medical and patient accounts of the patient"" after she was named in a newspaper story about Clinton's stump speech. ""There is no indication that she was ever denied medical care at any time, for any reason. We clearly reject any perception that we ever denied any care to this woman."" A hospital spokesperson confirmed to CNN the woman had insurance. She said the hospital decided to come forward after people in the community began to question if they had denied her care. Clinton's speech accurately reflects what she was told that day, but the campaign admits they were not able to confirm the account. Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee said, ""She had no reason to doubt his word."" ""Candidates are told stories by people all the time, and it's common for candidates to retell those stories. It's not always possible to fully vet them, but we try. For example, medical records are confidential. In this case, we tried but weren't able to fully vet the story,"" he said. Elleithee added, ""If the hospital claims it didn't happen that way, we certainly respect that, and she won't repeat the story."" ""She never mentions the hospital by name and isn't trying to cast blame. She tells this story because it illustrates the point that we have a very serious health care problem in America.

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Serving time for lesser crimes, Scott Kimball is leading investigators to bodies. Scott Kimball is currently serving a 48-year sentence on theft and habitual criminal convictions. Partly mummified bones thought to be those of his uncle, Terry Kimball, were discovered Monday in a remote Rocky Mountain pass near Vail, Colorado. DNA tests are pending to confirm the victim's identity, and the cause of death is pending a forensic examination, authorities said. Terry Kimball is one of several suspected homicide victims associated with Scott Kimball since his jailing in 2008. He is serving a 48-year sentence in state prison in Fairplay, Colorado, on theft and habitual criminal convictions. Kimball will also serve a 70-month federal sentence on firearms charges after the state sentence. The firearms charges led to Kimball's 18th conviction. However, Kimball probably will not be charged in any of the deaths. Sources with knowledge of the cases said Kimball's December 2008 plea to theft and habitual criminal charges, and the 48-year sentence, was part of a deal that included revealing the locations of the bodies. Authorities wanted to give victims' families resolution. Without his cooperation, authorities doubt they have enough evidence to convict him. Earlier this year, Kimball revealed where the remains thought to be his uncle's were, according to law enforcement sources close to the case. However, the search was delayed until snow had melted. The FBI would not confirm that Kimball, 42, identified the site. However, FBI spokeswoman Kathleen Wright said, ""we went to (a) specific location for a specific reason. It wasn't random."" Terry Kimball, 60 at the time, was last seen with Scott Kimball in September 2004, according to a 2007 federal search warrant affidavit. Scott Kimball told his wife that his uncle had won the lottery and left for Mexico with a stripper, the affidavit said, but FBI investigators think Kimball killed his uncle and dumped his body in Vail Pass, more than 100 miles from the home they shared in a Denver suburb. In March, Kimball accompanied FBI investigators to southeastern Utah to search for the body of Leann Emry, who was 24 when she vanished after departing on a camping trip in 2003. FBI agents found Emry's remains shortly after Kimball returned to jail. Kaysi McLeod was 19 when she disappeared in 2003. McLeod, the daughter of Kimball's ex-wife, was last seen getting a ride to work from Kimball, according to the 2007 affidavit. In fall 2007, a hunter found her remains in northwest Colorado. Kimball is also suspected in the disappearance of exotic dancer Jennifer Marcum, who disappeared in 2003, according to the affidavit. Sources close to the investigation say they think Kimball killed Marcum and buried her body near Rifle, Colorado. Authorities have not found her remains. ""We are continuing to look for Jennifer, and we will leave no stone unturned,"" Wright said. Kimball drew the FBI's attention in 2002 while jailed for writing bad checks. Kimball offered authorities information about his cellmate, Steven Ennis, who was suspected in a drug ring, according to the 2007 affidavit. After Kimball served his sentence, the FBI began paying him as an informant. Kimball was supposed to report back to the FBI on Marcum, Ennis' former girlfriend, when she disappeared. The FBI would not reveal how long or how much Kimball was paid. He was arrested again in March 2006 near Palm Springs, California, after a police chase and standoff.","Habitual felon likely to avoid charges in presumed murders of four people .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Summer excursions seem out of reach to many struggling young professionals, and the faltering economy isn't helping. But one New York City company, offering trips aimed at the young and thrifty, is capitalizing on the urbanite's desire to get away -- and finding success despite the downturn. A group of Urban Escapes NYC hikers stops for a snack during an expedition in New York's Harriman State Park. As a slightly broke young professional myself, with a taste for adventure but living in a very expensive city, the idea behind Urban Escapes NYC was intriguing. The company offers an array of activities -- from short hiking, sky diving or canoeing trips to international journeys that combine various activities. On the company's user-friendly Web site, I scrolled through the offerings. There were trips ranging from one-day hiking or fruit-picking excursions priced at around $60 to $800 weeklong international expeditions. The average trip includes ground transportation, the cost of the activity, guide fees, equipment rental and meals. Jumping out of planes put the company's founder and CEO, Maia Josebachvili, 25, on the path to becoming a business owner. While attending Dartmouth College, Josebachvili developed a passion for sky diving. To pay for the pricey dives, she began to lead trips for her friends and her friends' friends. Soon she realized that the people she was guiding were outside of her original social network, and an idea began to emerge. After graduating from Dartmouth and working as a trader on the New York Stock Exchange, Josebachvili decided working in the concrete jungle was not for her. At 24, Josebachvili started a business out of something she had been doing for years during college -- leading outdoor adventure trips. The company launched in early 2008, just months before the economy tanked. ""I started to wonder if this is really going to work,"" Josebachvili said. But with trips designed with budget and value in mind, the suffering economy did not stunt the business. Josebachvili said the company was able to break even within six months. The business relies on social networking avenues for promotion, and word spread rapidly. It also quickly developed a reputation as a great way to meet people and make new friends. ""I was the market,"" Josebachvili explains, ""My friends were the market. Anyone just out of college working on Wall Street didn't have the time to plan and research the trips. There is no shortage of those kinds of people in New York."" After perusing the site, I rather nervously picked a $59 six-mile hike. This may not sound so cheap, but after factoring in the planning of the trip, transportation, gas, experienced guides and a post-hike discount at a local restaurant, the value becomes apparent. I hadn't been hiking in years and still am sadly out of shape. My imagination ran wild with images of young, sporty folks racing up high peaks as I huffed and puffed behind. Terrifying. After a rainy start to the morning, our upbeat guides for the day, director Bram Levy and guide Roget Lerner, drove a group of 12 north of the city to Harriman State Park. They encouraged us to get to know each other and joked that we would be quizzed on it later. Waiting to get into the van, I asked a man standing next to me why he was on the trip. ""I moved from San Francisco a year ago,"" public relations professional Michael Lindenberger said. ""I need some trees."" After an hourlong drive, we arrived at our hiking destination. Levy and Lerner checked our sneakers, water supply and told us a bit about how the day was going to unfold. And then we began the hike. Throughout the day, there was lots of laughing, squealing and helping each other over rocks and through slick patches of mud. I was surprised how quickly a team mentally developed among the group. We were all strangers, but after a day of hiking, I knew everyone's name, profession and a good deal more. And this was no accident -- the guides were deliberately networking and bonding us together. Jen Badali, a city transit planner, was on her third trip with Urban Escapes. ""I went by myself my first hike,"" she said. ""It was fun to get away and do something different."" She said she still keeps in touch with people she met on the other excursions. ""I made some good friends out of it,"" she said. At the end of the day, sweaty, sore and smiling, I realized why Urban Escapes NYC was defying the recession. With a plethora of affordable outdoor excursions, cheerful guides and a youthful mindset, the company was the ideal destination for an urban professional with a slim wallet.","Urban Escapes NYC offers trips aimed at the young and thrifty .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson was an international superstar, and many in the black community herald him for breaking down racial barriers in the music industry. Michael Jackson was one of the first black global superstars. ""Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color way before Tiger Woods, way before Oprah Winfrey, way before Barack Obama,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""Michael did with music what they later did in sports and in politics and in television. And no controversy will erase the historic impact."" As the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson and his brothers ""became a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of black popular culture at Duke University's Department of African and African American Studies. ""You basically had five working-class black boys with Afros and bell bottoms, and they really didn't have to trade any of that stuff in order to become mainstream stars,"" Neal said. Young Michael Jackson was the first black ""bubblegum teen star"" in the vein of Monkees singer Davy Jones, Neal said. Jackson continued as a pioneer in the black culture when he broke barriers by appearing on MTV, and by breaking sales records with the 1982 album, ""Thriller.""  Timeline: The life of a ""King"" » . ""At the time that he releases 'Thriller,' I always argue that MTV was arguably the best example of cultural apartheid in the United States,"" Neal said. The former president of CBS Records, Walter Yetnikoff, remembered with scorn that MTV would not play ""Billie Jean"" or ""Beat It"" because it billed itself as a rock station. Looking back on that era, a 1991 Los Angeles Times article quoted MTV founder and then-CEO Robert Pittman as saying the channel's format didn't lend itself to other musical styles, including R&B and country. And Pittman accused his critics of attempting to impose their musical pluralism on the channel's die-hard rock fans. But Yetnikoff said he threatened to pull videos of his other artists unless MTV played Jackson's videos.  Watch Yetnikoff talk about getting Jackson's videos played » . Soon Jackson's videos were heavily in rotation on MTV. Showcasing a black artist paved the way for the popular show, ""Yo! MTV Raps,"" and other black artists, Neal said. In turn, Jackson became one of the first African-Americans to be a global icon. He also influenced a new generation of black musicians, including Usher, Ne-Yo and Kanye West, according to Joycelyn Wilson, a professor of African-American studies at Morehouse College, who specializes in popular culture and hip-hop studies.  Slideshow: Michael Jackson and his music » . Changing appearance . Jackson's changing physical appearance in the past two decades led to criticism he was trying to be less black. ""Here's a man who started off looking very typically African-American and ended up looking like something few people would have recognized early in his career. His nose was trimmed, his lips were different ... his skin was different,"" said Cheryl Contee, who writes as Jill Tubman on Jack & Jill Politics, a blog centered on African-American issues. ""The only thing that seemed to almost stay the same were his eyes,"" said Contee, who also called Jackson ""a genius and more than a trailblazer."" ""I think [it] troubled a lot of people that he left his skin color behind and seemed somehow to be ashamed of who he was [when] he was born,"" Contee said. But during a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Jackson shot down rumors that he was dying his skin to make it lighter. He told the talk show host that he had vitiligo, a disorder that destroyed his skin pigmentation. Black popular culture professor Neal said Jackson's physical changes did not reflect his life on the whole. ""I think if you solely pay attention to Michael Jackson's physicality, you actually miss something that's much more complex. ... Michael Jackson artistically and aesthetically never turned his back on blackness. His work was always in conversation with black culture both in the United States and more globally,"" said Neal. Neal said Jackson's changes were not to deny blackness, nor to become more white. ""This was somebody who most of his career we read as being asexual. And I think that many of the changes to his face, particularly his skin tone, he was almost trying to achieve an a-raciality,"" said Neal. Contee upset some commenters on her blog when she highlighted both the positive and negative aspects of Jackson's life, or what she termed his ""mixed legacy."" ""Some people were very offended that I would dare to mention some of the unfortunate aspects of his later years,"" she said. ""But others [acknowledged] that they had mixed feelings about his legacy and what that meant to African-Americans.""","Jackson 5 went mainstream and maintained black identity, professor says .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The CEO of Southwest Airlines said Friday he has ordered an investigation into charges the discount carrier flew airplanes that weren't properly inspected for safety. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly tells CNN the airline is surprised at FAA charges. Gary Kelly said Southwest was caught off guard when the Federal Aviation Administration notified it on Thursday that it may be hit with a record $10.2 million federal fine for alleged violations involving fuselage crack inspections. Kelly called the fine ""unfair"" and ""unprecedented."" The FAA on Thursday accused Southwest of operating the 47 airplanes last year without conducting mandatory checks for fuselage cracking. The airline has 30 days to respond. Kelly told CNN safety was never an issue. ""In this particular situation, we identified a gap in our documentation. We voluntarily reported that to the FAA. We worked out with the FAA how to fix that problem, and we fixed it,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning."" Asked why, then, the discount carrier was called on the carpet, Kelly replied, ""We were surprised yesterday to get that notification by the FAA as well. The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported as late as last month the FAA said that it had no safety issues with Southwest Airlines."" ""I've ordered an investigation as to exactly what happened in this event,"" Kelly said. ""It occurred in March of 2007. These aircraft are inspected inch by inch. In this particular incident, over 99 percent of the inspections were completed, according to documentation.""  Watch what's raising concerns about Southwest » . He said that after fuselage cracks were discovered in about half a dozen of the airline's 737s, 47 planes were reinspected over a 10-day period. Boeing Inc., the plane's manufacturer, which was contacted when the problems arose, said that at no time were the cracks unsafe, Kelly said. ""Cracks do occur. That's why we do inspections."" He said Boeing issued a release Thursday saying Southwest ""acted responsibly, and at no time were the aircraft operated in an unsafe manner."" The FAA issued a statement saying that Southwest improperly inspected the planes for cracks, then allowed them to fly an additional 1,451 flights, knowing they weren't airworthy. Kelly was asked about FAA allegations that an inspector knew about the problems, but continued to allow the planes to be flown. He didn't answer the question directly, saying the airline has an ongoing relationship with the federal agency and there is a complicated system of inspections. ""Our interpretation of the guidance that we got from the FAA at the time was that we were in compliance with all laws and regulations,"" Kelly said. ""I think the FAA has a different view of that today, and that's something that we're investigating as well. But the important point is that at no time were we operating in an unsafe manner, and I think our history proves it."" Calling the situation detailed in the FAA documents ""one of the worst safety violations"" he has ever seen, Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minnesota, is expected to convene a hearing to ask why the airline may have allegedly put its passengers in danger. He heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  Watch passengers react to the charges » . The FAA documents allege that Southwest flew at least 117 of its planes in violation of mandatory safety checks. The 117 number includes the 47 planes alleged to have flown without fuselage checks and 70 additional planes allegedly flown without mandatory rudder inspections. In some cases, the documents say, the planes flew for 30 months past government inspection deadlines. It should have grounded them until the inspections could be completed. The planes were ""not airworthy"" according to congressional air safety investigators. Southwest Airlines, which carried more passengers in the United States than any other airline last year, said in a written statement Thursday that it looks forward to making details of the case public -- saying those details will support the airline's actions. The documents were prepared by two FAA safety inspectors who have requested whistle-blower status from Oberstar's committee. The two inspectors have been subpoenaed to testify before the committee. The whistle-blowers say FAA managers knew about the lapse in safety at Southwest, but decided to allow the airline to conduct the safety checks on a slower schedule because taking ""aircraft out of service would have disrupted Southwest Airlines' flight schedule."" Laura Brown, an FAA spokeswoman, told CNN that the administration has taken action and that a supervisor who was in charge of overseeing Southwest is ""no longer in a supervisory position."" The mandatory checks for fuselage cracks were required after the cabin of an Aloha Airlines 737 tore apart in midair in 1988, killing a flight attendant. The incident was blamed on cracks in the fuselage that grew wider as the plane underwent pressure changes during flight . Southwest Airlines has never had a catastrophic crash. E-mail to a friend .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's memorial service will take place Tuesday morning in the Staples Center, the 20,000-seat coliseum in downtown Los Angeles where Jackson rehearsed his show the night before he died, according to a person who has been briefed by a representative of the family. Michael Jackson was rehearsing at Los Angeles' Staples Center. His memorial will now be there. No other details about the service, set to begin at 10 a.m. Tuesday, have been revealed. Thursday, CNN learned the family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge to the contents of the trust. Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said. The children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- will also share 40 percent of the estate's assets and the remaining 20 percent will benefits charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said. Jackson's will did not specify where he wished to be buried. Many of his fans had hoped they'd get a chance to pay last respects at Neverland Ranch, which Jackson purchased in 1987, filled with animals and amusement rides, and named after the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan."" Planning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly. A public viewing at the ranch on Friday also had been under consideration, law enforcement sources said. Gregory Son, a 31-year-old musician, was among many fans who had planned to ride to the ranch to say goodbye to Jackson. ""I think he was a modern-day prophet,"" Son said outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. ""We kind of lost our father."" DEA joins investigation . On Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson's death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon's passing. Two law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA probe, saying agents would look at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply. Neither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter. Officially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles, California, police department -- which would not confirm the involvement. ""We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act,"" said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. ""However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."" Speculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died on June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results. On Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything. Murray's lawyers issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner's tests are complete. ""Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson,"" the statement said. ""We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo."" The comments were in reaction to a claim by a nutritionist who said Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for the powerful sedative, Propofol, despite knowing its harmful effects. ""I told him this medication is not safe,"" said Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse. ""He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.' "" Will nominates Jackson's mother as kids' guardian . Meanwhile, details of Jackson's will -- written on July 7, 2002 -- showed that the singer estimated his estate to be worth at least $500 million. In it, he nominated his mother, Katherine Jackson, as the guardian of his three children. If his 79-year-old mother is not living, ""I nominate Diana Ross as guardian,"" Jackson stated. Singer Ross, 65, is a lifelong friend of Jackson's. The will said Jackson ""intentionally omitted"" his former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe. It will be up to a court to decide who gets custody of the children, ages 7, 11 and 12. Rowe has not publicly indicated whether she will challenge the Jacksons for custody. The two men whom the will named as executors immediately filed a request to take control of the estate. One is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death. He helped acquire Jackson's music catalog, which is worth millions. The other is music industry executive John McClain, a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet. The men said in their filing in Los Angeles Superior Court that control of the estate would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations. Judge Mitchell Beckloff held an emergency hearing Wednesday morning and decided there was no urgency to replace Katherine Jackson -- whom he appointed temporary administrator earlier this week. Another hearing has been set for Monday. -- CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.","NEW: Michael Jackson trust includes mother, children, charities .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Three leading Iranian reformists who have rejected the results of last month's election questioned the legitimacy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government Wednesday. Mehdi Karrubi is vowing to ""stand by the people and the revolution, until the end of my life."" This comes as Ahmadinejad is set to take office at the end of the month. Presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi wrote a letter in his party's newspaper, saying he would not recognize the government and vowing to ""stand by the people and the revolution, until the end of my life."" His statement prompted Iran's government to block publication of the newspaper. Read Karrubi's letter PDF . Ahmadinejad's main political rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, also released a statement Wednesday criticizing the government and its crackdown on the media, which he said has created a ""bitter, coup d'etat atmosphere"" in Iran. ""We will stand firmly in order to preserve this valuable accomplishment [revolution],"" Moussavi said. ""Unless we succeed in this, this government will not have legitimacy. The system and the heritage of the Islamic revolution are the fruits of our 200-year-old struggle against oppression.""Read Moussavi's statement PDF . Iran's former reformist President Mohammad Khatami called on Iranians to keep up the struggle, noting that ""all doors are not yet closed."" Read Khatami's letter PDF . ""We must not lose our social capital this easily,"" Khatami told progressive Iranian newspaper Tahlile Rooz. ""I know Moussavi as one of the faithful, original and valuable capitals of our revolution, and considered his return to the political scene as a great chance."" In a separate posting on his Web site, Khatami accused the government of having restricted communications in the country. ""The state-owned media outlet shows the same scenes over and over again, in order to provoke people's feelings,"" he said. ""Where was this media outlet when tens of people were killed and hundreds of people beaten?"" In his statement, Moussavi called for the release of jailed reformists and said he will participate in the creation of a ""legal organization"" that will release proof of fraud in the June 12 presidential election and take its case to the courts. He said the current political issue is a ""family dispute"" and cautioned against asking for outside help, warning, ""We will regret it."" ""Many"" have asked Moussavi to end his struggle and ""close my eyes,"" but he warned, ""If we do not stand our grounds now, then we will have no guarantees that we won't be at this exact point in the future, face to face with the bitter events of this election."" Karrubi called the actions of the government before and after the controversial June 12 voting ""the foundation for the annulment of the elections,"" according to a copy of his letter on the party newspaper's Web site. ""I will not recognize the legitimacy of the government which has resulted from this process,"" Karrubi said in the letter. The 72-year-old cleric also said he ""will not participate in any of its processes, in any way"" and said he is ""ready to cooperate with pro-change people and groups."" Karrubi's party, Etemed Melli, said Iran's Ministry of Culture and its attorney general prevented the publication of its newspaper because it carried the letter. He and Moussavi have questioned the legitimacy of the vote count of the presidential election that gave Ahmadinejad an overwhelming victory. That outrage sparked bloody street protests and a clampdown on international media coverage, as well as access to certain Web sites. At least 20 protesters were killed in the chaos and more than 1,000 were detained in Tehran, the head of Iranian internal security forces Brig. Esmaeil Ahmadi said, according to Iranian state-run media reports on Wednesday. The actual death toll may be higher, but restrictions on media have made it difficult to verify. Human Rights Watch on Wednesday called on Iran to release prominent Iranian reformist Saeed Hajjarian, who has been imprisoned since June 15. He is one of several jailed reformists accused of orchestrating the post-election violence in Iran. Hajjarian, 55, was severely disabled after he was shot in the head in a 2000 assassination attempt that left him confined to a wheelchair with severe brain and spinal cord injuries. His wife, Vajiheh Marsoussi, is a physician and has visited Hajjarian in Tehran's Evin prison. She told Human Rights Watch that his medical condition was ""deteriorating severely."" Meanwhile, questions surrounded an announcement in government-run Iranian media that Ahmadinejad canceled his trip to Libya on Wednesday. The trip, which had not been finalized, was canceled because of the president's ""huge workload"" at home and ""other priorities,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency. Four days after the controversial election, Ahmadinejad went to Russia to meet with leaders there, where he was welcomed as the ""newly re-elected president of Iran"" despite the ongoing street protests. He returned to Iran that same day. Ahmadinejad will be sworn in before parliament Sunday, July 26, according to Iranian media reports. He will participate in a ceremony officiated by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a couple of days later, and then his second term will officially begin.","NEW: Former President Khatami accuses government of restricting communications .

"(CNN) -- It's that time of year for seasonal trips to the movies, and to celebrate, the Screening Room is taking a look back at our favorite family hits over the years. The best of Spielberg: ""E.T."" is our perfect family movie and perfectly captures childhood. From blockbuster to blockbuster, these are the films with something for everyone. They've got to be live action -- we've covered animated films before -- and family friendly. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Post your comments to the Screening Room blog and we'll publish the best. Read other CNN viewers' favorite and worst family films, and tell us yours >> . 1. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982) Spielberg's magic captures a perfect moment in childhood. We laughed and wept as his ugly little critter from outer space stole our hearts, while the kids fell firmly on the cute side of annoying. And oh, the music... 2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, 1971) Gene Wilder's whacked-out Willy Wonka adds a pinch of sinister to Roald Dahl's anarchic sweet treat, while the ignoble exits of Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop and Mike Teevee were delicious. 3. Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) ""That'll do, pig."" Babe is wide-eyed with wonder in Dick King-Smith's touching tale of a lonely little sheep-pig. Comic relief from the ewes, subtle special effects and a heartwarming turn from James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett make this a magical tale for all. 4. Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker, 1976) Jodie Foster and Scott Baio (Yes, Chachi from ""Happy Days!"") star in this glorious escapade set in a musical world of pint-sized gangsters and mini-molls. Al Capone for the kids; just watch out for the splurge guns... 5. Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968) Jack Wild is delightful as the Artful Dodger, Ron Moody's devilish Fagin glints with avaricious greed and Shani Willis shines as poor, ill-fated Nancy. But it's Oliver Reed's dark and sinister Bill Sykes who stayed with us -- and left us wanting more. 6. Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis, 1985) Christopher Lloyd's mad professor, a Delorean-cum-time machine, rock 'n' roll and a convenient bolt of lightning see Biff the bully get his come-uppance. All that, and a skateboarding Michael J. Fox? Mr Zemeckis, you spoil us! 7. Home Alone (Chris Columbus, 1990) Macaulay Culkin's abandoned little boy sees off bungling burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern with a series of eye-watering stunts. It proves just how great a child actor Culkin was; pity the unpopular babysitters who became the victims of copycat pranksters... 8. Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis blast ghostly green monsters to oblivion in this slime-filled romp around NYC, while taking time out to annoy Sigourney Weaver en route. Who you gonna call? 9. The Muppet Movie (James Frawley, 1979) Kermit and Co.'s roadtrip to Hollywood is a fabulously fuzzy tale of friendship and following your dreams, but the Muppet Movie's not just for kids: there's cameos a-plenty (Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, ORSON WELLES!) for Dad and smart one-liners by the bucketful for Mom. 10. Harry Potter (Various, 2001-present) The Hogwarts trio's wizarding adventures, backed by a cast plump with the best of British actors. Fast-paced plots, spellbinding special effects and magical sets, but be warned: it'll have the li'l critters pestering you to go to boarding school... And our favorite hide-behind-the-sofa moments... The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939) ""I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!"" Margaret Hamilton's green, cackling Wicked Witch of the West is hell-bent on revenging the death of her sister and getting those ruby slippers; she'll use deadly poppies and flying monkeys to do it. Terror as a rite of passage. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (Ken Hughes, 1968) With his battered top hat and lank hair, Robert Helpmann's creepy Child Catcher prowled from Vulgaria into our nightmares, hoping to catch a whiff of his prey with his unfeasibly long nose. The only film character to give the Wicked Witch of the West a run for her money. Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977) Darth Vader may cast a formidable shadow, but it's the sound of his labored breathing that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up -- as it gets closer, closer, closer... Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Rule 475 of Surviving the Movies: Never go into the basement! The thick silence in New York's Central Library masks a phantom infestation -- and they're not going quietly. As the gray-haired librarian switched to shrieking ghoul, a generation of children was put off reading for life. Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) And again, it's the sound effects that make the Velociraptors so scary -- as the frighteningly intelligent pack of lizards hunt for Lex and Tim among the kitchen workbenches, their hissing grows ever nearer...

"(CNN) -- The second cut in U.S. interest rates in as many weeks is putting further pressure on the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to reconsider their currencies' peg with the dollar; and none more so than Qatar. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad tells MME Qatar has not made any decisions regarding dropping the dollar-peg. The small emirate has the highest inflation rate in the region, and it threatens to spiral further northward as its government brings Qatari interest rates into line with the U.S. The Qatar Central Bank lopped half a percentage off its deposit rate after the Federal Reserve sought to stave off recession in the U.S. with an emergency cut of 75 percentage points on January 22. Eight days later, the Fed moved again, this time with a cut of half a percentage point to take U.S. interest rates to three percent. After the first cut, MME's John Defterios sat down for an exclusive television interview with Qatar's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani, who is also the emirate's Foreign Minister, and controls Qatar's sovereign wealth fund through the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). John Defterios started by asking Sheikh Hamad whether the sharp decline in U.S. interest rates was putting too much pressure on Qatar's dollar-peg. (HA):  Oil and gas are saleable in dollars, but most of our imports are not in dollars but in Euros or Asian currencies. All of these currencies went 40 percent to 50 percent above the level which we experienced two years ago. For us, there is a pressure. We know that a decision needs to be made by the Fed because of the situation on the stock market in the United States; it might be a wise decision. But for countries like the GCC and Qatar, especially Qatar, it puts us under pressure on how to deal with inflation and our currency, which is undervalued already by at least 35 percent. (JD): What is your instinct telling you, to go to a basket of currencies to buffer this fall of the dollar? (HA): We are studying all options at the moment, but what I can say is that at the GCC meetings in December the agreement was to hold onto the dollar and to see. Every country has to see its way out of this, but only after a consultation with the GCC. For us, our wish is that it's a policy to be taken by the whole GCC, to either basket or revalue our currency. I cannot see a decision. Even in Qatar, we have no decision up to now. (JD): At the December meeting there was a commitment to move forward with the single currency, realistically by 2010, or is that just a target? (HA): It's just a target. I don't think we will reach that target. (JD): What is a realistic timeline? (HA): Well, first we need all of us to agree. Most of the GCC countries agree about the currencies but we would like to do it together, and some would like to wait. We cannot put a target on when it will be done. (JD): President Bush, during his swing through the Gulf States, was asking the producers to put more oil on the market because of the U.S. recession that may be pending. Is it time for OPEC to put more crude oil onto the market? (HA): Is there is excess oil to be put on the market? I am not sure there is more oil. I think all countries at the moment are pumping their capacity, if we are talking in real terms. If we are just telling the market there is some excess if something happens, then that is another situation. In my opinion everyone is at full speed, enjoying high prices, but there is no excess capacity immediately. Maybe there is 200,000 to 300,000 extra  with one of the producers, but no more than that. (JD): We have seen oil stabilize around $80 per barrel right now. That seems to be the new floor. Can we get to $100 per barrel and use that as a new floor within the next 12 months? (HA): Well, anything is possible, but with the slowdown in the United States, and I don't know what effect in Asia, $70 or $80 is more likely than $100 this year. Unless the situation changes in the economy, which from what we hear cannot be changed so quickly. (JD): We have seen a huge debate over the last four weeks about sovereign wealth funds and President Bush has actually gone to put tighter controls and a greater review of these funds. Do you think it's correct to provide greater scrutiny to the funds going into the United States and perhaps into Europe? (HA): I'm surprised about these talks. We know these talks were more serious six months ago. But after the crisis I think most of the sovereign wealth funds, which have helped in the United States and elsewhere in Europe, this has been welcomed by the government. They are talking about this fund coming from a different space, from another space, and taking over the market. First of all, we are not politically ambitious to play a role in these companies. We do not want to take over companies. Maybe some, but not all. (JD): I have talked to both the OECD and the International Monetary Fund and there is discussion about establishing a set of rules to adhere to for these funds. Would you go to a set of rules that were international in terms of the outlook as opposed to country by country? (HA): If it is an international rule done by an international body and consulting all the countries, yes. But if there is one country that wants to set its own rules, we will respect their rules as a country, but we have other options to invest somewhere else. (JD): You have a very good dialogue with the White House. Were you surprised by President Bush's actions? (HA): Well, I don't know exactly what he means by this, but let us wait and see what will come. E-mail to a friend .","MME speaks exclusively with Qatar PM Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- An internationally known Catholic priest sometimes called ""Father Oprah"" has been removed from his posts in Florida after published photos showed him lying down bare-chested in an embrace with a woman on a beach. The photos of the Cuban-American priest appeared on the cover of this week's TV Notas magazine. The Rev. Alberto Cutie (pronounced koo-tee-AYE) -- who got the nickname ""Father Oprah"" because of the advice he gives on Spanish-language media -- remains a priest. But he was relieved Tuesday of his duties at St. Francis De Sales Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and at the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks, said a ""deeply saddened"" Miami, Florida, Archbishop John C. Favalora. The photos of the Cuban-American priest appeared on the cover and on eight inside pages of this week's TV Notas magazine. The cover says in Spanish: ""Good God. Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover."" In a message posted on the Miami archdiocese Web page, the archbishop apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a ""scandal."" ""Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,"" Favalora said. ""Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest."" Cutie apologized in an online statement Tuesday, saying he ""wants to ask for forgiveness if my actions have caused pain and sadness. ... I assure you that my service and dedication to God remain intact.""  Watch pictures that led to priest's dismissal. » . Other media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story on Tuesday, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world. ""We got a bunch of calls from sobbing women,"" said Miami archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta. Archdiocese officials declined to say where Cutie was Tuesday or what his new assignment might be. A woman who answered the telephone Wednesday at St. Francis De Sales said, ""He is no longer here."" The identity of the woman in the photos remained publicly unknown Wednesday. Cutie was ordained in May 1995 and was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says. In addition to his TV and radio appearances, he has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, ""Real Life, Real Love."" He was president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace in Miami.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's prime minister warned Saturday that his country ""stands on the brink,"" as its soldiers cornered Tamil Tiger fighters in an assault that is trapping more than 50,000 civilians on a small plot of coastal land. Sri Lanka's defense ministry says this handout photo shows troops with a captured Tamil Tiger craft Thursday. The United Nations estimated the number of civilians, who were trapped on about 1.5 square miles (four square kilometers) of land. Government troops seized the last remaining coastal stretch under the control of Tamil Tiger rebels, the Ministry of Defense said Saturday, marking a possible end to more than 25 years of fighting in the island nation. The seizure marks the total capture of coastline territory previously controlled by the rebels, it said, after army divisions advanced from the north and south to link up. An army source told CNN that about two square kilometers in the region remain to be captured, and that military officials expect that to happen in a couple of days. The rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began. ""Sri Lanka stands on the brink,"" Prime Minister Rathnasiri Wickremanayake said in a written statement.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka » . ""We have called repeatedly for the violence to cease. The humanitarian agencies must be granted access to civilians caught in the crossfire of a dreadful conflict.  Watch iReporter Thileepan's footage of the ""safe zone"" » . ""We are backing U.N. efforts to secure an orderly end to the conflict. The LTTE must lay down its arms and allow civilians to leave. Sri Lanka must understand that there will be consequences for its actions."" No formal declaration of victory is expected at least until Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa returns to the country from Amman, Jordan, where he is attending the World Economic Forum. In an address to the summit in Amman on Saturday, Rajapaksa said the Sri Lankan armed forces had defeated the rebels. ""I will be going back to my country Sri Lanka that has been totally freed from the barbaric acts of terrorism of the LTTE. This freedom comes after 30 long years."" ""Our economic prosperity must essentially rest upon global peace and stability. Terrorism has for decades denied us this right. All eleven countries gathered here today have suffered the effects of terrorism, some more than others. ""Terrorism has raised its ugly head in different forms from time to time and destroyed all development initiatives in most of our countries"" he said. On Friday, the Navy arrested the wife of Soosai, a leader of Sea Tigers -- the ocean-going arm of the rebel group. His daughter and son-in-law were also arrested. Navy officials, quoting those who were arrested, said Tigers leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is believed to be inside the area of the latest fighting. Other sources have said he has escaped.

Pete Docter: There is an amazing group of computer scientists that really approach these things both as an artist but also as a scientist. May: You have thousands of balloons that all interact with each other, and all the balloons have strings, so this is a very complex animation problem. Docter: They think about the physics of the balloons. They bump into each other, they can turn wind up or down so they can dynamically move, and then you get the strings that attach those balloons to the house. It's a fairly complex mathematical problem. We tried to make things more like a window you look into, opposed to things coming out at you. May: And then when Russell is on the front porch of the house and you look down and see how far down it is, the audience is scared.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There are likely to be two hot-button issues in Judge Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court confirmation hearings as senators gauge not only her positions but also some controversial comments she has made. Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Issue No. 1: Abortion. It is the traditional hot-button issue in Supreme Court confirmation hearings. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken May 14-17, 68 percent of Americans say they don't want the court's Roe vs. Wade decision giving constitutional protection to abortion rights overturned. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Sotomayor was raised Catholic. If she is confirmed, six out of the nine justices on the high court will be from the faith. Catholics make up about 25 percent of the U.S. population. Of the 110 people who have served on the Supreme Court, 11 have been Catholic. Five of those justices -- Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts -- are currently on the court.  Read more about the justices on the court » . Barbara Perry, a government professor at Sweetbriar College, said she sees Catholics as swing voters with a base of socially conservative principles, and therefore attractive for Republican presidents. Catholic League President Bill Donohue said Catholics have conservative credentials on issues such as abortion, without the political baggage of terms such as the ""religious right"" or ""evangelicals."" ""Is it safer to nominate a Catholic as opposed to an evangelical to get votes? I think the answer is decidedly yes."" Court observers wonder what, if anything, six Catholic justices would mean for Supreme Court decisions. The five Catholics on the bench concurred in a 2007 decision, Gonzales v. Carhart, which upheld a state ban on late-term abortions. Sotomayor has faced few abortion cases, and no tests on issues such as gay rights or the death penalty. However, Donohue expects a Justice Sotomayor to lean more left than her fellow Catholics on the court.  Watch more on the issues confronting Sotomayor » . ""I think she's more reliably liberal,"" Donohue said. Issue No. 2: Same-sex marriage. Four states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Maine and Massachusetts -- allow same-sex couples to wed. New Hampshire could soon follow with legislation pending before the state Legislature. Vermont has also legalized same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples in California, however, suffered a defeat Tuesday when California's Supreme Court upheld the Proposition 8 ballot initiative in 2009 that outlawed same-sex marriage. The state had previously allowed such marriages after the same court ruled that, ""An individual's sexual orientation -- like a person's race or gender -- does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights."" On Tuesday the court said: ""Our role is limited to interpreting and applying the principles and rules embodied in the California Constitution, setting aside our own personal beliefs and values.'' Recent CNN polling has shown that a majority of Americans are against legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Fifty-four percent of Americans questioned in an April 23-26 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said marriages between gay or lesbian couples should not be recognized as valid, while 44 percent said they should be considered legal. But there was a gap between the opinions of younger and older people, with younger people far more likely to approve of same-sex marriage. In fact, 58 percent of people age 18 to 34 said same-sex marriages should be legal. Among people ages 35 to 49, 42 percent agreed, as did 41 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds. Twenty-four percent of people 65 and older agreed. The survey's sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. But is marriage a right under the federal Constitution? The federal courts have not ruled on that. ""That's an issue that may well come up within the federal courts ... almost certain to do so,"" Justice Samuel Alito has said. Will Sotomayor set aside her personal beliefs and values? Maybe. A recent clip of Sotomayor has surfaced that is being used by opponents to prove their belief she will rule a certain way. ""The court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know, I know that this is on tape, and I should never say that. Because we don't make law, I know,"" she said at a 2005 conference at Duke University. ""OK, I know, I know. I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it.""  Read about Sotomayor's key rulings » . Another comment that could be scrutinized during the Senate hearings is from 2001, when Sotomayor said the gender and ethnicity of judges does and should influence decisions. ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,"" she said. That comment has outraged conservative critics such as the group Judicial Watch, which said that if confirmed, Sotomayor may rule more on the basis of racial identity than law. ""It is outrageous and racist on its face, and if a nominee that had conservative credentials made a similar although reverse statement they would be laughed at. They would never be put on the court,"" said Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch. But one liberal academic said too much is made of these comments and not enough of Sotomayor's legal opinions. ""I don't think having a particular background is going to cash out as having a particular ready style or opinion,"" said New York University Professor Kenji Yoshino. ""If you actually read over 400 opinions that she has written, you will see she is a judge's judge."" One case that will get greater scrutiny is Sotomayor's role in dismissing the appeal of 19 white and one Latino firefighters from New Haven, Connecticut. They claim they were denied a promotion despite doing better on exams, because not enough minority candidates qualified. Sotomayor was one of a three-judge panel who in a one-paragraph summary sided with a lower court. Other judges on the court criticized the decision, arguing it failed to grapple with questions of exceptional importance. ""In a case like this where there are important competing concerns, it is important for the appellate court to explain the basis of her decision,"" said Case Western Reserve University professor Jonathan Adler. He said it was as if the court wanted to ""make the case go away or brush it under the rug."" The Supreme Court decided it would hear the firefighters' appeal. Legal analysts said they expect Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee will want to ask Sotomayor about her role in that case, as well as her comments about ethnicity and the bench. That, coupled with her views on abortion and same-sex marriage, could electrify an already heated debate over her nomination. Soon there will be even more known about Sotomayor. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's ranking Republican, on Wednesday released the bipartisan questionnaire the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked Sotomayor to complete. Once the questionnaire is completed and returned to the committee, copies will be made available online and in print.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- It is the most popular photograph in history: Argentine revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara stares pensively at the horizon, his steely eyes shielded behind a thick beard and his trademark beret. The shot -- taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda in Havana on March 5, 1960 -- turned the charismatic and controversial leader into a cultural icon. Che's image, here advertising soda, is still seen around the world. Now, nearly a half-century later, the photograph is used by communists and capitalists, Marxists and marketers to sell ideas. In his new book, ""Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image"" (Vintage Books), journalist Michael Casey examines how this photograph came to take on a life of its own and become the most reproduced photograph in the world. ""The Korda photograph can be seen on t-shirts, beach towels and condoms, even,"" he said. ""And it is in all corners of the world. You can find it in East Timor, parts of Africa, Israel, as well as Lebanon. You can see it in the United States and here in Latin America. And what this book is trying to do is discover why. What made this thing so big? So universal?"" The life of Che, the Argentine-born doctor turned revolutionary, has been well documented since his death in a Bolivian jungle in 1967. Countless books have been written about his role in leading Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution and translated into dozens of languages. Hollywood has given Che the treatment twice: in 2004's ""Motorcycle Diaries"" and last year in a two-part biopic starring Benicio Del Toro. Last month, ""Che: The Musical"" premiered at the Konex Cultural Center in Buenos Aires. What Casey -- the Buenos Aires bureau chief for Dow Jones Newswires -- discovered during three years of investigation throughout Latin America for the book, was that Korda's image became so popular because it was promoted by people from all walks of life, including Castro, pop-artist Andy Warhol and countless students from Paris, Berkeley and beyond, who embraced the image as a symbol of rebellion during an era when the world was aching for change. ""Whether or not people believe in Che's hard-line version of Marxism, they want hope,"" Casey said. ""They want hope and beauty -- and somehow both of those things are encapsulated in this image. And so you get people investing their dreams in it. I think that is at the heart of it, with all these other forces: political, artistic, marketing, economic, all coming together in a way that really makes it a ubiquitous brand.""  Watch author Michael Casey discuss the Che Guevara image » . The brand, Casey writes, is the ""quintessential post-modern icon"" but may be surpassed by a newer image: artist Shepard Fairey's Barack Obama ""Hope"" poster, which Obama used during his run to the White House. ""I think that Obama is extremely cognizant of the power of images,"" Casey said. ""[The 'Hope'] poster is very much caught up in some of these forces that moved Che forward. They are very different people, obviously, but that's only part of the point. ""Part of the point is that the U.S. is engaged in a battle of brands, always has been. 'Uncle Sam vs. Che' if you really want to boil it down to what Latin America and its ugly history in part has been,"" he said. ""So, part of the United States' battle to improve relations with the region is improving its image. And in some respects you now have an alternative brand with Obama. The previous brand did not sell very well in Latin America. The new brand is getting off to a much better start."" So while U.S. relations with Latin America, and much of the world, look to be changing, it's safe to say that the Che image -- and its ability to mean all things to all people -- will likely always stay the same.","Photo of revolutionary Che Guevara is the most reproduced image in history .

"(CNN) -- When a film cast includes names like Ben Stiller, Robin Williams and Owen Wilson, a bit of improvisation on set is to be expected. Ben Stiller and the gang are back in ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian."" ""I think the movie is really only 25 percent scripted, maybe even less than that,"" said Shawn Levy, director of the new film ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,"" which boasts those comedic actors and several others. ""It just so happens that the scenes that get some of the biggest laughs are the improvised scenes, so it feels like more than that, but we had a very good script and it's still very much there."" The sequel to 2006's ""Night at the Museum"" welcomes back the trio and director as well as other original cast members, including British actor Ricky Gervais, while also adding fresh faces such as Hank Azaria (as a villainous pharaoh) and Amy Adams (as Amelia Earhart).  Watch the group laugh about the film » . The new romp features Stiller's character, security guard Larry Daley, in action at the Smithsonian, where some of the pieces from the Museum of Natural History -- the setting for the original movie -- are now being housed. Story writer Robert Ben Garant said watching the actors take the script and run with it was painless. ""It's always hard to watch bad actors improv on your skit,"" Garant said. ""But when it's Ben Stiller and Jonah Hill and Hank, it's such a pleasure because it always starts with the idea of our script and sometimes they stick to the words, but most of the time they do stuff much, much funnier and weirder. It's really great to watch."" Owen Wilson is back as Jedidiah the miniature cowboy, who is now being held hostage at the Smithsonian. Azaria turns up the mean as Kahmunrah, the bitter brother of the pharaoh from the last film. Azaria said he thoroughly enjoyed his turn as the film's resident bad guy. ""When the villain is this ridiculous, it's fun,"" Azaria said. ""When he actually has a sense of humor and self-awareness, and goes from frivolous to really mean bully."" ""In the end I had to be forced to do the mean stuff because I always wanted to do the silly stuff,"" he added. ""But watching it ... I enjoyed the mean stuff the most. "" Even with the good times on set, filming at the iconic Smithsonian was a monumental task, given that it wasn't always closed while the actors worked. Stiller said the crowds who watched the movie making magic were respectful and quiet during filming, often breaking into applause after a scene. ""We weren't really doing much, it was just the best audience in the world,"" he said. ""So it was sort of like doing a live show at the Smithsonian."" Funny man Stiller even got to monkey around on set -- literally. In this film, there were two simians that took on the actor in a scene that found him getting the short end of the branch. ""I basically get slapped by both of them, but I am not allowed to slap them back because of animal rights, so I have to slap a dummy or a tennis ball when they're off-screen,"" Stiller told the British newspaper, The Mirror. ""It's a weird experience."" Robin Williams, who is recovering from heart surgery, said he was excited to return as Theodore Roosevelt -- this time with a twist. ""I got to play two versions of Teddy Roosevelt,"" Williams said. ""One, the Teddy that was in the first movie and the other was kind of a brassy, bitchy Teddy and the one that's a bust of Teddy Roosevelt."" With so many comics on board, it can't help but be a zany ride. Wilson said he believes those good times will translate to the audience. ""Shawn was really great about kind of letting people try things,"" he said. ""So it just had that kind of spirit on it where everybody was having a good time. I think you kind of feel it when watching the movie."" Director Levy said the actors weren't the only ones who had fun. It's not every day a crew has access to the secret life of a museum, especially the Smithsonian, and Levy immersed himself in the privilege. ""It's such a fun world to explore, it's so dynamic, and the possibilities are literally endless,"" he said. ""I just love telling these stories."" Since filming was such a blast, might there be a ""Night at the Museum 3"" in the works?

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- Cambodia has sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council to call attention to its continuing standoff with Thailand over an ancient border temple on disputed land. Cambodian soldiers stand guard near Preah Vihear temple, close to the Thai border. The country is not asking for U.N. intervention, said Information Minister Kheu Kanharith. Rather, the letter that Cambodia's permanent mission in New York submitted to the chairmen of the Security Council and the General Assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day Sunday. The two countries agreed to meet Monday to defuse tensions -- even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country's territory. Earlier this month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing. A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama. He had endorsed the application. Cambodia, meanwhile, is preparing for general elections on July 27. And Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph. The current flare-up began Tuesday, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claims Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies the charge, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. Each side has asked its troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon. So far, the only casualty has been a Thai soldier who was injured Tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the Khmer Rouge occupied the area. The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, won power through a guerrilla war. It is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million Cambodians. -- Journalist Soeum Yin contributed to this report .","Cambodia: Letter to Security Council meant to 'draw attention to crisis'

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- A Russian serial murderer dubbed the ""Chessboard Killer"" was given the maximum sentence of life in prison Monday and ordered to undergo psychiatric therapy for a string of at least 48 murders that terrorized Moscow for years. A Moscow jury convicted Alexander Pichushkin last week of 48 murders and three attempted murders. Pichushkin claimed he had actually committed 60 murders, though prosecutors were unable to find evidence to prove that. Pichushkin earned the nickname ""Chessboard Killer"" for saying he had intended to kill one person for each of the 64 squares on a chessboard. In ordering Pichushkin to receive compulsory psychiatric therapy, the judge said the defendant has a mental disorder but is still sane and cannot avoid responsibility for his crimes. Throughout his trial, Pichushkin gloated over his crimes and ridiculed the police case against him. ""I was dismayed my work had been attributed to others,"" Pichushkin said. ""In one week, I killed two people. If they hadn't caught me, I would have never stopped. Having caught me, they saved many lives."" Watch video report on serial killer Alexander Pichushkin . For years until his arrest in June 2006, Pichushkin kept Moscow on edge, stalking the heavily forested Bitsa Park on the city's southern outskirts and preying on the homeless and elderly. Pichushkin claimed to have committed all but one of his murders in the park. He lured his victims with the promise of alcohol and, after getting them drunk on vodka, he beat them to death and dumped their bodies in the park. It led Russian media to give Pichushkin his other nickname, the ""Bitsa Maniac."" Over the years, Russian police recovered dozens of corpses, some with sticks and vodka bottles rammed into their skulls. But the crucial lead came in 2005, when a woman Pichushkin worked with at a vegetable store was found dead. She had left a note at her home saying she was going for a walk with him. Pichushkin said he had been aware of the note but killed her anyway. E-mail to a friend .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Jackson fans who purchased tickets for his final concerts will receive a full refund or, if they chose, a commemorative ticket, the concert promoter said Tuesday. A fan shows off the first ticket bought at the O2 Centre in London for one of Michael Jackson's concerts. ""The world lost a kind soul who just happened to be the greatest entertainer the world has ever known,"" said Randy Phillips, president and chief executive officer of AEG Live. ""Since he loved his fans in life, it is incumbent upon us to treat them with the same reverence and respect after his death."" Fifty sold-out Jackson concerts were scheduled for the O2 Arena in London, starting July 13, with admission costing at least $105. The shows were billed as the final concerts of his career and were called ""This Is It."" Tell us what you think -- would you take the ticket or the refund? Fans who decide they would rather have a souvenir will receive a ticket conceived by Jackson. There are eight designs that include holographic images of the entertainer on the front. Images of the tickets will be available on michaeljacksonlive.com in coming days, according to the promoter. Refunds will be processed by the issuing ticketing agencies -- See, Ticketline, Ticketmaster and Viagogo. Billboard magazine has estimated that $85 million in tickets were sold for the concert series. Additional packages, merchandise and secondary market sales could have raised the total to $115 million. AEG Live declined to comment on the figures. Jackson was expected to earn $50 million from the London shows. He died Thursday in California after his doctor found him in bed not breathing, but with a slight pulse.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. ""It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,"" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. ""There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward. Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement, we were brought here to cultivate the land because that's something we did on the continent. So really, that's what many of the people are doing now,"" he said. Myers believes urban farming is a way for many African-Americans to reconnect with their past. iReport.com: Show us your urban farm . ""They are going through a process of Sankofa and going to what they traditionally did, which is connect to the Earth so they can move forward and grow,"" he says. But HABESHA Gardens isn't unique. Former pro basketball player Will Allen, who is considered to be one of the nation's leading urban farmers and founder of Growing Power Inc., estimates that there are hundreds of thousands of urban gardens in inner cities across America.  Urban farms help feed people, sustain neighorhoods »  ""It's beyond a movement at this point. Its more like a revolution,"" says Allen. Both Allen and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African-Americans is born out of necessity and not just echoing traditions. ""Minority people are affected by poor food, more than any other groups,"" and many inner cities lack access to quality fruits and vegetables, Allen says. ""Our food system is broken."" ""When you're poor, when you don't have access to resources, you have to create your own,"" says Myers. ""So this is a way for people of African descent to use their creativity to grow their own food."" Many poorer communities don't have full-scale grocery stores. Allen charges that companies have red-lined those areas and won't build stores there. So community activists like Myers have taken up the fight. ""[Starting] community gardens in local communities, specifically in urban areas, is important, so you create your own food security network,"" says Myers. ""You're not relying on large grocery stores to provide food for everyone because if those grocery stores have problems, your access to food is done."" HABESHA Gardens makes the fresh food accessible to people in Mechanicsville by opening up the garden to people in the community every Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. ""We invite people from the local community here, the immediate community but also from the greater Atlanta community ... to come out, work in the garden; learn, reconnect with the Earth and also be able to take food home with them after the harvest."" In addition to providing food for those that work in garden, HABESHA partners with organizations such as the Atlanta Community Food Bank and the MLK Senior Center to provide food from the garden to the hungry and elders in the community. HABESHA is more than just an urban garden. HABESHA, an acronym for Helping Africa By Establishing Schools at Home and Abroad. The organization mentors young African-Americans by sending them on a yearly trip to Ghana and educates the youth in Mechanicsville through the garden's after-school program called Sustainable Seeds. ""Not only are we teaching them about agriculture, [we're] teaching them about solar technology, rainwater catching,"" Myers says. ""A majority of the food that was planted here was done by the youth in the after-school program. They helped to build the shed, they helped to build the greenhouse, they helped to build the shade nursery ... They are very much a vital part of the process that goes on here."" Malik Parks, 12, is a member of HABESHA's mentoring program. ""Well, it feeds us. That's a big thing -- to know that we're helping the earth. Us planting it, that gives us exercise; then also, eating it gives us nutrients,"" says Parks. Sporting a ""Black to Our Roots"" T-shirt, Parks is already well aware of the higher purpose he and HABESHA have with their garden. ""I believe to some, its hope. I know there are a lot of people over here that live in poverty. I know you can come and pick food, so that's food for them,"" Parks says. ""So it's hope to stay alive longer and be energized and do what you have to do to get back on your feet."" Myers, who is his mentor, agrees. ""We encourage the people in the community to come, be a part of the process of growing the food, so it's more empowerment than it is giving as charity,"" says Myers. And with urban farms like Will Allen's becoming half-million dollar enterprises in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, and many other farms in New York City and Detroit, Michigan, urban gardening is spreading like the roots of the vegetables they grow. ""This has become a multicultural, multigenerational movement, a revolution,"" says Allen. ""This isn't just the hippies and tree huggers. Everyone is getting on board. It's really exciting.""","HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban farms sprouting up around the country .

"(CNN) -- Early in Michael Mann's vivid, incisive, but half-cocked gangster opus ""Public Enemies,"" Johnny Depp's John Dillinger returns to jail a few scant months after leaving it. Johnny Depp plays the charismatic John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies."" Only this time he's just visiting -- and he's taking his friends out with him. It's an audacious opening gambit, and when the getaway gets messy -- one of the gang panics and soon bullets are flying all over the place -- we glimpse another insight into what makes Dillinger tick. As he clings to a wounded comrade for dear life, and stares death long in the face, he has to make a decision: What to do with the guy who panicked and brought this upon them? Dillinger lets him go. Based on Bryan Burrough's well-sourced account of the Depression-era crime wave that gave rise not only to Dillinger, but also to a whole gallery of criminal poster boys -- Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the Barker gang, Bonnie and Clyde -- ""Public Enemies"" whittles the book down to its most dramatic duel: the nationwide manhunt for Dillinger presided over by J. Edgar Hoover (a knockout Billy Crudup) and led by his Chicago, Illinois, bureau chief, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Dillinger and Purvis assumed folk-hero proportions in their day. According to Burrough, when newsreels showed Dillinger -- public enemy No. 1 -- he was applauded more loudly than the president. A 20th-century Jesse James, he was an underdog with a reputation for fairness. It was said he never killed anybody, and he was gallant and jocular with members of the public, once offering his overcoat to a kidnapped bank teller he had taken as a human shield. The role is tailor-made for a self-styled rebel like Depp. He understands the outlaw's swagger, the ferocity that sits hand in glove with his soft-spoken sensitivity. All the romance in the picture comes from Depp: the graceful ease with which he vaults a bank railing, his astonishing self-confidence and his dedicated courtship of hat-check girl Billie Frechette (an eager Marion Cotillard). She's swept up less by the high life he promises than the passionate conviction of his pitch. Burrough paints Purvis as an ineffectual, even inept agent who was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to nab Floyd, Nelson and Dillinger. The movie has no truck with such revisionism, but betrays little interest in Bale's dour, narrow lawman. The film's parallel cop-and-robber structure recalls Mann's modern classic, ""Heat."" Purvis and Dillinger meet only once -- to talk -- and then face off just once more, at the climax, to kill and be killed. If the confrontation of Bale and Depp doesn't pack the same iconic punch as ""Heat's"" Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, the (entirely fictitious) exchange in a Midwestern jail cell remains central to the film. At one point, Dillinger reprimands Purvis for shooting down Pretty Boy Floyd, extending the poetic license still further -- as a point of historical fact Floyd died several months after Dillinger, and though Purvis was at the scene he almost certainly didn't pull the trigger. But Purvis did coordinate the execution of John Dillinger, an assassination as much as it was an attempted arrest, and maybe the nastiest crime in the picture. So when the incarcerated Depp advises the smug Bale that he should find a different line of work for his own peace of mind, his words carry a certain weight. Still, the movie's resolve to take Dillinger at face value feels a bit perfunctory, even old hat. At 140 minutes it takes a long time to find its rhythm; indeed, this is one film that would be better if it were 20 minutes longer. Still, there's little here that Arthur Penn didn't anticipate 40 years ago in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" except maybe the intriguing idea that organized crime pulled the plug on the old-style go-it-alone bank robber in a belated attempt to forestall Hoover's dream of a federal law enforcement agency. For all its loving period detail, the movie scarcely notices the desperate poverty of the times. Shot largely on high definition video, ""Public Enemies"" doesn't look like the old gangster films -- it looks like TV. The images gain in immediacy what is lost in luster, but left this spectator looking for more texture, more depth -- more heat. iReport.com: Depp's best film? One of the new Hollywood's last great stylists, Mann is well aware of the sacrifice involved in this transition. You can see it in the loving way he pictures Johnny Depp's doomed Dillinger watching Clark Gable's doomed gangster embrace his fate in ""Manhattan Melodrama"" while Purvis and his deputies assume their places outside Chicago's Biograph Theater. There is something ritualistic about this sequence, as if Dillinger divines some measure of grace from the screen, and we congregants also play our part. The faces change, but it's the same old movie we remember.","""Public Enemies"" is a solid gangster flick that's not quite great, says Tom Charity .

"(CNN) -- Of all of the calculations Zainab Ibrahim made during her accounting career in Baghdad, this one was a snap. Iraqi refugee Zainab Ibrahim lives in a modest, sparsely furnished apartment outside Atlanta, Georgia. After a bullet whizzed by her head and death threats showed up at her doorstep, it was time, she figured, to leave. She went to Jordan four years ago and arrived last June at her ultimate destination -- the United States. Once a target of insurgents because her job at the Iraqi Finance Ministry involved working with the U.S. military, Ibrahim is now trying to avoid another pitfall -- falling through the cracks of America's recession. She and thousands of refugees across America who fled war and persecution just can't seem to find full-time jobs in a weak economy. And that just doesn't add up for Ibrahim, who has bachelor's and master's degrees in accounting from Baghdad University and risked her life for the U.S. government. ""It's everybody's dream being in the United States. I thought I would get the opportunity I always dreamed about,"" she said in fluent English in her sparsely furnished apartment outside Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'm really shocked. I found out everything is slow.""   View video highlights from her interview » . The recession has made life tough nationwide for refugees. ""It's the most challenging time I've seen and I've been doing this work for 25 years,"" said Robert J. Carey, vice president of resettlement and migration policy at the International Rescue Committee, one of several nonprofit organizations that the U.S. government pays to resettle refugees. Lavinia Limon, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, says, ""it's a significant problem."" ""All refugees are required to become self-sufficient in a very fast time period. Our program is designed with that in mind. There isn't a long-term basis of support,"" said Anastasia Brown, director of refugee programs for the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops. ""What we have right now is a situation where it's becoming more and more difficult to find employment in a very short time period."" The U.S. government resettles a limited number of refugees each year. They have full legal rights to live and work in the United States and can apply to become U.S. citizens after five years. Both the U.S. State and the Health and Human Services departments pay for limited refugee services. The State Department allocation for living expenses per refugee on arrival to the country is $450, a sum the department calls ""modest."" Individual refugees also are eligible to get eight months of cash assistance and medical assistance under the HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement. Depending on states' eligibility requirements, refugee families could be eligible for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and Medicaid. State governments stipulate welfare benefit cash levels. There are five years' worth of social services, such as English language instruction. Refugee agencies across America pursue various state and federal programs that can help newcomers stay afloat, but they say they rely more and more on private donations to help provide food, clothing, money and furniture. That increasing reliance on community support shows that the U.S. program for resettling refugees needs reform, resettlement agencies argue. Three agencies -- Church World Service, Episcopal Migration Ministries, and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service -- said in a recent statement that ""the recession is making it harder for refugee newcomers to find jobs within 180 days of arrival as the program prescribes."" They said the government's ""one-size-fits-all"" approach -- the $450 per refugee and eight months of limited cash assistance plus food stamps and Medicaid -- ""reflects neither what resettlement actually costs nor the importance the U.S. refugee program holds in U.S. foreign policy,"" they said. The public-private partnership that has been the ""genius"" of the U.S. program has ""fallen out of balance,"" with the private sector is bearing much of the cost, these agencies say. More than 60,000 refugees were admitted to the United States during the fiscal year 2008, according to figures from the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. The largest number was from Burma, with 18,139. There were 13,823 from Iraq. Traditionally, refugees -- no matter their skill level -- have had a better chance of landing menial jobs, in places like hotels or restaurants or in plants with low-paying and arduous jobs. Now refugees are competing with Americans for low-paying jobs. Many are having a hard time finding the non-skilled positions. Refugee support agencies are scouring the job market, exploring job opportunities on farms as well as work in other sectors of the economy, said Carey, the International Rescue Committee senior vice president. He's also chairman of the Refugee Council USA, a coalition of non-government organizations helping refugees. ""For the first time I'm aware of,"" he said, ""large numbers of refugees are receiving eviction notices."" It's even hard for those refugees who go places where they have friends, relatives or members of their same faith. In San Diego, California, Iraqi Chaldean Christian refugees are facing strains despite having access to an established Chaldean community, said Michael McKay, refugees services department director of Catholic Charities in San Diego. There's ""great competition"" for jobs, from menial to highly skilled. Several Iraqis in San Diego have even talked about returning to Iraq. Yet some communities still have those one or two big employers with jobs well-suited to newcomers. In Bowling Green, Kentucky, refugees from Burma, Burundi, Iraq, Cuba and Bhutan have over the years found low-paying factory jobs that Americans shun, such as work at a Perdue Farms chicken processing plant, said James Robinson, executive director of The Bowling Green International Center. How long will that last? ""We're good now,"" said Robinson. ""But you never know what tomorrow will bring."" Back in Atlanta, Zainab Ibrahim makes no bones about how she feels: She wants work in her field, as an accountant, not just any job. But she knows she has to recalibrate her goals. She worked from September to November as a foreign language specialist with the U.S. Army in Mississippi, working with soldiers before they deployed to Iraq. During tax season this year, she worked another temporary job, as an assistant office manager and tax preparer for the Tax Service of America Inc.. Yet to her dismay, she has been unable to find what she covets -- a full-time job. She has produced a resume, gone to job fairs, and applied for clerical and administrative full-time jobs at places like hotels. She mines the job sites on the Web every day, using a computer at the public library because she can't afford Internet or cable service at home. David Oliver, the IRC job developer who works with her, said ""the recession is a big factor"" in her predicament. She is competing with other Americans for jobs and, he said, ""I think employers prefer to take somebody whose work experience is recognizable."" Along with refugee cash assistance and food stamps, Ibrahim saved money from her part-time jobs, and her family in the Middle East is ready to help her as they did when she lived in Jordan. Living frugally, she has been able to pay $600 a month to rent her sparsely furnished apartment. She has a $60 a month phone bill and a fluctuating power bill that once reached $240 a month. There's $50 to $60 a week in food and then gas for her car. Ibrahim's money is running out, and she wonders whether she will be able to pay her next month's rent. Oliver says there's help, such as IRC emergency funds and local rent assistance, but Ibrahim yearns to support herself, to pay her own way. Her struggles disappoint Louis Culpepper, president and chief executive officer of Culpepper & Associates Security Services in Atlanta. Ibrahim worked for his firm in Baghdad, and Culpepper called her a ""real go-getter."" ""I really feel bad about it that someone who put her life on the line can't get a job,"" he said. Ibrahim exudes optimism and determination despite her frustrations. She reminds herself that she survived the war and is still living a dream in America. And she applied for a job not long ago. ""Keep your fingers crossed,"" she said.","More than 60,000 refugees were admitted to the U.S. in FY 2008 .

"PANAMA CITY, Panama (CNN)  -- Ricardo Martinelli, the multimillionaire owner of a supermarket chain, was inaugurated as president of Panama on Wednesday. Ricardo Martinelli is a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center-left party. National Assembly President Jose Luis Varela performed the swearing-in and placed the presidential sash on Martinelli, a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center-left party in May. The citizens of Panama ""want things to be done differently,"" Varela said at the inauguration. ""An attitude of change starts today."" In his first speech as president, Martinelli promised a smaller government budget but raises for public workers. Public safety, an issue that the outgoing administration of Martin Torrijos struggled to maintain, will be a priority, Martinelli said. ""Our prisons will be rehabilitation centers, not schools for criminals,"" he said. Panama will also work with Mexico and Colombia to combat drug trafficking in the region, Martinelli said. Among the dignitaries at the inauguration was deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a military-led coup Sunday. The Organization of American States has condemned the coup, and Zelaya has continued to carry out his presidential duties. The son of Italian immigrants, Martinelli, 57, is a self-made businessman who is chairman of the Super 99 supermarket chain, one of the largest private companies in Panama. The U.S.-educated president previously served as minister and chairman of the board of directors of the Panama Canal Authority and formerly was director of social security for Panama, according to his Web site. Martinelli won the presidency with 60 percent of the votes in a race against ruling-party candidate Balbina Herrera.","NEW: Deposed Honduran president attends ceremony .

"(CNN) -- Australia's reputation as the happy-go-lucky country was turned on its head in the late 1990s as the usually safe streets of the Victorian capital were transformed into a gangland war zone. Police investigate the scene where Des Tuppence Moran was killed in Melbourne in June 2009. Melbourne's ""underbelly"" of organized crime suddenly became public. Men hungry for easy money, power and control of the state's lucrative illegal amphetamines trade were prepared to do whatever it took to be the boss of the underworld. Violence erupted between two families -- the Morans and the Williams. Police say both had trafficked drugs in Melbourne for years and for a while had been associates. But as public demand for amphetamines grew, the rivalry increased with both camps desperate to secure the market. On one side was the Moran family -- brothers Jason and Mark, father Lewis and matriarch Judy Moran. The brothers were notorious for their short tempers and relied on violence to achieve what they wanted. On the other was Carl Williams and his crew. He began as a small-time drug dealer but would become Australia's most notorious serial killer.  Watch how a feud between two families has spawned a TV miniseries »  His lieutenant was Andrew ""Benji"" Veniamin -- a tattooed former kick boxer who would become Williams' main hit man -- but eventually became a victim of the gang wars himself. The feud began on October 13, 1999, on Carl Williams' 29th birthday. The Moran brothers accused Williams of undercutting them, by selling cheap pills on the street. They allegedly shot Williams in the stomach. But this didn't frighten him. Instead, Williams planned his revenge, sparking a public underworld war that would leave police, the legal system and politicians struggling to cope.   Eight months later, Mark Moran was gunned down outside his home while he put out the rubbish.   Then in 2003, in the most horrific of all the gangland murders, Jason Moran and his associate Pasquale Barboro were gunned down in the front seats of a van in the car park at a children's football game. Five children were sitting in the back seats. Witnesses described the shooting as disgusting and callous. At Jason's funeral, his mother made a graveside threat. Leaning over the coffin, Judy Moran said ""all will be dealt with my darling."" But it didn't end there. A year later, Judy's husband was murdered. Crime patriarch Lewis Moran, who was facing drug charges, was shot dead while drinking at his local pub. Victoria Police Commissioner Simon Overland said ""regardless of anyone's circumstance in life no one deserves to die in this fashion. It's outrageous this is happening in Melbourne.""  But it wasn't just the Moran family that was wiped out. Over the course of nine years, 30 people were killed in this high-profile turf war. Matriarch Judy Moran expressed her sorrow and loss: ""I've lost 3 members of my family, lots of close friends and I feel for their families as well."" Williams was now in control of Melbourne's illegal drug trade. He had amassed millions of dollars, power and a reputation -- and believed he was untouchable. He referred to himself as ""The Premier"" because, as he told the Australian newspaper The Age, ""I run this f---ing state."" But the law would finally catch up with Carl Williams. Victoria's Purana police task force had spent years investigating the drug kingpin and they finally had enough evidence to arrest Williams, charging him with multiple murders. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to four of them, including the murders of Mark and Lewis Moran. Police say Williams was connected to at least 10 underworld murders and would have kept killing if he had not finally been jailed. He is serving a more than 30-year prison sentence. The war inspired a smash hit television series in Australia called ""Underbelly."" However, when it was released at the beginning of last year, the 13 episode mini-series was banned from being shown in Melbourne because of the possible impact it would have on related criminal trials. It aired in Victoria once the trials were completed. Just when police thought the underworld killings were over, another member of the Moran family was shot dead in June. But in a surprising twist, this was not a gangland hit -- apparently the enemy was from within. Family matriarch Judy Moran was arrested as an accessory to the murder of her brother-in-law, Des Tuppence Moran. Police say she has had no comment about the charges. Police claim there was bad blood over money, but it marks the end of one of Australia's best-known criminal dynasties. ""Fact is almost stranger than fiction with what we've seen"" said Victoria Police Commissioner Overland. ""If you were a scriptwriter and sat down and wrote this stuff you'd probably say: 'Look, no, it's a bit far fetched. No one will believe it.'""","War erupts between two families -- the Morans, Williams -- over drug trade .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Barely six months after being crowned the winner of ""American Idol,"" David Cook has released his self-titled debut album. David Cook recently released his debut album, which includes songs about his family. The Missouri native (no relation to the author of this article) described the recording process as ""squeezing a year's worth of work on a record into 2½ months."" But he's very happy with the result. ""It's a very accurate definition of where I'm at, where I was and where I want to be,"" he said. Cook sticks to his rock roots on the release, eliciting help from ex-Soundgarden member Chris Cornell to write the lead single, ""Light On."" He also keeps loved ones close: The track ""Heroes"" is a tribute to his family. ""Permanent"" (which Cook describes as having a ""delicate and lullaby feel"") and ""A Daily AntheM"" (""sing-alongy and grandiose"") acknowledge his older brother, who is battling brain cancer. The latter song was written three years before Cook's ""Idol"" run, when he was cutting his teeth as a grass-roots rocker.  Watch David Cook show his chops » . Cook, 25, dropped by CNN's New York offices (with his mother, Beth Foraker, in tow) to talk about keeping creative control, losing his privacy and his responsibility as Idol No. 7. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: You were very involved in the making of your debut album, weren't you? David Cook: Yeah. Out of 12 songs on the record, I wrote or co-wrote 10, and the label was even kind enough to let me get involved with the art direction on the record. So it was a busy summer. CNN: You actually have a degree in graphic design, don't you? Cook: I spent five long years at the University of Central Missouri. It should've been four, but I enjoyed college a little bit more than I should have. CNN: There's skepticism that American Idols have very little control over the music they ultimately make. That wasn't the case for you? Cook: Well, I can't speak for anybody else except myself, and I guess in that sense, I lucked out. I mean, 19 [Entertainment] and RCA really [gave] me a little bit of carte blanche to allow me to make a record that is me. And to that end, I think we managed to pull something really cool off. CNN: What was your approach with the music? Cook: I tried to put music down on this record that [translated] live. I want these songs to make people feel things and invoke certain responses in an audience. And so it's a lot of very epic choruses and open bridges and stuff like that. Something that will give a show some room to meander and feel like a unique experience for everybody. CNN: [Lead single ""Light On""] debuted on the Billboard charts at No. 17, and then several weeks later -- about four -- it dropped to No. 80. Was that discouraging? Cook: No, not really. I think, for us, it's all about the long-term results. And I feel like the song seems to be getting speed now, especially with the record coming out. It just feels like everything's headed in the right direction, so I'm definitely not one to hang my head on immediate results. I'd rather the song hit No. 1 four months from now if it's gonna do it. I'm just excited to get this record out. I'm excited to have people hear it. CNN: When you were catapulted to fame, did you ever experience any self-doubt or feelings of insecurity? Cook: I'll be the first to admit there are [musicians] out there who are way better than me. I feel almost a responsibility to do everything that I can with this on their behalf as well as my own. But I've always been a confident person. I feel like I know why I'm here, I know what put me here. It's just a matter of trusting it and going with it. CNN: All this talk about you and [""American Idol"" runner-up] David Archuleta being mortal enemies is absolute garbage, isn't it? Cook: It is. David is one of the most unassuming, down-to-earth people I think I've ever met. It seems like he has no idea he was even on the show, let alone did well. And I find that really endearing. He'll be the first to congratulate you. He seems to just appreciate every moment . CNN: You seem to be a very private person. Has all this attention been a little intrusive? Cook: In a sense, yeah. It's a little strange to go from toiling in obscurity to having to worry about walking out of a restaurant and [seeing] who's going to shove a camera in your face and all that. But it comes with the territory, and if dealing with that on occasion allows me to make music that I want to make ... then, I'll take it.","David Cook became the seventh ""American Idol"" in the spring .

"(CNN)  -- A 6.7-magnitude earthquake hit near the Greek island of Crete on Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It struck at 12:30 p.m. (5:30 a.m. ET), the USGS said. It was centered about 80 miles (130 kilometers) off the city of Iraklion on Crete, the USGS said. An earthquake with a 6.7 magnitude is capable of causing significant damage, especially in areas of poor construction. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. A staff member at Iraklion Airport told CNN they didn't feel the earthquake. Similar reports came from staff members at hotels just outside Iraklion and in western Crete. A spokesman at the Greek Ministry of Health in Athens, 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the epicenter, also said he didn't feel the quake. David Booth, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, explained that the earthquake happened deep below the sea, leading to little risk of tsunami and reducing the likelihood that people would feel tremors. -- CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Krsna Harilela in London, England, contributed to this report.","A 6.7-magnitude earthquake hits near the Greek island of Crete .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Even in the midst of Japan's deepest economic recession since World War II, the country's love hotel industry is thriving. The Style A hotel in Tokyo offers amenities. ""I'd hate to use the term ""recession-proof,"" but it's certainly proven very resilient over the last six to nine months,"" said Steve Mansfield, CEO of New Perspectives, which operates six love, or ""leisure,"" hotels in Japan. One of them, the Bonita Hotel in Isawa, boasts a 257 percent occupancy rate. Rooms can be rented for three to 24 hours. Mansfield's company estimates the industry in Japan pulls in $40 billion a year in revenue. ""It's a natural human desire. Even these days, on the weekend, every love hotel is full of people -- it's hard to get in. You can never stop sexual desire,"" said a woman with her boyfriend in Tokyo, who laughed in embarrassment when asked for her name. Love hotels fill a need for privacy in a country where high population density often means couples have little time alone. Rooms offer a broad assortment of features, including karaoke machines, PlayStation game consoles, DVD players, a variety of cosmetics, customized condoms and indoor-outdoor Jacuzzis.  Watch Morgan Neill's report from inside a love hotel » . Though required by law to have a front desk, most can be rented and entered without talking to a clerk. The days of Japanese being ashamed to enter love hotels are coming to an end, though, Mansfield said. ""Seventy-five percent of our guests are members of our points program,"" he said. ""They carry our points cards, they collect points and they receive gifts. That's something people are very comfortable with, and I think that reflects the customers that we attract."" Takashi Yamamoto, who designs love hotels in Tokyo, agreed. ""The bad image that love hotels had has faded over time. Also, customers started to raise their voices and became more selective about choosing hotels. In response, management has improved."" The flashiest love hotels are found in Osaka, including a Hello Kitty-themed hotel and one with a room featuring a merry-go-round. Tokyo hotels tend to be tamer, focused on winning customers with amenities. The Style A Hotel, for example, offers a suite for $190 that includes a full-size Jacuzzi and a private sauna. Though young couples make up the majority of customers, they are not the only ones. One man, who declined to be named, said: ""I go to love hotels when I'm drunk and don't feel like going home."" Whatever the reasons, the hotels have been doing well enough that Mansfield recently went to London, seeking investors to expand. ""The industry has 25,000 hotels, and through our research we've worked out that 90 percent of owners have five or fewer hotels,"" he said. That fragmentation is a structural inefficiency in the market, he said, one he would like to help correct.","Industry has 25,000 hotels, says Steve Mansfield, CEO of a love hotel operator .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for a powerful sedative despite knowing its harmful effects, a nutritionist who worked with the singer said Tuesday. Cherilyn Lee is a holisitic health practitioner and has been in  healthcare for 23 years, her Web site states. Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse and nurse practitioner who first met Jackson in January to treat his children for a common cold, said she rejected his requests for Diprivan and informed him of the side effects. ""I told him this medication is not safe,"" Lee said. ""He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.' "" ""I told him -- and it is so painful that I actually felt it in my whole spirit -- 'If you take this you might not wake up.' "" According to the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, nurse practitioners ""provide high-quality healthcare services similar to those of a doctor."" They can also prescribe medications, according to the academy's Web site. CNN could not independently verify whether Lee worked with Jackson. When asked about Lee's account, Jackson family attorney Londell McMillan said: . ""I wonder why someone would make a comment about drugs when they haven't seen him take the drug or anyone who administered it."" The drug, known by its generic name Propofol, is administered intravenously as an anesthetic during surgeries.  Watch nurse describe Jackson's drug request » . An initial dose puts a person to sleep. An overdose can lead to cardiac arrest, doctors say. Jackson died June 25 at the age of 50. Authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine what killed him. Lee is licensed as a registered nurse, according to the California Board of Registered Nursing Web site. According to her Web site, she is a proponent of alternative medicine that uses a holistic approach. Lee said that four days before Jackson's death, she received a call from a Jackson staff member who said the singer felt that one side of his body was cold; the other hot. ""I could hear Mr. Jackson saying in the background, 'Please have her come see me now. Can she come now?' "" Lee, who was in Florida at the time, said she told Jackson's staffers to take him to a hospital. ""I was really afraid because of the symptoms they were telling me,"" she said. ""It could have meant something going on in the nervous system or something cardiovascular."" After his death, Lee said she didn't go to the authorities. ""When I saw it on the news, I really didn't know what to do,"" she said. ""I was saddened. I heard there was a physician there."" Lee also could not say why Jackson would call on her, when the last time she saw him was three months ago. ""The only think I can think of is he recalled the symptoms I was telling him,"" she said. But, she added, she didn't know of any doctors who would have given him the drug. ""I asked him, 'What doctor gave you this drug?' "" she said, when the singer initially brought up the medicine. ""He told me, 'Oh it was a long time ago.' "" Dr. Rakesh Marwah of the anesthesiology department at the Stanford University School of Medicine said Propofol can lead to cardiac arrest, which is suspected in Jackson's death.

"(CNN)  -- What's a July Fourth celebration without fireworks? Many cities across the United States will find out Saturday. Milwaukee holds its lakefront show on July 3, so as not to compete with surrounding communities. As municipalities grope for ways to shore up budgets, expensive pyrotechnics displays are becoming the latest victims of the economic downturn. ""They need to have things in the community like that to keep things going. So I'm sad to see it going,"" said Seth Stolz, of Flint, Michigan, which will go without its traditional July Fourth explosions in the sky this year, according to CNN affiliate WJRT. He was accustomed to watching the show from his home. The Greater Flint Arts Council puts on the show every year, and when the city and county said they couldn't afford the $40,000 for the Flint Fireworks Festival, it was canceled last month. Private donors tried to save it, but the mayor expressed concerns that safety measures might be overlooked if the event was hastily organized, WJRT reported.  Watch how town brings bikinis into the mix » . ""Yeah, a very hard decision to make,"" Greg Fiedler with the arts council, told the station. In Florida, Miami-Dade County canceled one of its two shows to save about $40,000, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. The Monterey, California, City Council in April also nixed its show and accompanying lawn party to save about $150,000 . ""Although the 4th of July festivities are a very popular community-wide event, we cannot recommend continuation of this costly one-day event during a fiscal downturn,"" a city staff report said. In Illinois, CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported that Harvey, Berwyn, Elgin, Gurnee and North Riverside had canceled their shows. Blue Springs, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City, also 86'ed the pyrotechnics to give the city ""some immediate budget relief,"" city officials told CNN affiliate KCTV. The American Pyrotechnics Association says that despite the economic challenges, fireworks display companies are working with their clients to make sure the shows go on. Communities are also finding alternative funding or cutting back to make sure the sky rockets light up their July Fourth sky. The nation hosts about 14,000 fireworks shows each Independence Day, according to the association, and the majority of shows will prevail because communities ""realize the importance of continuing this annual tradition of providing their citizens with free entertainment to celebrate our freedom and independence,"" Julie Heckman, the group's director, said in a statement. ""The industry has been tested time after time and each challenge unites the industry, makes it stronger, and ensures that communities do not go dark on Independence Day,"" Heckman said. iReport.com: How are you celebrating the Fourth of July? The Illinois towns of Elmhurst and Wooddale couldn't foot their own shows, so they chipped in funds for the show in nearby Bensenville, WLS reported. Evanston, Illinois, had to shorten its show, and North Aurora forewent its own show in favor of bolstering the celebration in neighboring Aurora, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Tucson, Arizona, canceled it's $55,000 fireworks display to save money, but CNN affiliate KGUN reported Friday that private donors stepped in to save the celebration. Joliet, Illinois, almost canceled its 63rd annual skyrocket display because businesses weren't able to send their customary donations. The show had a $23,000 price tag, but local businesses could muster only about $14,000, according to WGN. City residents were not content to go without fireworks Saturday. ""It's a tradition in Joliet. It's an American tradition. You can't give up on that,"" said Robert Svarz, who has been attending fireworks shows in Joliet for 50 years, according to WLS. Residents scraped together the remaining $9,000 to make sure the city staged its show, which draws thousands to Joliet Memorial Stadium and the surrounding parking lots each year. ""Not only did they send in contributions, but they all sent notes on how important it was to keep this thing alive,"" Russ Slinkard, CEO of the Joliet Region Chamber of Commerce, told WLS. Despite Chicago's budget crisis, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office told WGN that there will be no cutbacks to the Windy City's fireworks display. Fireworks also will be part of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's, celebration, as U.S. Bank has sponsored the hourlong, lakefront show for the past few years. The city holds its show the day before Independence Day to not compete with surrounding communities' shows. Middletown, Connecticut, also held its celebration early, on Thursday -- but for a different reason. Holding the celebration on Saturday would have meant $20,000 in overtime pay for city workers, on top of the $65,000 bill for the actual show, Mayor Sebastian Giuliano told CNN affiliate WTNH-TV. Rescheduling the celebration had an added bonus: Businesses that usually close for the holiday were able to cater to the crowd of about 15,000. At least one community had no problem finding the funds for this year's festivities. In fact, Olive Branch, Mississippi, more than tripled its budget, according to CNN affiliate WPTY-TV. The town seemed split over the move. While one resident said it would be ""unfair"" to deprive the town of the show, another said upping the fireworks budget from $10,000 to $35,000 seems irresponsible, WPTY reported. So, what about people who don't live in towns like Olive Branch? What are their options when their fireworks shows are canceled? Well, they can always enjoy a show in another town, or -- as Blue Springs Mayor Carson Ross suggested to KCTV -- put on their own show.  Watch the safeguards you should take » . Blue Springs is one of the few western Missouri towns that allows residents to shoot their own fireworks, and indeed, the American Pyrotechnics Association reported last month that the popularity of backyard fireworks had more than doubled since 2000. However, those who aren't mindful of the laws in their city could find the economic downturn taking an even greater toll. Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan told CNN affiliate WTMJ-TV that the city is serious about stopping backyard fireworks. Because no one respected the ban last year, the city is ""going to hit them in the pocketbook,"" he said. The fine for each citation? $676.","The nation hosts about 14,000 fireworks shows each Independence Day .

"(CNN) -- Amid all the talk about storm clouds gathering over the U.S. economy, it's easy to forget there are other places in the world where the sun is still shining. A shortage of housing is contributing to an inflation rate of almost 14 percent in Qatar . Take Qatar, for example; a small emirate in the Gulf whose economy is booming. When the final figures come in, Qatar's economy is expected to have grown 17.8 percent in 2007. Qatar National Bank predicts growth to slow in 2008, but at 16.5 percent who could complain? Well, consumers for one. While growth has steamed ahead, so has inflation. At the end of 2007, Qatar's official inflation rate was nearing 14 percent -- the highest in the region. Three major factors are contributing to Qatar's soaring inflation rate: High levels of government spending; growing demand for housing, which is pushing up house prices and rent, and the riyal's peg with the dollar, which is pushing down interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve exacerbated the latter problem by slashing U.S. interest rates twice in the past eight days to three percent. Gulf States with currencies linked to the U.S. dollar were under pressure to follow suit. Qatar reduced its deposit rate to 3.5 percent, but left its lending rate at 5.5 percent. Liz Martins, Head of MENA, Business Monitor International says Qatar is facing a serious problem. ""You've huge a amount of monetary easing and if you think that that's not even going to feed through properly for six to nine months then, you've got a really dangerous inflationary outlook,"" she says. ""The only policy option really that they have is to revalue the exchange rate."" Kuwait did just that in May, ditching the dollar-peg for a basket of currencies, and speculation is growing that other GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries will do the same. Tristan Cooper, Vice President and Senior Analyst at Moody's Middle East, says the argument for revaluation is becoming more convincing. ""The economic justification for revaluation is growing stronger as inflation multiplies and the government increases expenditure."" He says any move by Gulf governments to curb public spending would not be welcomed by locals facing higher living costs. In Qatar's instance, new housing stock is expected to come onto the market to help ease inflation in the rental market. ""There is some hope that prices will begin to slow as that supply comes onto the market, but that's not guaranteed,"" Tristan Cooper says. So that leaves a currency revaluation. ""The easier policy option would presumably be to revalue, but that also has political difficulties. It involves to some extent coordinating with GCC members."" In the past, Saudi Arabia has ruled out any change to its dollar-peg. Qatar has made it clear that it prefers any move to be made with a GCC consensus. In an interview with Marketplace Middle East, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani said that the emirate is ""studying all options"" in relation to the dollar-peg. ""Every country has to see its way out of this, but only after a consultation with the GCC,"" he said. ""For us, our wish is that it's a policy to be taken by the whole GCC, to either basket or revalue our currency. I cannot see a decision. Even in Qatar, we have no decision up to now."" This week, one of Qatar's leading economic advisors was quoted as saying any policy change would have to be substantial. In an interview with Reuters news agency, Ibrahim Al-Ibrahim said, ""change should be major; minor change won't solve the problem."" He ruled out any potential moves to float the Qatari riyal. ""As a small country we cannot float our currency... it has to be tied,"" he said. One of the main reasons GCC members are reluctant to abandon their dollar link is because they're working towards their own monetary union. A policy diversion now may make it more difficult to unite again under a common currency by the nominated deadline of 2010. There's widespread skepticism that that deadline can be reached. ""The timeframe of 2010 is rather unlikely now, and the project itself seems to be facing increasing difficulties given the pressure on individual states to go their own way and revalue,"" Tristan Cooper says.

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN) -- The head of the Organization of American States said Friday he has found no willingness among leaders of Honduras' interim government to return President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power. OAS Secretary General Jose Insulza doubts Honduras' new leaders will restore ousted President Jose Zelaya. ""They have, for the moment, no intention of reversing the situation,"" Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza told reporters. He said he had reached that conclusion after speaking Friday with members of the Supreme Court, among others. Insulza also rejected assertions by the interim government that the change in leadership was not really a coup d'etat. ""I don't know what else you would call it when a group of military take a president out of power and sends him to another country,"" he said. At the end of Insulza's comments, Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Lorena Alvarado said Honduras is willing to withdraw from the OAS. ""If the Organization of American States doesn't deem Honduras worthy of membership of the Organization of American States, then Honduras would renounce, with immediate effect, the inter-American charter."" Vice Chancellor Martha Lorena de Casco also said Honduras was ready to leave the OAS, which she called a political organization rather than a tribunal of justice. ""Honduras will defend its sovereignty,"" she said in a televised response. Zelaya was ousted in a military-led coup Sunday and sent to Costa Rica in his pajamas. The same day, the Honduran Congress voted to install Roberto Micheletti as interim president. That sparked international condemnation, with the OAS on Tuesday passing a resolution calling for Zelaya's reinstatement by Saturday and threatening to suspend Honduras from the group. Zelaya has said he will return this weekend with presidents of other OAS member countries, despite Micheletti's vow to have him arrested for violating the country's constitution if he does so. On Friday, thousands of people assembled in front of the presidential residence in Tegucigalpa, where Micheletti praised the armed forces for their efforts and offered a different version of events. ""We must tell the world that there was no coup d'etat here,"" he said, his voice hoarse. ""It wasn't a coup! It wasn't a coup!"" He promised that the nation would revert to a democracy, but did not say when. ""Here, in front of Honduras and the entire world, I guarantee we will have free elections, as soon as we decide when,"" he said. Micheletti has promised not to run in elections slated for November. ""You may choose any candidate from any party,"" he told the crowd. ""I want to tell you that I am governing for all political parties. I am governing for the poor, for the businessmen, for the rich, for the children and for all the people of Honduras."" Though the two sides appeared far apart, a compromise might be possible, said Jennifer McCoy, an Americas expert at the Atlanta, Georgia-based Carter Center. ""The options are that neither side backs down and that President Zelaya shows up tomorrow and the police are there waiting to arrest him."" If Zelaya returns accompanied by international figures, the result would be ""awkward,"" she said. McCoy added there could be ""some kind of compromise, including mutual guarantees."" One such scenario -- Zelaya's promise not to pursue legal action against the coup plotters in exchange for their agreement to step aside and not to pursue his Cabinet ministers who are in hiding. McCoy praised U.S. President Obama for supporting Zelaya without qualification. ""By taking the principled stand for democracy that he took in this case in favor of a government that is an ally of Venezuela, he did not let politics intervene. This is a change from the previous administration,"" she said. McCoy was referring to the tacit U.S. approval that was given to the coup that in 2002 briefly toppled leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has been a consistent U.S. critic. ""It helps to recuperate the pro-democracy credential of the United States in this hemisphere,"" she said. Meanwhile, Amnesty International accused the new government Friday of intimidating media workers. ""Recent reports suggest that journalists who have published news stories on the crisis or covering the issue of protests and scores of detentions have been intimidated,"" it said. ""Prosecutors have also reported threats on account of their attempts to verify human rights abuses during protests."" At the center of the dispute was a referendum that Zelaya had vowed to carry out last Sunday even after the country's supreme court and congress declared it would be illegal. The nonbinding referendum could have opened the door to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country's charter. Opponents accused Zelaya of having sought to rewrite the constitution to allow him to run for re-election. Zelaya denied that was his intent. However, international support for the new government has been virtually nonexistent. On Thursday, the European Union announced that all its ambassadors had left Honduras. Also Thursday, the U.S. State Department said it was suspending some aid programs to the country. Earlier, the U.S. military, which has trained Honduran forces for years, postponed some planned exercises with the Honduran military until the situation in the country settles down. Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo. After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule, Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981. Since then, the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people, about 70 percent of whom live in poverty. Military interventions were once common in Latin America, but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s. Before Sunday, the only other barracks revolt this decade was the unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The ongoing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq ""shows that the (Iraqi) government and the occupation are not serious about the withdrawal,"" a key Shiite cleric in the country said Wednesday. A crowd gathers Tuesday after a deadly bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Muqtada al-Sadr made the statement on his Web site a day after U.S. forces withdrew from Iraqi cities and towns in accordance with the security agreement between the United States and Iraq. About 131,000 American troops remain in the country, on bases and in outposts outside of population centers. ""The withdrawal should include all the occupation forces: army, intelligence, militias, and security companies and others. Otherwise, the withdrawal will be uncompleted and useless,"" al-Sadr said. ""We want a withdrawal and stopping the interference with Iraqi political, social and economic affairs,"" the statement said. Al-Sadr commands the loyalty of the Mehdi Army, one of the largest independent militias in the country. His agreement to a cease-fire with the government and its allies is considered a key factor in reducing the level of violence in the country. But he seemed to suggest Wednesday that Iraqis had the right to attack foreign forces in the country -- if not Iraqi security forces. ""If the occupation forces violate this claimed withdrawal, even with a government cover, then the people of Iraq will have all the right to express their opinion in a peaceful way, and the right to self-defense on condition of not harming the Iraqi people and the security forces,"" he said. Under an agreement signed in the waning days of the Bush administration, all U.S. forces will be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Most will be gone by August 2010 under the withdrawal plan laid out by President Barack Obama, Bush's successor. The U.S. troops who remain are now tasked with supporting Iraqi troops and police, and must seek Iraqi permission to launch operations in the cities. the top U.S. general in the country said Tuesday that much of the country was safe. ""There is not widespread violence in Iraq,"" Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a video conference from Baghdad. ""There's still gonna be bumps in the road. There's still gonna be violence here,"" he added. Meanwhile, the death toll from a huge blast in northern Iraq rose to 35, local security officials said Wednesday. The car bombing took place in a busy commercial district in a predominantly Kurdish area of Kirkuk early Tuesday evening when the neighborhood was busy, security sources said. About 17 shops and houses were destroyed and 95 people were wounded, a police official in the Iraqi city added. Kirkuk is about 378 kilometers (235 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- It's a nightmarish scenario straight out of the movies: A passenger is forced to land a plane after its pilot becomes incapacitated. Passanger Doug White landed this Super King two-engine turboprop after the pilot fell unconscious. ""Descend and maintain 5,000. Just take your time, we'll set you up for the airport,"" an air traffic controller says. In a calm voice, a passenger responds: ""I need to get my throttle set for this descent. I don't know where to set it at."" The reality was playing aboard a plane over Florida on Sunday in what the National Air Traffic Controllers Association called ""an Easter miracle."" The incident began about 1:30 p.m. The plane, a Super King Air two-engine turboprop with four passengers on board, was headed to Jackson, Mississippi, from Marco Island, Florida, about 18 miles south of Naples. The plane entered the jurisdiction of air traffic control at Miami Center, the facility responsible for high-altitude air traffic in southern Florida and the Caribbean, according to a statement issued by the air traffic controllers association. The pilot notified controllers that the plane was at 9,000 feet and climbing, said Steve Wallace, Miami Center spokesman for the association. However, a controller at the center tried twice to raise the pilot after that and received no response, Wallace said.  Hear audiotape of emergency landing » . After a few moments, a different voice came over the radio: Passenger Doug White told air traffic controllers the pilot was unconscious and they needed help. His wife and two teenage daughters were flying home to Louisiana with him, he said.  Listen to White describe seeing the pilot's eyes roll back in his head » . He reported the plane's autopilot was on and the plane was continuing to climb from 10,000 feet. ""I told my girls to pray hard,"" White later told CNN television affiliate WINK. White later told the Naples Daily News he has a pilot's license and about 130 hours experience flying a single engine Cessna, but had never flown the larger, faster King Air. The difference, experts said, is not as simple as driving a different model of car. A turboprop multi-engine, Wallace told CNN, ""probably lands at a faster speed than he's ever flown a single-engine plane before."" White told air traffic controllers it appeared the pilot had died, according to the statement, and he reported that the plane's autopilot was on and the plane was continuing to climb from 10,000 feet. Two air traffic controllers worked to help him disengage the autopilot, as other controllers stepped in to lighten their workload. ""Keep it coming around when you can ... the turn looks good, very good sir,"" a controller said. The controllers then turned the plane over to air traffic controllers at the airport. One of them had called a friend who was certified in the King Air planes for advice. ""They walked him through flipping the switches, turning the knobs,"" Wallace said. White, who was composed for the most part, seemed doubtful for a brief moment. ""When I touch down ... If I ever touch down, do I just kill the throttle or what?"" he asks. The landing was successful. ""I knew we had to do something ... I knew that much,"" White told WINK. The Federal Aviation Administration has not given any of the involved air traffic controllers permission to speak about the incident, Wallace said. However, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association lauded all of those involved in landing the plane. ""If you were to ask any one of the controllers who worked this even about what happened over the skies of south Florida, they would tell you that it was just a typical day at the office and that it was merely their job,"" association President Patrick Forrey said in the statement. ""However, the actions they all took to save the passengers aboard the flight were beyond heroic."" Victoria Moreland, spokeswoman for Southwest Florida International Airport, said the pilot's death was confirmed after the plane landed. The cause of death was unclear, Moreland said. It's rare for a pilot to suffer a medical emergency during flight, said Chris Dancy, spokesman for the Frederick, Maryland-based Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. The organization issues a yearly summary of accident trends and factors based on National Transportation Safety Board reports involving aircraft of less than 12,500 pounds -- smaller than the King Air involved in Sunday's incident. According to the most recent report, which covers the year 2007, out of 22 million general aviation flight hours, an estimated 15 million to 20 million flights, only six instances of a pilot's medical incapacitation were reported, he said. In four of those instances, the pilot died. CNN's Ashley Broughton contributed to this report.","Passenger Doug White commandeers plane after pilot loses consciousness .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday that more Africans have fled poverty and conflict on the continent during the first 10 months of this year than in all of 2007. A woman who has been displaced by the current fighting in the Congo. The bulk of the more than 96,000 African refugees headed to Yemen and Italy, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office. The rest sought refuge in Malta, Greece, Spain and the Canary Islands, the agency said. Last weekend, at least 60 refugees died en route to Yemen, a frequent destination for Somali and Ethiopian refugees, according to Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF. UNHCR said most of those who died were forced overboard in deep water off Yemen's coast by smugglers who demanded more money than the $100 they paid for the journey. ""Those who did not or could not pay extra were severely beaten by the smugglers,"" UNHCR said in a news release Tuesday. ""Up to 40 -- mainly Ethiopians -- [were] thrown overboard despite their pleas for mercy."" Andreas Koutepas, MSF's field coordinator in southern Yemen, said such a high number of refugee deaths in a short period of time ""is not usual at all."" ""For the whole of September until now, we've had 27 dead and now suddenly we reach this number,"" Koutepas told CNN from MSF's base in Ahwar, Yemen. ""We are quite shocked here."" About 30,000 African refugees arrived on boats on Italy's shores during the first 10 months of this year compared with 19,900 refugees last year, according to UNHCR. In Malta, an estimated 2,600 boat people arrived in the first nine months of this year from North Africa, compared with 1,800 last year, UNHCR said.. The agency said that from January to October this year, 509 of those attempting to make the journey to Italy and Malta died, compared with last year's death toll of 471. More than 38,000 people have made the perilous journey across the Gulf of Aden from Somalia to Yemen during the first 10 months of this year, a ""considerable increase from the 29,500 who made the same journey during the whole of last year,"" UNHCR said Tuesday. However, the death toll on that route has remained lower so far this year: more than 600 have died or disappeared en route to Yemen compared to 1,400 killed last year. In late September, at least 52 Somalis died when the boat smuggling them across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen broke down, and they were left adrift with no food or water for 18 days, according to the U.N. Many are fleeing the war in Somalia, but Koutepas of MSF told CNN on Monday that he has noticed a recent increase in the number of refugees from Ethiopia. ""It used to be 10 percent of total arrival, and now it's around 50-50,"" he said. Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity. It is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes, including some based out of Djibouti -- which lies north of Somalia and is much closer to Yemen -- have also led to the increase in refugees, according to the UNHCR. But according to the Yemen Post, Yemen is just a stopping point for most of the refugees, who then travel on to the wealthier Persian Gulf states or Europe and the United States. Earlier this year, Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline in an attempt to deter the smugglers. Some of the smuggling boats seized by Yemen's coast guard are given to Somali fishermen who suffered losses in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. As part of a $19 million operation, UNHCR operates shelters and reception centers for the refugees in Yemen and has increased its efforts to discourage people from making the illegal crossing to Yemen. It has also sponsored training programs for coast guard personnel and other officials. MSF said the plight of the refugees has been overshadowed by the dozens of pirate attacks off Somalia's coast that have grabbed international headlines in recent months. ""A lot of attention has been paid lately to tackling the issue of piracy in the waters off the Horn of Africa,"" said MSF Yemen mission leader Francis Coteur. ""Unfortunately, little attention is paid to the drama of the refugees crossing the same waters in horrific conditions. Much more needs to be done to address this issue.""","More Africans have already fled poverty and conflict so far this year than in 2007 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Reigning hot dog-guzzling champ Joey Chestnut and nemesis Takeru Kobayashi of Japan attempted to psych each other out Thursday at the weigh-in for the 94th annual Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog-Eating Contest. Competitive eaters Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi take part in an official ""staredown."" Chestnut and Kobayashi glared long and menacingly into each other's eyes in an official ""staredown."" At last year's contest, 25-year-old Chestnut, a civil engineering student at San Jose State University, eked out a win over Kobayashi, 31, in a tiebreaker after both initially consumed 59 dogs apiece. It was Chestnut's second slim victory over Kobayashi in as many years. Kobayashi vowed he will avenge those two defeats on Saturday. He also said he no longer suffers from the ""jawthritis"" that some cited as the culprit for his 2007 defeat, which snapped his six-year winning streak at Coney Island. Chestnut, for his part, said he had no intention of ceding the coveted mustard yellow belt -- competitive eating's answer to golf's green jacket. He is setting his sights this year on 68 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Saturday's competition will be partially about redemption for Chestnut, too. In May, he suffered a stinging defeat to Kobayashi in a loss he said ""really set a fire underneath me"" and ""made me hungry for this contest."" Chestnut revealed the extreme dietary regimen he is following in the days leading up to the contest. He said he is sticking to water to make sure he is ""empty"" when the mountain of hot dogs is placed in front of him. In addition to Chestnut, Kobayashi admitted to keeping a watchful eye on 32-year-old Tim ""Eater X"" Janus, whose signature painted face was described by Major League Eating impresario Richard Shea as an attempt to mask his ""inner torment."" In a recent trial round, Janus downed a personal-best 55 hot dogs -- a weiner's throw from the 59 that Chestnut and Kobayashi wolfed down last year. As a lead-in to the main event, Major League Eating on Friday will hold a first-of-its-kind ""cross-species"" eating contest between three competitive eaters and three Asian elephants. MLE's Shea described it as the realization of one of his two lifelong dreams, the other being a scenario in which a dozen competitive eaters eat the entire contents of a convenience store. Twenty finalists will compete in the championship on Saturday. They were culled from 18 preliminary contests and comprise a Who's Who of the world of competitive eating. For people who stuff their faces with record-breaking quantities of food, many of the contestants at the weigh-in boasted surprisingly svelte physiques. Juliet Lee, a 44-year-old Maryland salon owner fresh off the feat of downing 13.23 pounds of cranberry sauce in 8 minutes, clocked in at a mere 105 pounds. Kobayashi, at 123 pounds, lifted his T-shirt to reveal the sort of chiseled abdomen one would expect at a bodybuilding competition. Others contestants were not quite as disconcertingly trim. Fearsome world matzo ball-eating champion Eric ""Badlands"" Booker tips the scales at 400 pounds.","Reigning hot dog-guzzling champ Joey Chestnut, Takeru Kobayashi have staredown .

"INDIO, California (CNN) -- For some concertgoers, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival really kicked into action on Day Two. Festival attendees enjoy the music Saturday, Day Two of the Coachella music festival in Indio, California. Day One was leisurely and pleasant -- the weather was mild, the acts were fairly mellow and the big headliner was Paul McCartney. On Day Two, someone took the dial and turned it up a notch, as the desert sun beat down a little harder, the music pumped a little louder and the crowds who packed the VIP tent threw a little more attitude. There were the usual celebrity sightings. Jake Gyllenhaal and Reese Witherspoon snuck in the back just as rapper M.I.A. hit the stage, Paris Hilton took in Travis Barker and DJ AM's set in the Sahara tent and David Hasselhoff was spotted making out with a mystery lady near the restrooms. Forty-six acts performed on five stages scattered about the grassy field of the Empire Polo Club near Palm Springs, California. Massive eco-friendly art installations fashioned from scrap metal and reclaimed wood doubled as shelter from the heat, as well as mini-stages for dancers and performance artists. There was good buzz for thenewno2, an indie-pop band fronted by Oli Hecks and Dhani Harrison, whose vocals are reminiscent of his late father, George, but warmer, and less haunting. ""It's the first festival we've ever played, and our 12th gig overall,"" said Harrison. ""Normally with festivals, people come to check you out, stand in the back, and then move on pretty quickly, even if they like you -- but people stayed! It's the best performance we've ever had."" Unfortunately Fleet Foxes was not so lucky. The Seattle,Washington, group's delicate baroque harmonies were drowned out by the world music beats of Thievery Corporation's percussion section bleeding over from the neighboring main stage, as one of their female vocalists crowd-surfed. As usual, the day's line-up was a mix of up-and-coming indie artists sprinkled with tried-and-true veteran acts. The Killers have played Coachella in both capacities. The Las Vegas, Nevada, quartet received their first invitation from festival organizers in 2004, the same year their debut album, ""Hot Fuss,"" was released. ""We played at 11:30 a.m. in a tent. It was 150 degrees out, and backstage, it smelled like horse droppings,"" said drummer Ronnie Vannucci, referencing the fact that there are certain consequences to holding an event on a polo field in the desert. This time, as the marquee act, The Killers enjoyed their own backstage compound decked out with a white picket fence, tablecloths and festive party lights in the shape of daisies. Palm trees gently swayed in the distance, silhouetted against the desert backdrop. You could hear the crowd going crazy for a feisty M.I.A. slotted on the main stage before The Killers. Vannucci and his three bandmates had just rolled in on their tour bus from Vegas. He spoke with CNN while warming up his hands and wrists with drumming exercises. ""With festivals, you have to realize the audience is not necessarily there to see YOU. So we'll play some stuff off our new album, 'Day and Age,' and work in some songs that everybody knows, like 'Mr. Brightside' from our first album."" Half an hour later, The Killers took the stage, opening their set with their latest hit, ""Human."" Frontman Brandon Flowers soon had the crowd singing the along to the perplexing lyrics, ""Are we human, or are we dancer?"" At Coachella, it doesn't matter if you're human or if you're dancer. But if you're dancer, you'll probably be relegated to one of the mini-stages inside an art installation. ""The first time I heard about Coachella 10 years ago, I thought, 'That could be the cool festival here in America,"" said Vannucci. ""It's since become a successful festival with good bands, swarms of people coming in from all over the world -- even art elements. It's strange to think we're headlining one night.""","46 acts perform on 5 stages at Empire Polo Club near Palm Springs, California .

"(CNN) -- Bringing a growing health concern to Congress, scientists squared off Thursday over whether cell phones contribute to brain cancer. Rep. Denis Kucinich of Ohio holds a model of a 5-year-old child's brain absorbing cell phone radiation. Studies have indicated that long-term cell phone use may be associated with brain cancer, according to Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and Dr. David Carpenter, director of Institute for Health and the Environment at University of Albany. They both testified in front of the House Subcommittee on Domestic Policy. ""I cannot tell this committee that cell phones are definitely dangerous. But, I certainly cannot tell you that they are safe,"" Herberman said. Herberman and Carpenter cited the results from a study recently presented by Dr. Lennart Hardell of Örebro University in Sweden. The results indicated that people who use cell phones have double the chance of developing malignant brain tumors and acoustic neuromas, which are tumors on the hearing nerve. The study also said people under age 20 were more than five times as likely to develop brain cancer. But Dr. Robert Hoover, director or Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program at the National Cancer Institute, said the study has not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, so has not come under sufficient scrutiny. The evidence for the connection between cell phones and cancer is inconclusive and more research is needed, he said. ""Larger studies are needed to sort out chance and bias,"" Hoover testified. Interphone, a series of multinational studies on the risk of cancer from cell phones, has not found an increase in tumors associated with the first 10 years of mobile phone use, he said. Some findings show an increased risk of tumors diagnosed on the side of the head that the cell phone is pressed against, but this pattern has not been seen consistently, Hoover said. CTIA, the International Association for Wireless Telecommunications, declined the invitation to testify, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a former Democratic presidential candidate from Ohio, who led the hearing, said. Steve Largent, CEO of CTIA, issued a statement Wednesday saying the industry has supported scientific research on these issues and supports the Federal Communications Commision's safety guidelines. ""The available scientific evidence and expert reviews from leading global health organizations such as the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization reflect a consensus based on published scientific research showing that there is no reason for concern,"" Largent's statement said. The overall evidence for the cancer-phone link has not been statistically significant at a 95 percent confidence level, a standard in science, Carpenter said. But he also noted that U.S.-funded research is very scarce. ""Are we at the same place we were with smoking and lung cancer 30 years ago?"" he asked. Carpenter and Herberman testified that the risk of brain cancer for children is far greater than for adults. Herberman demonstrated a model showing that the radiation from cell phones would penetrate far deeper into a 5-year-old's brain than an adult's.  See models from researchers at the University of Pittsburgh » . But the incidence of brain cancer in children has not increased significantly from the late 1980s to 2005, Hoover said. The Federal Communications Commission limits cell phone radio frequency energy emissions, called the specific absorption rate (SAR), at 1.6 watts per kilogram, as measured over one gram of tissue. The standard was developed in 1997 in consultation with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a professional association open to everyone, including manufacturers and health specialists. But the SAR standard reflects a biological response to cell phone radio frequency energy heating tissue, Kucinich said. Many experiments show that radio frequency energy does cause ""biological effects"" without heating tissue, although not all of those effects are harmful, Carpenter said. Hoover agreed that there could be such effects related to cancer risk, but they have not been properly vetted in a laboratory. The FCC itself does not have the expertise to evaluate whether this standard is appropriate protection for possible heath risks, Julius Knapp, director of the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology, testified. The hearing took place just a week after the Cleveland Clinic reported a study showing that keeping a cell phone on talk mode in a pocket can decrease sperm quality. Herberman had issued a warning to physicians, scientists, and staff at the University of Pittsburgh in July advising them to limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer. The Israeli Health Ministry endorsed this recommendation within a week, he said. Ellen Marks of Lafayette, California, whose husband found out he had a brain tumor on his right frontal lobe in May, attended the hearing. The tumor is on the same side of his head where he held his cell phone, which he used about 30 hours per month. She believes the tumor is the result of cell phone use. ""I often threatened to throw it in the garbage, and how I wish I had,"" she said. ""This horror could have been avoided with a simple warning.""","Studies conflict; do not consistently show cell phones cause cancer, expert says .

"(Mental Floss) -- Have you ever wondered about the origins and namesakes of our favorite spreads, sauces, and dressings? Here are a few stories that you can use to regale your friends the next time you chow down. Peppers were imported from the Mexican state of Tabasco to make spicy Tabasco sauce, giving the condiment its name. 1. Thousand Island Dressing . Is the delicious dressing that gives a Reuben its tanginess named after an actual chain of islands? You bet it is. The Thousand Islands are an archipelago that sits in the Saint Lawrence River on the U.S.-Canada border, and there are actually 1,793 of them, some of which are so small that they contain nothing more than a single home. So why is the dressing named after an archipelago? No one's quite sure. Some people claim that early film star and vaudevillian May Irwin, who summered on the Thousand Islands, named it, while others contend that George Boldt, the famed proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, gave the dressing its name because of his own summer place in the region. No matter who named it, it's tough to beat on a sandwich. 2. Ranch Dressing . Yep, the beloved dressing and dipping sauce actually got its start on a real ranch. When Steve and Gayle Henson opened a dude ranch in California in 1954, they had an ace up their sleeves: a delicious dressing that Steve had concocted while the couple was living in Alaska. The couple did a nice business at their Hidden Valley Ranch, but guests were always flipping out over just how tasty Steve's dressing was. Eventually, the Hensons started bottling the stuff, and the popularity grew so quickly that they had to hire a twelve-man crew just to help mix up each batch. Steve's culinary creativity turned out to be lucrative; in 1972 Clorox forked over $8 million for the recipe. Mental Floss: Foods named after people . 3. A1 Steak Sauce . According to the brand's Web site, A1 has been around for quite a while. Henderson William Brand worked as the personal chef for King George IV from 1824 to 1831, and at some point during this employment mixed up a new sauce for the king to use on his beef. George IV allegedly took one bite of Brand's creation and declared that it was ""A1."" Brand then left the king's employ in order to go peddle his new sauce. 4. Tabasco Sauce . Tabasco sauce is perhaps the most famous of all hot sauces, but where did it get its name? When Edmund McIlhenny, a former banker, invented the sauce in Louisiana in 1868, he didn't have a huge supply of chili peppers at his disposal. To keep cooking, he imported peppers from the Mexican state of Tabasco and slapped the region's name on his bottles. Mental Floss: The origins of salt, pepper and other popular spices . 5. Heinz 57 . Legend has it that Heinz 57 takes its name from H.J. Heinz's company formerly marketing 57 products at once, and except for the number, the story holds up. Heinz's Web site tells a story that Henry John Heinz was riding a train when he saw a billboard advertising 21 varieties of shoes. He so liked the idea he wanted to try it with his own condiment company. Thus, he started touting Heinz's 57 varieties. There was only one catch: Heinz marketed well over 60 products at the time. So where did the 57 come from? Heinz thought the number was lucky. Five was Heinz's lucky number, and seven was his wife's. He mashed the charmed digits together, got 57, and never looked back. 6. Tartar Sauce . Fish's best friend is named after an alternate spelling of the word ""Tatar,"" which was how Western Europeans once referred to almost anyone of Mongolian or Turkic descent. Many of these Tatars/Tartars ran roughshod over Europe in the time of Genghis Khan, but they knew how to cook. One of the dishes they left behind, beef tartare, came back into fashion in 19th-century France. These helpings of steak tartare came with a number of garnishes, including the creamy white stuff that eventually became generically known as tartar sauce. Mental Floss: The history of utensils (spork included) 7. Hollandaise Sauce . Hollandaise, the lemon-butter-and-egg yumminess that Eggs Benedict can't live without, isn't actually Dutch. Instead, it's one of the most well known French sauces. The sauce first appeared in French cooking in the 17th century, and is apparently named both because it somewhat resembles an old Dutch sauce and because the Dutch had such thriving butter and egg industries that provided two of the sauce's main ingredients.
